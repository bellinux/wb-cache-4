5|$|The video {{begins as}} the protagonist parks {{her car and}} cries {{following}} an argument she has had with her lover. She then leaves the car, walks towards the sea, and lets down her hair. Flashbacks of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> lover on the beach are shown. With teary eyes, she heads into the sea as waves break the shore. Back in the car, she imagines her lover holding her hands. The video transitions into color, as Beyoncé's character appears {{on the beach in}} a green dress and holds a rose without its petals, which she later restores. The video then flashes back to black-and-white memories of the woman resting her head on her lover's shoulder. She eventually realizes that she must set her relationship back on the right track. In the end, she drives off with a smile.|$|E
25|$|Different {{measures}} for pain control have {{varying degrees of}} success and side effects to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> baby. In some countries of Europe, doctors commonly prescribe inhaled nitrous oxide gas for pain control, especially as 53% nitrous oxide, 47% oxygen, known as Entonox; in the UK, midwives may use this gas without a doctor's prescription. Opioids such as fentanyl may be used, but if given too close to birth there is a risk of respiratory depression in the infant.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the present}} form of the tale (dating to the Edo period), Momotarō came to Earth inside a giant peach which was found {{floating}} down a river, by an old, childless woman who was washing clothes there. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> husband discovered the child {{when they tried to}} open the peach to eat it. The child explained that he had been sent by Heaven to be their son. The couple named him Momotarō, from momo (peach) and tarō (eldest son in the family).|$|E
25|$|Inheritance was by descent, {{but could}} be further {{restricted}} by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In {{the case of the}} Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> future children. The irony of the novel's opening line, therefore, is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband in order to have prosperous life.|$|E
25|$|Courtship and {{relationships}} in the Philippines are conservative in nature. The man will have to court the woman and prove his love for her before he can win her heart. Sometimes the courtship period would last for years; this however, is a very old fashioned idea. In the bigger more urbanized cities, this conservative courtship idea is not so emphasized as much. Parents prefer their daughter to be courted in theirhome, so {{they can have a}} chance to know the man. It is during the courtship period that the man would put his best foot forward to create a good impression on <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> family. Generally, the man is being measured on his being a gentleman, ability to respect the woman's family, and servitude (the extent of what he was willing to do to prove his love for the woman). Usually, the woman is courted by several men and will have to choose the best from among her suitors. Courtship {{and relationships}} remain the same for rural and urban areas despite the modern western influence.|$|E

25|$|An {{extensive}} Greek and Latin {{medical literature}} covered obstetrics and infant care, and the 2nd century Greek gynecologist Soranus of Ephesus advised midwives {{not to be}} superstitious. But childbirth in antiquity remained a life-threatening experience for both <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> newborn, with infant mortality as high as 30 or 40 percent. Rites of passage pertaining to birth and death had several parallel aspects. Maternal death was common: {{one of the most}} famous was Julia, daughter of Julius Caesar and wife of Pompey. Her infant died a few days later, severing the family ties between her father and husband and hastening the Caesar's Civil War, which ended the Roman Republic. Some ritual practices may be characterized as anxious superstitions, but the religious aura surrounding childbirth reflects the high value Romans placed on family, tradition (mos maiorum), and compatibility of the sexes. Under the Empire, children were celebrated on coins, as was Juno Lucina, the primary goddess of childbirth, as well as in public art. Funerary art, such as relief on sarcophagi, sometimes showed scenes from the deceased's life, including birth or the first bath.|$|E

500|$|While {{working on}} the copy that the Patriarch had commissioned, Jovanović began a second version of the painting, one that {{retained}} <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> child, the herd of sheep and the wagons carrying refugees. This, Filipovitch-Robinson asserts, is indicative of [...] "Jovanović's firmness of conviction and artistic integrity." [...] The second version was smaller than the first, measuring [...] Like the first, it was completed in 1896, and {{came to be called}} the [...] "Pančevo version" [...] as it was acquired by the Pančevo Museum in the 1970s. Shortly after its completion, the rights to the Pančevo version were purchased by Zagreb art collector Petar Nikolić, who secured the right to publish lithographic reproductions of the painting for the next fifty years. Such prints became quite popular, and could be found in Serb homes up {{to the end of the}} 20th century. As the Pančevo version was the first to be lithographically reproduced, it became the best known rendition. It was displayed at the 1900 Exposition Universelle (world's fair) in Paris.|$|E

500|$|Upon first seeing it, Georgije was displeased by Jovanović's {{depiction}} of the exodus, particularly the sight of sheep and wagons carrying women and children, saying it made the migrants look like [...] "rabble on the run". The source of the Patriarch's displeasure lay in differing interpretations of what had originally caused the migration to take place; the Church maintained that Arsenije was simply heeding {{the call of the}} Holy Roman Emperor to head north. Having studied Ruvarac's work, Jovanović came to hold the view that fear of Ottoman persecution, rather than the desire to protect the Habsburg frontier, had prompted the migrants to leave their homes. Jovanović duly took the painting back to his studio and altered it to the Patriarch's liking, removing the sheep, lumber wagons, and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> infant son, putting stylized warriors in their place. He also placed the letter Leopold had supposedly sent the Serbs inviting them to settle Vojvodina in the hand of , a priest riding beside Arsenije. Although these changes were made relatively quickly, Jovanović could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest. Hence, only the Vršac triptych was displayed at the Millennium Exhibition.|$|E

After that, the ala brought lunch and said to the woman, “Eat, kuma.” “How can I eat after I saw a poker and a broom fighting in the first room?” “Eat, kuma, eat. Those are my maids: they fight about which one should take the broom and sweep.” “How can I eat after I saw human arms and legs {{in the second and third}} rooms?” And the ala told her, “Eat, kuma, eat. That is my food.” “How can I eat, kuma, after I saw the sixth room full of blood?” “Eat, kuma, eat.

500|$|The church {{continues}} to promulgate Hubbard's claims about their relationship. The writer Lawrence Wright was told in September 2010 by Tommy Davis, the then {{spokesman for the}} Church of Scientology, that Hubbard [...] "was never married to Sara Northrup. She filed for divorce {{in an effort to}} try and create a false record that she had been married to him." [...] She had been part of Jack Parsons' group because [...] "she had been sent in there by the Russians. I can never pronounce her name. Her actual true name is a Russian name. That {{was one of the reasons}} L. Ron Hubbard never had a relationship with her. He never had a child with her. He wasn't married to her. But he did save her life and pull her out of that whole black magic ring." [...] After the documentary-maker Alex Gibney directed the film Going Clear, based on Wright's book of the same name and citing Northrup's words about Hubbard, the Church published a video calling Northrup a [...] "failed gold digger" [...] and [...] "self admitted perjurer" [...] who was responsible for [...] "a get-rich-quick scheme [...] by <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> publicity starved lawyer to try to shake down Mr. Hubbard for money and take over the Hubbard Dianetics Foundation after Dianetics soared to the top of national bestseller lists." ...|$|E

500|$|Girolamo Rusticucci, {{secretary}} of Pope Pius V (r. 1566–72), who in 1570 [...] appointed him Cardinal of Santa Susanna, bought a palace lying {{almost at the}} end of the Via Alessandrina (the road later named Borgo Nuovo) in Borgo on 31 March 1572. This building, once owned by Roberto Strozzi (exponent of the banker family from Florence), had been sold in 1567 to Pope Pius V, who donated it immediately to his nephew Paolo Ghislieri. Ghislieri sold it to the Cardinal five years later with the accordance of the pope. In order to enlarge his building, Rusticucci also bought several nearby houses. Selling negotiation not always finished successfully: an old woman refused to sell her home, forcing the architect to engulf it in the enlarged palace. However, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> heirs could live there until they sold it to the owner of the [...] "Caffè San Pietro", one of the oldest coffee shops in the city. [...] The strong-willed opposition of another owner forced the cardinal to renounce to extend the building to the east until Borgo Sant'Angelo, although the works had already commenced. A powerful angular rustication erected at the corner between Borgo Sant'Angelo and Borgo Nuovo testified until 1937 about the Rusticucci's intention. Several years went by after the acquisition of Ghislieri's palace, until in 1584 Rusticucci gave the task to design a larger palace to architect Domenico Fontana. After Fontana's transferral to Naples who, after the death of Sixtus V (r. 1585–90) and the brief intermezzo of Innocent IX (r. Oct.-Dec. 1591), could not win the favor of Pope Clement VIII (r. 1592–1605), the task was finished by his nephew Carlo Maderno.|$|E
