40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the relationship between}} temperature and residential electricity consumption by exploiting variation in weather conditions across 13 Building Climate Zones in California. Cross-sectional household data and daily weather data are obtained from the Energy Information Administration’s 2005 Residential Electricity Consumption Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Global Summary <b>of</b> the <b>Day</b> dataset respectively. For each climate zone, daily mean temperatures are sorted into seven equidistant bins based on the state’s temperature distribution in 2005. The estimated temperature bin coefficients along with two 21 st-century climate forecasts are used to simulate changes in per-household consumption for a selected group of counties. The simulation results suggest that households located in regions {{that are expected to}} experience the largest <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> from lower to higher temperature bins may increase their consumption of electricity by more than 15 % {{over the course of the}} century. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{full-length}} cDNA encoding {{a nuclear}} factor-YB (NF-YB) /HAP 3 /CCAAT binding factor-A (CBF-A) subunit of a CCAAT-box binding complex, designated as TaNF-YB 3 was isolated from Triticum aestivum. Sequence {{analysis indicated that}} the full-length cDNA was 809 bp long, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 597 bp, which encoded a deduced polypeptide of 199 amino acids and is located in chromosome 3 D. The deduced protein contained conserved structural domains and showed high identity to other plant NF-YBs. TaNF-YB 3 was expressed in various organs, especially in the leaves and stamens; it was also regulated by salt, mannitol, abscisic acid, wounding, and cold. Moreover, TaNF-YB 3 was down-regulated by short days and vernalization, and sensitive to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> length. It was mainly induced by light and exhibited a similar diurnal rhythmic expression pattern with the CCT-domain family gene VRN 2 (TaZCCT 1 and TaZCCT 2), but not with CO (WCO 1 and TaHd 1).

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{a case of}} conjoined twins after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> a single <b>day</b> 2 embryo. Design: Case report. Setting: University hospital. Patient(s) : A 30 -year-old woman underwent ICSI with a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> a single <b>day</b> 2 embryo. Intervention(s) : Vaginal ultrasound examination was performed during early pregnancy. Result(s) : The diagnosis of conjoined twins was made by vaginal ultrasonography at 9 weeks' gestation. The conjoined fetuses were diagnosed as thoracopagus twins with a single beating heart shared between the thoraxes. Extensive ultrasound examination suggested an extremely poor prognosis, Therapeutic termination was performed at 11 weeks. Conclusion(s) : Given that single embryo transfers are able {{to shed light on}} the real incidence of conjoined twins developed on day 2 / 3 or on day 5 / 6, this is of interest mechanistically. Thus, it should be taken into account when trying to determine the true incidence of conjoined twins and ultimately trying to understand why these anomalies occur.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a first kidney {{transplant}} on a subsequent transplant outcome: An experimental and clinical study. BackgroundSecond kidney transplantations have a roughly similar clinical outcome to first transplantations. Nevertheless, {{the effect of the}} presence of the first, nonfunctional transplant {{at the time of the}} second transplantation may also influence its outcome and has not yet been specifically studied. MethodsWe analyzed the effect of the presence of a first graft on the outcome of a second graft in a rodent allograft model and in a cohort of 240 human second kidney allograft recipients. ResultsIn rodents, 100 days subsequent to the rejection of the first graft, we observed an increase in blood but not spleen CD 4 +CD 25 + T cells, whereas no differences were observed in transcriptional patterns. Adoptive <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> 100 splenocytes did not prolong graft survival. Moreover, the presence of a first rejected graft does not prolong the survival of a second graft performed at a later date. In the human context, a higher incidence of patients with anti-HLA immunization and a higher % of PRA were observed in retransplant recipients with primary allograft nephrectomy. Despite a relatively low statistical power, our data do not suggest significant differences in graft outcome between recipients of second transplants with primary allograft nephrectomy and those without. ConclusionCollectively, the data from both an experimental model and a large cohort of human recipients of a second graft do not suggest a beneficial effect of the presence of a first rejected graft at the time of a second transplantation...|$|R

40|$|At various intervals, from 10 {{minutes to}} 21 days, after the {{injection}} of dysentery bacilli into the hind foot pads of rabbits the popliteal lymph nodes were excised. The {{cells of the}} lymph nodes were teased free, washed, and injected intravenously into normal rabbits. In each case aliquots of the same cell suspension were either incubated at 37 °C. for 24 hours or heated at 52 °C. for 20 minutes and then injected into other normal rabbits, as controls. In the case of lymph node cells obtained 4 or 3 days after the injection of antigen, antibody {{was found in the}} serum of recipients on the 1 st <b>day</b> after the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> untreated cells. The titer increased until the 3 rd day and then began to decline after the 5 th or 7 th day. In the sera of recipients of incubated cells antibody was not found, except on occasion after the 4 th day and in low titer. This late appearance of antibody was attributed to the presence of small amounts of antigen in the original cell suspension. As the interval between injection of antigen and collection of cells was increased beyond 4 <b>days</b> the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> decreased progressively until at 14 days no transfer effect was obtained. When cells which were obtained 2 days after the injection <b>of</b> antigen were <b>transferred,</b> antibody appeared on the 2 nd day after transfer and then followed the characteristic curve, whereas in the case of incubated cells antibody did not appear until the 3 rd day after transfer. After the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> untreated 1 <b>day</b> cells antibody did not appear in the recipient until the 3 rd day, and then followed the type of curve seen with 2, 3, and 4 <b>day</b> cells. Following <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> incubated 1 <b>day</b> cells antibody also appeared on the 3 rd day. To establish the possibility of eliciting the cell transfer effect as early as 1 day after the injection of dysentery bacilli, recipient rabbits were x-irradiated 24 hours prior to the injection of cells.

40|$|Background: Repeated {{failure of}} in vitro {{fertilization}} treatment is frustrating to the patients and their clinicians. Various treatment plans and a change of protocol have been suggested for “low responders”; however, patients who fail treatment repeatedly inspite of good quality embryos pose a special therapeutic challenge. Additional challenge would be imposed on that particular group when the local IVF regulating low does not permit surplus embryo freezing. Objective: To examine whether sequential <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> embryos on <b>day</b> 3 and on day 5 after ovum pick-up improves IVF/ET success rates in patients with repeated consecutive IVF failures (⩾ 3 trials) compared to day 3 alone, with the background that local regulation prohibits embryo freezing. Study design: Randomized controlled study. Women scheduled for IVF/ET with repeated consecutive IVF failures (⩾ 3 trials) were randomized to either sequential <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> embryos on <b>day</b> 3 and on day 5 after ovum pick-up (Group I =  74) or conventional day 3 transfer (Group II =  73) as a control. The primary outcome measures were clinical pregnancy rate and implantation rate. The secondary outcome measures were ongoing pregnancy rate and early pregnancy loss. Results: Baseline and cycle characteristics were comparable in both groups. Clinical pregnancy rate (per embryo transfer) was significantly higher in sequential ET group (37. 8 %) compared to that in day 3 group (21. 9 %) (P value < 0. 05). Also, implantation rate (per embryos transferred) was significantly higher in sequential ET group (17. 1 %) compared to that in control group (10. 5 %) (P value < 0. 01). Similarly, ongoing pregnancy (per embryo transfer) was significantly higher in sequential ET group (33. 8 %) compared to that in day 3 group (19. 2 %) (P value < 0. 05). Conclusions: Patients with repeated implantation failures, treatment with the sequential embryo transfer approach had significantly improved pregnancy outcomes compared to regular day 3 transfers. This approach would be particularly useful when neither oocyte freezing is a clinical option due to insufficient number of collected oocytes nor surplus embryo freezing is an option as the current local regulatory law prohibits it...|$|R
