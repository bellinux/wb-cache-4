5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
25|$|Johnson and Ostrom {{studied the}} anatomy of the ceratopsid forelimb and {{concluded}} that it was inconsistent with a fully erect stance despite the tendency of artists to draw <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Instead they concluded that ceratopsids stood with the front limbs in a semi-erect posture.|$|E
25|$|Dodson and Farlow {{studied the}} anatomy of the ceratopsid forelimb and {{concluded}} that it was inconsistent with a fully erect stance despite the tendency of artists to draw <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Instead they concluded that ceratopsids stood with the front limbs in a semi-erect posture. They also concluded that Lockley and Hunt had overextended themselves by trying to infer limb posture from the Ceratopsipes footprints, which they felt was impossible.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know how}} to do it Mr. Hyde always killed <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> but I didn't have any camphor, so I use a pin," [...] and Dan gently poured a drop on the insect's head, when the pale green wings fluttered an instant, and then grew still.|$|R

Why, d'ye know, Saxon, his hands is soft as a woman's that's never done any work.

25|$|Dodson {{studied the}} anatomy of the ceratopsid forelimb and {{concluded}} that it was inconsistent with a fully erect stance despite the tendency of artists to draw <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Instead they concluded that ceratopsids stood with the front limbs in a semi-erect posture. He argued against the interpretation Lockley and Hunt made of the forprints {{left behind by the}} trackmaker of their 1995 ichnospecies Ceratopsipes goldenensis as supporting the erect-forelimb hypothesis, instead Dodson suggested that the width of the Ceratopsipes foreprints were still consistent with the sprawling reconstruction supported by the actual limb anatomy.|$|E
25|$|Not {{counting}} the two Composite prototypes, the IRT received 500 Composites: 340 motor cars and 160 trailers. Estimates by IRT engineers required a 3:1 ratio of motor cars to trailer cars. Therefore, when the 300 Gibbs Hi-V motors {{were added to}} these numbers, the new totals were 640 motor cars and 160 trailers. This was a surplus of motor cars. Shortly after delivery, therefore, the IRT began converting motor cars into trailers. As all Gibbs Hi-V cars were motors, the preference was to keep <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> while converting more Composite motors into trailers. By 1910, 208 of the 340 motorized Composite cars had been converted into trailers.|$|E
500|$|There are {{multiple}} endings {{based on whether}} the player caused high chaos by indiscriminate murder, or achieved low chaos by refraining from taking lives. In the High Chaos ending, the player is faced with the choice of freeing Emily / Corvo from petrification or leaving <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> forever. If Emily is not left in stone, she becomes a vengeful empress and brutally purges Delilah's supporters, with Corvo by her side {{in one form or}} another. If Corvo leaves Emily petrified, he takes the throne for himself and becomes a brutal tyrant known as Emperor Corvo [...] "the Black". Meanwhile, Karnaca is either ruled by a new tyrant or collapses completely into anarchy and, if still alive, Sokolov becomes a broken man after having borne witness to the perversion of his work and is exiled to his home country. In the Low Chaos ending, the player frees Emily / Corvo from their imprisonment. A council of representatives takes charge in Karnaca and brings the city back from the brink. Emily becomes a fair and just ruler, reuniting the Empire with Corvo by her side. Sokolov, proud to see his work used for good, returns to his home country. In either ending, if Meagan – who is revealed to be Billie Lurk – survives, she leaves to search for Daud.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Miss Schuyler, [...] "though {{there was}} a time when I wished I could. You can't help being pretty, but it ought to make you careful when you see another of <b>them</b> going <b>that</b> <b>way</b> again." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1903, Harry Byrd {{took over}} his father's newspaper, the Winchester Star. Under his father's ownership, {{it came to}} owe $2500 (...) to its {{newsprint}} supplier, the Antietam Paper Company. The company refused to ship more newsprint on credit, so Byrd cut a deal to make daily cash payments in return for ownership. As Byrd would later say, [...] "when you have to hunt for <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> {{you get to know}} how many cents there really are in a dollar." [...] He eventually bought the Harrisonburg Daily News-Record and several other papers in the Shenandoah Valley; his family still owns these papers today.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} style of lapel, the notched lapel, [...] {{originated}} in older types of jacket or coat that buttoned to the neck, by unbuttoning and turning back {{the upper part}} of the closure at an angle indoors or in hot weather, and then removing the upper buttons. The upper points are derived from the end corners of the collar. This can be duplicated by similarly turning back the closure in a modern button-to-the-neck garment such as an outdoor coat or a boilersuit. Sometimes when caught outside in bad weather in a lapelled jacket and nothing over it, its wearer may unfold the lapels and hold <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to temporarily reproduce the ancestral to-the-neck closure.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors Corporation was {{a common}} client of Jo-Han, {{producing}} mainly 1/25 scale promo models. 1959 and 1960 Rambler station wagons were produced by Jo-Han. These were not offered in kit form - but the demand was not as great for station wagon kits. These were later re-issued by X-El Products and Okey Spaulding in the 1990s and early 2000s. Though perhaps not as collectible, the later issues were made in non-warping styrene plastic. The company also made Rambler Classic sedans and American convertibles for 1963-1965, however, the 1963 and 1964 versions were of a slightly larger 1:24 scale, apparently AMC wanted <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> [...] Also interesting is that both the dealer promo and the dimestore versions of these Classics came with friction motors - as usually the promo versions did not.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yet, joy well-nigh incredible!' {{said her}} aunt, meditatively. 'Were not those the words? It {{would not be}} like your uncle to put <b>them</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> unless it were something--even more wonderful, and besides, why should he not write it to me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I will, my dear Jack!" [...] {{answers the}} other, in a {{relieved}} voice. [...] "Never thought about <b>'em</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> before. Daresay I shall {{come across the}} very girl to suit you. I'll keep my eyes open and let you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And this'll be your second, and {{you know}} how these things are managed. No gentleman'll marry her because she runs after him. Girls as knows what they're about should let the gentlemen run after <b>them.</b> <b>That's</b> my <b>way</b> of looking at it.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Game!" [...] he said. [...] "I like <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Still, it isn't {{every man}} could seize a pack on him, and you'll {{have to let}} up three dollars on the price you asked me." ...|$|E

6000|$|This remark much amused Lawrence. [...] "Do you know," [...] said he, [...] "that I {{would rather}} not read novels at all, than to read <b>them</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I must begin at the beginning, and go {{regularly}} through, as the author wishes his readers to do." ...|$|R
60|$|Viola's {{carriage}} was now actually coming, and as I {{went into}} the house with her, she held me, whispering to me to come home at once with her, but I told her I could not leave <b>them</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and they were really my nephews.|$|R

6000|$|... "Precious lot {{you know}} about dogs," [...] her brother sneered; [...] "and I wish you'd leave me alone. They're lazy, I tell you, and you've got to whip them to get {{anything}} out of <b>them.</b> <b>That's</b> their <b>way.</b> You ask any one. Ask one of those men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will lay}} {{them in the}} bottom of the boat, Luka, four longways and four crossways.

6000|$|... "But was it?" [...] thought Billy. [...] "Didn't I {{tell them}} that I was dying? I thought so myself, {{and there is no}} reason why they shouldn't have thought so too.

60|$|But {{before they}} fir'd from either, Villeroy, in {{complement}} to the Duke of Bavaria, sent a Messenger {{to know in}} what Part of the Town his Dutchess chose to reside, that they might, as much as possible, avoid incommoding her, by directing their Fire to other Parts.

50|$|I {{think that}} if {{companies}} were willing to put that material out there, moving forward, consumers will follow.
