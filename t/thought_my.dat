500|$|On 9 December 1980 (UK time), whilst {{staying at}} Starr's ex-wife's home, she {{received}} a phone call from Starr, two hours after Lennon had been shot in New York. [...] "The memory of Ringo's words, the sound of his tearful voice crackling over the transatlantic line, is crystal clear: 'Cynthia, I'm so sorry, John's dead'. I had only one clear <b>thought.</b> <b>My</b> son, our son, [...] was at home in bed, I had to get back to Ruthin so that I could tell him about his father's death." ...|$|E
500|$|Rabi died at {{his home}} on Riverside Drive in Manhattan from cancer on 11 January 1988. His wife, Helen, survived him and {{died at the age}} of 102 on 18 June 2005. In his last days, he was {{reminded}} of his greatest achievement when his physicians examined him using magnetic resonance imaging, a technology that had been developed from his ground-breaking research on magnetic resonance. The machine happened to have a reflective inner surface, and he remarked: [...] "I saw myself in that machine... I never <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> work would come to this." ...|$|E

500|$|The Honourable Virgil P. Moshansky, who {{investigated}} the crash in Dryden {{and wrote the}} report, appeared in the documentary, alleging that if the recommendations in his report had been followed, the USAir accident could have been prevented. Moshansky told the documentary that his report [...] "probably sat on somebody's [...] desk." [...] He said [...] "when I first heard about it I <b>thought,</b> <b>my</b> God, it's Dryden all over again ... certainly if they had followed the recommendations in my report, the F28 crash at LaGuardia could have been averted." ...|$|E
500|$|Stoddart went, aged seventeen, {{to train}} in fine {{art at the}} Glasgow School of Art where he studied from 1976 to 1980. There he settled on {{sculpture}} and initially worked within the modernist idiom. Stoddart has recalled an epiphany moment several times: when, after finishing a riveted metal pop-art sculpture (praised by his tutors) he found a bust of the Apollo Belvedere, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> pop-riveted thing was rubbish by comparison. It's extraordinarily easy to pop-rivet two bits of metal together and extraordinarily difficult to make a figure like the Apollo, but I thought I had to try." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the record, Smith said: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> {{head would}} be chopped off {{immediately}} {{when it came}} out because {{at the time it was}} so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed , unfortunately." [...] Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: [...] "The idea of playing [...] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest—Mudhoney and Nirvana—and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off." ...|$|E

500|$|For the new songs, Madonna {{worked with}} David Foster, a {{well-known}} producer {{who had worked}} with the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind & Fire. Foster initially did not expect Madonna would collaborate with him, as he believed that his music would not [...] "really [...] hip enough for her". The recording session with Foster resulted in two new songs to the final track list, [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". Foster commented: [...] "At the end of the day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, 'You'll See', was really neat. Madonna had written a great lyric ('You think that I can't live without your love / You'll see') and I <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> music was great". The track was produced and arranged by Madonna and Foster, who worked on the song during the third weekend of September 1995.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{was dating}} co-founder of Roc-A-Fella Records Damon Dash {{at the time}} of her death and, though they were not {{formally}} engaged, in interviews given after Aaliyah's death, Dash claimed the couple had planned to marry. Aaliyah and Dash met through his accountant and formed a friendship. Dash has said he is unsure of how he and Aaliyah started dating and that the two just understood each other. [...] "I don't know , just spending time, you know, we just saw things the same and it was new, you know what I mean? Meeting someone that is trying to do the same thing you are doing in the urban market, in the same urban market place but not really being so urban. It was just; her mind was where my mind was. She understood me and she got my jokes. She <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> jokes were funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Weezer's self-titled debut album, {{also known}} as the Blue album, was {{released}} in May 1994 and became a commercial success; it was certified gold on December 1 and platinum on January 1, 1995, with sales of over one million. Songwriter Rivers Cuomo wrote that success had [...] "stirred up a lot of mixed feelings in me – 'Yay, I'm happy' as well as 'I'm not sure this is the life I want to lead.'" [...] He had also developed a [...] "huge inferiority complex" [...] about rock music, saying: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> songs were really simplistic and silly, and I wanted to write complex, intense, beautiful music." [...] Touring with Weezer, he listened to the operas Aida (1871) and Madama Butterfly (1904), the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), and the musical Les Misérables (1980). Inspired by how these works married music and narrative, he decided to write a rock opera to explore his feelings about relationships, fame, and his life as a touring musician.|$|E

500|$|Four years later, the children's father [...] "came to Stamps without warning" [...] and {{returned}} {{them to their}} mother's care in St. Louis. [...] At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told {{the rest of their}} family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. [...] Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles. [...] Angelou became mute for almost five years, believing, as she stated, [...] "I <b>thought,</b> <b>my</b> voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name. [...] And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone..." [...] According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.|$|E
500|$|In 1754, he {{was elected}} {{a fellow of the}} Society of Antiquaries but by 1760 he was happily married and {{resigned}} his fellowship because [...] "my circumstances at that time were very narrow, my worthy father being alive, and I vainly <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> happiness would have been permanent, and that I never should have been called again from my retirement to amuse myself in town, or to be of use to the society." [...] When his financial circumstances later improved, he became a patron and collector. He amassed a considerable collection of works of art, many of which had been commissioned and which were selected for their scientific interest rather than their connoisseur value. He had several works by Nicholas Pocock representing topographical landforms, mostly in Wales, and others by the artist Peter Paillou, probably commissioned, representing different climate types. His portrait by Thomas Gainsborough shows him as a country gentleman. Also included in the [...] "Pennant Collection", housed at the National Library of Wales, are many watercolours by Moses Griffiths and John Ingleby, and some drawings by Pennant himself.|$|E
500|$|Although {{principal}} photography {{was scheduled}} to take 55 days, it did not wrap until October 6, 1974, after 159 days. Spielberg, reflecting on the protracted shoot, stated, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> career as a filmmaker was over. I heard rumors... that I would never work again because {{no one had ever}} taken a film 100 days over schedule." [...] Spielberg himself was not present for the shooting of the final scene in which the shark explodes, as he believed that the crew were planning to throw him in the water when the scene was done. It has since become a tradition for Spielberg to be absent when the final scene of one of his films is being shot. Afterward, underwater scenes were shot at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer water tank in Culver City, with stuntmen Dick Warlock and Frank James Sparks as stand-ins for Dreyfuss in the scene where the shark attacks the cage, as well as near Santa Catalina Island, California. Fields, who had completed a rough cut of the first two-thirds of the film, up until the shark hunt, finished the editing and reworked some of the material. According to Zanuck, [...] "She actually came in and reconstructed some scenes that Steven had constructed for comedy and made them terrifying, and some scenes he shot to be terrifying and made them comedy scenes." [...] The ship used for the Orca was brought to Los Angeles so the sound effects team could record sounds for both the ship and the underwater scenes.|$|E

500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> experience with zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{recording}} {{session with}} David Foster resulted two new songs {{to the final}} track listing, [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". Foster commented: [...] "At {{the end of the}} day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, [...] "You'll See", was really neat. Madonna had written a great lyric (You think that I can't live without your love / You'll see) and I <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> music was great." [...] "You'll See" [...] is a low bass track featuring wind chimes and a Spanish guitar. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. Lyrically, the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. Madonna was asked whether the track was about revenge to which she replied [...] "No, it's about empowering yourself." [...] Madonna later recorded the Spanish version of [...] "You'll See" [...] in Gloria and Emilio Estefan's studio in Miami. Titled [...] "Verás", the song was adapted into Spanish by Paz Martinez. The next original song, [...] "One More Chance", is an acoustic ballad, whose lyrics are about attempting to win a lost lover back. The song was inspired by Madonna's real life experience, but she wrote it from the opposite point of view. Its composition has an organic arrangement, devoid of any synths and sequencing, and only based on guitars with plenty of chord changes and subdued strings.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E
