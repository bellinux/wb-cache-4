Gediminas was also the forefather of the Gediminid dynasty, which ruled the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1310s or 1280s to 1572.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. <b>The</b> <b>siblings</b> outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E

5|$|Fields {{serve as}} {{foundational}} notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, {{which are based}} on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, <b>the</b> <b>siblings</b> of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.|$|E

For example, the Buddhist legend describes Devagabbha (Devaki) to have been isolated in a palace built upon a pole, after she is born, so no future husband could reach her. Krishna's father similarly is described as a powerful king, but who meets up with Devagabbha anyway, and to whom Kamsa gives away his sister Devagabbha in marriage. <b>The</b> <b>siblings</b> of Krishna are not killed by Kamsa, though he tries.

5|$|The {{earliest}} case {{of possible}} BHD {{in the medical}} literature was published by Burnier and Rejsek in 1927, who described a case of perifollicular fibromas on a 56-year-old woman's face. Trichodiscomas were first described in 1974 by H.S. Zackheim and H. Pinkus, but were not associated with BHD until Birt, Hogg, and Dubé. The first case of BHD with the systemic symptoms was described by Hornstein and Knickenberg and found in two siblings and their father, all of whom exhibited colon polyps and the characteristic fibrofolliculomas. Though <b>the</b> <b>siblings</b> did not have renal or pulmonary symptoms, their father had cysts in his lungs and kidneys.

5|$|Although a {{commercial}} and critical success, the play closed after 31 performances when Barrymore collapsed, suffering a nervous breakdown. Since appearing in Redemption {{he had worked}} ceaselessly, appearing on stage in the evenings, while planning or rehearsing the next production during the day, {{and by the time}} he appeared as Richard, he was spending his daytimes filming Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He spent six weeks recuperating under the ministrations of his father's friend, wrestler William Muldoon, who ran a sanitarium. During the summer of 1920, Oelrichs became pregnant with Barrymore's child, and a quick divorce was arranged with her husband, which left her and Barrymore free to marry in August that year; a daughter, Diana Barrymore, followed in March 1921. Soon after the birth, he began rehearsals for Clair de Lune, which his wife had adapted from Victor Hugo's 1869 novel The Man Who Laughs.

50|$|Closeness and {{performance}} can either raise self-evaluation through reflection or lower self-evaluation through comparison. Relevance determines whether reflection or comparison will occur. There {{are many different}} dimensions that can be important to an individual's self-definition. A self-defining factor is any factor {{that is important to}} who a person is. For example, an ability or success in music may be important to one's self-definition, but at the same time, being good in math may not be as important. Relevance assumes that a particular factor that is important to an individual is also important to another person. Relevance {{can be as simple as}} a shared dimension which he/she considers important to who he/she is. If relevance is high, then one will engage in comparison, but if relevance is low, one will engage in reflection. For example, if athletics is important to a person and that person considers athletics to be an important dimension of his/her self-definition, then when a sibling does well in athletics, the comparison process will take place and his/her self-evaluation will decrease. On the other hand, if athletics is not a dimension he/she uses for self-definition, the reflection process will take place and he/she will celebrate <b>the</b> <b>sibling's</b> success with <b>the</b> sibling; his/her self-evaluation will increase along with <b>the</b> <b>sibling's</b> because he/she is not threatened or challenged by <b>the</b> <b>sibling's</b> athletic capability.|$|R

Maya Yotsuba, their aunt and the leader of the Yotsuba, was the reason Tatsuya was born with the unique magic to decompose, reconstruct, and detonate matter.

During a family vacation in Okinawa, Tatsuya wards off an invasion by the Great Asian Alliance and joins the 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion which is headed by major Kazama Harunobu.

40|$|December 2013. Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Matthew T. Bernards. Vita. Native bone {{tissue is}} {{comprised}} of a mixture of collagen, non-collagenous proteins, and hydroxyapatite (HA). <b>The</b> <b>SIBLING</b> (small integrin binding, N-linked glycoprotein) family of proteins is the primary group of non-collagenous proteins found in bone tissue, several {{of which have been}} identified ahead of the mineralized front of developing bone. By replicating the native binding interactions between collagen and <b>the</b> <b>SIBLING</b> family of proteins, it is believed that a new type of bone tissue scaffold can be developed. In this work, preliminary studies are conducted which suggest that both mineralization and cell growth can be enhanced by <b>the</b> addition of <b>SIBLINGs</b> to a collagen scaffold. The mineralization forming capabilities of three of <b>the</b> <b>SIBLING</b> members, bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteopontin (OPN), and the calcium binding subdomain of dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin phosphoprotein (DPP), were directly compared on a biomimetic collagen substrate. Collagen substrates were prepared with either BSP, DPP, or OPN and exposed to a simulated body fluid for 5, 10, and 24 hours. The resulting mineral morphology was assessed and mineralization was seen in the presence of all three proteins, but only minerals formed in the presence of DPP were morphologically similar to those seen in developing bone tissue. The accessibility of the cell binding RGD domain of DPP when bound to collagen was explored and compared to previous studies with BSP and OPN. A statistically significant difference was seen between cell binding on collagen coated TCPS and TCPS with bound DPP, and the cells exhibited a preference for plain TCPS over collagen coated TCPS. This suggests that the RGD sequence of DPP is less accessible when it is bound to collagen. <b>The</b> effects of <b>SIBLINGs</b> on <b>the</b> early stages of collagen fibrillogenesis were also investigated using a solution of collagen, a fibrillogenesis buffer, and one of <b>the</b> three <b>SIBLINGs</b> mentioned earlier. It was shown that BSP and OPN will accelerate the rate of fibril formation, while DPP slowed down the fibril formation process significantly. This preliminary work has shown that a collagen-SIBLING scaffold is capable of both promoting cell growth and mineralization that is morphologically similar to that found in vivo developing bone tissue, allowing for an acellular bone tissue scaffold. By replicating the native binding interactions between collagen and <b>the</b> <b>SIBLING</b> family of proteins it is thought that a novel type of biomimetic bone scaffold can be developed without the need of cells.
