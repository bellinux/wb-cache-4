5|$|The {{following}} year Æthelwold persuaded the East Anglian Danes to attack Edward's territory in Wessex and Mercia. Edward retaliated with {{a raid on}} East Anglia, and when he withdrew the men of Kent lingered and met the East Anglian Danes at the Battle of the Holme. The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses, including the death of Æthelwold, which ended <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Edward's rule.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Krug led <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the {{constitutionality}} of the Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for the Act's opponents; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that internet filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. She said that filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare. She emphasized the need to educate children about morality instead of using online filters to block information from them. In 2006, she was elected Vice-President of the Phi Beta Kappa Society.|$|E

5|$|From the 1980s, {{improvements}} in technology {{led to a}} greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, {{and a reduction in}} their size and price. Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech, with text-to-speech options available in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish and Ewe. AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person's daily life, and greater involvement of the family. Increasingly, individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and locked-in syndrome, received AAC services. In addition, with <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served. Courses on AAC were developed for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students, clinicians and parents.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} move from Namco Bandai to Nintendo, Sugiura commented {{that it was a}} {{challenge}} to only be developing games for a single group of consoles, but then Nintendo endorsed <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Monolith Soft with incentives such as making a particular game within given hardware specifications, with Nintendo providing the company time and resources to accomplish that. Another factor that changed within Monolith Soft's development process was Nintendo's increased quality control, which would moot any project that did not have the desired quality for their systems. The sense of challenge was also echoed by Takahashi, who described both Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X as being partially defined by self-imposed challenges to the development team when creating the environments on limited gaming hardware. Monolith Soft's scope and goals are often attributed to Takahashi's drive and ambition. While commonly associated with Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), Monolith Soft focuses more on making role-playing games for a worldwide audience.|$|E

25|$|In 1044 however, Min Saw {{raised a}} {{rebellion}} at nearby Mount Popa, and challenged Sokkate to single combat.

On 11 August 1044, Min Saw slew Sokkate at Myinkaba, near Pagan. The king and his horse both fell into the river nearby.|$|E
25|$|Minimum {{wages are}} used widely in {{developing}} countries to protect vulnerable workers, reduce wage inequality, and lift the working poor out of poverty.
