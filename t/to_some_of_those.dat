25|$|Modern {{recognition}} of the plant outside of China originated from research in sugar substitutes. In the 1970s, while analyzing the sweet component of the jiaogulan plant (known as amachazuru in Japan), Masahiro Nagai discovered chemical compounds identical <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> found in Panax ginseng, an unrelated plant. Afterward, Tsunematsu Takemoto reported that jiaogulan contains four saponins identical to those in Panax ginseng as well as seventeen other similar saponins. Over the next decade 82 saponins (gypenosides) were identified in jiaogulan, compared to the 28 (ginsenosides) found in Panax ginseng.|$|E
25|$|Author Hristo Stoyanov {{has been}} {{critical}} of the tendency to impute false intellectualism <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> engaging in legal transgressions as a way of protest, seeing the methods employed by the protesters between 23 and 24 July 2013 {{as a threat to the}} fundamentals of Bulgarian democracy. Analyst Petar Klisarov has voiced his disapproval of the demonstrators (especially the emigrant students who participated in protests on 26 December 2013 and 3 January 2014) for flaunting Bulgarian legal regulations, for example by behaving disrespectfully towards police officers and blocking the city traffic on a whim, suggesting that they would have been much more disciplined and law-abiding if the activities were taking place abroad. Sofia mayor Yordanka Fandakova is also claimed to have been overly permissive of the demonstrators at the expense of the other members of society.|$|E
500|$|Eureka {{presents}} {{themes and}} sentiments similar <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in Poe's fiction work, including attempts at breaking beyond the obstacle {{of death and}} specifically characters who return from death in stories like [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher" [...] and [...] "Ligeia". Similar to his theories on a good short story, Poe believes the universe is a self-contained, closed system. In coming to his conclusions, Poe uses ratiocination as a literary device, through his character C. Auguste Dupin, as if Poe himself were a detective solving {{the mystery of the}} universe. Eureka, then, is the culmination of Poe's interest in capturing truth through language, an extension of his interest in cryptography.|$|E

[...] Ultimately, the opening scene of [...] "Shadows" [...] serves as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter with the inclusion of Atwell as Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including the then unconfirmed involvement of Howard Stark, who is mentioned in the scene, as well as Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

The episode [...] "Making Friends and Influencing People" [...] names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the Faustus Method, named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in Agent Carter, played by Ralph Brown.|$|E

North Africans, we know today, had a range of skin tones, from light to dark. In this case, we selected a medium skin tone, and we say, quite up front, 'This is midrange.'

2500|$|Sturt {{found his}} {{troubles}} {{to be influenced}} by various gold rushes, which took a toll on police numbers – indeed he reported in December 1851 that he had lost forty of his fifty staff to resignation. In early 1853, Sir William Mitchell assumed Sturt's position of Superintendent of police and Evelyn was reappointed as magistrate for Melbourne, serving for the next twenty-five years. [...] It appears that he was not afraid of brandishing his authority and in 1854 when he was appointed to the commission of inquiry into the Bentley hotel affair at Ballarat – seen by many to be a precursor to the Eureka Stockade [...] he recommended dismissal of some corrupt government officers and compensation <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had suffered losses.|$|E
2500|$|Oklahoma {{scored on}} their first {{possession}} only 32 seconds into the game. By halftime, the Sooners had exceeded the point spread and were up 49–0. Two redshirt freshmen were {{the stars of the}} day. Sam Bradford, making his first start as the new quarterback, threw for 350 yards in the first half, the most yards thrown in a half by any Oklahoma quarterback in history. He came out of the game early in the third quarter after throwing for a total of 363 yards, the most ever for a Sooner in his debut game. During this time, he tied Heisman Trophy winner Jason White's record of 18 consecutive pass completions. He finished the day with 23 pass attempts and 21 completions and a passing efficiency rating of 266.92, the second highest ever for a Sooner (behind Jason White). Head coach Bob Stoops felt Bradford [...] "threw the ball fantastic, from the deep balls <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> quick bubble screens that he put right on the money." [...] DeMarco Murray, another redshirt freshman, also set a school record as he became the first Sooner to score four touchdowns in a half in his first game. He finished the day with five touchdowns.|$|E
2500|$|As {{described}} in her comic book appearances, Artemis was born an Amazon {{as a member}} of the Egyptian tribe of Bana-Mighdall, who migrated from Greece to various European and Middle Eastern countries before finally settling in Egypt. Three thousand years ago, the two Amazon Queens (Hippolyta and Antiope) split the Amazon nation in two. Hippolyta's tribe traveled to the isolated island of Themyscira (otherwise known as Paradise Island) to live immortal lives in order to protect the doorway to the Underworld called Doom's Doorway. Antiope's tribe was never given immortality and were forced to mate with common men in order to guarantee their tribe's survival over the centuries. As they had renounced their Olympian gods once the two Queens parted ways, they eventually began to assimilate various religions and goddesses from the many lands they traveled <b>to.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> included the goddesses Isis, Mammitu, Bast, and Neith. It was in Egypt that they finally built the city of Bana-Mighdall, which in their language translates to [...] "The Temple of Women". Thanking the Amazons for their worship, one of their new goddesses created a powerfully consistent sandstorm to surround and protect their city from any outsiders who could not be trusted, or [...] "ariadnas". The Bana-Mighdallian Amazons eventually began an uneasy trade with outside cities in order to create commerce. They would exchange custom-made weapons and their warrior skills for goods and slaves for breeding.|$|E
