Here {{we set up}} a hierarchical probabilistic mixture model, where data is generated in a hierarchical tree-structuredmanner. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are demonstrated which can be used to sample from the posterior distribution over treescontaining variable numbers of hidden units. 1 Introduction Over the past decade or two mixture models have become a popular approach to clusteringor competitive learning problems. They have the advantage of having a well-defined objective function and fit in with the general <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>viewing</b> neural network problems in astatistical framework. However, one disadvantage is that they produce a &quot;flat &quot; cluster structure rather than the hierarchical tree structure that is returned by some clustering algorithmssuch as the agglomerative single-link method (see e. g. [12]). In this paper I formulate a hierarchical mixture model, which retains the advantages of the statistical framework, butalso features a tree-structured hierarchy. The basic idea is illustrated in Figure 1 (a). At the root of the tree (level 1) we have a singlecentre (marked with...|$|E
40|$|As {{software}} systems {{become more}} complex and config-urable, failures due to misconfigurations are becoming a crit-ical problem. Such failures often have serious functionality, security and financial consequences. Further, diagnosis and remediation for such failures require reasoning across the software stack and its operating environment, making it dif-ficult and costly. We present a framework and tool called EnCore to au-tomatically detect software misconfigurations. EnCore takes into account two important factors that are unexploited be-fore: {{the interaction between the}} configuration settings and the executing environment, as well as the rich correlations between configuration entries. We embrace the emerging <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>viewing</b> systems as data, and exploit this to ex-tract information about the execution environment in which a configuration setting is used. EnCore learns configuration rules from a given set of sample configurations. With train-ing data enriched with the execution context of configura-tions, EnCore is able to learn a broad set of configuration anomalies that spans the entire system. EnCore is effective in detecting both injected errors and known real-world prob-lems – it finds 37 new misconfigurations in Amazon EC 2 public images and 24 new configuration problems in a com-mercial private cloud. By systematically exploiting environ-ment information and by learning correlation rules across multiple configuration settings, EnCore detects 1. 6 x to 3. 5 x more misconfiguration anomalies than previous approaches...|$|E

40|$|Multiplicative trend {{exponential}} smoothing has received very little {{attention in the}} literature.

40|$|Abstract—In the {{long-term}} evolution of software systems, various maintenance {{activities such as}} functionality extension, bug fixing, refactoring may positively or negatively {{affect the quality of}} design and implementation. The <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> quality degradation caused by negative affections may accumulate and cause serious difficulties for future maintenance of the software if they were not addressed properly in time. In this paper, we propose an approach for monitoring the degradation <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> software design in evolution and providing useful feedbacks for evolution decisions. The approach {{is based on the assumption}} that the deviations between different modularity views and their trends in evolution can be used to monitor the degradation <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> design. Currently, our approach considers three modularity views, namely package view, structural cluster view and semantic cluster view. Package view denotes the package structure reflecting the desired modularity view; Structural cluster view and semantic cluster view are the modularity views extracted from implementation by software clustering based on formal information and non-formal information, respectively. Then based on the three modularity views extracted from each version, our approach calculates the similarity between different views as the measurement of modularity deviations, and analyzes the deviation trends over a series of versions. We conduct an empirical study on three open-source systems, which confirms that continuous monitoring <b>of</b> deviation <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> modularity <b>views</b> can provide useful feedbacks for future evolution decisions.

40|$|The View the MathML sourceTEX 86 H paleothermometer {{based on}} isoprenoid {{glycerol}} dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (isoGDGTs) has widely been applied in various marine settings to reconstruct past sea surface temperatures (SSTs). However, it still remains uncertain how well this proxy reconstructs annual mean SSTs. Here, we assess environmental factors governing the View the MathML sourceTEX 86 H paleothermometer in the Mediterranean Sea, {{by studying the}} distribution of isoGDGTs in surface sediments, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and two sediment cores. A redundancy analysis using the fractional abundance of the six major isoGDGTs indicates that the sedimentary isoGDGTs are mostly influenced by three environmental factors explaining a large part (74 %) {{of the variance in}} isoGDGT distribution. In order of decreasing significance, these factors are annual mean SST, continental organic matter input as indicated by the BIT index, and water depth. However, when considering only the four isoGDGTs that are used for the View the MathML sourceTEX 86 H proxy, water depth is the most significant parameter, explaining 63 % of the variance. Indeed, a strong positive relationship between water depth and View the MathML sourceTEX 86 H is observed in both surface sediments and SPM from the Mediterranean Sea. This is driven by an increase in fractional abundances of GDGT- 2 and crenarchaeol regio-isomer and a decrease in the fractional abundances of GDGT- 1 and GDGT- 3 with increasing water depth, leading to a bias to higher temperatures <b>of</b> <b>View</b> the MathML sourceTEX 86 H in deep-water surface sediments. The fact that the water-depth trend is also apparent in SPM suggests that this change might be due to a change in thaumarchaeotal community thriving below surface mixed-layer waters and that this signal is, at least partly, incorporated into sedimentary isoGDGTs. Interestingly, surface-sediment View the MathML sourceTEX 86 H values from > 1000 m water depth do not show a correlation with water depth anymore and instead are correlated to annual mean SSTs. A composite deep-water View the MathML sourceTEX 86 H dataset of surface sediments from both the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, interconnected regional restricted basins with relatively high bottom-water temperatures and high salinity, forms a distinctive correlation line, statistically distinct from that of the general global correlation. Application of this correlation on two sedimentary records from the western Mediterranean Sea covering the last deglaciation yields SSTs nearly identical to those obtained with the View the MathML sourceU 37 K' paleothermometer, whereas the global calibration substantially overestimates SSTs. Our results show that the warm bias <b>of</b> the <b>View</b> the MathML sourceTEX 86 H proxy in the Mediterranean Sea is not due to seasonality, as previously suggested. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism behind the strong water depth <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>View</b> the MathML sourceTEX 86 H in the Mediterranean Sea which is not apparent in open ocean settings...|$|R

This study therefore looked at three different categories of community radio stations, namely the faith-based radio (Kingfisher FM), geographic community radio (Radio Grahamstown) and institutional community radio (Forte FM) with the aim of studying their activities and comparing the three. Relevant literature has been reviewed and data have been collected using both quantitative and qualitative methods through questionnaires, personal interviews and focus group interviews. The study however leans more on the qualitative approach and a quantitative approach has merely been used to identify the <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the participants. The analysis of data highlights the <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the respondents about these radio stations as the voice of the community. The <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the respondents from the three radio stations showed that these stations enjoy a very good patronage from the listeners in Port Elizabeth (Kingfisher FM), Grahamstown (Radio Grahamstown) and Alice (Forte FM), respectively. The results and discussions confirm that these radio stations meet their various individual needs of the listeners and that of the community at large. In addition, the fact that participants of the focus groups and survey respondents for these three selected radio stations reported that the Station regularly fulfils the major functions of a radio station, which is to inform, educate and entertain them, showed that these radio stations are acting socially responsible as well. This study was also able to confirm that these community radio stations do give opportunities to listeners to contribute to programme content development, which shows the willingness of these stations to give voice to the listeners and allow them to be part of their own personal development and that of the community at larg...|$|R
