40|$|It {{has always}} been the law of <b>trespass</b> mesne profits to an oil and gas estate that a <b>trespasser</b> is liable for the value of the oil and gas that it has {{produced}} from the estate to which it <b>trespasses.</b> That value is determined after ascertaining whether the <b>trespasser</b> held an honest belief that he or she had the right to produce oil or gas from the estate upon which it <b>trespassed.</b> In those cases, the <b>trespasser</b> is said to have <b>trespassed</b> in good faith. Conversely, the <b>trespasser</b> acts in bad faith when it knowingly produces oil and gas without the right to do so. The rule is couched subjectively {{from the perspective of the}} <b>trespasser</b> and not from the view of a reasonable person in the same position as the <b>trespasser...</b>|$|R
50|$|There may be {{regulations}} that hold a <b>trespasser</b> {{to a higher}} duty of care, such as strict liability for timber <b>trespass</b> (removing trees beyond a permitted boundary), which {{is a type of}} <b>trespass</b> to chattels {{as a result of a}} <b>trespass</b> to land.|$|R
5|$|In August 1996, a {{photographer}} and reporter {{from the paper}} were arrested by the United States Forest Service for <b>trespassing</b> {{at the site of}} a timber protest in a national forest.

5000|$|<b>Trespass</b> to chattels, {{also known}} as <b>trespass</b> to goods or <b>trespass</b> to {{personal}} property, is defined as [...] "an intentional interference with the possession of personal property … proximately causing injury". <b>Trespass</b> to chattel {{does not require a}} showing of damages. Simply the [...] "intermeddling with or use of … the personal property" [...] of another gives cause of action for <b>trespass.</b> Since CompuServe Inc. v.

He backed Mike Harris when Timbrell withdrew from the contest. Baird has also indicated that {{he was charged with}} <b>trespassing</b> during the 1988 federal election, after he tried to question Ontario Premier David Peterson about free trade with the United States during a Liberal Party campaign stop in a Kingston shopping mall.

In April 1967 she married Louis Chesimard, a fellow student-activist at CCNY. The married life ended within a year; they divorced in December 1970. Shakur's marriage receives one paragraph in her memoir, she wrote that it ended over their differing views of gender roles.|$|E
5|$|The Church of Scientology {{sought an}} {{injunction}} and {{a restraining order}} to prevent Anonymous from protesting on March 15, 2008, citing threats allegedly made by Anonymous.

The Church filed complaints of <b>trespassing</b> and criminal harassment against Boston organizer Gregg Housh, who was charged with disturbing an assembly of worship, disturbing the peace, and harassment. The District Attorney's office dropped the harassment charge, and Judge Thomas Horgan issued a continuance without finding for the remaining charges.|$|E

5|$|The Winnebago War, {{also known}} as the Winnebago Uprising, was a brief {{conflict}} that took place in 1827 in the Upper Mississippi River region of the United States, primarily in what is now the state of Wisconsin. Not quite a war, the hostilities were limited to a few attacks on American civilians by a portion of the Winnebago (or Ho-Chunk) Native American tribe. The Ho-Chunks were reacting to a wave of lead miners <b>trespassing</b> on their lands, and to false rumors that the United States had sent two Ho-Chunk prisoners to a rival tribe for execution.|$|E
5|$|The boy Jones was an {{intruder}} who gained {{entry to the}} palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841. At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914, including Michael Fagan, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen's bedroom on the second occasion. At the time, news media {{reported that he had}} a long conversation with the Queen while she waited for security officers to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with The Independent, Fagan said the Queen ran {{out of the room and}} no conversation took place. It was only in 2007 that <b>trespassing</b> on the palace grounds became a specific criminal offence.|$|E
5|$|The false {{story of}} the {{execution}} of the Ho-Chunk prisoners, along with the incessant American <b>trespassing,</b> convinced some Ho-Chunks to take up arms against the United States. The timing seemed right, since the evacuation of Fort Crawford appeared to be a sign of American weakness. Another grievance was the news that some Ho-Chunk women had been sexually assaulted by American riverboat crews along the Mississippi River, although this story, like the one about the executions, may have been a false rumor. The Ho-Chunks broke off diplomatic relations with the United States by not showing up for a scheduled treaty conference, and prepared for war.|$|E
5000|$|If an act {{is direct}} but unintentional, a {{plaintiff}} in Australia may pursue an action based on either negligent <b>trespass</b> or negligence. Because intent {{is a requirement}} for <b>trespass</b> under UK law, negligent <b>trespass</b> is not possible in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Trespass</b> to chattels, {{also known}} as <b>trespass</b> to goods or <b>trespass</b> to {{personal}} property, is defined as [...] "an intentional interference with the possession of personal property...proximately causing injury". While originally a remedy for the asportation of personal property, the tort grew to incorporate any interference with the personal property of another. In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, <b>trespass</b> to chattels has been codified to clearly define {{the scope of the}} remedy; in most jurisdictions, <b>trespass</b> to chattel remains a purely common law remedy, the scope of which varies by jurisdiction.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of <b>trespass,</b> {{the first of which}} is <b>trespass</b> to the person. Whether intent is a {{necessary}} element of <b>trespass</b> to the person varies by jurisdiction. Under English decision, Letang v Cooper, intent is required to sustain a <b>trespass</b> to the person cause of action; in the absence of intent, negligence is the appropriate tort. In other jurisdictions, gross negligence is sufficient to sustain a <b>trespass</b> to the person, such as when a defendant negligently operates an automobile and strikes the plaintiff with great force. [...] "Intent is to be presumed from the act itself." [...] Generally, <b>trespass</b> to the person consists of three torts: assault, battery, and false imprisonment.|$|R

After leaving the diner, Mulder and Scully are confronted by black-suited agents, who destroy the photographs they have taken and order them to leave town.|$|E
5|$|Fans' {{behaviour}} {{at international}} games {{has led to}} various sanctions against the national team.

UEFA and FIFA have both penalized the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) for similar incidents in the past. During a friendly match against Italy in Livorno, {{a small group of}} Croatia fans formed the shape of a swastika. Croatian fans were also heavily scrutinized for racist behavior against Turkey in 2008, as well as an incident of racial abuse towards English striker Emile Heskey in 2010. During the 2006 World Cup a Croatian fan evaded security at a German venue and approached Croatian players on the field; he was arrested and banned for <b>trespassing.</b> There were also reports of violent clashes between Croatian and Turkish supporters at Euro 2008, as well as improper conduct by Croatia fans at Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Having become {{versed in}} Kuba {{language}} and culture, Sheppard took {{a team of}} men {{to the edge of}} Kuba territory in 1892. His original plan was to ask for directions to the next village under the guise of purchasing supplies, but the chief of the village only allowed one of his men to go. Sheppard used a variety of tricks to make his way further into the kingdom, including having a scout follow a group of traders and, most famously, eating so many eggs that the townspeople could no longer supply him and his scout was able {{to gain access to the}} next village to find more eggs. Eventually, however, he encountered villagers that would allow him to go no further. While Sheppard was formulating a plan, the king's son, Prince N'toinzide, arrived and arrested Sheppard and his men for <b>trespassing.</b>|$|E

5|$|In March 2014, {{the tower}} was scaled by 16-year-old Weehawken, New Jersey {{resident}} Justin Casquejo, {{who entered the}} site {{through a hole in}} a fence. He was subsequently arrested on <b>trespassing</b> charges. He allegedly dressed like a construction worker, sneaked in, and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower’s 88th floor, according to news sources. He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site.|$|E
5|$|In {{diplomatic}} {{talks with}} the Ho-Chunks {{at the close of}} the war, General Atkinson promised that the U.S. government would look into their grievances in the lead mining region. Thomas McKenney requested military aid to evict American miners who were <b>trespassing</b> on Ho-Chunk land, but after the war, settlers poured into the region in unprecedented numbers, and U.S. officials proved to be unable or unwilling to stem the tide. By January 1828, there were as many as 10,000 illegal settlers on Ho-Chunk land, including militia general Henry Dodge, who established a mining camp after the war and boasted that the U.S. Army could not make him leave. Having no other options, on August 25, 1828, the Ho-Chunks signed a provisional treaty with the United States, agreeing to sell the land occupied by the miners in a more formal treaty to be held later.|$|E

Florida, which controversially upheld a <b>trespassing</b> conviction for protesters who demonstrated on government property. He dissented from Brown v. Louisiana, in which the Court held that protesters were entitled to engage in a sit-in at a public library. Likewise, he disagreed with Tinker v.

50|$|In its {{submission}} to the Burns Inquiry, the League Against Cruel Sports presented evidence of over 1,000 cases of <b>trespass</b> by hunts.
