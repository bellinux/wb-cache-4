25|$|In 1890 David Ames Wells {{estimated}} wagon transport at 16 {{cents per}} <b>ton-mile</b> compared to railroads {{at less than}} one cent per <b>ton-mile.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{were only}} a few roads outside of cities at the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, but turnpikes were being built. A <b>ton-mile</b> by wagon cost from between 30 and 70 cents in 1819. Robert Fulton's estimate for typical wagonage was 32 cents per <b>ton-mile.</b> The cost of transporting wheat or corn to Philadelphia exceeded the value at 218 and 135 miles, respectively. To facilitate westward expansion, in 1801 Thomas Jefferson began work on the Natchez Trace, which was to connect Daniel Boone's Wilderness Road, which ended in Nashville, Tennessee, with the Mississippi River.|$|E
25|$|Upon introduction, {{locomotive}} C1 {{was put to}} work operating through goods trains on the Melbourne to Seymour line. Apart {{from its}} ability to operate heavy train unassisted, it was also found to be 5% more efficient in coal consumption per <b>ton-mile</b> than superheater-equipped A2 and Dd class locomotives, and 25% more efficient that A2 or Dd class locomotives with saturated steam boilers.|$|E
40|$|This study {{measured}} {{fuel consumption}} in transporting grain from Iowa origins to Japan and Amsterdam by alternative routes {{and modes of}} transport and applied these data to construct equations for fuel consumption from Iowa origins to alternative final destinations. Some of the results are as follows: (1) The metered tractor-trailer truck averaged 186. 6 gross <b>ton-miles</b> per gallon and 90. 5 net <b>ton-miles</b> per gallon when loaded 50 % of total miles. (2) The 1983 fuel consumption of seven trucks taken from company records was 82. 4 net <b>ton-miles</b> per gallon at 67. 5 % loaded miles and 68. 6 net <b>ton-miles</b> per gallon at 50 % loaded miles. (3) Unit grain trains from Iowa to West Coast ports averaged 437. 0 net <b>ton-miles</b> per gallon whereas unit grain trains from Iowa to New Orleans averaged 640. 1 net <b>ton-miles</b> per gallon [...] a 46 % advantage for the New Orleans trips. (4) Average barge fuel consumption on the Mississippi River from Iowa to New Orleans export grain elevators was 544. 5 net <b>ton-miles</b> per gallon, with a 35 % backhaul rate. (5) Ocean vessel net <b>ton-miles</b> per gallon varies widely by size of ship and backhaul percentage. With no backhaul, the average net <b>ton-miles</b> per gallon were as follows: for 30, 000 dwt ship, 574. 8 net <b>ton-miles</b> per gallon; for 50, 000 dwt ship, 701. 9; for 70, 000 dwt ship, 835. 1; and for 100, 000 dwt ship, 1, 043. 4. (6) The most fuel efficient route and modal combination to transport grain from Iowa to Japan depends {{on the size of}} ocean vessel, the percentage of backhaul, and the origin of the grain. Alternative routes and modal combinations in shipping grain to Japan are ranked in descending order of fuel efficiencies...|$|R
50|$|In 1925, Rutland {{reported}} 259 million net <b>ton-miles</b> {{of revenue}} freight and 38 million passenger-miles on 413 miles of road and 559 miles of track; in 1960 it had 182 million <b>ton-miles</b> on 391 route-miles and 476 track-miles.|$|R
50|$|In 1925 CNO&TP {{reported}} 1688 million <b>ton-miles</b> {{of revenue}} freight (not including Harriman & Northeastern) on 338 route-miles operated; in 1967 it had 4116 million <b>ton-miles</b> on 337 route-miles. Revenue passenger-miles were 134 million in 1925 and 15 million in 1967.|$|R
25|$|The 325-mile Erie Canal, which {{connected}} Albany, New York, on the Hudson River with Buffalo, New York, on Lake Erie, began {{operation in}} 1825. Wagon cost from Buffalo to New York City in 1817 was 19.2 cents per <b>ton-mile.</b> By Erie Canal c. 1857 to 1860 {{the cost was}} 0.81 cents. The Erie Canal was a great commercial success and had a large regional economic impact.|$|E
25|$|Because a horse {{can pull}} a barge {{carrying}} a cargo of over 50 tons {{compared to the}} typical one ton or less hauled by wagon, and the horse required a wagoner versus a couple of men for the barge, water transportation costs were {{a small fraction of}} wagonage costs. Canals' shipping costs were between two and three cents per <b>ton-mile,</b> compared to over 30 cents by wagon. The cost of constructing a typical canal was between $20,000 and $30,000.|$|E
25|$|U.S. freight railroads {{operate in}} a highly {{competitive}} marketplace. To compete effectively against each other and against other transportation providers, railroads must offer high-quality service at competitive rates. In 2011, within the U.S., railroads carried 39.9% of freight by <b>ton-mile,</b> followed by trucks (33.4%), oil pipelines (14.3%), barges (12%) and air (0.3%). However, railroads' revenue share has been slowly falling for decades, {{a reflection of the}} intensity of the competition they face and of the large rate reductions railroads have passed through to their customers over the years.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1925 it {{incorporated}} 375 {{miles of}} road and 470 miles of track; that year the Turtle Line reported 81 million <b>ton-miles</b> of revenue freight and 7 million passenger-miles. In 1967 it reported 124 million <b>ton-miles</b> on 224 miles of road.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1970 it {{operated}} 692 {{miles of}} road on 1116 miles of track; that year it reported 1365 million <b>ton-miles</b> of revenue freight. In 1980 route-miles had dropped to 678 but <b>ton-miles</b> had ballooned to 7230 million: Powder River coal had arrived.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1970 FW&D {{operated}} 1201 {{miles of}} road on 1577 miles of track; that year it reported 1493 million <b>ton-miles</b> of revenue freight. (Those totals {{may or may not}} include the former Burlington-Rock Island Railroad.) In 1980 operated mileage had dropped to 1181 but <b>ton-miles</b> were 7732 million: the tide of coal had begun.|$|R
25|$|Double-stacking {{containers}} {{greatly improved}} operating efficiency by reducing train length {{and the number}} of axles per container, thus saving fuel per <b>ton-mile.</b> Another benefit was created by permanently joining five cars in a set. This reduced the number of couplers, which reduced slack action. Slack is created in any train by the couplers between the cars being stretched and compressed, and in long, heavy trains this can be quite a powerful force. By reducing slack action, the damage caused to the freight transported in containers is also reduced.|$|E
25|$|Lockheed also {{planned a}} {{civilian}} {{version of the}} C-5 Galaxy, the L-500, the company designation also used for the C-5 itself. Both passenger and cargo versions of the L-500 were designed. The all-passenger version {{would have been able}} to carry up to 1,000 travelers, while the all-cargo version was predicted to be able to carry typical C-5 volume for as little as 2 cents per <b>ton-mile</b> (in 1967 dollars). Although some interest was expressed by carriers, no orders were placed for either L-500 version, due to operational costs caused by low fuel efficiency, a significant concern for a profit-making carrier, even before the oil crisis of the 1970s, keen competition from Boeing's 747, and high costs incurred by Lockheed in developing the C-5 and later, the L-1011 which led to the governmental rescue of the company.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} predecessor of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Aurora Branch Railroad, was chartered by {{act of the}} Illinois General Assembly on October 2, 1848. The charter {{was obtained}} by citizens of Aurora and Batavia, Illinois, who were concerned that the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad would bypass their towns in favor of West Chicago on its route; at the time, {{that was the only}} line running west from Chicago. The Aurora Branch was built from Aurora, through Batavia, to Turner Junction in what is now West Chicago. The line was built with old strap rail and minimal, if any, grading. Using a leased locomotive and cars, the Aurora Branch ran passenger and freight trains from Aurora to Chicago via its own line from Aurora to Turner Junction and one of the G's two tracks east from there to Chicago. The G required the Aurora Branch to turn over 70 percent of their revenue per <b>ton-mile</b> handled on that railroad; as a result, in the mid-1850s, surveys were ordered to determine the best route for a railroad line to Chicago.|$|E

25|$|U.S. railroads {{still play}} a major role in the nation's freight shipping. They carried 750 billion <b>ton-miles</b> by 1975 which doubled to 1.5 {{trillion}} <b>ton-miles</b> in 2005. In the 1950s, the U.S. and Europe moved roughly the same percentage of freight by rail; by 2000, the share of U.S. rail freight was 38% while in Europe only 8% of freight traveled by rail. In 2000, while U.S. trains moved 2,390 billion ton-kilometers of freight, the 15-nation European Union moved only 304 billion ton-kilometers of freight. In terms of <b>ton-miles,</b> railroads annually move more than 25% of the United States' freight and connect businesses with each other across the country and with markets overseas.|$|R
5000|$|In 1925 AT&N {{reported}} 15 million <b>ton-miles</b> {{of revenue}} freight on 187 miles of line; in 1967, 543 million <b>ton-miles</b> on 214 route-miles. In 1950, {{under the auspices}} of the ATN, the Frisco began freight service to and from, and on Blakeley and Pinto Islands by way of two car floats across the Mobile river. The service was continued after the SLSF was merged into the BN, until about 1994.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} match the {{capacity}} and economics of a [...] oil pipeline, the same being considered for the Alaska Pipeline and Mackenzie Valley Pipeline, the system required 50 aircraft (about 15 of those being spares) each carrying about 8,000 barrels of oil and flying 24 hours a day. The aircraft were estimated to cost $72 million each (about $ today), and fly for between 1 and 1½ cents per <b>ton-mile.</b>|$|E

Today, the Corps of Engineers maintains more than [...] of inland waterways and operates 235 locks. These waterways—a system of rivers, lakes and coastal bays improved for commercial and recreational transportation—carry about 1/6 of the nation's inter-city freight, {{at a cost}} per <b>ton-mile</b> about 1/2 that of rail or 1/10 that of trucks.

2500|$|The 747-400 {{and earlier}} {{versions}} had {{proven to be}} a very popular freighter, carrying around half of the world's air freight. To maintain this position, Boeing designed a freight variant of the 747-8, named the 747-8 Freighter or 747-8F. The company launched the freighter version on November 14, 2005. The 747-8F is the initial model to enter service. As on the 747-400F, the upper deck is shorter than passenger models; the [...] stretch is just before and just aft of the wing. 747-8 Freighter was designed with a [...] maximum take-off weight with a payload capability of [...] and a range of [...] Four extra pallet spaces were created on the main deck, with either two extra containers and two extra pallets, or three extra pallets, on the lower deck.

2500|$|Rival {{performance}} {{claims by}} Airbus and Boeing {{appear to be}} contradictory, their methodologies unclear and neither are validated by a third party source. [...] Boeing claims the 747-8I to be over 10% lighter per seat and have 11% less fuel consumption per passenger, with a trip-cost reduction of 21% and a seat-mile cost reduction of more than 6%, compared to the A380. The 747-8F's empty weight {{is expected to be}} 80 tonnes (88 tons) lighter and 24% lower fuel burnt per ton with 21% lower trip costs and 23% lower <b>ton-mile</b> costs than the A380F. On the other hand, Airbus claims the A380 to have 8% less fuel consumption per passenger than the 747-8I and in 2007 Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng stated the A380 was performing better than both the airline and Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per passenger than the airline's 747-400 fleet. Emirates' Tim Clark also claims that the A380 is more fuel economic at Mach 0.86 than at 0.83. One independent, industry analysis shows fuel consumption in litres per seat per 100 kilometres flown (L/seat/100km) as 3.27 for the A380 and 3.35 for the B747-8I, or a fuel cost per seat mile of $0.055 and $0.057 respectively.
