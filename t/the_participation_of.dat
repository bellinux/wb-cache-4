40|$|Objectives A stable {{follow-up}} {{participation rate}} {{is a very}} important factor for validity in a cohort study. This study analyzed the factors that affect <b>the</b> <b>participation</b> rate at one hospital-based birth cohort in South Korean. Methods The participants were recruited from the Mothers’ and Children’s Environmental Health study between 2006 and 2010. The analysis targeted 1751 mothers who participated in a birth cohort. We conducted analyses of general characteristics during pregnancy and those of infants at birth that affect <b>the</b> <b>participation</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6 -month follow-up survey. Results <b>The</b> <b>participation</b> rate for <b>the</b> 6 -month follow-up survey was 60. 4 %. <b>The</b> <b>participation</b> rate in <b>the</b> follow-up of the subsequent period decreased within a 5 % to 10 % range compared to the number <b>of</b> subjects. <b>The</b> <b>participation</b> rate <b>of</b> premature infants was 16. 9 % lower than that of a full-term infant (52. 6 % vs. 69. 5 %). Analysis showed a 16. 7 % difference between <b>the</b> <b>participation</b> rate <b>of</b> low-birthweight infants in follow-ups (53. 7 %) and <b>the</b> <b>participation</b> rate <b>of</b> infants with normal weight (70. 4 %). <b>The</b> <b>participation</b> rate <b>of</b> mothers who were employed during pregnancy was significantly lower for the 6 -month follow-up compared to <b>the</b> <b>participation</b> rate <b>of</b> mothers who were unemployed during pregnancy. Conclusions In this study, factors such as premature birth, low-birthweight, and the employment status of the mother during pregnancy affected <b>the</b> <b>participation</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> follow-up survey for the birth cohort at six months. A specific strategy is needed to encourage survey <b>participation</b> for <b>the</b> high risk groups in the follow-ups...|$|R
