5|$|During the battle, Graham also {{saved the}} life of Captain Wyndham– {{one of those who}} had shut the gate– by {{shooting}} a sniper whose musket was <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> officer. Mid-afternoon, a fire broke out in one of the farm buildings following a bombardment of incendiary shells. Graham's brother Joseph was lying wounded within, and Graham requested permission to fall out, so he might rescue his brother; given permission, he retrieved his brother and returned to his post. Joseph Graham died of wounds five days later.|$|E
5|$|Hansa {{returned}} to Germany in 1906. The following year, {{she went to}} dry dock at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig for a refit, during which she was re-boilered. Hertha originally had three stacks, and during the modernization they were trunked into two funnels. The refit was finished by 1909, at which point Hansa became a cadet training ship. From 1911 to 1912, Günther Lütjens served aboard Hansa as commander of the naval cadets that <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship. Lütjens went on to command the task force composed of Bismarck and Prinz Eugen in World War II. In early January, Hansa cruised into the Atlantic and visited Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|In April 1940, the RAAF {{confirmed}} both Rawlinson's {{appointment as}} a pilot officer and promotion to temporary flying officer as of 22November 1939. Three months later, he posted out to the Middle East with No.3 Squadron, which was to support the 6thDivision in the Western Desert Campaign against Italian forces. Sailing via Bombay, the squadron arrived in Suez, Egypt, on 23August 1940. The next month it was equipped with a flight of Westland Lysander high-wing monoplane reconnaissance aircraft and two flights of Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters, augmented by four Gloster Gauntlet biplanes {{to be used for}} dive bombing; Rawlinson initially <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Gauntlet.|$|E

5|$|Jarre {{was raised}} in Lyon by his mother and grandparents, and <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> piano. From an early age, he was {{introduced}} {{to a variety of}} art forms, including those of street performers, jazz musicians, and the artist Pierre Soulages. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales.|$|E
5|$|Testing {{then moved}} to Kwajalein. The first test on 21 March 1963 failed when the MTR failed to lock onto the missile. A second on 19 April also failed when the missile's {{tracking}} beacon failed 30 seconds before intercept. The third test, this time using an actual target consisting of an Agena-D upper stage equipped with a Zeus miss-distance transmitter, was carried out on 24 May 1963, and was a complete success. From that point until 1964, one DM-15S was kept {{in a state of}} instant readiness and teams continually <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> missile.|$|E
5|$|After commissioning, Bolt was {{assigned}} as a cadet training instructor, training aviation cadets at Naval Air Station Jacksonville and at Naval Auxiliary Air Station Green Cove Springs, Florida, until December 1942, when the unit was deactivated. Until May 1943 he was <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> F4F Wildcat, a carrier-based aircraft, {{in preparation for}} movement to a front-line combat unit. Over the next few months, Bolt was stationed at Naval Air Station Glenview in Glenview, Illinois, where he trained for 60 hours aboard the paddlewheel aircraft carrier USS Wolverine. After qualifying to operate carrier-based aircraft, he {{was assigned}} to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California, until June 1943, when he and his class departed for the Pacific Theater aboard the USS Rochambeau.|$|E

5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make}} a hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E
5|$|His first {{squadron}} was No. 29 Squadron RAF, {{based at}} RAF West Malling, flying the two-seater Hawker Demon. In February 1939 No 29 Squadron re-equipped with the Bristol Blenheim. Braham was disappointed at not being <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hawker Hurricane and {{his reaction to}} this news was request a transfer which was refused. The squadron spent three months converting onto the Blenheim. In August 1939 No. 29 did convert to the Hurricane but upon the outbreak of war the squadron was reverted to the Blenheim {{as part of its}} reorientation to night fighter rather than daylight fighter operations. Braham soon earned the nickname 'Bob', which stayed with him throughout his service career. He had chosen this Christian name as his radio call sign to distinguish himself from the multitude of other Johns in the unit.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1940, {{following}} the Battle of France, Panzer-Regiment 2 was subordinated to the 16th Panzer Division. Strachwitz asked the divisional commander Generalmajor Hans Hube for {{the command of}} a Panzer company, and Hube gave Strachwitz the I. Bataillon, a position he held until October 1942. Strachwitz and his men <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new Panzer III with 5 cm KwK 38 cannon. He paid {{special attention to the}} training and integration of the replacements crews which joined his unit. In December 1940, 16th Panzer Division was declared a Lehrtruppe (demonstration troop), a unit to be involved in experimentation with new weapons and tactics. Via Bavaria, Austria and Hungary they were transferred to Romania, with Strachwitz's I. Battalion stationed at Mediaș.|$|E

5|$|Sir R.E.M.Wheeler, the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, in the 1940s {{saw a few}} {{potsherds}} of Arikamedu site {{displayed in}} the Madras Museum, which he identified as Arrentine ware, an expensive ceramic made until 50 CE in Arizzo, Italy. Thereafter, when he visited the Pondicherry Museum and saw more of {{the findings from the}} Arikamedu site, he was impressed and thought that he had found the links between the Classical Mediterranean and Ancient India. Soon thereafter in 1945, the penultimate year of World War II, he mounted excavations in a scientific manner. He was looking for an archaeological site in India that could establish its cultural link, a datum of the Indian antiquities to the Greco-Roman period, and this quest led him to the Arikamedu site. These excavations also involved Indian archaeologists, who were <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Richard Morris {{provided}} {{some of the}} first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories in vivo. He tested the spatial memory of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.|$|E
