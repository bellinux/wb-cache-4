5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called <b>the</b> <b>director,</b> <b>is</b> introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules {{in the neighborhood of}} any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E

500|$|Film critic Glenn Kenny wrote, [...] "Che {{seems to}} me almost the polar {{opposite}} of agitprop. It flat out does not ask {{for the kind of}} emotional engagement that more conventional epic biopics do, and that's a good thing". In his review for UGO, Keith Uhlich wrote, [...] "The best to say about Del Toro's Cannes-honored performance is that it's exhausting—all exterior, no soul, like watching an android run a gauntlet (one that includes grueling physical exertions, tendentious political speechifying, and risible Matt Damon cameos)". Slant magazine gave Che two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "The problem is that, despite his desire to sidestep Hollywood bio-hooey, <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>is</b> unable to turn his chilly stance into an ideological perspective, like Roberto Rossellini did in his demythologized portraits of Louis XIV, Garibaldi and Pascal".|$|E
500|$|Sue Parrill {{observes that}} Persuasions larger {{production}} budget, which allowed {{the crew to}} film much content on-location, [...] "enabled the filmmakers to make fuller use of setting for symbolism and for creation of mood". The weather, for instance, is particularly important to Anne's state of mind in the novel. Persuasions opening scenes establish its historical context, {{as well as the}} financial predicament in which the Elliot family finds itself. Indeed, for Rachel Brownstein, by opening the film with a depiction of sailors, <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>is</b> confronting a common complaint of Austen's works—her failure to mention the Napoleonic Wars. The juxtaposition between the navy and the Elliots establishes their differences, with the former group discussing the fall of Napoleon and the latter group discussing the relatively minor inconvenience of overspending.|$|E
500|$|Upon further investigation, Francis {{is shocked}} to learn that Dr. Caligari is the asylum's director. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director's records and diary while <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>is</b> sleeping. The {{writings}} reveal his obsession {{with the story of}} an 18th-century mystic named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns. The director, attempting to understand the earlier Caligari, experiments on a somnambulist admitted to the asylum, who becomes his Cesare. The director screams, [...] "I must become Caligari!" [...] Francis and the doctors call the police to Dr. Caligari's office, where they show him Cesare's corpse. Dr. Caligari then attacks one of the staff. He is subdued, restrained in a straitjacket, and becomes an inmate in his own asylum.|$|E
