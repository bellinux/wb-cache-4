50|$|On {{aircraft}} or vessels {{there are}} three types of bearing: true, magnetic, and <b>compass</b> bearing. <b>Compass</b> <b>error</b> {{is divided into two}} parts, namely magnetic variation and magnetic deviation, the latter originating from magnetic properties of the vessel or aircraft. Variation and deviation are signed quantities. As discussed above, positive (easterly) variation indicates that magnetic north is east of geographic north.|$|R
50|$|In {{navigation}} manuals, magnetic deviation often refers {{specifically to}} <b>compass</b> <b>error</b> caused by magnetized iron within a ship or aircraft. This iron has {{a mixture of}} permanent magnetization and an induced (temporary) magnetization that is induced by the Earth's magnetic field. Because the latter depends on {{the orientation of the}} craft relative to the Earth's field, {{it can be difficult to}} analyze and correct for it.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) to characterise the hydraulic conditions near river engineering structures such as dams, fish passes and groins, as part of ecological and hydromorphological assessments. However, such ADCP applications can be limited by <b>compass</b> <b>errors,</b> obstructed view to navigation satellites, frequent loss of bottom tracking and spatially heterogeneous flow leading to erroneous water velocity measurements. This study addresses these limitations by (i) developing a heading sensor integration algorithm that corrects <b>compass</b> <b>errors</b> from magnetic interference, (ii) testing a Total Station based technique for spatial ADCP data referencing and (iii) evaluating a recently proposed data processing technique that reduces bias from spatial flow heterogeneity. The integration of these techniques on a radio control ADCP platform is illustrated downstream of a weir with fish pass on the River Severn, UK. The results show that each of the techniques can have a statistically significant effect on the estimated total water velocities and can strongly affect measures of vorticity. The obtained three-dimensional flow maps are suitable to describe the magnitude and orientation of the fish pass attraction flow in relation to competing flows and to highlight areas of increased vorticity...|$|R

25|$|Like any {{magnetic}} device, compasses {{are affected}} by nearby ferrous materials, {{as well as by}} strong local electromagnetic forces. Compasses used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to ferrous metal objects or electromagnetic fields (car electrical systems, automobile engines, steel pitons, etc.) as that can affect their accuracy. Compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks, cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of built-in magnets or other devices. Large amounts of ferrous metal combined with the on-and-off electrical fields caused by the vehicle's ignition and charging systems generally result in significant <b>compass</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of fish passes {{has been a}} longstanding measure to improve river ecosystem status by ensuring the passability of weirs, dams and other in- channel structures for migratory fish. Many fish passes have a low biological effectiveness because of unsuitable hydrodynamic conditions hindering fish to rapidly detect the pass entrance. There has been a need for techniques to quantify the hydrodynamics surrounding fish pass entrances {{in order to identify}} those passes that require enhancement and to improve the design of new passes. This PhD thesis presents the development of a methodology for the rapid, spatially continuous quantification of near-pass hydrodynamics in the field. The methodology involves moving-vessel Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements in order to quantify the 3 -dimensional water velocity distribution around fish pass entrances. The approach presented in this thesis is novel because it integrates a set of techniques to make ADCP data robust against errors associated with the environmental conditions near engineered in-channel structures. These techniques provide solutions to (i) ADCP <b>compass</b> <b>errors</b> from magnetic interference, (ii) bias in water velocity data caused by spatial flow heterogeneity, (iii) the accurate ADCP positioning in locales with constrained line of sight to navigation satellites, and (iv) the accurate and cost-effective sensor deployment following pre-defined sampling strategies. The effectiveness and transferability of the methodology were evaluated at three fish pass sites covering conditions of low, medium and high discharge. The methodology outputs enabled a detailed quantitative characterisation of the fish pass attraction flow and its interaction with other hydrodynamic features. The outputs are suitable to formulate novel indicators of hydrodynamic fish pass attractiveness and they revealed the need to refine traditional fish pass design guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{preserve}} their efficiency, submarine tidal turbines and other marine renewable energy systems need an accurate knowledge of sea currents directions. The speeds and directions of these currents {{can be measured in}} a cell of water with currentmeters (AQD) or on a water column with profilers called AQP or ADCP which stands for Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. When these instruments are installed on carriers, mooring lines or mooring cages, it is necessary to correct the measured data in heading, roll and pitch, in order to interpret them in a terrestrial referential. In this way, they are equipped with a magnetic compass and tilt sensors. Magnetic environment influences compasses responses. There was no system to calibrate AQD and AQP in their using configurations. Following a method perfected in 2007 in order to correct angle errors and warranting a measurement uncertainty in the case of instruments fixed in mooring cages, a calibration platform for magnetic compasses and tilt sensors has been built. In order to show the interest and the corrections allowed by this equipment, this publication shows the effects of the instrumentation of a DORA mooring cage on the compass response of an AQD. The measurements underscore that the initial <b>compass</b> <b>error</b> of 4 ° peak-peak is between – 10 ° and + 5. 7 ° after installation in the cage. This publication shows also the results obtained after the calibration of a stock of 30 AQD currentmeters and 22 AQP profilers. The manufacturer specifications of 2 ° in heading are respected only in 37 % of cases for AQD’s and 23 % for AQP’s. The heading and roll specifications of 0. 2 ° are never respected but 86 % of profilers and 53 % of currentmeters show errors less than 2 °. ...|$|R

We investigated {{the efficacy of the}} composite autonomic symptom scale 31 (COMPASS 31) questionnaire as a tool for evaluating autonomic function in parkinsonism patients. In this study, we enrolled drug-naïve patients with MSA-P and PD, and administered the COMPASS- 31 and an objective autonomic dysfunction test (AFT). Demographic and clinical data, including parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction, were compared between the two groups. Additionally, we determined the optimal COMPASS 31 cut-off score to differentiate MSA-P from PD for use as a screening tool. In this study, 27 MSA-P patients and 41 PD patients were recruited. The <b>total</b> <b>COMPASS</b> 31 score was well correlated with the objective AFT results. When we compared the COMPASS 31 score between the two groups, MSA-P patients showed higher total scores and sub-scores in the orthostatic intolerance, gastrointestinal, and bladder domains compared with PD patients. Similarly, MSA-P patients had more abnormalities in expiration to inspiration ratio, Valsalva ratio and pressure recovery time than PD patients in objective AFT. With 13. 25 as the cut-off score for diagnosis of MSA-P, the total COMPASS- 31 score demonstrated high sensitivity (92. 6 %) and moderate specificity (51. 2 %) with an area under the curve of 0. 765.

40|$|On {{the bridge}} of a ship the {{officers}} are looking for visual aids to guide navigation in order to reconcile the outside world with the position communicated by the digital navigation system. Aids to navigation include: Lighthouses, lightships, sector lights, beacons, buoys, and others. They {{are designed to help}} navigators calculate their position, establish their course or avoid dangers. In poor visibility and dense traffic areas, it can be very difficult to identify these critical aids to guide navigation. The paper presents the usage of Augmented Reality (AR) as a means to present digital information about these aids to support navigation. To date, nautical navigation related mobile AR applications have been limited to the leisure industry. If proved viable, this prototype can facilitate the creation of other similar applications that could help commercial officers with navigation. While adopting a user centered design approach, the team has developed the prototype based on insights from initial research carried on board of several ships. The prototype, built on Nexus 9 tablet and Wikitude, features a head-up display of the navigational aids (lights) in the area, presented in AR and a bird’s eye view mode presented on a simplified map. The application employs the aids to navigation data managed by Hydrographic Offices and the tablet’s sensors: GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass and camera. Sea trials on board of a Navy and a commercial ship revealed the end-users’ interest in using the application and further possibility of other data to be presented in AR. The application calculates the GPS position of the ship, the bearing and distance to the navigational aids; all within a high level of accuracy. However, during testing several issues were highlighted which need to be resolved as the prototype is developed further. The prototype stretched the capabilities of Wikitude, loading over 500 objects during tests in a major port. This overloaded the display and required over 45 seconds to load the data. Therefore, extra filters for the navigational aids are being considered in order to declutter the screen. At night, the camera is not powerful enough to distinguish all the lights in the area. Also, magnetic interference with {{the bridge of}} the ship generated a continuous <b>compass</b> <b>error</b> of the AR display that varied between 5 and 12 degrees. The deviation of the compass was consistent over the whole testing durations so the team is now looking at the possibility of allowing users to manually calibrate the compass. It is expected that for the usage of AR in professional maritime contexts, further development of existing AR tools and hardware is needed. Designers will also need to implement a user-centered design approach in order to create better interfaces and display technologies for enhanced solutions to aid navigation...|$|R
