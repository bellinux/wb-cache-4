Murphy, distrustful of the commission and fearing that it had an ulterior motive, sent out a press release announcing that Seedman had been relieved of his position as chief of detectives. After it made headlines on all the city's newspapers, the commissioner reinstated him five days later.|$|E

25|$|The next day, the park's {{official}} public opening day, crowds {{gathered in}} line {{as early as}} 2:00am. The first person to buy a ticket and enter the park was David MacPherson with ticket number 2, as Roy O. Disney arranged to pre-purchase ticket number 1 from Curtis Lineberry, the manager of admissions. However, an official picture of Walt Disney and two children, Christine Vess Watkins (age 5) and Michael Schwartner (7), inaccurately identifies them as the first <b>two</b> <b>guests</b> of Disneyland. Both received lifetime passes to Disneyland that day, and MacPherson was awarded one shortly thereafter, which was later expanded to every single Disney-owned park in the world. Approximately 50,000 guests attended the Monday opening day.|$|E

Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house.
