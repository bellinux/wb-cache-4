30|$|Previous results {{indicate}} that connectors can delay the buckling initiation, reduce the contact force between <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> and wellbore, and improve the axial force transfer on the <b>tubular</b> <b>string.</b> Therefore, a reasonable optimization of connector parameters may greatly improve the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> extension limit in long horizontal-section and extended-reach wells. For practical application, theoretical results {{about the effect of}} connectors on <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling and contact force should be obtained first.|$|E
30|$|<b>Tubular</b> <b>string</b> {{buckling}} is {{an important}} issue in well engineering. Buckling makes the initially straight <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckle into curved shapes, which {{is an important}} reason for the well deviation problem. Buckling can also increase both bending stress on the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> and the contact force between the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> and the wellbore, which may further lead to serious down-hole problems such as <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> failure, casing wear, hard slack off, or even “lock up.” Down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling is usually taken as analogous to the Euler buckling problem for a rod with axial compressive forces on both ends. The rod remains straight until the axial force exceeds a certain value, namely the critical load. When the axial force is larger than the critical value, the initial configuration becomes unstable and the rod buckles into a laterally deformed configuration. However, unlike the free post-buckling deflection of the Euler rod, various external factors, such as the constraint of wellbore, <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> weight, torque, friction force, etc., make <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling behavior more complex.|$|E
30|$|Different {{from the}} {{vertical}} wellbores, the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> bucking behavior is greatly {{affected by the}} component of the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> weight perpendicular to the wellbore axis. If there is no axial force applied, the straight <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> lies on the lower side of the wellbore. With the axial compression increasing to a certain value, the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> moves up from the wellbore bottom and buckles into a certain configuration. During this process, the axial force, which makes the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> become unstable, contends with other stable {{factors such as the}} wellbore constraint, perpendicular weight component, and the bending stiffness of the <b>tubular</b> <b>string.</b> That is to say, the buckling state is a comprehensive function of the stable and unstable factors.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{extending}} {{limit in}} horizontal drilling means the maximum horizontal extending {{length of a}} horizontal well under certain ground and down-hole mechanical constraint conditions. Around this concept, the constrained optimization model of mechanical extending limits is built and simplified analytical results for pick-up and slack-off operations are deduced. The horizontal extending limits for kinds of <b>tubular</b> <b>strings</b> under different drilling parameters are calculated and drawn. To improve extending limits, an optimal design model of drill strings is built and applied to a case study. The results indicate that horizontal extending limits are underestimated a lot when the effects of friction force on critical helical buckling loads are neglected. Horizontal extending limits firstly increase and tend to stable values with vertical depths. Horizontal extending limits increase faster but finally become smaller {{with the increase of}} horizontal pushing forces for <b>tubular</b> <b>strings</b> of smaller modulus-weight ratio. Sliding slack-off is the main limit operation and high axial friction is the main constraint factor constraining horizontal extending limits. A sophisticated installation of multiple <b>tubular</b> <b>strings</b> can greatly inhibit helical buckling and increase horizontal extending limits. The optimal design model is called only once to obtain design results, which greatly increases the calculation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Taking {{account of}} the {{influence}} of friction between the outer wall of buckling tubular and the inner wall of casing under vibrating loads, the burst and collapse strengths of worn tubular would be reduced greatly compared to the unworn tubular. If the reduction of burst and collapse strength weren’t taken into consideration, there may be potential risk in well completion. The models of worn <b>tubular</b> <b>strings</b> were established based on finite element method, and thus the relationships between strength of burst and collapse and the degree of wear were analyzed. The results of FEM were verified by the equations in API 5 C 3. The results show that the strengths of burst and collapse will be reduced with the increase of wear degree, and the burst strength will be reduced more sharply. When the <b>tubular</b> <b>strings</b> are worn by 30 %, the strengths of burst and collapse will be reduced by almost 50 %. While the strengths of burst and collapse will be reduced by almost 60 %, when the <b>tubular</b> <b>strings</b> are worn by 50 %. So, to avoid the accident caused by the worn tubular, the work case should be controlled strictly correspondingly...|$|R

Meanwhile, comments on some unsolved problems and controversial conclusions are presented.|$|E
30|$|One {{important}} {{method for}} improving the axial force transfer is rotating the <b>tubular</b> <b>string.</b> With rotation, the axial friction force can be dramatically decreased by converting {{the direction of the}} friction force from the axial direction to the rotational direction. Meanwhile, rotation also affects the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling behavior. Menand et al. (2008, 2009) studied the effect of friction force and rotation on <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling with ABIS software and experiments, which indicates that rotation can reduce about 50  % of the critical helical buckling load from a non-rotating case. Gao and Miska (2010 b) deduced the dynamic buckling equation of a rotating <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> without friction and solved it with a perturbation method. The results show that {{there are two kinds of}} snaking motion: the first one is that the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> moves up and down about the static buckling configuration, while the other is the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> moves from one side to the other side of the wellbore periodically. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that rotation does not affect the critical buckling load. Hydraulic vibration is another way to improve the axial force transfer and the “lock up” phenomenon caused by the combined effects of friction force and helical buckling can be overcome through <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> vibration (Barakat et al. 2007). Some researchers also believed that the connectors on the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> can inhibit the buckling initiation and reduce the friction force on the <b>tubular</b> <b>string.</b> The effects of connectors on <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling are discussed below.|$|E

30|$|In this article, our {{aim is to}} {{introduce}} three main research methods in down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling, summarize the effects of relevant factors on the critical buckling loads and post-buckling behavior, and draw a picture for future research in this field. Previous studies built the basic knowledge framework of down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling theory in which three issues are studied in detail: (1) {{the description of the}} transition between different buckling modes and the corresponding critical buckling loads; (2) the buckling behavior including the deflection curve, bending moment, and contact force under different bucking modes; (3) the effects of relevant factors such as wellbore configuration, torque, and boundary conditions. It is indicated that down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling is a complex problem because of the involvement of instability, nonlinearity, multiple factors etc. Future research on down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling should still be conducted from two aspects: (1) a more sophisticated and more accurate description of the critical buckling conditions and post-buckling behavior, such as the quantitative description of the full path for the buckling mode transition in a vertical wellbore and an arbitrary three-dimensional wellbore; (2) the combination of as many factors as possible, such as the buckling behavior of a <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> with connectors under the action of friction force in a three-dimensional wellbore. To achieve the above objects, the three research methods should be combined to solve the down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling problems and an efficient calculation program to solve the generated nonlinear algebraic equations should be proposed. In addition, the previous studies mainly focused on the mechanism of the down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling but neglected the active control of the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling behaviors, which provides an important guidance for improving the extending limit of the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> in well engineering.

Later, Paslay and Cernocky (1991) extended Lubinski’s work to the axial compression case. The results show that the local bending curvature with connectors is larger than the wellbore curvature. Therefore, the bending moment magnification should be taken into consideration for the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> design. On the basis of Paslay’s work, Huang et al. (2015 c) further considered the effect of <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> weight and assumed that the wellbore curvature is equivalent to an additional <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> weight. The results show that the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> weight and wellbore curvature affect the critical transition conditions between different contact cases a lot.

In this review, the basic principles and applicable scope of three classic research methods (the beam-column model, buckling differential equation, and energy method) are introduced. The critical buckling loads and the post-buckling behavior under different buckling modes in vertical, inclined, horizontal, and curved wellbores from different researchers are presented and compared.

The Electron String Ion Source “Krion- 2 ” (VBLHE, JINR, Dubna) with an applied confining magnetic field of 3 T was used for injection into the superconducting JINR synchrotron – Nuclotron and during this runs the source provided a high pulse intensity of the highly charged ion beams: Ar 16 +- 200 µА, Fe 24 +- 150 µА in 8 µs pulses. It is expected, that an increase of the source magnetic field from 3 T up to 5 T should lead to increase of the intensity of Ar 16 + and Fe 24 + ion beams up to 1 mA at a pulse duration of 10 µs.

30|$|Gao et al. (2012) {{studied the}} {{critical}} sinusoidal buckling load for a initially straight <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> in no contact, point contact, and wrap contact cases. The {{results show that}} both the length between two adjacent connectors and the radial clearance difference between the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> body and connector affect the critical buckling loads a lot. With {{a decrease in the}} length between two adjacent connectors, the effective radial clearance approaches the connector radial clearance. When the length between two adjacent connectors reaches the critical value where the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> is just in point contact with the wellbore, the critical buckling load achieves its minimum value.

30|$|However, {{the above}} three {{research}} methods {{are usually not}} isolated from each other. The combination of the three methods can give a sophisticated description of the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> deflection. For example, in the derivation of the deflection curve on the transition section near the boundary, the beam-column model is used to depict the suspended section while the buckling differential equation to depict the perturbed buckling section (Sorenson and Cheatham 1986; Liu et al. 1999). Taking a down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> with two connectors on its two ends as another example, the two portions of the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> near the connectors are suspended, while the middle portion is in continuous contact with the wellbore. Similar to the analysis about boundary conditions, the suspended section and the continuous contact section are, respectively, depicted by the beam-column model and the bucking differential equation. In addition, the relative angular displacement between the two connectors is obtained when the total potential energy of the down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> achieves the minimum value (Huang and Gao 2014 b).

30|$|Every {{suspended}} {{section is}} depicted by the above general solution and the terms including the lateral displacement, tangent direction, bending moment, and tangent shear force are all continuous at the connecting points between every two adjacent suspended sections. Introducing the boundary {{conditions at the}} ends of the integral <b>tubular</b> <b>string,</b> a system of nonlinear algebraic equations can be obtained. In this way, the down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckling problem is transformed into the properties of the solutions of the nonlinear algebraic equations.|$|E
30|$|At first, the {{critical}} load which initiates helical buckling in vertical wellbores is approximately {{considered to be}} 0 (F = 0) for a <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> with rather small bending stiffness, such as tubing. As a result, the down-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> deflection {{is divided into two}} parts with the neutral point (F = 0) as the dividing point: the initial straight configuration above the dividing point and a full helix depicted by Eq. (10) below the dividing point. Later, it was realized that it is too conservative to take the neutral point as {{the critical}} helical buckling force for the drill string. Wu (1992) improved the calculation method for the critical force between the three-dimensional sinusoidal buckling and helical buckling in vertical wellbores with the energy method shown in Table  1. In Wu’s analysis, the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> buckles into a half-sine wave under the critical sinusoidal buckling condition and into a pitch of helix under the critical helical buckling condition.|$|E
30|$|Cheatham {{pointed out}} that Eqs. (10) and (14) are, respectively, {{applicable}} for the loading and unloading processes. In the loading process, the pitch of the helix is variable but the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> is constrained by the wellbore. However, in the unloading process, the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> tends to lose contact with the wellbore but the pitch of the helix remains constant. Huang et al. (2015 a) verified Cheatham’s results from {{the view of the}} buckling differential equation and further {{pointed out that}} the contact force reaches its maximum value when Eq. (10) is satisfied and its minimum value when Eq. (14) is satisfied.|$|E
3000|$|To be specific, the {{amplitude}} A for sinusoidal buckling {{is calculated}} by introducing θ = Asin([...] ω· z) into the total potential energy equation for the continuous section {{and letting the}} total energy reach the minimum value ∂/∂ A = 0. With the critical stability condition ∂^ 2 /∂ A^ 2 = 0, the critical load F crs is obtained (Liu 1999; Gao and Miska 2009), which converts the initial straight configuration into sinusoidal buckling. Similar to the analysis in sinusoidal buckling, the helical buckling pitch p for a weightless <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> is deduced by introducing θ = 2 π/pz into Eq. (9) and letting ∂/∂ p = 0 (Lubinski and Althouse 1962). For a <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> with weight, the helical buckling solution is θ = 2 π/pz + Asin([...] 2 π/pz), which {{is more complicated than}} that for the weightless <b>tubular</b> <b>string,</b> whereas the solution process for the helical buckling fluctuation amplitude A is similar. Different from the stability criterion for sinusoidal buckling, the critical force F crs which converts sinusoidal buckling to helical buckling is deduced by letting Δ = 0, where Δ means the difference of total potential energy at the helical buckling and the initial configuration stages (Chen et al. 1990; Wu 1992; Cunha 1995).|$|E

30|$|Chen et al. (1990) first deduced the {{critical}} force to cause helical buckling {{with the energy}} method and stated that critical helical buckling load was \(\sqrt 2 \) times {{the critical}} sinusoidal buckling load. In Chen’s research, the axial force on the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> {{was assumed to be}} constant during the process from the starting of sinusoidal buckling to helical buckling. By assuming that the axial force increases linearly from the start of sinusoidal buckling to helical buckling, Wu (1992) refined Chen’s method and pointed out that Chen’s result was an average value of the critical sinusoidal and helical buckling loads. According to Wu, the critical helical buckling load is \(2 \sqrt 2 - 1 \) times the critical sinusoidal buckling load. Miska et al. (1996) assumed that the axial force increased linearly in the entire loading process and found that the critical helical buckling load was \(2 \sqrt 2 \) times the critical sinusoidal buckling load. Miska et al. (1996) also proved that the sinusoidal buckling configuration became unstable (\(\beta = 1.875 \)) before the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> changes to the helical buckling configuration. Therefore, the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> may be in a sinusoidal or helical buckling state when the axial force satisfies \(1.875 < \beta < 2 \sqrt 2 \). Cunha (1995) pointed out that there are two critical helical buckling loads, where the lower limit value is equal to Chen’s result and the upper limit is equal to Miska’s result. The upper limit means the minimum axial force causing helical buckling in the loading process, while the lower limit refers to the minimum axial force to keep the <b>tubular</b> <b>string</b> in the helical buckling stage for the unloading process. Mitchell (1997) obtained similar conclusions with the buckling differential equation. On the basis of previous studies, Gao et al. (2002) summarized the previous assumptions (Fig.  2) and considered that the axial force increases linearly in the sinusoidal buckling stage and then remains constant until the start of helical buckling based on experimental results.|$|E
