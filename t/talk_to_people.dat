5|$|If you <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> {{who perform}} a Burrakatha, {{you will see}} a huge {{difference}} in the way the older generation performs the art vis-à-vis the way the way the younger generation performs it... This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point we are making is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E
5|$|The {{control pad}} {{may be used}} to move the hero in any {{direction}} and to move the flashing cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people,</b> check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go up or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.|$|E

Chick heard from missionary Bob Hammond, who had broadcast in Asia on the Voice of America, that the Communist Party of China had gained significant influence among ordinary Chinese in the 1950s through the distribution of small comic books. Chick also began working with a prison ministry and created a flip chart of illustrations to use with his presentation. He hit upon the idea of creating witnessing tracts, which could be given to people directly or indirectly.|$|E
25|$|At an {{altitude}} of 400 feet above ground level, First Officer Poe suddenly spotted the Swift under the fuselage of the DC-6 {{but was unable to}} take evasive action, and the two aircraft collided. The airliner's flight crew continued the approach and landed without incident; the DC-6 was almost completely unscathed except for some minor damage to a fuselage-mounted radio antenna and the No. 4 propeller. Capt.

25|$|The Romanovs {{were placed}} in the Napolnaya School, on the fringe of the town. The school was small, {{consisting}} of only six rooms, the furniture basic but scanty. Each prisoner received an iron bed. They were allowed to move into the desolate former schoolrooms and sort out their living arrangements on their own. Grand Duke Sergei shared a room with Feodor Remez and Prince Paley. Although the captives were under the strict guard of the Red Army soldiers, they were allowed to walk in town, to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> and to go to church on feasts days. Preparing to spend a long time in Alapayevsk, they planted flowers and vegetable gardens near the school and spent many hours working there. On rainy days, the Romanovs read Russian novels to each other. Gradually, the regimen toughened and they were forbidden to take walks. The school was encircled with a barbed-wire fence and small trenches. Two weeks later, they were murdered.|$|E

500|$|People with AS {{may not be}} as {{withdrawn}} around others, {{compared with}} those with other, more debilitating forms of autism; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction. This social awkwardness has been called [...] "active but odd". This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive. However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display selective mutism, speaking not at all to most people and excessively to specific people. Some may choose only to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> they like.|$|E

500|$|Jagger {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock & roll" [...] by AllMusic and MSN, with Billboard sharing a similar sentiment calling him [...] "the rock and roll frontman". Musician David Bowie joined many rock bands with blues, folk and soul orientations in his first attempts as a musician in the mid-1960s, and he was to recall: [...] "I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger". Bowie would also offer that [...] "I think Mick Jagger would be astounded and amazed if he realized that to many people he is not a sex symbol, but a mother image." [...] Jagger appeared on Rolling Stone List of 100 Greatest Singers at number 16; in the article, Lenny Kravitz wrote: [...] "I sometimes <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> who sing perfectly in a technical sense who don't understand Mick Jagger. [...] His sense of pitch and melody is really sophisticated. His vocals are stunning, flawless in their own kind of perfection." [...] This edition also cites Mick Jagger as a key influence on Jack White, Steven Tyler and Iggy Pop.|$|E
500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{believe that in}} 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what {{has been described as}} a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a [...] high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law {{enforcement officers}} visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered the front door to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people,</b> but never stated there was a problem or attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.|$|E
500|$|The IWF {{said they}} were first {{notified}} of the Wikipedia URL on 4 December 2008. This followed the May 2008 reporting of the cover image on Wikipedia by U.S.-based social conservative site WorldNetDaily to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws. An officer of the Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented, [...] "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and paedophilia". EContent magazine subsequently reported that the discussion page associated with the article declared [...] "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed", and asserted that Wikipedia contributors [...] "favour inclusion {{in all but the}} most extreme cases". However, according to The Guardian because [...] "the IWF doesn't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> outside of the UK they weren't able to appreciate what was going on". Internet security expert Richard Clayton explained that [...] "We see this borderline stuff all the time; it's a no-win", before adding that the decision seems to have been based on taking the image out of context, particularly [...] "given that you can go into HMV and buy a copy on the high street". [...] On 9 December 2008 the IWF reversed its blacklist of the Wikipedia pages {{on the basis of the}} [...] "contextual issues involved in this specific case and, in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability".|$|E

He received little formal education as a youth, with his mother teaching him how to read. As a child, he much preferred to wander the streets of his neighborhood, and even beyond to meet and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people.</b> This led to his mother calling him “pata de perro” (lit. dog’s foot), which later became the title of his autobiography. His propensity to escape from the house even drove his mother to tie him to the bed, but he said that he always found a way to escape. As a young child he went as far as the air field that was in the Balbuena section of the city, selling gum to the aviators. He was adopted as a “mascot” and even given a ride in one of the planes when he was only six. At age seven, he hitchhiked his way to Veracruz [...]|$|E

He said that he does not condone the actions of either organisation: [...] "Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do?
