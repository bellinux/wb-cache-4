25|$|This kind {{of damage}} made life in Fort Jackson a misery when {{combined}} with constant flooding from high water within the fort. The crew could be safe from mortar fragments and falling debris only within <b>the</b> <b>dank</b> and partially flooded casemates. Lack of shelter, food, blankets, sleeping quarters, drinkable water, along with the depressing effects of days of heavy, unanswered shelling were hard to bear. When combined with sickness and the ever-present corrosive fear, conditions were definitely a drain on morale. These factors contributed to the mutiny of the Fort Jackson garrison on April 28. This mutiny began a subsequent collapse of resistance downriver from the city. Fort St. Phillips was also surrendered, the CSS Louisiana blown up and even the Confederate fleet on Lake Pontchartrain was destroyed to avoid capture. The general collapse of morale began with the mutiny and greatly simplified the occupation of New Orleans by the Union navy.|$|E

500|$|After the Germans {{suppressed}} the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, they sent Rejewski's {{wife and children}} west, along with other Warsaw survivors; the family eventually found refuge with her parents in Bydgoszcz. [...] Rejewski was discharged from the Polish Army in Britain on 15 November 1946. [...] Six days later, he returned to Poland {{to be reunited with}} his wife and family. [...] On his return, he was urged by his old Poznań University professor, Zdzisław Krygowski, to take a university mathematics post at Poznań or Szczecin, in western Poland. [...] Rejewski could have looked forward to rapid advancement because of personnel shortages {{as a result of the}} war. However, he was still recovering from rheumatism, which he had contracted in <b>the</b> <b>dank</b> Spanish prisons. Soon after his return to Poland, in the summer of 1947, his 11-year-old son Andrzej died of polio after only five days' illness. [...] After his son's death, Rejewski did not want to part, even briefly, with his wife and daughter, so they lived in Bydgoszcz with his in-laws. [...] Rejewski took a position in Bydgoszcz as director of the sales department at a cable-manufacturing company, Kabel Polski (Polish Cable).|$|E
2500|$|Hitman: Absolution {{received}} a generally positive reception. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 84.83% and 83/100, the Xbox 360 version 79.29% and 79/100 and the PC version 76.13% and 79/100, respectively. Positive reviews came from GamesRadar, calling it [...] "one {{of the strongest}} entries in the series to date", and Game Informer, who wrote that [...] "devising a strategy, using the environment and disguises to your advantage, and leaving before anyone knows you’re there are the hallmarks of a perfect hit, and Absolution proves Agent 47 is still gaming's premier hitman." [...] The Daily Mail gave the game a 4/5, with particular praise being given to the game's varied environments, of which they remarked that [...] "whether it's walking along the sun-kissed balcony of a beach-side villa, or exploring <b>the</b> <b>dank,</b> underground sewers below a nightclub, Absolution brings each world to life with remarkable aplomb." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{properties}} of the O-type, massive eclipsing binary 2 MASS J 13130841 - 6239275 located in the outskirts of <b>the</b> <b>Danks</b> 2 cluster in the G 305 star-forming complex, using near-infrared spectroscopy from VLT/ISAAC. We derive the masses and radii to be 24. 5 ± 0. 9 M_ and 9. 2 ± 0. 1 R_ for the primary and 21. 7 ± 0. 8 M_ and 8. 7 ± 0. 1 R_ for the secondary component. In addition, we evaluate the sensitivity of our parameters to the choice of the spectral features used to determine the radial velocities. Both components appear to be main-sequence O 6. 5 -O 7 type stars at an age of ∼ 5 Myr, which is in agreement with the age of the cluster. A high visual extinction of A_ 5495 = 11. 9 ± 0. 1 mag is reported, which is likely attributed to the cold molecular gas contaminating the north-east region of the cluster. By fitting the spectral energy distribution of the system to the available BVI_cJHK_s photometry, we determine a distance to the system of 3. 52 ± 0. 08 kpc with a precision of 2 %, which is the most well-determined distance to <b>the</b> <b>Danks</b> 2 cluster and the host complex reported in the literature.
