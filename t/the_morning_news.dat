5|$|Clint Grant {{was born}} in Nashville, Tennessee. During his time at Vanderbilt University, {{economic}} troubles {{brought on by the}} Great Depression forced Grant's family to move from Nashville; they settled in Dallas, Texas, where his father was asked to lead the Art Department at <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>News.</b> Grant got a job with the Photo Department, but he was drafted into the United States Army before he could report to work. Grant served during World War II in Europe, where he never used a camera.|$|E
5|$|Disorder {{spread across}} the {{province}} as large processions ignored section 144 and condemned {{the actions of the}} police. More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, to boycott offices and join the procession. Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the Jubilee Press and <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>News.</b> Police fired on a major janaza, or mourning rally, as it was passing through Nawabpur Road. The shooting killed several people including activist Sofiur Rahman and a nine-year-old boy named Ohiullah.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after {{completing}} The Road to Glory, Hawks began writing his next film, Fig Leaves, his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays {{a married couple}} by juxtaposing them in the Garden of Eden and in modern New York City. The Garden of Eden humorously depicts Adam and Eve awoken by a Flintstones-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>news</b> on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eve's gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy flapper and fashion model when Adam is at work. The film starred George O'Brien as Adam and Olive Borden as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks's first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, 22 May, Nansouty {{received}} his second cuirassier brigade, Doumerc's 2nd and 9th regiments. During the morning, having received some reinforcements, Napoleon sent Marshal Lannes's Corps forward, in an attack against the enemy line. Nansouty's and Lasalle's cavalry protected the infantry columns, charging the enemy cavalry to clear their path. However, at around 21:00 in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>news</b> that the great bridge over the Danube had broken, making the arrival of further reinforcements virtually impossible, forced Napoleon to call off his attack and order a phased retreat. The situation of the French army was critical, with Marshal Lannes fatally wounded, and a great number of losses in men. It took all the skill of Nansouty and the other cavalry commanders to contain the formidable Austrian onslaught in order to allow the rest of the army to gradually disengage. After most of the army had safely crossed an arm of the Danube onto the island of Lobau, Nansouty's men were also withdrawn from the battlefield during the night, with the French cavalry subsequently celebrated for their role in preventing a catastrophic defeat that day.|$|E

50|$|Breakfasts {{dominance}} {{was virtually}} unchallenged {{by the other}} networks until 2008, when TV3 launched Sunrise.

25|$|Despite the {{ownership}} change, channel 6 continued preempting ABC programming {{in favor of}} locally produced and syndicated shows. In 1975, when ABC entered <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>news</b> field with AM America, WPVI chose not to carry it, nor pick up AM Americas successor, Good Morning America in its entirety for nearly three years, choosing instead to carry Captain Noah and His Magical Ark {{in place of the}} second hour of GMA. WPVI-TV also did not run other ABC daytime programs, notably The Edge of Night and numerous sitcom reruns. ABC was able to get most of its daytime schedule on the air in Philadelphia anyway through contracts with independent stations WKBS-TV (channel 48) and WTAF-TV (channel 29).|$|E
25|$|The network {{operates}} a news division, Noticias Telemundo ("Telemundo News"), which produces a half-hour early evening flagship newscast, Noticiero Telemundo, that has aired daily {{for most of}} its run (Telemundo also produced a secondary newscast, Noticiero Telemundo Internacional, until 2011, which aired in place of late local newscasts on affiliates without their own news department or which opted to preempt regularly scheduled local newscasts on certain holidays). It also produces <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>news</b> and lifestyle program Un Nuevo Día ("A New Day"), the late afternoon newsmagazine series Al Rojo Vivo con Maria Celeste ("Red Hot Live with Maria Celeste") and the Sunday morning talk show Enfoque ("In Focus"); the network previously produced weekend editions of Al Rojo Vivo and Noticiero Telemundo until 2007, which were replaced with feature films and reality-based series; the latter returned to a daily broadcast with the restoration of Saturday and Sunday editions on September 4, 2014.|$|E
25|$|ABC's daytime {{schedule}} currently features {{talk shows}} The View and The Chew, and {{the soap opera}} General Hospital, the latter {{of which is the}} longest-running entertainment program {{in the history of the}} ABC television network, having aired since 1963.

In addition to the long-running All My Children (1970–2011) and One Life to Live (1968–2012), notable past soap operas seen on the daytime lineup include Ryan's Hope, Dark Shadows, Loving, The City and Port Charles. ABC also aired the last nine years of the Procter & Gamble-produced soap The Edge of Night, following its cancellation by CBS in 1975. ABC Daytime has also aired a number of game shows, including The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game, Let's Make a Deal, Password, Split Second, The $10,000/$20,000 Pyramid, Family Feud, The Better Sex, Trivia Trap, All-Star Blitz and Hot Streak.|$|E

25|$|Throughout its history, {{the station}} has always carried local news programming. Branded {{for years as}} Eyewitness News from 1974 to 1995, its newscasts were retitled as Fox 7 News from 1995 to 1998 {{following}} the affiliation switch to Fox. When WTVW joined Fox, news programming on the station was expanded to two hours on weekday mornings, along {{with the addition of}} a 5 p.m. newscast. Newscasts came and went, with the midday news being cancelled in the late 1990s, later followed by the 5 p.m. and finally, <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>news.</b> This eventually left only the 6 and 9 p.m. newscasts (the 10 p.m. news had earlier been moved into the 9 p.m. slot and expanded to an hour); however, the morning and midday newscasts returned in March 2002. In 2006, the weekday morning newscast expanded to three hours, the midday newscast moved to noon and a 6:30p.m. weeknight newscast was added to the schedule.|$|E
25|$|The {{simulcast}} {{from the}} BBC World Service begins at 01:00 and ends at 05:20 {{with a brief}} introduction from the early shift continuity announcer. The five-minute Radio 4 UK Theme composed by Fritz Spiegl followed this for 28 years until April 2006. It was replaced by an extension to the early news bulletin, despite public opposition and a campaign to save it. After a continuity link and programme trail there are a shipping forecast, weather reports from coastal stations for 04:00 GMT and the inshore waters forecasts, followed at 05:30 by a news bulletin, a review of British and international newspapers, and a business report. On weekdays at 05:45, Farming Today, which deals with news of relevance to the agricultural sector, is followed by Tweet of the Day, a 2-minute feature looking at different species of birds through their songs and calls. <b>The</b> <b>morning</b> <b>news</b> and current affairs sequence Today then runs for three hours from 06:00 to 09:00 on weekdays (for two hours from 07:00 on Saturdays).|$|E
