5|$|As {{promised by}} Fillmore, treaty commissioners arrived in La Pointe in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. Recalling {{the experiences of}} 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854. Ambiguity in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom he referred to as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and gather on all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and in failing health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs. He entrusted Armstrong with taking care of <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> the written version.|$|E
5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E
5|$|The town of Ludlow was {{increasingly}} fashionable and frequented by tourists, with the castle forming a particularly popular attraction. Thomas Warton published an edition of Milton's poems in 1785, describing Ludlow Castle and popularising the links to Comus, reinforcing the castle's {{reputation as a}} picturesque and sublime location. The castle became a topic for painters interested in these themes: J. M. W. Turner, Francis Towne, Thomas Hearne, Julius Ibbetson, Peter de Wint and William Marlowe all produced depictions of the castle during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, usually taking some artistic licence with <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> order to produce atmospheric works.|$|E

5|$|Xinhua News Agency {{published}} an article on 17 January 2016 stating that an individual {{by the name of}} Gui Minhai had been detained relating to a fatal traffic accident in December 2003 in which a schoolgirl died. Xinhua alleged that Gui Minhai (桂敏海), with a different but identical-sounding middle character with respect to Gui Minhai the publisher, had fled abroad under the guise of a tourist in November 2004 using a borrowed identity card following the court case; his stated age was 46 years in 2005 – a discrepancy of five years compared with <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> Gui's Swedish passport. The two discrepancies created doubts {{that there may have been}} a case of mistaken identity. Xinhua claimed that Gui gave himself up to public security officials in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|Clarkson's {{book had}} an {{important}} influence on the artist J. M. W. Turner, who displayed a painting at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1840 entitled The Slave Ship. The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> the painting, such as the shackles worn by the slaves, {{appear to have been}} influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book. The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The painting was admired by its owner, John Ruskin. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood {{as one of the few}} truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E
5|$|The census {{enumeration}} {{was carried}} out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school leavers and 8,400 census supervisors deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the enumerators. There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details about individual members of the family. When the respondent was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. <b>The</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by the proxy members, most of whom did not have full information about all the family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the enumerators. Compared to the form used during 2000 census enumeration, there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albimism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010. The enumeration was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining {{regions of the country}} were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011. OMR and ICR technologies were used for data processing.|$|E

25|$|Burns visited Wanlockhead in January 1792 {{to explore}} the lead mines. He was {{accompanied}} by Maria Riddell, Robert Riddell's sister. They breakfasted at Sanquhar and then took a poste-chaise to the mines. They went a considerable distance into the mines, braving the dark, wet and cramped conditions at first, however they had to turn back as Burns found the poor air very distressing. Burns did not record this visit, however Maria included <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> a letter.|$|E
25|$|Knox {{continued}} to show interest in psychology {{in his next}} article, also published in 1913.

Knox stated that for a period of time, he had listened to this man recount his delusions and wrote down <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> his notebook. After a period of time, the man appeared to recover; and Knox believed that by writing down his delusions, he had validated the patient which contributed to his improvement.|$|E
25|$|Ray casting is {{primarily}} used for realtime simulations, {{such as those}} used in 3D computer games and cartoon animations, where detail is not important, or where it is more efficient to manually fake <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> order to obtain better performance in the computational stage.

25|$|Hipparchus {{devised a}} {{geometrical}} method {{to find the}} parameters from three positions of the Moon, at particular phases of its anomaly. In fact, Ptolemy did this separately for the eccentric and the epicycle model. Ptolemy describes <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> the Almagest IV.11. Hipparchus used two sets of three lunar eclipse observations, which he carefully selected to satisfy the requirements. The eccentric model he fitted to these eclipses from his Babylonian eclipse list: 22/23December 383, 18/19June 382, and 12/13December 382. The epicycle model he fitted to lunar eclipse observations made in Alexandria at 22September 201, 19March 200, and 11September 200.|$|E
25|$|A 1995 book found further {{inconsistencies}} in Smith’s allegations; {{the authors found}} no newspaper record of the car crash that the book describes in the time frame described {{despite the fact that}} the local newspaper reported on all vehicle accidents at the time. Former neighbors, teachers and friends were interviewed and yearbooks from Smith’s elementary school were reviewed and found no indication of Smith being absent from school or missing for lengthy periods of time, including the alleged 81-day non-stop ceremony. Ultimately the book's authors were unable to find anyone who knew Smith in the 1950s who could corroborate any of <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> her allegations.|$|E
25|$|The Dragon Ball Super anime {{is being}} adapted into a {{companion}} manga illustrated by artist Toyotarou, who was previously {{responsible for the}} official Resurrection 'F manga adaptation.

25|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> Polo's {{accounts}} {{have been}} verified.

His claim is confirmed by a Chinese text of the 14th century explaining how a Sogdian named Mar-Sargis from Samarkand founded six Nestorian Christian churches there in addition to one in Hangzhou during the second half of the 13th century. Nestorian Christianity had existed in China since the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD) when a Persian monk named Alopen came to the capital Chang'an in 653 to proselytize, as described in a dual Chinese and Syriac language inscription from Chang'an (modern Xi'an) dated to the year 781.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian {{had a great}} {{passion for}} armour, not only as {{equipment}} for battle or tournaments, but as an art form. The style of armour that became popular {{during the second half}} of his reign featured elaborate fluting and metalworking, and became known as Maximilian armour. It emphasized <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> the shaping of the metal itself, rather than the etched or gilded designs popular in the Milanese style. Maximilian also gave a bizarre jousting helmet as a gift to King Henry VIII – the helmet's visor featured a human face, with eyes, nose and a grinning mouth, and was modelled after the appearance of Maximilian himself. It also sported a pair of curled ram's horns, brass spectacles, and even etched beard stubble.|$|E
25|$|After the {{proposals}} for a tunnel died out in 1970, there remained two critical groups against the project: {{those who were}} in favor of the bridge, but critical to <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> the plan, and those who were opposed to a bridge and wanted to keep the ferry service. The former group was largely concerned about the choice of the outer route, rather than the inner crossing to Kvarven. The latter would give a significantly shorter route to the city center, and the same driving distance to places south of Bergen, including Bergen Airport, Flesland. Another issue was that there was not a sufficient road network in Bergen to handle the traffic from the bridge. Starting in late 1970, a petition was created demanding a referendum about which crossing should be chosen. The issue was discussed in the municipal council on 23 April, and was dismissed with five votes in favor of a referendum.|$|E
