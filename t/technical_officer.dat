5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, chief <b>technical</b> <b>officer</b> of Opera Software and {{creator of the}} widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief <b>Technical</b> <b>Officer</b> at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E
5|$|Cross {{started at}} Sandhurst in 1969 and was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Army Ordnance Corps {{as a second}} lieutenant on 30 July 1971. His first tour was in West Germany, with the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in 1971, after which he undertook an in-service degree at the Royal Military College of Science (now part of the Defence College of Management and Technology). He was promoted to lieutenant in 1973. Having graduated as a Bachelor of Science in 1975, he served a tour with 22 Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery, with responsibility for the regiment's new Rapier missiles. Promoted to captain in 1977, {{he went on to}} train as an Ammunition <b>Technical</b> <b>Officer</b> (ATO) and was posted to Northern Ireland in 1978, where he was involved in explosive ordnance disposal along with inspection duties.|$|E

40|$|M. Ed. It is of outmost {{importance}} that <b>technical</b> <b>officers</b> in Telkom are effective technological problem solvers. All prospective <b>technical</b> <b>officers</b> in Telkom {{are subjected to}} a selection process before starting with <b>technical</b> <b>officer's</b> training. The selecting process consists of two stages, namely: (1) the Senior Aptitude Test (SAT), and (2) the Introduction to the A-course. The problem statement of this study is: No scientific investigation is done {{on the effect of}} the Introduction to the A-course on the technological problem-solving style of prospective <b>technical</b> <b>officers.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the effect of the Introduction to A-course on the technological problem-solving style of prospective <b>technical</b> <b>officers,</b> when measured with the PSI-TECH inventory. The PSI-TECH inventory (technological problem-solving in-ventory) is used as a pre-test and a post-test to measure the technological problem-solving styles of 119 prospective <b>technical</b> <b>officers</b> in Telkom. The Introduction to the A-course (independent variable) serves as the treatment. In the process of measuring technological problem-solving style, differentiation occurs between effective and ineffective technological problem solvers. The PSI-TECH inventory performed very well in terms of reliability and validity in this study. Two conclusions were drawn from this case study, namely: (1) the Introduction to the A-course does not contribute towards the technological problem-solving styles of prospective <b>technical</b> <b>officers</b> and, (2) the PSI-TECH inventory can serve as a discriminator to determine who are effective and ineffective technological problem-solvers...|$|R

5|$|In mid-1946, McAloney was {{involved}} in an investigation {{into a series of}} engine failures experienced by RAAF aircraft. The inquiry led him to visit operational and transport units throughout Australia, in an attempt to determine whether the issues were the result of substandard maintenance or defective components. He returned to his duties at the Directorate of Technical Services on the investigation's conclusion. Made squadron leader in March 1950, he attended a land/air warfare course the following year. McAloney was posted to Singapore in June 1952 as the <b>technical</b> <b>officer</b> to the Changi-based No.90 (Composite) Wing, formed specifically for service in the Malayan Emergency. The attachment proved short lived with the disbandment of No.90 Wing in December, at which point McAloney transferred to No.1 Squadron, then operating out of Tengah.|$|E
5|$|The next day, 21 January 1944, Sayn-Wittgenstein, {{wireless}} operator Ostheimer {{and board}} mechanic Unteroffizier Kurt Matzuleit {{took off on}} a Zahme Sau (Tame Boar), a combination of ground controlled and airborne radar, night fighter intercept mission flying the Ju88R4+XM (Werknummer 750 467—factory number), which normally {{was assigned to the}} <b>Technical</b> <b>Officer</b> of NJG2. At 22:00 contact with the first of five Lancasters was established and shot down which was observed to explode at 22:05. Between 22:10 and 22:15 the second Lancaster was shot down. Observers reported the third Lancaster exploded at approximately 22:30, followed shortly by number four, which hit the ground at 22:40. During the fifth and final attack, the four-engined bomber was burning when their Ju 88 came under attack, presumably from British fighter escorts. In the attack, their left wing caught fire. Sayn-Wittgenstein ordered his crew to jump, and Ostheimer and Matzuleit parachuted to safety from the damaged aircraft.|$|E
5|$|McAloney {{sufficiently}} recovered {{to return}} to his work in the RAAF, and during the Second World War was primarily involved in engine repair and engineering staff work in Australia. Commissioned as a flying officer in 1942, he saw service in Dutch New Guinea during late 1944. He received a permanent commission in the RAAF in 1948, and was advanced to squadron leader in 1950. During the Malayan Emergency, he served as <b>technical</b> <b>officer</b> to both No.90 Wing and No.1 Squadron, based in Singapore. In 1960, he was made Officer Commanding Engineering Squadron at the Aircraft Research and Development Unit, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his efforts in the post. McAloney retired in 1966 with the honorary rank of group captain. In 1971, the Albert Medal was discontinued and living recipients of the decoration were invited to exchange their medal for the George Cross; McAloney took up the offer and formally became a recipient of the latter. He died in 1995 at the age of 85.|$|E
