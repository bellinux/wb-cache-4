5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted <b>their</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, the Massachusetts Bay Colony's first {{governor}} John Winthrop led {{the signing}} of the Cambridge Agreement, a key founding document of the city. Puritan ethics and <b>their</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> education influenced its early history; America's first public school was founded in Boston in 1635. Over the next 130 years, the city participated in four French and Indian Wars, until the British defeated the French and their Indian allies in North America. Boston was the largest town in British America until Philadelphia grew larger in the mid-18th century.|$|E

5|$|Paintings by Bellette {{were among}} those of twelve Australian artists {{included}} in the 1953 Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition in London, five regional British cities, and at the Venice Biennale. Bellette {{was one of only}} two women represented, the other being Constance Stokes. As with her Sulman prize-winners, Bellette's subjects were classically themed works: Electra (1944) and Oedipus (1945). Arts Council chairman Kenneth Clark was disappointed with the response of British critics to the exhibition, and <b>their</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a theme of nationhood paid little regard to the works of Bellette and several others.|$|E
5|$|Students {{moved into}} the center on May 8, 1987. The school {{remained}} unfinished, but the dormitory levels had been completed. Students had formerly been housed at Kibbutz Ramat Rachel. In 1988, before the center's dedication, a few Jerusalem locals complained that {{the arrangement of the}} windows at night looked like a Christian cross. The center purchased blinds and carefully arranged them over the windows so that no such sign would be seen. Members of the LDS Church do not use the symbol of the cross as other Christian denominations do, due to <b>their</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the resurrection, rather than the death, of Christ.|$|E
5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased <b>their</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.|$|E

5|$|Jan Wiley {{was cast}} as Scott's wife, Virginia. Although Wiley had {{appeared}} in several movies throughout the 1930s and 1940s, The Brute Man marked one of her final film performances. It was also recalled {{as one of her}} most memorable film appearances along with another Universal Pictures B horror film, She-Wolf of London. However, her performance in The Brute Man proved to be a less than memorable one for her, so much so that in an interview shortly before Wiley's death in 1993, she could barely remember even having appeared in the film. Donald MacBride and Peter Whitney portray the police officers Captain M.J. Donelly and Lieutenant Gates, respectively. Their roles serve as comic relief for the film. Their characters portray the incompetence of the police force in their inability to find and arrest the Creeper and <b>their</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> passing blame for their failures rather than diverting resources toward his arrest.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland began between 1166 and 1171, under first Richard de Clare and then Henry II of England, with {{the occupation of}} southern and eastern Ireland {{by a number of}} Anglo-Norman barons. The rapid Norman success depended on key economic and military advantages, with castles enabling them to control the newly conquered territories. The new lords rapidly built castles to protect their possessions, many of these were motte-and-bailey constructions; in Louth at least 23 of these were built. It remains uncertain how many ringwork castles were built in Ireland by the Anglo-Normans. Other castles, such as Trim and Carrickfergus, were built in stone as the caput centres for major barons. Analysis of these stone castles suggests that building in stone was not simply a military decision; indeed, several of the castles contain serious defensive flaws. Instead the designs, including <b>their</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> large stone keeps, were intended both to increase the prestige of the baronial owners and to provide adequate space for the administrative apparatus of the new territories. Unlike in Wales the indigenous Irish lords do not appear to have constructed their own castles in any significant number during the period.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutions of 1989 and the {{dissolution}} of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and <b>their</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the continent of Europe. This shift started with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe between NATO and the Soviet Union, which mandated specific military reductions across the continent that continued after {{the dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in December 1991. At that time, European countries accounted for 34 percent of NATO's military spending; by 2012, this had fallen to 21 percent. NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous Central and Eastern European nations, and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns.|$|E
