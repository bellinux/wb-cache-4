Two <b>thirds</b> of all persons with dysglycemia are prediabetic; two <b>thirds</b> of all persons with diabetes are diagnosed to have the condtion; and two <b>thirds</b> are diagnosed {{before the age of}} 50 years. Two <b>thirds</b> of people with diabetes have concomitant hypetension or dyslipidemia; two <b>thirds</b> do not get their HbA 1 c assessed; and two <b>thirds</b> of those who do, do not achiev target values. Yet, two <b>thirds</b> of people with diabetes report satisfactory psychosocial health and quality of life, and adherence to dietary therapy and medication. Only one <b>thirds</b> adhere to exercise and self monitoring advice, however. Two <b>thirds</b> of persons on oral glucose lowering drugs receive metformin; two <b>thirds</b> of those on insulin receive premixed insulin or twice daily isnuslin, and a similar proportion uses pens for delivery. Thus, the rule of two <b>thirds,</b> rather than of halves, operates in modern Indian diabetes practice...|$|R

Several of the Four <b>Thirds</b> lenses focus on Micro Four <b>Thirds</b> proficiently when an electrically compatible adapter is used on the Micro Four <b>Thirds</b> cameras, and they focus on Micro Four <b>Thirds</b> cameras much quicker than earlier generation Four <b>Thirds</b> lenses can.|$|R
