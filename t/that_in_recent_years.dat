25|$|It {{has been}} alleged by British ROCOR clergy that {{the diocese of}} Sourozh failed to expand to meet the spiritual needs of newly arrived Orthodox Christians from Russia who lived {{in areas of the}} United Kingdom in which the diocese did not have parishes or communities.

Other wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson note <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> overproduction has introduced a lot of variable quality with some Sancerre blancs producing flavor profiles that are not that much different from generic Sauvignon de Touraine from the Middle Loire, though this varies depending on the producer and overall quality of the vintage.|$|E

25|$|A tape ball is {{a tennis}} ball wrapped in {{electrical}} tape and is used in playing street cricket. This modification of the tennis ball gives it greater weight, speed and distance while still being easier to play with than the conventional cricket ball. The variation was pioneered in Karachi, Pakistan and is credited with Pakistan's famous production of fast bowlers as children are brought up playing the game using a tape ball in which various skills are developed. The increasing popularity of the tape ball in informal, local cricket has transformed the way games are played in cricket-loving nations such as India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh but most famously Pakistan. Such has been the impact of tape ball <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> some companies have introduced tennis balls designed to act like cricket balls.

He said that Islam is the current fastest growing religion in the world and has a major role and contribution to mankind and civilization. The core value of Islam is {{that there is only one}} God, people should do good deeds and people should love their fellow men and citizens. He personally believes that Taiwanese Muslims must emphasize the principle of Islam that stresses peace and love in order to enable others to understand the true nature of Islam. He further added <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years,</b> Taiwan has made significant progress in expanding affairs with the Muslim world, creating a win-win situation for all parties involved and also triggering more interest in Islam among Taiwanese people. Although there are only around 60,000 Taiwanese Muslims, this community has made Taiwan becomes more diverse and richer in culture. He assured to the local Muslims that the Muslim people in Taiwan will always enjoy religious freedom and that the government will pay close attention to any raising needs to the group. He also hoped that Taiwanese Muslims will participate in Islamic-related international affairs and play even more role in helping Taiwan solidifies itself with the Islamic nations.|$|E

500|$|..... a basic {{principle}} of triage {{is to treat}} victims having the most life-threatening injuries first with available medical resources and to utilize limited medical personnel {{in a manner that}} will provide maximum effectiveness.

They survived after periods of underwater, including sea water, as long as one hour or more. In view of these facts, the Safety Board believes that all emergency response organizations should review their emergency plans to include contingencies for applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques as soon as a sufficient number of trained personnel arrive to perform CPR, even during mass casualty/triage incidents, regardless of whether vital signs are present, especially if cold-water immersion/near drowning is involved and where traumatic injuries do not indicate death.|$|E
500|$|Most historians today, {{including}} John's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, {{argue that}} John was an unsuccessful monarch, but note that his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers.

John Gillingham, {{author of a}} major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren, and describes him [...] "one of the worst kings ever to rule England". Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults.
