The reviewer from The Otaku's Study found the English voice-acting for the female characters to be strong, and that she [...] "portrayed the innocent character role effectively." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the book, rock critic Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "The way [...] describes the songs he loves... is tremendously suggestive. If only he or some acolyte could spin a worldview around those observations, we might really have something to go on." [...] Musician Stephin Merritt wrote that Miller [...] "manages actual humor (a first in music criticism) and major insights that may change <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about, for example, 1967. Almost a new art form." [...] In a book review in Ugly Things magazine, Miller was described as [...] "a sort of fourth-generation rock and roll renaissance man capable of making the printed page jump and sing as deftly as the complex conversations that his Les Paul conducts with a Marshall stack." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN Australia awarded Spore a 9.2 out of 10 score, saying, [...] "It [...] {{will make}} you {{acknowledge}} just how far we've come, and just how far we have to go, and Spore will change <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the universe we live in." [...] PC Gamer UK awarded the game a 91%, saying [...] "Spores triumph is painfully ironic. By setting out to instill a sense of wonderment at creation and the majesty of the universe, it's shown us that it's actually a lot more interesting to sit here at our computers and explore the contents of each other's brains." [...] In its 4.5 (of 5) -star review, GameSpy wrote [...] "Spore is a technological triumph that introduces {{a whole new way}} of tapping into a bottomless well of content." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 6, 2011, Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton {{gave his}} first {{interview}} {{about the case}} on The View. Ashton said of the verdict, [...] "Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted. But {{from the perspective of}} what we do, this was a fantastic case." [...] He disagrees with those who state the prosecution overcharged the case, saying, [...] "The facts that we had... this was first-degree murder. I think it all came down to the evidence. I think ultimately it came down to the cause of death." [...] Ashton additionally explained that if the jury did not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with the duct tape, [...] "then so be it". He said he accepts the jury's decision and that it has not taken away his faith in the justice system. [...] "You can't believe in {{the rule of law and}} not accept that sometimes it doesn't go <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it should", stated Ashton, and explained that he understands why the case [...] "struck such a nerve" [...] with the public. [...] "I think when people see someone that they believe has so gone away from , it just outrages them." [...] Ashton also made appearances on several other talk shows in the days following, and complimented Jose Baez on his cross-examinations and as having [...] "the potential to be a great attorney".|$|E
6000|$|... "All I have to say," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Cliff, who {{had been}} listening intently to Mr. Burke's extraordinary flow of words, [...] "all I have to say is, if that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about her, you ought to speak to her." ...|$|E

"That {{the last}} is true, Señor, I will swear myself, having held the tiller in mine own hands {{no small part}} of <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Señor Don Almirante, that we have come far enough in this {{direction}} to have got to {{the back side of}} the earth, or to stand, as it might be, under the very feet of Spain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes,” he said; “but not in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> mean. She {{was my best}} friend’s sweetheart, {{and nothing}} to me. No doubt she has married him by now.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Mrs. Halliday, [...] "I suppose I did mean this, {{but perhaps}} not {{altogether}} in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> There is a rude vein in the Dearhams that comes to the surface now and then. One hardly noted it in Joseph, but in Bernard it's rather marked. I imagine he has some sympathy for Jim's extravagances. This may have its influence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{thinking}} about him and his work," [...] Joan answered. Her hand sought Hilda's and held it. [...] "There are things you don't understand. Men and women can't help each other in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> They may try to, and mean no harm in the beginning, but the harm comes, and then not only the woman but the man also suffers, and his work is spoilt and his life ruined." ...|$|E
50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts you think about the way you think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (the thoughts you think about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think),</b> and Fourth Thoughts (the thoughts you think about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think).</b> All these thoughts sometimes cause Tiffany to walk into door frames.|$|E
5000|$|With Varrays {{you need}} to {{understand}} that the word [...] "variable" [...] in the phrase [...] "variable-size arrays" [...] doesn't apply {{to the size of the}} array in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> might <b>think</b> that it would. The size the array is declared with is in fact fixed. The number of elements in the array is variable up to the declared size. Arguably then, variable-sized arrays aren't that variable in size.|$|R

"By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> mustn't <b>think</b> only of gold; silver is, after all, {{the chief}} {{source of the}} riches of Peru, and there are numbers of {{extraordinarily}} rich mines. It is calculated that three hundred millions have been produced since the first occupation by the Spaniards. Quicksilver is also very abundant; copper and lead are found too, {{but there is not}} much to be done with them at present, owing to the cost of carriage.

60|$|During {{the whole}} of that evening Roger Carbury hardly spoke to his cousin Hetta. There was not much {{conversation}} between them till quite late, when Father Barham came in for supper.

500|$|President of Congress John Hancock sent a {{broadside}} to General George Washington, instructing {{him to have}} it proclaimed [...] "at the Head of the Army in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>think</b> it most proper". Washington had the Declaration read to {{his troops}} in New York City on July 9, with thousands of British troops on ships in the harbor. Washington and Congress hoped that the Declaration would inspire the soldiers, and encourage others to join the army. After hearing the Declaration, crowds in many cities tore down and destroyed signs or statues representing royal authority. An equestrian statue of King George in New York City was pulled down and the lead used to make musket balls.|$|R
