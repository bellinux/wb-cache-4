They are unable to keep {{themselves}} entertained and take their frustrations out on Meg as usual. But, having dealt with their abuse for years, Meg finally turns on them, starting with Chris for mistreating her with hurtful comments. Tired of her outburst, Lois tries to tell Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else, but Meg brings up Lois's past and tells her that she is [...] "the furthest thing from" [...] the perfect mother. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns eighteen, she is considering never seeing her again. Lois is reduced to tears and profusely apologizes to Meg. Meg then confronts Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing until she calls him a [...] "waste of a man." [...] Within moments, Peter, Lois and Chris turn their abusive criticisms on each other. Peter then runs away to his room crying, leaving Meg and Brian to discuss what just happened. Despite Brian complimenting her for standing up for herself, Meg concludes that her family cannot survive without a [...] "lightning rod" [...] to absorb its dysfunction, and that her enduring her family's antagonism helps keep them together. She then decides to apologize to her family and lies that she was taking her own problems out on everyone, restoring their egos and original opinions. Stewie then breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience about the dangers of drugs: [...] "Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use, but <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> it's no laughing matter.

2500|$|Early Dublin is also {{referred}} to {{in a number of}} native sources. The Book of Invasions, a largely fabulous compilation of myths and legends, mentions Dublin when describing how two legendary kings of Ireland, Conn of the Hundred Battles and Mug Nuadat, divided the country between them. The line of demarcation, which cut the island into two symbolic halves (known as Leth Cuinn, or [...] "Conn's Half", and Leth Moga, or [...] "Mug's Half") ran along the Esker Riada from High Street in Dublin to Galway on the west coast. According to another work which draws on early sources, the Annals of the Four Masters, Fiachu Sraibtine, the king of Tara, quelled the rebellious inhabitants of Leinster in a battle fought at Dublin in 291 AD; the Annals of Dublin also record that Alphin mac Eochaid, King of Dublin, was converted to Christianity by Saint Patrick in 448 AD. But these entries were only added to the Annals, or the sources from which they were compiled, many centuries after the events they purport to record, and no reliance can be placed on them. <b>The</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that we do not know for certain when the city of Dublin was founded.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson {{wanted to}} {{purchase}} the Ford GT after admiring its inspiration, the Ford GT40 race cars of the 1960s. Clarkson was able to secure {{a place on the}} shortlist for the few cars that would be imported to Britain to official customers, only through knowing Ford's head of PR through a previous job. After waiting years and facing an increased price, he found many technical problems with the car. After [...] "the most miserable month's motoring possible," [...] he returned it to Ford for a full refund. After a short period, including asking Top Gear fans for advice over the Internet, he bought back his GT. He called it [...] "the most unreliable car ever made", because he was never able to complete a return journey with it. In 2006, Clarkson ordered a Gallardo Spyder and sold the Ford GT to make way for it. In August 2008, he sold the Gallardo because [...] "idiots in Peugeots kept trying to race [...] in it". In October, he announced that he had sold his Volvo XC90. In January 2009, in a review of the car printed in The Times, he wrote: [...] "Iâ€™ve just bought my third Volvo XC90 in a row and <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> this: it takes six children to school in the morning." ...|$|E

This fire had been partially returned, the whole concluding with the finale from the Irishman's gun, as has been related. As it was now too light to apprehend a surprise, and {{the ground in front of}} the palisade had no very dangerous covers, Robert Willoughby was emboldened to send one of the Plinys to request an interview with his father.

40|$|A {{theory of}} optimal {{orthogonal}} fractions is developed for Fourier regression models using integer lattice designs. These provide alternatives to simple grids (product designs) {{in the case}} when specified main effects and interaction terms are required to be analysed. The challenge is to obtain sample sizes which are polynomial in the dimension rather than exponential. This is achieved for certain models with special algorithms based on both special algebraic generation and more direct sequential search, which will be called linear. 1 Introduction In the paper by Bates, Buck, Riccomagno and Wynn (1995) <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> mentioned that certain integer lattice designs (see below for the definition) are D [...] optimal {{in the sense of}} Kiefer and Wolfowitz for Fourier regression models.

That is the point I wish to show you, and of {{that there can be no}} dispute. Whether or not Christianity be the purer for lacking the service of art, is disputable--and I do not mean now to begin the dispute; but that art is the impurer for not being in the service of Christianity, is indisputable, and that is the main point I have now to do with.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{although}} it was very natural that the board, of all people in the world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling {{on the part of}} anybody, they were rather out, in this particular instance. <b>The</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was,</b> that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received. He heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had his luggage put into his hand--which was not very difficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep--he pulled his cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble's coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.|$|R

60|$|Observe, {{it is not}} now the {{question}} whether our Northern cathedrals are better with color or without. Perhaps the great monotone gray of Nature and of Time is a better color than any that the human hand can give; but that is nothing to our present business. <b>The</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> that the builders of those cathedrals laid upon them the brightest colors they could obtain, {{and that there is}} not, as far as I am aware, in Europe, any monument of a truly noble school which has not been either painted all over, or vigorously touched with paint, mosaic, and gilding in its prominent parts. Thus far Egyptians, Greeks, Goths, Arabs, and mediaeval Christians all agree: none of them, when in their right senses, ever think of doing without paint; and, therefore, when I said above that the Venetians were the only people who had thoroughly sympathized with the Arabs in this respect, I referred, first, to their intense love of color, which led them to lavish the most expensive decorations on ordinary dwelling-houses; and, secondly, to that perfection of the color-instinct in them, which enabled them to render whatever they did, in this kind, as just in principle as it was gorgeous in appliance. It is this principle of theirs, as distinguished from that of the Northern builders, which we have finally to examine.|$|E
60|$|While {{the epic}} mania, while {{the idea that}} to merit in poetry {{prolixity}} is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying {{out of the public}} mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies combined. I allude to the heresy of The Didactic. It has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate object of all Poetry is Truth. Every poem, it is said, should inculcate a morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged. We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we Bostonians very especially have developed it in full. We have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem's sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force:--but <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem's sake.|$|E
60|$|So {{far as to}} {{external}} sanctions. The internal sanction of duty, whatever our standard of duty may be, is one and the same--a feeling in our own mind; a pain, more or less intense, attendant on violation of duty, which in properly cultivated moral natures rises, in the more serious cases, into shrinking from it as an impossibility. This feeling, when disinterested, and connecting itself with the pure idea of duty, and not with some particular form of it, or {{with any of the}} merely accessory circumstances, is the essence of Conscience; though in that complex phenomenon as it actually exists, <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> in general all encrusted over with collateral associations, derived from sympathy, from love, and still more from fear; from all the forms of religious feeling; from the recollections of childhood and of all our past life; from self-esteem, desire of the esteem of others, and occasionally even self-abasement. This extreme complication is, I apprehend, the origin of the sort of mystical character which, by a tendency of the human mind of which there are many other examples, is apt to be attributed to the idea of moral obligation, and which leads people to believe that the idea cannot possibly attach itself to any other objects than those which, by a supposed mysterious law, are found in our present experience to excite it. Its binding force, however, consists in the existence of a mass of feeling which must be broken through in order to do what violates our standard of right, and which, if we do nevertheless violate that standard, will probably have to be encountered afterwards in the form of remorse. Whatever theory we have of the nature or origin of conscience, this is what essentially constitutes it.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} limitation to {{the usefulness}} of security lighting <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> that it <b>is</b> only useful at night.

60|$|Not {{that the}} poets or the players had any {{conscious}} intention of demoralising their hearers, {{any more than}} they had of correcting them. We will lay on them the blame of no special malus animus: but, at the same time, we must treat their fine words about 'holding a mirror up to vice,' and 'showing the age its own deformity,' as mere cant, which the men themselves must have spoken tongue in cheek. It was as much an insincere cant in those days as it was when, two generations later, Jeremy Collier exposed its falsehood in the mouth of Congreve. If the poets had really intended to show vice its own deformity, they would have represented it (as Shakspeare always does) as punished, and not as triumphant. It is ridiculous to talk of moral purpose in works {{in which there is no}} moral justice. The only condition which can excuse the representation of evil is omitted. <b>The</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that the poets wanted to draw a house; that this could most easily be done by the coarsest and most violent means; and that not being often able to find stories exciting enough in the past records of sober English society, they went to Italy and Spain for the violent passions and wild crimes of southern temperaments, excited, and yet left lawless, by a superstition believed in enough to darken and brutalise, but not enough to control, its victims. Those were the countries which just then furnished that strange mixture of inward savagery with outward civilisation, which is the immoral playwright's fittest material; because, while the inward savagery moves the passions of the audience, the outward civilisation brings the character near enough to them to give them a likeness of themselves in their worst moments, such as no 'Mystery of Cain' or 'Tragedy of Prometheus' can give.|$|E

60|$|One of {{the first}} of these is the fact, {{generally}} lost sight of by those who censure the Anglo-Saxon novel for its prudishness, that it is really not such a prude after all; and that if it is sometimes apparently anxious to avoid those experiences of life not spoken of before young people, this may be an appearance only. Sometimes a novel which has this shuffling air, this effect of truckling to propriety, might defend itself, if it could speak for itself, by saying that such experiences happened not to come within its scheme, and that, so far from maiming or mutilating itself in ignoring them, it was all the more faithfully representative of the tone of modern life in dealing with love that was chaste, and with passion so honest that it could be openly spoken of before the tenderest society bud at dinner. It might say that the guilty intrigue, the betrayal, the extreme flirtation even, was the exceptional thing in life, and unless the scheme of the story necessarily involved it, that it would be bad art to lug it in, and as bad taste as to introduce such topics in a mixed company. It could say very justly that the novel in our civilization now always addresses a mixed company, and {{that the vast majority of}} the company are ladies, and that very many, if not most, of these ladies are young girls. If the novel were written for men and for married women alone, as in continental Europe, it might be altogether different. But <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that it is not written for them alone among us, and it is a question of writing, under cover of our universal acceptance, things for young girls to read which you would be put out-of-doors for saying to them, or of frankly giving notice of your intention, and so cutting yourself off from the pleasure--and it is a very high and sweet one of appealing to these vivid, responsive intelligences, which are none the less brilliant and admirable because they are innocent.|$|E
