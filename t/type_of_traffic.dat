25|$|Intersection sight {{distance}} is the {{sight distance}} needed to safely proceed through an intersection. The distance needed {{depends on the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> control at the intersection (uncontrolled, yield sign, stop sign or signal), and the maneuver (left turn, right turn, or proceeding straight). All-way stop intersections need the least, and uncontrolled intersections require the most. Intersection sight distance is {{a key factor in}} whether no control or yield control can be safely used, or more restrictive control in needed.|$|E

2500|$|The British South Africa Company was {{responsible}} for building the Rhodesian railway system {{in the period of}} primary construction which ended in 1911, when the main line through Northern Rhodesia reached the Congo border and the Katanga copper mines. Rhodes' original intention was for a railway extending across the Zambesi to Lake Tanganyika, popularly considered as part of a great [...] "Cape to Cairo" [...] railway linking all the British colonies of Africa. Rhodes was as much a capitalist in his motivation as a visionary, and when little gold was found in Mashonaland, he accepted that even the scheme to reach Lake Tanganyika had no economic justification. Railways built by private companies without government subsidies need enough of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> that can pay high freight rates to recover their construction costs. The agricultural products that fuelled much of Rhodesia's early economic growth could not provide this traffic; large quantities of minerals could. Most early railways in Africa were built by the British government rather than Chartered Companies. The need to raise capital and produce dividends prevented most Chartered Companies from undertaking such infrastructure investments. However, in the early period of railway construction, the BSAC obtained finance from South African companies including Consolidated Gold Fields and De Beers in which Rhodes was a dominant force. BSAC also benefitted from the large, but not unlimited personal fortunes of Rhodes and Beit before their deaths.|$|E

30|$|Radio channel {{reservation}} is used {{to alleviate}} call dropping which may occur in two situations: (i) hand-off between cells in cellular networks, and (ii) channel withdrawal in wireless networks with spectrum leasing. In this article, we study a radio resource reservation scheme for heterogeneous traffic in a cellular network with spectrum leasing, in which one reservation pool {{is used to}} alleviate the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> call droppings. Since different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> have different tolerances to the exhaustion of channels, it is critical for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> to select the optimal size of the reservation pool such that the channel requirements <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> are satisfied while throughput is maximized. A three-dimensional Markov chain is presented to find the optimal size of reservation pool. Numerical and simulation results show that (i) the selected parameters of reservation satisfy the quality-of-service requirements <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> while produce high throughput, and (ii) channel withdrawal yields higher impact on real-time traffic than non-real-time <b>traffic</b> in terms <b>of</b> throughput.|$|R
