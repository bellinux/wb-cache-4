25|$|The war led to {{independence}} for Cuba {{within a few}} years. The United States imposed a colonial government on the Philippines, quashing the young Philippine Republic. This led directly to the Philippine–American War, a brutal guerilla conflict that caused the deaths of about 4,100 Americans and 12,000 to 20,000 Filipino guerilla and regular troops. Another 200,000 to 1,500,000 Filipino civilian deaths occurred. However, the conflict brought William Howard Taft {{to the attention of}} President Theodore Roosevelt, and led to Taft's ascension to the U.S. presidency in 1908. The American presence in the Philippines still existed at the beginning of World War II. Along with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>experience</b> in the Philippines {{at the start of the}} war (the Philippines Campaign, the Bataan Death March, the Battle of Corregidor) became another formative episode in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>experience</b> and rehabilitated the career of General Douglas MacArthur.|$|E
25|$|In {{her book}} Stilwell and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Experience</b> in China, 1911-45, Barbara Tuchman wrote that Stilwell was sacrificed as a {{political}} expedient because of his inability {{to get along with}} his allies in the theater. Some historians, such as David Halberstam in his final book, , have theorized that Roosevelt was concerned that Chiang would sign a separate peace with Japan, which would free many Japanese divisions to fight elsewhere, and that Roosevelt wanted to placate Chiang. The power struggle over the China Theater that emerged between Stilwell, Chennault, and Chiang reflected the American political divisions of the time.|$|E
25|$|Much of America’s aesthetic, economic, {{and social}} history {{is found in}} works on paper, a {{category}} that includes drawings, prints, and watercolors. The ACMAA began to actively collect works on paper in 1967. The collection today numbers several thousand items by noted artists of the {{nineteenth and twentieth centuries}} to the present. Drawings and paintings range from preliminary studies to fully realized compositions. Most nineteenth-century prints originated as reproductions intended for dissemination to the public and depict subjects relevant to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>experience.</b> Twentieth-century and later prints are fine art prints made by a variety of processes as a means of artistic self-expression.|$|E

25|$|Arguably, had Stilwell {{been given}} the number of American regular {{infantry}} divisions he had continually requested, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>experience</b> in China and Burma would have been very different. Certainly, his Army peers, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Gen. George Marshall had the highest respect for his abilities, and both saw he replaced Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. as commander of Tenth U.S. Army at Okinawa after the latter's death. During the last year of the war, however, the U.S. was strained to meet all its military obligations, and cargo aircraft diverted to supply Stilwell, the 14th Air Force, and the Chinese in the East left air-drop-dependent campaigns in the West, such as Operation Market Garden, woefully short of aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Antioch Review, {{founded in}} 1941, {{is one of}} the oldest {{continuously}} publishing literary magazines in America. They publish fiction, essays, and poetry from both emerging as well as established authors. Throughout the history of the magazine questions about race, ethnicity, sex, education, and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>experience</b> have had a large place. Academic questions in their formal sense have not loomed large, and the magazine’s policy of refusing to run footnotes is, in fact, a statement about the non- (rather than anti-) academic nature of the journal. Academics by the score have contributed, but always within a belles-lettres or journalistic tradition. So the magazine was open to both Malcolm Bradbury and Eric Bentley, sans footnotes. The Antioch Review has always avoided narrow academic debates and tried to suggest that although professors may be for the academy, their commentaries can bear on larger social and intellectual processes. The Review has always tried to be a forum for new writers and ideas in poetry and the short story.|$|E

500|$|Others, like {{journalist}} Nick Gillespie, see The Great Gatsby {{as a story}} [...] "underlying {{permanence of}} class differences; {{even in the face}} of a modern economy's attempt to assert that the class structure is based; not on status and inherited position; but, upon the innovation and the ability of literally anyone, to succeed by meeting the ever-changing demands and tastes of consumers' needs." [...] This interpretation asserts that The Great Gatsby captures <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>experience</b> because it is a story about change and those who resist it; whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants (Southern Europeans in the early 20th century, Latin Americans today), the nouveau riche, or successful minorities, Americans from the 1920s to modern day have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances. As Gillespie states, [...] "While the specific terms of the equation are always changing, it's easy to see echoes of Gatsbys basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society." [...] Because this concept is particularly American and can be seen throughout American history, readers are able to relate to The Great Gatsby (which has lent the novel an enduring popularity).|$|E
500|$|Marvel's {{announcement}} {{was met with}} widespread reactions online. Fatemeh Fakhraie, founder of Muslimah Media Watch, a diversity advocacy group, told Al Jazeera America that [...] "She {{is going to be}} a window into the American Muslim experience" [...] and that she [...] "normalizes this idea of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>experience</b> as Muslim." [...] Brett White of Comic Book Resources said, [...] "With Kamala Khan, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants living in Jersey City, Marvel Comics has shown yet again that it wants to include groups of the American population that have yet to be personally inspired by their heroes." [...] Hussein Rashid writing for CNN said, [...] "The character of Kamala Khan has the opportunity to offer something new to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims. She is born in the United States, appears to be part of the post-9/11 generation and is a teenager." [...] Muaaz Khan of The Guardian compared Kamala Khan to Malala Yousafzai and indicated that the rest of entertainment industry should follow Marvel's example. However, Dr. Leon Moosavi of the University of Liverpool felt that the character's family would reinforce the stereotype of restrictive Muslim parents and that her shape-shifting ability resembled several anti-Muslim stereotypes, especially taqiyya: a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are at risk of significant persecution. Political satirist Stephen Colbert joked about Marvel's decision to introduce a Muslim superhero on his television show. Comedian Conan O'Brien also made a joke via Twitter, linking the character's religion to polygamy, but later removed it due to public backlash.|$|E
