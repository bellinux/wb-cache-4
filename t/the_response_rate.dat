25|$|Rapalogs, {{which are}} the first {{generation}} mTOR inhibitors, have proven effective {{in a range of}} preclinical models. However, the success in clinical trials is limited to only a few rare cancers. Animal and clinical studies show that rapalogs are primarily cytostatic, and therefore effective as disease stabilizers rather than for regression. <b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> in solid tumors where rapalogs have been used as a single-agent therapy have been modest. Due to partial mTOR inhibition as mentioned before, rapalogs are not sufficient for achieving a broad and robust anticancer effect, at least when used as monotherapy.|$|E

We examined <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> in these studies, which covered more than 100, 000 organizations and 400, 000 individual respondents. <b>The</b> average <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> for studies that utilized data collected from individuals was 52. 7 percent {{with a standard deviation}} of 20. 4, while <b>the</b> average <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> for studies that utilized data collected from organizations was 35. 7 percent {{with a standard deviation of}} 18. 8.

2500|$|Treatment {{of panic}} {{disorder}} with sertraline {{results in a}} decrease {{of the number of}} panic attacks and an improved quality of life. In four double-blind studies sertraline was shown to be superior to placebo for the treatment of panic disorder. <b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> was independent of the dose. In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in improvement of quality of life on most parameters. The patients rated as [...] "improved" [...] on sertraline reported better quality of life than the ones who [...] "improved" [...] on placebo. The authors of the study argued that the improvement achieved with sertraline is different and of a better quality than the improvement achieved with placebo. Sertraline was equally effective for men and women. While imprecise, comparison of the results of trials of sertraline with separate trials of other anti-panic agents (clomipramine, imipramine, clonazepam, alprazolam, fluvoxamine and paroxetine) indicates approximate equivalence of these medications.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Antimuscarinic therapy {{remains one}} of the most common forms of therapy for overactive bladder (OAB) in children. However, few {{clinical}} studies on the outcomes of antimuscarinics in children with OAB have been published. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of propiverine, which is frequently prescribed for the treatment of pediatric OAB. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed children with OAB treated with propiverine within the past 5 years. <b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> were compared between the non-urge incontinence (non-UI) and urge incontinence (UI groups). <b>The</b> cumulative <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> by treatment duration was also compared between the two groups.
