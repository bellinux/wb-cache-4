5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads {{from side to side}} as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{was also}} {{discreet}} about his {{religious and political}} beliefs, but {{it is known that}} he voted for the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. He felt that keeping his personal life private was beneficial to his career: [...] "The less you know about me the more interesting it will be <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> do what I do".|$|E
500|$|On the day [...] "Smile" [...] was released, Allen {{appeared}} on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge with DJ Jo Whiley, performing an acoustic version of [...] "Smile" [...] and {{a cover of}} The Kooks' song [...] "Naïve". At the Secret Garden Party, in September 2006, Allen made a rendition of the song and afterwards stated: [...] "The festival was well good, particularly as Lester, my ex, who I wrote 'Smile' about, and subsequently sold his story to the papers, had a tent called 'the shit tent' positioned directly opposite the main stage. So he and his new girlfriend had no option but <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> perform {{to a couple of}} thousand people singing 'Smile' back to me. Oh, it's the little things eh!" ...|$|E

500|$|Lin {{sent his}} résumé and a DVD of {{highlights}} {{of his high}} school basketball career to all of the Ivy League schools; the University of California, Berkeley; and his dream schools, Stanford University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The Pac-10 schools wanted him to walk-on, rather than be actively recruited or offered a sports scholarship. Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances. [...] "Most colleges start recruiting a guy in the first five minutes they see him because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate," [...] Walters said. Lin added, [...] "I just think in order for someone to understand my game, they have <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> more than once, because I'm {{not going to do anything}} that's extra flashy or freakishly athletic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hunter's {{entry into}} the music {{business}} came after a chance encounter with Colin York and Colin Broom at a Butlin's Holiday Camp, where the trio won a talent competition performing [...] "Blue Moon" [...] on acoustic guitars. York and Broom were members of a Northampton-based band called The Apex Group, fronted by bass player and band leader Frank Short. Hunter soon left his home in Shrewsbury, transferred his apprenticeship from Sentinel/Rolls Royce to British Timken in Northampton, and joined The Apex Group on rhythm guitar. Hunter recalls jumping around like a lunatic on stage: [...] "Music affected me so much. The rest of them just stood there. It was funny, I had kids who came just <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> do this, and I can't imagine what it looked like." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2010, Fuse {{announced}} that Hoppus would be hosting his own weekly, one-hour television series entitled A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus.

More importantly, I'm excited to force millions of people <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> {{on a weekly basis}} on national television."

2500|$|Pasternak's {{fortunes}} {{were soon}} to change, however. In March 1956, the Italian Communist Party sent a journalist, Sergio d'Angelo, {{to work in}} the Soviet Union, and his status as a journalist as well as his membership in the Italian Communist Party allowed him to have access to various aspects of the cultural life in Moscow at the time. A Milan publisher, the communist Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, had also given him a commission to find new works of Soviet literature that would be appealing to Western audiences, and upon learning of Doctor Zhivagos existence, d'Angelo travelled immediately to Peredelkino and offered to submit Pasternak's novel to Feltrinelli's company for publication. At first Pasternak was stunned. Then he brought the manuscript from his study and told d'Angelo with a laugh, [...] "You are hereby invited <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> face the firing squad." ...|$|E
2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't {{very smart}} about things. At that stage I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, {{most of the other}} guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I thought {{it was up to me}} to compete with the Packer boys. When the Packer catchcry was [...] "Lillee getting wickets and Hookesy clearing pickets" [...] I felt that anyone who was coming <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> play needed to be entertained. I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd something to look at when they came in the gates. I should have been more circumspect. In a lot of cases I was happy to get out for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys.|$|E
