25|$|Martin Luther King III {{has three}} siblings; the late Yolanda Denise King, Dexter Scott King and Rev. Bernice Albertine King. They {{were raised in}} Vine City, an urban {{neighborhood}} in Atlanta, Georgia. When he {{was eight years old}} and only in the third grade, he began to endure racial comments and insults from a Caucasian boy in his class, who also happened <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> draw. When he approached the boy and complimented him on a drawing of his, the harassment ceased.|$|E
25|$|The {{rhetoric of}} the nudism and anti-nudism {{movements}} emphasizes freedom {{from many of the}} normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with Hall's high-low context distinction and the Francoeur's hot-cool sexuality continuum.|$|E

[...] The Seth character declares, [...] "I used <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> get inside cardboard boxes and close them up behind me. [...] I enjoyed being in that safe, confined space. [...] My mother's place is a lot like those boxes." ...|$|E
500|$|Louis Stanislas was an {{intelligent}} boy, excelling in classics. His education {{was of the}} same quality and consistency as that of his older brother, Louis Auguste, {{despite the fact that}} Louis Auguste was heir and Louis Stanislas was not. Louis Stanislas' education was quite religious in nature; several of his teachers were men of the cloth, such as Jean-Gilles du Coëtlosquet, Bishop of Limoges; the Abbé Jean-Antoine Nollet; and the Jesuit Guillaume-François Berthier. La Vauguyon drilled into young Louis Stanislas and his brothers the way he thought princes should [...] "know how to withdraw themselves, <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> work," [...] and [...] "to know how to reason correctly".|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Shields tour, Daniel Rossen embarked upon a solo tour performing tracks from his debut EP, and his other band, Department of Eagles. During the tour, Rossen commented on the future of Grizzly Bear, stating: [...] "We don't have a clear plan. We tend <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> let the records come together naturally. I think everyone wants {{a little bit of a}} break and everyone's scattered around the globe. I think towards the end of the year, if it feels natural, we'll start again." [...] In a more recent interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, singer Ed Droste explained that a new album was in the works. Unlike the recording process for Shields, where Grizzly Bear ensconced themselves at studios in Marfa, Texas and Cape Cod, Massachusetts to construct a truly collaborative album, Droste says the creative process was [...] "more fractured." [...] While two members still live in New York, the other half, including Droste, have traded coasts and now reside in Los Angeles. As of June 2016, Droste has been working on the next album with the rest of Grizzly Bear.|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
