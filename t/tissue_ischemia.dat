25|$|Although {{hypercholesterolemia}} {{itself is}} asymptomatic, longstanding elevation of serum cholesterol {{can lead to}} atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries). Over a period of decades, elevated serum cholesterol contributes to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arteries. This can lead to progressive narrowing of the involved arteries. Alternatively smaller plaques may rupture and cause a clot to form and obstruct blood flow. A sudden blockage of a coronary artery {{may result in a}} heart attack. A blockage of an artery supplying the brain can cause a stroke. If the development of the stenosis or occlusion is gradual, blood supply to the tissues and organs slowly diminishes until organ function becomes impaired. At this point <b>tissue</b> <b>ischemia</b> (restriction in blood supply) may manifest as specific symptoms. For example, temporary ischemia of the brain (commonly referred to as a transient ischemic attack) may manifest as temporary loss of vision, dizziness and impairment of balance, difficulty speaking, weakness or numbness or tingling, usually {{on one side of the}} body. Insufficient blood supply to the heart may cause chest pain, and ischemia of the eye may manifest as transient visual loss in one eye. Insufficient blood supply to the legs may manifest as calf pain when walking, while in the intestines it may present as abdominal pain after eating a meal.|$|E

50|$|Once a {{reduction}} in blood flow occurs, that lasts seconds the brain <b>tissue</b> suffers <b>ischemia.</b> If the interruption of blood flow is not restored in minutes, the tissue suffers infarction followed by tissue death. When the low cerebral blood flow persists for a longer duration, this may develop into an infarction in the border zones (areas of poor blood flow between the major cerebral artery distributions). In more severe instances, global hypoxia-ischemia causes widespread brain injury leading to a severe cognitive sequelae called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.|$|R
50|$|The heart {{regulates the}} amount of {{vasodilation}} or vasoconstriction of the coronary arteries based upon the oxygen requirements of the heart. This contributes to the filling difficulties of the coronary arteries.Compression remains the same. Failure of oxygen delivery caused by a decrease in blood flow in front of increased oxygen demand of the heart results in <b>tissue</b> <b>ischemia,</b> a condition of oxygen deficiency. Brief ischemia is associated with intense chest pain, known as angina. Severe ischemia can cause the heart muscle to die from hypoxia, such as during a myocardial infarction. Chronic moderate ischemia causes contraction of the heart to weaken, known as myocardial hibernation.|$|E
50|$|Inflammation of {{the dental}} pulp, termed pulpitis, {{produces}} true hypersensitivity of the nerves in the dental pulp. Pulpitis {{is classified as}} irreversible when pulpal inflammation will irreversibly progress to pulpal necrosis due to compression of the venous microcirculation and <b>tissue</b> <b>ischemia,</b> and reversible when the pulp is still capable of returning to a healthy, non-inflamed state, although usually dental treatment is required for this. Irreversible pulpitis is readily distinguishable from DH. There is poorly localized, severe pain which is aggravated by thermal stimuli, and which continues after the stimulus is removed. There also is typically spontaneous pain without any stimulus. Reversible pulpitis {{may not be so}} readily distinguishable from DH, however usually there will be some obvious sign such as a carious cavity, crack, etc. which indicates pulpitis. In contrast to pulpitis, the pain of DH is short and sharp.|$|E
50|$|Proliferative {{retinopathy}} is {{the result}} of aberrant blood flow to the retina due to blood vessel overgrowth, or neovascularization. These pathologically overgrown blood vessels are often fragile, weak, and ineffective at perfusing the retinal tissues. These weak, fragile vessels are also often leaky, allowing fluids, protein, and other debris to leech out into the retina. They are also prone to hemorrhage due to their poor strength. This makes proliferative types of retinopathy more risky since vessel hemorrhaging often leads to vision loss and blindness. Many of the causes mentioned in non-proliferative retinopathy may also cause proliferative retinopathy at later stages. Angiogenesis and neovascularization tend to be a later manifestation of non-proliferative retinopathy. Many types of non-proliferative retinopathies result in <b>tissue</b> <b>ischemia</b> or direct retinal damage. The body responds by trying to increase blood flow to damaged retinal tissues. Diabetes mellitus, which causes diabetic retinopathy, is {{the most common cause of}} proliferative retinopathy in the world.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Evaluate {{the degree}} of {{vascular}} occlusion, vascular recanalization, and necrosis of the vascular wall caused by polyvinyl alcohol-covered polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) particles compared to trisacryl particles after renal embolization. METHODS: Seventy-nine female albino New Zealand rabbits underwent arterial catheterization of the right kidney. Thirty-three animals were embolized with trisacryl particles, thirty-one with PVAc particles, and fifteen were kept as controls. Four animals were excluded (three trisacryl and one PVAc) due to early death. Five subgroups of six animals were created. The animals in the different groups were sacrificed either 48 hours, 5 days, 10 days, 30 days, or 90 days after embolization. The control group was divided into subgroups of three animals each and kept for the same periods of time. The kidneys were dyed with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson’s trichrome and then examined using optical microscopy. RESULTS: There were significant differences in {{the degree of}} vascular occlusion caused by the trisacryl and the PVAc particles between the five-day and the ten-day groups. Additional differences were noted between the five-day and 48 -hour groups in regard to the amount of necrosis. For both findings, the PVAc group members showed adequate <b>tissue</b> reaction (<b>ischemia</b> and volumetric reduction) and less recanalization than those treated with trisacryl.

30|$|After passively {{targeting}} tumor tissues via {{the enhanced}} permeability and retention (EPR) effect, nano-drugs such as NP-loaded small-molecule anti-tumor drugs mainly exert their efficacy in two ways: (1) by being released in tumor tissues and entering cells {{in a free}} form to exert efficacy and (2) by being taken up by cells {{in the form of}} microparticles and released in the cell to exert pharmacodynamic effects [6, 7]. When a nano-pharmaceutical agent is passively targeted to a tumor, which of the two methods plays a major role or whether both play a major role {{at the same time and}} whether other factors are involved is a complex issue. Because of the metabolic activity of tumor <b>tissues,</b> <b>ischemia</b> and hypoxia and the accumulation of lactic acid and because extracellular fluid of tumor tissues shows weak acidity, many nano-drugs show increased release in acidic environments, for enhanced efficacy [8]. The drug release efficiency of nano-drugs in an acidic environment is closely related to the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and is also affected by the size of NPs [9 – 11]. After the NPs passively target the tumor tissue, because the tumor cells have a phagocytosis function, the nano-pharmaceutical preparation enters cells mainly via pinocytosis and complex processes mediated by the cell membrane proteins [12, 13]. Under the degradation of intracellular lysozymes, nano-pharmaceuticals release drugs and exert efficacy [14].|$|R
50|$|During {{compartment}} syndrome there is increased intra-compartmental {{pressure in the}} interstitium over its capillary perfusion pressure, due to the accumulation of necrotic debris and hemorrhage, especially hemorrhage secondary to fractures (Rorabeck, 1984). Any condition that results {{in an increase in}} compartment contents or reduction in a compartment’s volume can lead to the development of an acute {{compartment syndrome}}. When pressure is elevated, capillary blood flow is compromised. Edema of the soft tissue within the compartment further raises the intra-compartment pressure, which compromises venous and lymphatic drainage of the injured area. Pressure, if further increased in a reinforcing vicious circle, can compromise arteriole perfusion, leading to further <b>tissue</b> <b>ischemia.</b> Untreated compartment syndrome-mediated ischemia of the muscles and nerves leads to eventual irreversible damage and death of the tissues within the compartment.There are three main mechanisms that are hypothesized to cause compartment syndrome. One idea is the increase in arterial pressure (due to increased blood flow due to trauma or excessive exercise) causes the arteries to spasm and this causes the pressures in the muscle to increase even further. Second, obstruction of the microcirculatory system is hypothesized. Finally, there is the idea of arterial or venous collapse due to transmural pressure.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} main {{mechanisms}} of damage in non-proliferative retinopathy: blood vessel damage or remodeling, direct retinal damage, or occlusion {{of the blood}} vessels. The first mechanism is indirect damage by altering the blood vessels that supply the retina. In the case of hypertension, high pressures in the system causes {{the walls of the}} artery to thicken, which effectively reduces the amount of blood flow to the retina. This reduction in flow causes <b>tissue</b> <b>ischemia</b> leading to damage. Atherosclerosis, or hardening and narrowing of blood vessels, also reduces flow to the retina. The second mechanism is direct damage to the retina usually caused by free radicals that causes oxidative damage to the retina itself. Radiation, solar retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity fall under this category. The third common mechanism is occlusion of blood flow. This can be caused by either physically blocking the vessels of the retinal artery branches or causing the arteries to narrow. Again, the end result is reduced blood flow to the retina causing tissue damage. Sickle cell disease compromises blood flow by causing blood to sludge, or thicken and flow slowly, through the retinal arteries. Other disorders that cause hyperviscosity syndrome may also cause blood sludging. Lastly, clots or central artery thrombosis directly blocks flow to the retina causing the cells to die.|$|E
50|$|Septic shock is a {{subclass}} of distributive shock, {{a condition}} in which abnormal distribution of blood flow in the smallest blood vessels results in inadequate blood supply to the body <b>tissues,</b> resulting in <b>ischemia</b> and organ dysfunction.

50|$|In microangiopathy, {{the walls}} of the smaller blood vessels become so thick and weak that they bleed, leak protein, and slow the flow of blood through the body. The {{decrease}} of blood flow through stenosis or clot formation impairs the flow of oxygen to cells and biological <b>tissues</b> (called <b>ischemia)</b> and leads to cellular death (necrosis and gangrene, which in turn may require amputation). Thus, tissues which are very sensitive to oxygen levels, such as the retina, develop microangiopathy and may cause blindness (so-called proliferative diabetic retinopathy). Damage to nerve cells may cause peripheral neuropathy, and to kidney cells, diabetic nephropathy (Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome).|$|R
5000|$|Complementary {{to chronic}} {{compartment}} syndrome is another subset known as chronic exertional compartment syndrome CECS, often called exercise induced compartment syndrome EICS. CECS {{of the leg}} is a condition caused by exercise which results in increased tissue pressure within a limited fibro-osseous compartment - muscle size may increase by up to 20% during exercise (Touliopolous, 1999). When this happens, pressure builds up in the tissues and muscles causing <b>tissue</b> <b>ischemia</b> (Touliopolous, 1999). An increase in muscle weight will reduce the compartment volume of the surrounding fascial borders and result in an increase of intracompartmental pressure. An increase in {{the pressure of the}} tissue can cause fluid to exude into the small spaces between the tissue known as interstitial space, leading to a disruption of the micro-circulation of the leg. [...] This condition occurs commonly in the lower leg and various other locations within the body, such as the foot or forearm. This is commonly seen in athletes who train rigorously in activities that involve constant repetitive actions or motions. In athletic popular culture there is a catchphrase, [...] "Feel the burn," [...] which references these conditions as something to strive for when training, weightlifting or otherwise working out. They are not understood as symptoms. The symptoms involve numbness or a tingling sensation in the area most affected. Other signs and symptoms include pain described as aching, tightening, cramping, sharp, or stabbing. This pain can occur for months, and in some cases over a period of years, and may be relieved by rest. It also includes moderate weakness that can be a noticeable factor in the affected region. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome most commonly affects the anterior compartment of the leg, this can lead to problems with dorsiflexion of the ankle and the toes. The symptoms of CECS are often confused with more common injuries like shin splints and spinal stenosis. Treatment for chronic exertional compartment syndrome includes decreasing or subsiding exercising and activities, or cross training for athletes. In cases with severe intracompartmental pressures surgical treatment, a fasciotomy, is necessary.|$|E

40|$|Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are {{important}} in the recruitment of leukocytes to injured tissues and, as such, play {{a pivotal role in}} arteriogenesis and the <b>tissue</b> response to <b>ischemia.</b> Hind limb ischemia represents a complex model with arteriogenesis (collateral artery formation) occurring in tissues with normal perfusion while areas exhibiting ischemic necrosis undergo angiogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration; monocytes and macrophages {{play an important role in}} all three of these processes.

40|$|In this study, {{the impacts}} of {{adrenalin}} on ovarian injury caused by ischemia reperfusion were investigated in rats. In addition, it’s been investigated {{whether there is a}} correlation between adrenergic receptors and oxidant/anti-oxidant and COX 1 /COX- 2 levels. It’s been observed that the COX- 2 level that is responsible for MDA and inflammatory reaction (which are the indicators of oxidative stress in ovarian <b>tissue</b> to which <b>ischemia</b> reperfusion was applied) increased and the COX- 1 levels that are responsible for GSH (an endogenic anti-oxidant with protective impact) were depressed. Adrenalin has prevented an increase in MDA and COX- 2 activity in the ovarian tissue, to which I/R was applied, and prevented a reduction in GSH and COX- 1 activity. However, adrenalin failed to prevent an MDA increase in ovarian tissue, to which alpha- 2 adrenergic receptor blocker yohimbine was given (I/R formed), and also failed to prevent a GSH and COX- 1 decrease. Adrenalin also failed to inhibit the COX- 2 activity increase in ovarian tissue, to which beta blocker was applied. As a result, stimulation of the alpha- 2 adrenergic receptors in an ovarian tissue causes an anti-oxidant and protective effect, while stimulation of beta- 2 adrenergic receptors causes an anti-inflammatory effect.
