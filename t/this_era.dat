5|$|Eventually, {{at a time}} {{known as}} recombination, {{electrons}} and nuclei formed stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated era. Light from <b>this</b> <b>era</b> could travel freely, and it can still {{be seen in the}} Universe as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). After around 100 million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive, luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. The Universe also contains a mysterious energy called dark energy, the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era. In <b>this</b> <b>era,</b> the expansion of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy.|$|E
