5|$|After the 1987 {{resignation}} of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded {{his own private}} equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm {{was responsible for the}} 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign {{of the end of the}} 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in , and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.|$|E

James was physically much bigger than they'd originally had in mind, however they felt that his interpretation of Tony would be expansive and get noticed.

25|$|Freud, like Josef Breuer, {{found the}} {{hypothesis}} that hysterical manifestations were generated by ideas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> warranted, but given in observation. Disagreement between them arose when they attempted to give causal explanations of their data: Breuer favored a hypothesis of hypnoid states, while Freud postulated the mechanism of defense. Richard Wollheim comments that given the close correspondence between hysteria {{and the results of}} hypnosis, Breuer's hypothesis appears more plausible, and that it is only when repression is taken into account that Freud's hypothesis becomes preferable.|$|E
25|$|Designed by the {{architect}} Philip Hardwick, it {{was inspired by}} the Roman architecture Hardwick encountered on a trip to Italy in 1818 and 1819. Strictly speaking it was not an arch at all, but a propylaeum of the Doric order. The sandstone structure was designed for the London and Birmingham Railway (L), complementing Birmingham Curzon Street station, {{at the other end of}} the company's mainline. The arch was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a fitting gateway to the Midlands, but to the whole new world which the railway was to open up.|$|E

Baeksuk, which is the Korean counterpart to the chicken noodle soup of Western culture, is also popular among Koreans for its power to cure minor illnesses such as a cold. While the chicken noodle soup, as the name suggests, has some noodles in it, quite often Baeksuk does not contain any noodles.|$|E

25|$|The Karen {{people were}} a primitive, hunted {{minority}} group of ancient Tibeto-Burman ancestry scattered {{in the forests}} and jungles of the Salween River and in the hills along the southeast coast. Judson was the first missionary {{to make contact with}} them in 1827, when he ransomed and freed a debt-slave from one of his early converts. The freed slave, Ko Tha Byu, was an illiterate, surly man who spoke almost no Burmese and was reputed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a thief, but also a murderer who admitted killing at least 30 men, but could not remember exactly how many more.|$|E
25|$|Having {{lost his}} home world of Krypton, Superman is very {{protective}} of Earth, and especially of Clark Kent's family and friends. This same loss, {{combined with the}} pressure of using his powers responsibly, has caused Superman to feel lonely on Earth, despite having his friends and parents. Previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow Kryptonians, Power Girl (who is, in fact from the Krypton of the Earth-Two universe) and Mon-El, have led to disappointment. The arrival of Supergirl, who has been confirmed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> from Krypton, but also his cousin, has relieved this loneliness somewhat. Superman's Fortress of Solitude acts {{as a place of}} solace for him in times of loneliness and despair.|$|E
25|$|To cause {{growth in}} the {{required}} domains, auxins must of necessity be active preferentially in them. Local auxin maxima can be formed by active biosynthesis in certain cells of tissues, for example via tryptophan-dependent pathways, but auxins are not synthesized in all cells (even if cells retain the potential ability to do so, only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated in them). For that purpose, auxins have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> translocated toward those sites where they are needed, but also they must have an established mechanism to detect those sites. For that purpose, auxins have to be translocated toward those sites where they are needed.

Personally leading her forces into battle, Mavia proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> an able political leader but also a strong field tactician. Her forces, using Roman battlefield techniques and their own traditional fighting methods had a highly mobile cavalry that used long lances with deadly effect. The Romans were defeated, {{and it was not}} the first time they had been humiliated at the hands of a woman. This time, however, they had no indigenous forces to call upon for help as had been the case in their battles against Zenobia, since it was the Tanukh confederation they were now fighting, that had come to their aid then. Valens had no choice but to sue for peace.|$|E
25|$|There {{still was}} no formal {{organisation}} of international tours, with any promoter free {{to try to}} put together a touring side. However, for ten years, only one team had toured for any one Australian summer. In 1887/8 this changed. Lillywhite, Shaw and Shrewsbury put together what was to turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> their last professional tour, but the last English tour led by a professional for sixty-seven years. Their team was invited to Australia by the Melbourne Cricket Club. Shaw himself did not tour, but stayed at home to put together a football side that played rugby union and Victorian rules (now known as Australian rules) football in Australia after the cricket tour. The tour was a financial disaster, with the Melbourne Cricket Club, Lillywhite, Shaw and Shrewsbury well out-of-pocket. Lillywhite defaulted on his debt. All the English team was mostly professional, to boost the status of the team, an amateur, Aubrey Smith, was invited to captain it.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a dispute}} {{with regard to the}} quality of {{education}} provided by the system. In the year 2014, the National Achievement Test (NAT) and the National Career Assessment Examination (NCAE) results show {{that there had been a}} decline in the quality of Philippine education at the elementary and secondary levels. The students’ performance in both the 2014 NAT and NCAE were excessively below the target mean score. Having said this, the poor quality of the Philippine educational system is manifested in the comparison of completion rates between highly urbanized city of Metro Manila, which is also happens <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the country's capital but the largest metropolitan area in the Philippines and other places in the country such as Mindanao and Eastern Visayas. Although Manila is able to boast a primary school completion rate of approximately 100 percent, other areas of the nation, such as Eastern Visayas and Mindanao, hold primary school completion rate of only 30 percent or even less. This kind of statistic is no surprise to the education system in the Philippine context, students who hail from Philippine urban areas have the financial capacity to complete at the very least their primary school education.|$|E

25|$|HDP rallied {{more than}} {{expected}} and gained 13.12% of the total votes cast (6,280,302 out of 46,774,793), breaking the 10% threshold, the minimum set for any Turkish political party to have its representatives sit in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (TBMM), and securing 81 seats. The HDP carried victories in 14 out of 85 electoral districts in Turkey: Ardahan, Kars, Iğdır, Ağrı Province, Muş, Bitlis, Van, Turkey, Hakkâri, Şırnak, Siirt, Batman, Mardin, Diyarbakır and Tunceli. These electoral districts are mostly Kurdish-majority provinces. In this election, however, the HDP departed from its traditional Kurdish issues-focused role and embraced other minority ethnic and religious groups in Turkey, women's issues, LGBT and left-wing activists and political groups under its wing, promoting its appeal to a national level and drawing a wider pool of support from all over Turkey. This resulted the HDP <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the 4th largest political party in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey but also a formidable force in gaining the Turkish overseas votes, ranking 2nd after the AKP with 20.41% and carrying Japan, Ukraine, Greece, Poland, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Canada and the U.K. The HDP also derailed the AKP from being the majority party, forming a single-party government and reaching 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the necessary number to enact a referendum necessary to change the constitution so that Turkey would abandon its traditional parliamentary government and instead adopt an American-style executive presidency government. This is hailed by Turkey's opposition parties and their supporters as the biggest contribution the HDP made to the Republic of Turkey.|$|E

[...] Like Kneale, he contrasted this to American science-fiction productions, where the alien adversary would be defeated by [...] "it being blown up or electrocuted, or having the entire firepower of the army turned against it."
