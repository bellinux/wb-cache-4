Following the {{recovery}} of freshman Marquis Rankin from a torn meniscus, Garland played a total of one minute in three games. He also scored a combined six points following his initial two performances that season. On December 11, 2011, Garland did not even remove his warm-up shirt in his team's game vs Norfolk State. When Greenberg was asked about Garland's playing time, the coach said, [...] "Marquis [...] is right now a good play-starter and good on ball defender. We've got to get other guys more minutes".

On December 16, 2011, Garland announced on Twitter that {{he was planning to}} transfer out of Virginia Tech. Following his exams, he returned to his hometown of Philadelphia. Garland became the third men's basketball player to transfer out of the Hokies' team in the past academic year, following the footsteps of Ben Boggs, who moved to Valparaiso, and Manny Atkins, who would end up with Georgia State.

Explorers head coach John Giannini said, [...] "We recruited Tyrone extremely hard out of high school. He is known as a scorer and can also be a very good passer and defender. He is the type of all-around guard, talent and person that will make our team better. He gives us an experienced player <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> growth over the next 2 years. With his addition we will have tremendous team quickness and depth." [...] Several of the team's top scorers in 2011–12 had experience playing high school basketball in the Philadelphia Public and Catholic Leagues.|$|E
