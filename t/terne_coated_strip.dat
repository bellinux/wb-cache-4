40|$|The biofilm {{formation}} of the oral fungal pathogen Candida on denture acrylic <b>strips</b> <b>coated</b> with saliva, serum and, saliva-serum pellicle were examined in vitro using Candida albicans (four isolates), Candida glabrata (three isolates) and Candida tropicalis (three isolates). The degree of biofilm activity varied depending upon both the isolate and the pellicle. Significantly increased biofilm activity on the pellicle (particularly serum) <b>coated</b> <b>strips</b> was observed with three isolates of C. albicans and another of C. glabrata on protein-coated acrylics, with increasing concentration of serum in the pellicle. Similar trends were observed with one isolate of C. albicans and C. glabrata, although the effects of pellicles were not significant. In contrast, with all three isolates of C. tropicalis and a single isolate of C. glabrata, although the biofilm activity on the protein-free control strips {{was significantly higher than}} that of saliva- <b>coated</b> <b>strips,</b> the increase in activity of pellicle-admixed biofilm depended upon the serum concentration.

The technique assumes the total scattered field from each <b>coated</b> <b>strip</b> as the sum of the scattered fields from the individual element due to a plane incident wave plus scattered fields from factious line sources of unknown intensity located at the center of every element. The line sources account for the multiple scattering effect. By enforcing the boundary conditions, the intensity of the line sources can be calculated. Numerical examples are introduced for comparison with data published in the literature. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} hybrid {{optical fiber sensor}} system for {{simultaneously}} sensing the strain, temperature, and thermal strain of composite materials. The hybrid fiber optic sensor system involves a combination of three sensors: 1) a polarimetric sensor based on an acrylate coated polarization maintaining photonic crystal fiber (PM-PCF); 2) a <b>coating</b> <b>stripped</b> PM-PCF sensor; and 3) a fiber Bragg grating sensor (FBG). Temperature is sensed using the FBG sensor, axial strain is sensed using the acrylate coated PM-PCF sensor, and thermal strain is sensed using the <b>coating</b> <b>stripped</b> PM-PCF. The hybrid sensor system presented operates in the intensity domain by converting the polarization and wavelength information from the polarimetric sensors and the FBG, respectively, into detectable linear intensity variations. Subsequently, by deriving a characteristic matrix for the hybrid sensors, information about temperature, axial strain, and thermal strain can be simultaneously determined. An experimental demonstration of the hybrid sensor system is described based on a glass fiber reinforced composite material sample within which the three different sensors are embedded. The proposed sensor configuration can be employed in composite material structural health monitoring application...|$|R

The mixing ratio between aluminum, aluminum oxide and oxygen develops as a barrier layer gradient which exhibits a maximum of the metallic aluminum content. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Through variation of the partial pressure of the reactive gas and the position of the evaporation zone, the position and intensity of this maximum within a certain depth range of the barrier layer is adjusted so that, for the same optical transmissibility, the oxygen permeation and/or the water vapor permeation of the layer is minimized. USE - For <b>coating</b> <b>strips</b> with transparent barrier layers of aluminum oxide. ADVANTAGE - Coatings can be produced without large installation and operating costs.

This paper presents {{an investigation into}} the electro-active actuation characteristics of Nafion while being hydrated from one of its edges to avoid direct water contact with the surface. The effectiveness of actuation of electrically excited platinum coated Nafion cantilever past a 12 minute time period without direct hydration is investigated.

The oscillations of <b>coated</b> <b>strips</b> were able to be sustained for more than 24 hours with the techniques used.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} reliability of fused silica glass fibers is significantly {{influenced by the}} properties of their polymer coatings. The primary coating, which is {{in contact with the}} fiber surface, is expected to control the chemis ry there, but the secondary coating does have a considerable effect on the strength and aging behavior of the fiber. This observation is confirmed by data obtained for ten fused silica fibers, having the same primary coatings but ten different secondary coatings. These fibers were aged at 85 oC in both de-ionized water and 85 % relative humidity for up to 6 weeks and the residual strength as a function of aging time was measured. Dynamic fatigue measurements were carried out on as-received and aged fibers using two-point bending.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{critical}} issues of the influence of the thermal expansion of composite materials on embedded polarimetric sensors for measurements of strain and temperature are studied in this paper. A composite material sample with polarimetric fiber sensors embedded in two distinct layers of a multi-layer composite structure is fabricated and characterized. The polarimetric fiber sensors used in this study are based on Panda type fiber and polarization maintaining photonic crystal fiber (PM-PCF). The temperature sensitivities of polarimetric fiber sensors with acrylate buffer <b>coated</b> and buffer <b>stripped</b> polarization maintaining optical fibers are measured in free space and compared with those for sensors embedded in the composite material. It is found that a polarimetric fiber sensor with an acrylate coating embedded in the composite material shows the same response as the one in free space while the <b>coating</b> <b>stripped</b> fiber polarimetric sensor shows significant temperature sensitivity when embedded in the composite material. This is due to the stress induced change in birefringence created by the thermal expansion of the composite material, while {{in the case of a}} buffer coated fiber, the effect is considerably reduced as the thermal stress is largely eliminated by the buffer coating. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that thermal expansion of the composite material is the main source of error in strain and temperature measurement using embedded polarimetric fiber sensors and that more accurate strain and temperature measurements can be obtained with buffer coated polarimetric fiber sensors. 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
