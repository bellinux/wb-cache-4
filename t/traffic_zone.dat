25|$|In May 2004, {{the airport}} {{operator}} PlaneStation bought 30% {{of the shares}} in airline EUjet, and in January 2005 it completed its takeover by acquiring the remaining 70% of the shares. On 26 July 2005, the airline went into administration and all EUjet flights ended, along with all non-freight operations at the airport, owing to financial difficulties with the airline and airport owner, PlaneStation. Their business plan was ambitious and when the bank lenders foreclosed many passengers were left stranded abroad. London Manston Airport plc went into liquidation. Operations then temporarily ceased, and Manston's aerodrome <b>traffic</b> <b>zone</b> and radar services were suspended, until after a new buyer could be found.|$|E
500|$|The Single Eurasian Sky programme, {{administered}} by the Eurasian Economic Commission, outlines {{the creation of a}} single market for air services and a single air <b>traffic</b> <b>zone.</b> The single air <b>traffic</b> <b>zone</b> {{would make it easier for}} airlines to draw up new flight paths, thereby increasing the number of flights flying through the region. Eurasian Commissioner, Daniyal Akhmetov, said that it would be created on a step-by-step basis. In June 2014, Belarusian Airline Belavia stated that it was ready to move towards the development of the Single Eurasian Sky. The terms and conditions of operation in the common aviation market have not yet been agreed on. However, the project is likely to be modelled on the European Union's Single European Sky. The project will reportedly help turn the airspace of the Eurasian Union into a popular transit hub between Europe and Southeast Asia. [...] "We should understand that currently, the aviation companies of Kazakhstan and Belarus are not able to compete with Russia's aviation companies. Therefore, the programme will envisage a phasing, creating a competitive environment and so on", Eurasian Commissioner Akhmetov said.|$|E

30|$|If {{the student}} chooses {{to carry out}} a {{secondary}} activity on his tour, the system of models simulates, after the choice of the type of activity, the place in which the same one can be undertaken. For simulating the choice dimension related to the secondary activity spatial distribution, a hierarchical Logit model is proposed, in which there are two alternatives at the higher hierarchical level: the secondary activity carried out inside the university area, the secondary activity undertaken outside the university area (Fig.  1). On the lower hierarchical level are located the <b>traffic</b> <b>zones</b> in which the campus and urban area have been separated. As a rough guide, the university area has been separated in N <b>traffic</b> <b>zones,</b> while the urban area in M <b>traffic</b> <b>zones.</b> Further zones could be considered outside the urban area.|$|R

Here, we only analyzed the SDNs with destinations located at transfer zones (Fig. S 5). This is because both bus-to-subway trips and subway-to-bus trips exist in these SDNs. While for the SDNs with destinations located at ordinary zones, only bus-to-subway trips or subway-to-bus trips can be observed. The transfer zones are popular destinations, roughly 70 % of the trips are captured by the 124 SDNs.|$|R

30|$|The Metropolitan area of Thessaloniki {{is divided}} in 339 <b>traffic</b> <b>zones,</b> 124 of which {{belong to the}} Municipality of Thessaloniki. Due to the {{economic}} crisis that Greece is facing since late 2009, it is considered that in the design year 2020, the number of passenger vehicles in Thessaloniki {{will be at the}} 2010 levels. Similarly, the number and allocation of the trips to the <b>traffic</b> <b>zones</b> will be the same. Based on the above, the total number of passenger vehicles with destination to one of the 124 <b>traffic</b> <b>zones</b> of the Municipality, but also the average travel distance between the zones were computed. Based on the Hellenic Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change [29] report the penetration rate of EVs will be 2 – 7 %. Choosing an intermediate scenario, we assume that 5 % of the passenger cars will be electric in 2020. The penetration of electric vehicles is assumed to be uniform across all areas of Thessaloniki. Moreover, it is assumed that the use of EVs will not affect the behaviour of commuters and thus their trips. However, not all EVs will require charging when they arrive at a destination zone.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} risk of cancer due to benzene in the ambient air of gas {{stations}} and <b>traffic</b> <b>zones</b> {{in the north of}} Tehran. The cancer risk was estimated using the population distribution data for benzene levels and the unit risk for benzene proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). Material and Methods: Sixteen sampling locations were monitored, once every week, during 5 April 2010 to 25 March 2011. Results: The results showed that the mean annual benzene concentration was 14. 51 ± 3. 17 parts per billion (ppb) for <b>traffic</b> <b>zones</b> and 29. 01 ± 1. 32 ppb for outside gas stations. The risk calculated was 1026 × 10 - 6 for gas station 27 and 955 × 10 - 6 for gas station 139. Conclusions: According to our results, the annual benzene level in Tehran ambient air is 2 to 20 times higher than the respective value specified in International Standard (1. 56 ppb). Moreover, the results showed a notable increase of cancer risks, ranging from 10 % to 56 %, for the vicinity population close to the gas stations in comparison to the vicinity population in the <b>traffic</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R
