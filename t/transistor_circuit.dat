This way of driving an avalanche transistor was relatively less employed in first generation circuits because the base node has a relatively low impedance and an input capacitance [...] which is highly nonlinear (as a matter of fact, it is exponential) under the large signal regime: this causes a fairly large, input voltage dependent, delay time, which was analyzed in detail in the paper [...] However, the required inverse voltage for the feed diode is far lower respect diodes {{to be used in}} collectior trigger input circuits, and since ultra fast Schottky diodes are easily and cheaply found, this is the driver circuit employed in most modern avalanche <b>transistor</b> <b>circuit.</b> This is also the reason why the diode [...] in the following applicative circuits is symbolized as a Schottky diode.|$|E
