50|$|A {{communications}} audit is {{a comprehensive}} evaluation of an organization’s ability to send, receive and share information with various audiences within the organization (and as organizations become flatter to allow groups within the organization to cooperate and share among themselves), as well at key constituencies outside, such as customers and investors, {{in the case of}} publicly traded companies. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> can be performed to evaluate an organization's external or internal communication effectiveness. The purpose of a communications audit is to uncover the strengths and weaknesses between management, typically, and employees, customers and other groups such as investors, the news media, and regulators and legislative bodies with the objective to improve future communications by developing a strategic plan, through a series of recommendations, and to determine where gaps exists which need to be bridged.|$|E
5000|$|The general audit (alternatively {{called a}} mini-audit, site energy audit or {{detailed}} energy audit or complete site energy audit) expands on the preliminary audit described above by collecting more {{detailed information about}} facility operation and by performing a more detailed evaluation of energy conservation measures. Utility bills are collected for a 12- to 36-month period to allow the auditor to evaluate the facility's energy demand rate structures and energy usage profiles. If interval meter data is available, the detailed energy profiles that such data makes possible will typically be analyzed for signs of energy waste. [...] Additional metering of specific energy-consuming systems is often performed to supplement utility data. In-depth interviews with facility operating personnel are conducted to provide {{a better understanding of}} major energy consuming systems and to gain insight into short- and longer-term energy consumption patterns.This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> will be able to identify all energy-conservation measures appropriate for the facility, given its operating parameters. A detailed financial analysis is performed for each measure based on detailed implementation cost estimates, site-specific operating cost savings, and the customer's investment criteria. Sufficient detail is provided to justify project implementation.The evolution of cloud-based energy auditing software platforms is enabling the managers of commercial buildings to collaborate with general and specialty trades contractors in performing general and energy system-specific audits. The benefit of software-enabled collaboration is the ability to identify the full range of energy efficiency options that may be applicable to the specific building under study with [...] "live time" [...] cost and benefit estimates supplied by local contractors.|$|E
