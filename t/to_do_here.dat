In a very short while {{there will be no more}} of me– and of all the things worldly, of all the affairs and destinies, from then on I will be unaware! And what I'm left <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> is dumbly try to {{consciously}} impose upon myself fear and amazement," [...] he wrote.|$|E

2500|$|Subsequent to the British {{occupation}} of Palestine following World War I, `Abdu'l-Bahá remarked [...] "If the Zionists will {{mingle with the}} other races and live in unity with them, they will succeed. If not, they will meet certain resistance. For the present I think a neutral government like the British administration would be best. A Jewish government might come later. There is too much talk today of what the Zionists are going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here.</b> There is no need of it. Let them come and do more and say less." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{summarizing}} the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to what we wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress. To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India, Gandhi was [...] "Indira Amma or Mother Indira." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{awarded the}} film {{three and a}} half stars, finding that the film [...] "makes up" [...] for the 1998 version and praised Edwards, stating, [...] "The {{director}} thinks visually, which sounds redundant until you realize how many monster movies are flat, effects-dependent factory jobs. Edwards knows how to use great heights for great effect." [...] Phillips also praised the film's build-up, stating, [...] "director Gareth Edwards lays the expository groundwork nicely and hands the audience what it craves in the second half" [...] and defended the amount of screen-time Godzilla received, stating, [...] "Is there enough Godzilla in Godzilla? Folks, there is. There is just enough." [...] David Blaustein of ABC News Radio called the film [...] "very good, but not great", criticizing the film for not having enough screen-time for Godzilla, stating, [...] "There’s not enough Godzilla. When the monster’s away, the movie drags. It’s clear what Edwards and company are trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here.</b> i.e. less is more. The issue is, this Godzilla is so much fun to watch, we never want it leave the screen and when he/she/it's not there, it's a letdown." [...] Regardless, Blaustein stated that the film's finale, [...] "more or less, makes it all worth the wait", and awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of five.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his show}} on May 24, 2011, Schultz called Laura Ingraham both a [...] "right-wing slut" [...] and a [...] "talk slut." [...] Feminist {{organizations}} including the Women's Media Center called for his suspension. The following day he issued an apology {{by saying he}} [...] "used vile and inappropriate language when talking about talk show host Laura Ingraham. I am deeply sorry, and I apologize. It was wrong, uncalled for and I recognize the severity of what I said. I apologize to you, Laura, and ask for your forgiveness." [...] He offered an indefinite self-suspension without pay. Ingraham accepted his apology: [...] "Ed Schultz said something about me on his show that was not all that nice, to say the least. It was pretty crude. He apologized, and I accept his apology. It seemed heartfelt, {{it seemed like he}} really wished he hadn't said it and I accept that apology." [...] MSNBC issued a statement saying that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave over the matter. Schultz ended his radio show on May 23, 2014. He stated on MSNBC, [...] "This change will give me more flexibility to be on the road, to do the kind of shows I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> for The Ed Show here on MSNBC.

2500|$|... "awoke early, {{found out}} Boat landed at St. Paul's {{discharging}} flour. I {{took a walk}} up the steep bluff and took {{a view of the}} town generally. The Upper or new town is laid out on a wild looking place situated on high bluffs which have a steep face to the River & Rocks projecting. The lower, or Old French town, is composed of about 10 or 15 houses, some of them bark roofs. In this part is found Half breed Indians & French and Canadian French. This part stands on a lower ground just above a ravine where Carver’s Cave is. Site of upper town is more broken and it stands on a succession of benches of sand. There is a great many of people here. Many of them have for a covering their wagons and tents. There is two large frame hotels going up and a great many small frame building scattered among the bushes, for the greater part of the ground where the new town stands is not yet grubbed out, full of hazel bushes and scrub oaks. They area asking as high as $500 for lots. I think they will {{have a great deal of}} work <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> before they will have things as they should be. There is a slough 100 yards wide between the town and the river, over which they build a causeway to get from the River to the town. Between the river and the slough there is barely room for three or four warehouses. Two are here erecting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Right upon {{setting up}} camp in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Romanian troops joined the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel-organized Einsatzgruppen in mass shootings of Bessarabian and Ukrainian Jews, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 10,000 to 20,000 people. Scholar Christopher R. Browning compares these killings with similar atrocities perpetrated by locals in Reichskommissariat Ukraine, Lithuania and Latvia (see Holocaust in Latvia, Holocaust in Lithuania, Holocaust in Ukraine). From then on, as the fighting troops progressed over the Dniester, the local administration deported large numbers of Jews into the fighting zone, in hopes that they would be exterminated by the Germans. Antonescu himself stated: [...] "I am in favor of expelling the Jews from Bessarabia and [...] Bukovina {{to the other side of}} the border [...] There is nothing for them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> and I don't mind if we appear in history as barbarians [...] There has never been a time more suitable in our history to get rid of the Jews, and if necessary, you are to make use of machine guns against them." [...] He also explained that his aim was: [...] "the policy of purification of the Romanian race, and I will not give way before any obstacle in achieving this historical goal of our nation. If we do not take advantage of the situation which presents itself today [...] we shall miss the last chance that history offers to us. And I do not wish to miss it, because if I do so further generations will blame me." [...] He made a contradictory statement about the murder of Jews in Chișinău, claiming that their perpetrators were [...] "bastards" [...] who [...] "stained" [...] his regime's reputation. Antonescu saw the [...] "war" [...] against the Jews as being just as important as the war against the Soviet Union, and regularly demanded reports from his officers in Bessarabia and Transnistria about their measures against the Jews. In late August 1941 in Tighina Antonescu called a secret conference attended by himself, the governors of Bessarabia and Bukovina and the governor-designate of Transnistria to discuss his plans regarding the Jews in those regions.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} the words [...] "Neither shall he multiply wives to himself" [...] in [...] to limit him {{to no more}} than 18 wives. Judah said that he could have more wives, provided that they did not turn away his heart. But Simeon said that he must not marry even one wife who would turn away his heart. The Mishnah concluded that [...] prohibited the king from marrying more than 18 wives, even if they were all as righteous as Abigail the wife of David.. The Gemara noted that Judah did not always employ the rationale behind a Biblical passage as a basis for limiting its legal effect, as he did here in [...] The Gemara explained that Rabbi Judah employed the rationale behind the law here because [...] itself expounds the rationale behind its legal constraint: The reason behind the command, [...] "he shall not multiply wives to himself," [...] is so [...] "that his heart be not turned aside." [...] Thus Rabbi Judah reasoned that [...] itself restricts the law to these conditions, and a king could have more wives if [...] "his heart be not turned aside." [...] The Gemara noted that Simeon did not always interpret a Biblical passage strictly by its plain meaning, as he appeared <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> in [...] The Gemara explained that Simeon could have reasoned that [...] adds the words, [...] "that his heart turn not away," [...] to imply that the king must not marry even a single wife who might turn away his heart. And one could interpret the words [...] "he shall not multiply" [...] to mean that the king must not marry many wives even if they, like Abigail, would never turn away his heart. The Gemara then analyzed how the anonymous first view in [...] came to its conclusion that the king could have no more than 18 wives. The Gemara noted that [...] refers to the children of six of David's wives born to David in Hebron. The Gemara reasoned that the prophet Nathan referred to these six wives in [...] when he said, [...] "And if that were too little, then would I add to you the like of these, and the like of these," [...] each [...] "these" [...] implying six more wives. Thus with the original six, these two additions of six would make 18 in all.|$|E
