5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> them. The false chanterelle was then {{placed in the}} genus Clitocybe, but it was later observed that its forked gills and dextrinoid spores indicated a relationship to Paxillus. Genetic analysis has confirmed that {{it belongs to the}} order Boletales and is more closely related to boletes.|$|E

5|$|Mimicry {{occurs when}} an {{organism}} (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> a third organism. This {{results in the}} mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve aposematic coloration, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.|$|E
5|$|Operation Ironside formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception intended <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> the Axis {{high command}} as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. The overall aim of Bodyguard was to tie down German forces away from Normandy by threatening other targets. Ironside's specific {{objective was to}} tie up the 17th SS and 11th Panzer divisions deployed {{in the south of}} France.|$|E
5|$|Operation Royal Flush formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception intended <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> the Axis {{high command}} as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings.

It evolved from Operation Graffham, a political deception aimed at Sweden between February and March 1944.|$|E

5|$|Operations Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{tactical}} military deceptions {{conducted on}} 6 June 1944 {{in support of}} the Allied landings in Normandy. The operations formed the naval component of Operation Bodyguard, a wider series of tactical and strategic deceptions surrounding the invasion. Small boats, along with aircraft from RAF Bomber Command, simulated invasion fleets approaching Cap d'Antifer, Pas-de-Calais and Normandy. Glimmer and Taxable played on the German belief, amplified by Allied deception efforts over the preceding months, that the main invasion force would land in the Calais region. Big Drum was positioned on the western flank of the real invasion force to try <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> German forces about the scale of the landings. These operations complemented Operation Titanic, which was intended <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> the Germans about the D-Day airborne forces.|$|E

5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> onlookers.|$|E

5|$|Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum were World War II {{deception}} operations. They {{were conducted}} {{as part of}} Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic military deception intended to support the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in June 1944. Bodyguard was designed <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the invasion. The London Controlling Section (LCS) had spent some time convincing German commanders that the fictional First United States Army Group (FUSAG) represented {{the bulk of the}} Allied invasion force. FUSAG's existence was fabricated through Operation Fortitude South.|$|E
5|$|In {{the lead}} up to the assault on Musa Qaleh, members of the Brigade Reconnaissance Force {{provided}} vital intelligence for the upcoming operation. Coalition military manoeuvres and a build-up of troops and supplies continued for weeks before the assault. On 1 November, British forces started reconnaissance patrols {{in preparation for the}} attack. In the middle of that month, the MOD reported that troops from Brigade Reconnaissance Force (BRF), 40 Commando Royal Marines and the Right Flank Company of the Scots Guards were patrolling outside the town <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> the Taliban insurgents and disrupt their supply routes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at Cap Nègre to {{the west}} of the main invasion, a large group of French commandos {{destroyed}} German artillery emplacements as part of Operation Romeo. Their main effort was supported by diversionary flank landings by other commando teams. While the main mission succeeded, 67 French commandos were taken prisoner after they ran into a minefield. In addition to the commando operations, another operation was carried out, named Operation Span. This was a deception plan, aimed <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> the German defenders with fake landings and paratroopers, to disperse them from the actual landing zones.|$|E

The castle complex originally contained 84 gates, 15 of which were named according to the Japanese syllabary (I, Ro, Ha, Ni, Ho, He, To, etc.). At present, 21 gates from the castle complex remain intact, 13 of which are named according to the Japanese syllabary.|$|E
5|$|Operation Graffham formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception intended <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> the Axis {{high command}} as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. One {{of the key}} elements of Bodyguard was Operation Fortitude North, which promoted a fictional threat against Norway via wireless traffic and visual deception. Fortitude North played on German, and particularly Adolf Hitler's, belief that Norway was a key objective for the Allies (although they had earlier considered and rejected the option).|$|E
5|$|Originally the {{operation}} was due to begin on January 1, but poor ice conditions on the Neva caused the offensive to be delayed until January 10–12. A number of measures were taken to prevent the details of {{the operation}} being revealed to the Germans. Only a limited number of senior officers were involved in the planning, all redeployments took place in bad weather or at night and simulated attack preparations were made elsewhere <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> the German side.|$|E
