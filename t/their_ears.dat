5|$|Visual {{displays}} mostly {{occur in}} agonistic situations. Elephants {{will try to}} appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading <b>their</b> <b>ears.</b> They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping <b>their</b> <b>ears,</b> as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> in a V shape.|$|E
5|$|Hearing is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish sense sound using their lateral lines and <b>their</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E

5|$|Southern grey desert foxes {{include the}} Asian {{subspecies}} V.v.griffithi, V.v.pusilla, and V.v.flavescens. These foxes display transitional features between northern red foxes and smaller fox species; their skulls possess more primitive, neotenous traits than the northern forms, {{and they are}} much smaller; the maximum sizes attained by southern foxes are invariably less than the average sizes of northern foxes. Their limbs are also longer, and <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> larger.|$|E
5|$|Among the Tlingit of the Pacific Northwest of America, {{earrings}} were {{a sign of}} nobility and wealth, as {{the placement}} of each earring on a child had to be purchased at an expensive potlatch. Earrings were common in the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1550–1292 BCE), generally taking {{the form of a}} dangling, gold hoop. Gem-studded, golden earrings shaped like asps seem to have been reserved for nobility. The ancient Greeks wore paste pendant earrings shaped like sacred birds or demigods, while the women of ancient Rome wore precious gemstones in <b>their</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cacambo and Candide are {{captured}} by Oreillons, or Orejones; {{members of the}} Inca nobility who widened the lobes of <b>their</b> <b>ears,</b> and are depicted here as the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a Jesuit by his robes, the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however, Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe, living on fruits and berries.|$|E

5|$|Muskrats {{spend much}} of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E
5|$|The {{piercing}} gun: The {{vast majority}} {{of women in the}} west have <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> pierced with a piercing gun. The safety of piercing guns, which were originally developed for tagging livestock, has been disputed. The Department of Health of Western Australia does not recommend their use for piercing body parts other than the lobes of ears, and the Association of Professional Piercers recommends that piercing guns not be used for any piercing, requiring members to agree not to use piercing guns in their practice.|$|E
5|$|The water bull {{is said to}} {{reproduce}} with standard cattle, the resulting progeny distinguishable by {{the small size of}} <b>their</b> <b>ears.</b> According to some myths, the calves of water bulls and ordinary cows ought to be killed at birth by any method other than drowning– they cannot be killed by drowning– to avoid bringing disaster to the herd. Conversely, in northern areas the calves are considered to be of superior quality.|$|E

5|$|These 7.5cm (3in) long {{chandelier}} earrings made by Cartier in 1929 {{have three}} large drops adorned with every modern cut of diamond. The earrings were purchased by Margaret Greville, who left {{them to her}} friend the Queen Mother in 1942, and Elizabeth's parents gave them to her in 1947 as a wedding present. However, she {{was not able to}} use them until she had her ears pierced. When the public noticed that her ears had been pierced, doctors and jewellers found themselves inundated with requests by women anxious to have <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> pierced too.|$|E
5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up {{on the slopes of}} Uhud. A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser {{running away with}} little more than a few {{scratches}} to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> and nose.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> in various directions, and {{it has been said that}} it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E
5|$|Sonderkommandos (special work crews {{forced to}} work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from <b>their</b> <b>ears.</b> The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Meatoplasty is {{the final}} and {{essential}} step in performing effective canal wall down surgery for chronic otitis media. In this article we review some previous techniques and discuss our preferred method. Materials and Methods: In this observational case series study, we used this technique in 53 patients (28 male and 25 female) between January 2005 and January 2008. Our survey was completed in 31 patients. Results: Twenty-six patients (83. 9 %) said <b>their</b> <b>ear</b> appeared normal after the procedure, but five patients (16. 1 %) complained of some minor change {{in the shape of}} <b>their</b> <b>ear.</b> Twenty-nine patients (93. 5 %) had a completely wide ear canal. The ear canal had some degree of stenosis in two patients (6. 5 %) post-operatively. Conclusion: This technique offers good functional and cosmetic results with minimal manipulation and minimal anatomic disruption...|$|R
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> warm.|$|E
5|$|The {{market was}} also the {{location}} for public punishment of wrongdoers, and stocks and a pillory were set at a prominent position at {{the eastern end of}} the Guildhall. The stocks were used for the punishment of relatively minor offences such as breaching the regulations on the price of bread, public brawling or incivility to the Mayor; wrongdoers would on occasion also be paraded around the market wearing paper hats bearing details of their offence. The pillory was used for more serious offences such as sedition. On at least two occasions in the late 16th century people convicted of sedition were nailed to the pillory by their ears; on completion of their time on the pillory <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> were cut off. Public whippings of criminals were also conducted in the marketplace. Although not all executions in the period are recorded, it is known that public hangings also took place in the market square and around the market cross.|$|E
