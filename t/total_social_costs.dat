The Kaiser Family Foundation found that raising the age of eligibility would save the federal government $5.7 billion a year, while raising costs for other payers. According to Kaiser, raising the age would cost $3.7 billion to 65- and 66-year-olds, $2.8 billion to other consumers whose premiums would rise as insurance pools absorbed more risk, $4.5 billion to employers offering insurance, and $0.7 billion to states expanding their Medicaid rolls.

40|$|A {{liability}} rule {{determines whether}} and how much damage (liability) payments are {{to be made by}} the injurer(s) to the victim(s) of an accident. Damage awards are critical for the efficiency or otherwise of liability rules. One of the factors affecting damage awards and, as a consequence, efficiency characteristics of liability rules is the errors made by courts in estimation of the harm suffered by the victims. In this paper efficiency properties of liability rules when courts make errors in estimation of the harm are studied. Effects of courts' errors on parties' behaviour regarding the levels of care they take to prevent the accident are analyzed. A condition called negligent injurer's liability is introduced. When courts make upper-biased errors, condition negligent injurer's liability is shown to be necessary and sufficient condition for a liability rule to be efficient. The notion of simple liability rules is also introduced and discussed. Analysis is carried out in a quite broader framework. In particular, the standard assumption that costs of care and expected loss functions are such that <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of accident are minimized at a unique configuration of care levels is relaxed.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how parking fee and parking supply {{can be designed}} to mit-igate traffic congestion, and to reduce <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> Vickrey’s morning commute model is extended to incorporate travelers ’ choices between two parking areas (clusters). We first derive the travel patterns under different parking capacities, parking fees and accessibility to the destination; then perform a sensitivity analysis to reveal the effect of each factor on network performance and travel profiles. Some interesting findings are: 1) Enlarging the central parking lots is not always desirable; 2) Parking fee and capacity should be set {{in a way that}} commuters prefer to park in the farther area during early arrival; and 3) A shorter access time always reduces the so-cial costs. Finally, we derive the optimal parking fees, capacities and access times which altogether yield the minimum <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> When the closer parking cluster does not have too large an accessibility advantage over the farther one, the optimal travel profile is such that both parking clusters are utilized. As a result, the optimal parking solution can effectively reduce both the social costs and the queuing delay. Even more intriguing is that, com-pared to the case without parking choices, all travelers are better off under the optimal parking solution, which cannot be achieved by only imposing a system-optimal dynamic toll...|$|E

Congestion pricing under uncertainty has been relatively little studied. In this paper, we review the literature on deterministic {{congestion pricing}} and introduce possible sources of uncertainty for a simple bottleneck. We show that, when prices involve exogenous uncertainty that is independent of the central authority and of individual drivers, <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> may be expressed in closed form as a function of departure time and uncertainty. We also show that there is a class of financial derivatives based on congestion that have the potential to reduce <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>cost.</b> In particular, such derivatives are shown to have the potential to alter drivers' departure behavior and reduce drivers' risks of high variance in trip costs, including congestion tolls.

Several parameters are key to calculating optimal levels of punishment: <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>costs,</b> total social benefits, and the probability that offenders are apprehended. However, levels of punishment are often determined by aggregating individual decisions.

40|$|In recent years, on {{the basis}} of static allocative {{efficiency}} properties economists have advocated the use of taxation as an economically efficient means of control to implement environmental protection policy. Environmental problems, however, do not always develop smoothly and gradually but are often characterized by infrequent serious crises that require rapid, but temporary, changes in the controlling mechanism. Tax policy is inappropriate for such crises, but direct controls can be implemented rapidly to handle such emergencies. Using simple stochastic models to represent the physical environment, we show that the pollution control policy which minimizes <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> (stationary social costs plus short-term emergency costs) is a mixed policy in which taxes are used to control the long-run equilibrium level of pollution and direct controls are used in short-term emergencies to maintain the pollution at satisfactory level.

The efficiency analysis incorporating the causation requirement of law of Torts, whenever undertaken, is largely restricted only to the rule of negligence. One of the aims of this paper is to provide an efficiency characterization of the entire class of liability rules when the `causation' requirement of the law is taken into account.
