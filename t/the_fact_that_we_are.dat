25|$|Gestalt Therapy, an {{approach}} created by Fritz Perls, {{was based on}} phenomenology, existentialism and also Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Perls {{spent some time in}} Japanese Zen monasteries and his therapeutic techniques include mindfulness practices and focusing on the present moment. Practices outlined by Perls himself in Ego, hunger and aggression (1969), such as “concentration on eating” (“we have to be fully aware of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> eating”) and “awareness continuum” are strikingly similar to Buddhist mindfulness training. Other authors in Gestalt Therapy who were influenced by Buddhism are Barry Stevens (therapist) and Dick Price (who developed Gestalt Practice by including Buddhist meditation).|$|E

[...] "Our new leaders seemed to turn their backs upon the sea and to ignore <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> an island". Each year the fleet declined. In 1923, the merchant fleet consisted of 127 ships. This number dropped every year until 1939 when, {{at the start of}} World War II, the fleet numbered only 56 ships. Only 5% of imports were carried on Irish flagged vessels. There were several reasons for this decline: a consequence of the war of independence, a policy of self-sufficiency, the economic depression, the lack of investment and government neglect. Foreign ships, on which Ireland had hitherto depended, were withdrawn. [...] "In the period April 1941 and June 1942 only seven such ships visited the country".|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} Disney.com observed, [...] "The creepiness of this song {{lies in the}} fact that the very untrustworthy Mother Gothel is {{positioning}} herself as a helpful figure to Rapunzel." [...] Brian Galindo of BuzzFeed wrote that the song, its purpose having been summarized by Curt Holman of Creative Loafing as [...] "simply to manipulate Rapunzel into staying at home," [...] "perfectly disguises Mother Gothel's true motives." [...] According to Simon Miraudo of Quickflix, Gothel craftily uses the song to guilt trip Rapunzel [...] "into staying in the tower ... frightened into imagining the horrors that lay outside her door." [...] In her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) the Art of Adapting Fairy Tales, author Conny Eisfeld observed that [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] emphasizes Gothel's [...] "status of superiority", in spite of the fact that [...] "her existence solely depend on Rapunzel." [...] Bitch identified Gothel as an abusive mother, writing, [...] "she is manipulative, dishonest, and dedicated to undermining her daughter's independence. This is shown consistently through all her appearances in the film, but comes out clearly very early indeed, with the song 'Mother Knows Best'. Critics have often identified the sequence as one of the film's darkest and edgiest moments. Acknowledging the song's [...] "extremely dark undertone", Anthony Falco of Film Class Junkies wrote, [...] "This song rues in the fact that a child is impressionable; Rapunzel believes that Mother Gothel has the best intentions, but obviously, the evil witch is using the princess for her own gains. Falco continued, [...] "The audience knows what Gothel wants with Rapunzel, but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> unable to protect the naïve princess results in further hatred for the witch." [...] Falco also concluded that Gothel's [...] "sinister reprise at the end of Tangled allows for these horrifying undertones to emerge, which makes 'Mother Knows Best' one of the most sinister villain songs in the Disney library." [...] Similarly, Elissa Smith of Paper Droids wrote that while the audience is fully aware of Gothel's evil intentions, Rapunzel is denied [...] "the outsider's point of view." [...] Glen Chapman of Den of Geek wrote that the scene [...] "strikes a balance between melodic and narrative sophistication, as well as being equal parts sweet and sinister." [...] Gothel later reprises the song [...] "in indelible fashion." ...|$|E

[...] A slightly larger quantity of dark energy, or a slightly larger value of the cosmological constant would have caused space to expand rapidly enough that galaxies would not form.

The show's executive producer predicted that Malakar would not win. Some commentators have remarked that the judges seemed to have stopped giving thoughtful critiques of Malakar's performances. The judges seemed stunned by his large following of voters. Randy Jackson went as far to remark that [...] "I cannot even say anything on the vocals anymore", in his critique of Malakar after his performance during the top nine. Chris Ayres of The Times speculated {{that it would have been}} a turning point leading toward decline and eventual cancellation for American Idol if Malakar had won.

2500|$|McKenna saw the universe, in {{relation}} to Novelty theory, as having a teleological attractor {{at the end of}} time, which increases interconnectedness and would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity. He also frequently referred to this as [...] "the transcendental object at the end of time." [...] When describing this model of the universe he stated that: [...] "The universe is not being pushed from behind. The universe is being pulled from the future toward a goal that is as inevitable as a marble reaching the bottom of a bowl when you release it up near the rim. If you do that, you know the marble will roll {{down the side of the}} bowl, down, down, down – until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That's precisely my model of human history. I'm suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is based on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now very, very close to the attractor." [...] Therefore, according to McKenna's final interpretation of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012 we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced. An event he described as a [...] "concrescence", a [...] "tightening 'gyre'" [...] with everything flowing together. Speculating that [...] "when the laws of physics are obviated, the universe disappears, and what is left is the tightly bound plenum, the monad, able to express itself for itself, rather than only able to cast a shadow into physis as its reflection...It will be the entry of our species into 'hyperspace', but it will appear to be the end of physical laws, accompanied by the release of the mind into the imagination." ...|$|E
