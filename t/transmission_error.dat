40|$|A new {{approach}} for determination of machine-tool settings for {{spiral bevel gears}} is proposed. The proposed settings provide a predesigned parabolic function of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> and the desired location and orientation of the bearing contact. The predesigned parabolic function of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> is able to absorb piece-wise linear functions of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> that are caused by the gear misalignment and reduce gear noise. The gears are face-milled by head cutters with conical surfaces or surfaces of revolution. A computer program for simulation of meshing, bearing contact and determination of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> for misaligned gear has been developed...|$|R

5000|$|The {{repetition}} codes {{can detect}} up to [...] <b>transmission</b> <b>errors.</b> Decoding errors {{occur when the}} more than these <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> occur.

5000|$|In Bisync, the NAK {{is used to}} {{indicate}} that a <b>transmission</b> <b>error</b> was detected in the previously received block and that the receiver is ready to accept retransmission of that block.

50|$|The 10 bits {{sent back}} from the antenna are largely unused. Only the first two bits are used {{with at least one}} of those being used for a <b>transmission</b> <b>error</b> flag; the {{remaining}} 8 bits are reserved. The contents of the 14 bits sent to the antenna are not revealed.|$|E
30|$|Another {{appealing}} {{property of}} DVC is its good resilience to <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> {{due to its}} intrinsic joint source-channel coding framework. A thorough analysis of its performance {{in the presence of}} <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> has been presented in [5], showing its good error resilience properties. This results from the fact that DVC is based on a statistical framework rather than the closed-loop prediction used in conventional video coding. Recently, the rapid growth of Internet and wireless communications has led to increased interest for robust transmission of compressed video. However, <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> may severely impact video quality as compressed data is very sensitive to these errors [6]. Thus, error control techniques are necessary for efficient video <b>transmission</b> over <b>error</b> prone channels.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research on}} {{two aspects of}} distributed speech recognition (DSR) {{in the presence of}} channel <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> in wireless network environments. The first is on experiments with a frame-based channel error protection scheme, where in previous research we reported results from experiments using randomly distributed bit-errors. This paper presents results from experiments using three additional, more realistic error distributions: burst-like packet loss, GSM error patterns and UMTS statistics. The second is on exploiting the knowledge about channel <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> for the purpose of optimising the Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) detection. <b>Transmission</b> <b>errors</b> influence the acoustic likelihood, and therefore affect the optimal threshold setting for discrimination between In-Vocabulary (IV) words and OOV words. An OOV-detection method is proposed in which the estimated Frame-Error-Rate (FER) is used to adjust the discrimination threshold. Results from experiments are reported over a range of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes {{scheduling}} {{methods to}} reduce the burst <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> between the wireless nodes. <b>Transmission</b> <b>errors</b> are rectified by decreasing the chances of root fading. Best afford path is proposed to handle root fading and to decrease the <b>transmission</b> <b>errors.</b> This method overcomes the problem of network misbehavior that is not addressed in CNC but concentrates in NUM. We also use honey comb algorithm to extend the CNC initiated to the source node throughout the network for other nodes depending upon the network type and thus improving the mechanism when the size of network increases; scalability...|$|R
50|$|Other slower {{but more}} rugged forms of VSB include 2VSB, 4VSB, and 8VSB. 16VSB {{is capable of}} twice the data {{capacity}} of 8VSB; while 8VSB delivers 19.39 Mbit/s (Megabits per second) in a 6-MHz television channel, 16VSB could deliver 38.78 Mbit/s, while making the sacrifice of being more prone to <b>transmission</b> <b>error.</b>|$|E
5000|$|We {{want to give}} [...] the {{standard}} basis because each coordinate represents a [...] "bit" [...] that is transmitted across a [...] "noisy channel" [...] with some small probability of <b>transmission</b> <b>error</b> (a binary symmetric channel). If some other basis is used then this model cannot be used and the Hamming metric does not measure the number of errors in transmission, as we want it to.|$|E
5000|$|This {{mechanism}} {{enables the}} detection of single bit errors, because if one bit gets flipped due to line noise, {{there will be an}} incorrect number of ones in the received data. In the two examples above, B's calculated parity value matches the parity bit in its received value, indicating there are no single bit errors. Consider the following example with a <b>transmission</b> <b>error</b> in the second bit using XOR: ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to design pinion machine tool-settings for spiral bevel gears by controlling contact path and <b>transmission</b> <b>errors.</b> It is based on the satisfaction of contact condition of three given control points on the tooth surface. The three meshing points are controlled to be on a predesigned straight contact path that meets the pre-designed parabolic function of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors.</b> Designed separately, the magnitude of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> and the orientation of the contact path are subjected to precise control. In addition, {{in order to meet the}} manufacturing requirements, we suggest to modify the values of blank offset, one of the pinion machine tool-settings, and redesign pinion machine tool-settings to ensure that the magnitude and the geometry of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> should not be influenced apart from minor effects on the predesigned straight contact path. The proposed approach together with its ideas has been proven by a numerical example and the manufacturing practice of a pair of spiral bevel gears...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the delay performance of Enhanced relay-enabled Distributed Coordination Function (ErDCF) for wireless ad hoc networks under ideal condition {{and in the}} presence of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors.</b> Relays are nodes capable of supporting high data rates for other low data rate nodes. In ideal channel ErDCF achieves higher throughput and reduced energy consumption compared to IEEE 802. 11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). This gain is still maintained {{in the presence of}} errors. It is also expected of relays to reduce the delay. However, the impact on the delay behavior of ErDCF under <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> is not known. In this work, we have presented the impact of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> on delay. It turns out that under <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> of sufficient magnitude to increase dropped packets, packet delay is reduced. This is due to increase in the probability of failure. As a result the packet drop time increases, thus reflecting the throughput degradation. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{management}} and control of telecommunication activities and networks is a responsibility of telecommunications control software. Telecommunications control software {{can be in the}} form of many different components to include; telecommunication monitors, network management components, network operating systems for network servers, microcomputer Web browsers, etc. This software can reside on almost any component of the network and can provide such features as performance monitoring, activity monitoring, priority assigning, <b>transmission</b> <b>error</b> correction and network problem mitigation.|$|E
50|$|The error {{recovery}} procedure is very fast. When a receiver detects a <b>transmission</b> <b>error</b> in the received data stream, the receiver causes its associated transmitter {{to send a}} Packet Not Accepted control symbol. When the link partner receives a Packet Not Accepted control symbol, it stops transmitting new packets and sends a Link Request/Port Status control symbol. The Link Response control symbol indicates the ackID that {{should be used for}} the next packet transmitted. Packet transmission then resumes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Precise {{positioning}} {{and precise}} force control requirement in haptic devices necessitate the calibration of the device. Since force control algorithms in haptic interfaces employ Jacobian matrix that includes kinematic model parameters, calibration {{is not only}} important for pose accuracy but also for force control. The deviation in kinematic parameters and joint <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> are main reasons disturbing the calibration of the haptic devices. Capstan drives and parallelogram mechanisms are preferred to use for actuation in haptic device design. Their <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> should be estimated in the calibration. This paper presents a simulation study including the estimation of kinematic parameters and <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> due to the capstan drives and parallelogram mechanism for a PHANTOM Premium haptic device...|$|R
3000|$|These {{expressions}} {{together with}} those defined earlier {{will give the}} energy consumption {{in the case of}} <b>transmission</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{this section}} we take into {{consideration}} the impact of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> on the energy consumption. Unlike collision which occurs at the first control packet, <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> can occur at any packet. Therefore it is important to {{take into consideration}} that even with successful reception of one or more packets involved in the transmission a failure can still take place due to one of the following packets being in error.|$|R
5000|$|An error {{detection}} code {{can be defined as}} a function that computes the [...] (amount of redundant bits) corresponding to each string of [...] total number of bits. The simplest {{error detection}} code is the parity bit, which allows a receiver to detect transmission errors that have affected a single bit among the transmitted [...] bits. If there are two or more bits in error, the receiver {{may not be able to}} detect the <b>transmission</b> <b>error.</b>|$|E
50|$|Beside framing, {{data link}} layers also include {{mechanisms}} {{to detect and}} even recover from transmission errors. For a receiver to detect <b>transmission</b> <b>error,</b> the sender must add redundant information (in the form of bits) as an error detection code to the frame sent. When the receiver obtains a frame with an error detection code it recomputes it and verifies whether the received error detection code matches the computed error detection code. If they match the frame {{is considered to be}} valid.|$|E
50|$|With this checksum, any <b>transmission</b> <b>error</b> which flips {{a single}} {{bit of the}} message, or an odd number of bits, will be {{detected}} as an incorrect checksum. However, an error which affects two bits will not be detected if those bits lie at the same position in two distinct words. Also swapping {{of two or more}} words will not be detected. If the affected bits are independently chosen at random, the probability of a two-bit error being undetected is 1/n.|$|E

ErDCF achieves higher throughput and reduces energy consumption compared to IEEE 802. 11 distributed coordination function (DCF) in an ideal channel environment. However, {{there is a possibility}} that this expected gain may decrease in the presence of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors.</b> In this work, we modify the saturation throughput model of ErDCF to accurately reflect the impact of <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> under different rate combinations. It turns out that the throughput gain of ErDCF can still be maintained under reasonable link quality and distance...|$|R

The contact stress and <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> under load were examined. First, a mesh generation program was developed according to the mathematical model of a curvilinear gear generated using a male fly cutter. A finite element model containing one contacting tooth pair was built, and the mesh density at the contact-sensitive area was adjusted to attain a reasonable finite element model for estimating the contact pressure. Adequate mesh density at the possible contact region predicted by tooth contact analysis was defined based on the theoretical Hertzian contact stress and the calculated contact ellipse. A finite element model containing five tooth pairs was developed and applied to examine the contact stress and <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> under load of the modified curvilinear gear set. Finally, numerical examples were provided to demonstrate the contact stress and <b>transmission</b> <b>errors</b> under load for various design parameters and loads...|$|R
