5|$|The bill imposed fines {{on anyone}} who {{imported}} or traded in unlicensed or foreign books, required every book for which copyright protection was sought to be {{entered into the}} Stationers' Register, provided a legal deposit system centred around the King's Library, the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, but said nothing about limiting the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright.</b> It also specified that books were property; {{an emphasis on the}} idea that authors deserved copyright simply due to their efforts. The Stationers were enthusiastic, urging Parliament to pass the bill, and it received its second reading on 9 February. A Committee of the Whole met to amend it on 21 February, with further alterations made when it was passed back to the House of Commons on 25 February. Alterations during this period included minor changes, such as extending the legal deposit system to cover Sion College and the Faculty of Advocates, but also major ones, including the introduction of a limit on the length of time for which copyright would be granted.|$|E

25|$|In the European Union, {{copyrights}} {{have been}} harmonized amongst {{the member states}} by the EU directive 93/98/EEC on harmonising the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> protection. This binding directive, which became effective on July 1, 1995, has raised the duration of copyrights throughout the union to 70 years p.m.a. It also includes in its article 7 a mandatory rule of the shorter term for works from non-EU countries. Within the EU, no comparison of terms is applied, and—as in the Berne Convention or in the UCC—existing international obligations (such as bilateral treaties) may override this rule of the shorter term. Directive 93/98/EEC was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights.|$|E

500|$|... The 2010 {{circular}} by the United States Copyright Office {{provides an}} explanation for the necessity for copyright renewal: [...] "Copyrights whose first 28-year <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> was secured between January 1, 1950, and December 31, 1963, including works protected in their first term under the Universal Copyright Convention, still had to be renewed within strict time limits in order to receive the maximum statutory duration. U.S. Adherence to the Berne Convention did not alter this requirement. Renewal registration had to be made within a year period beginning on December 31 of the 27th year of the copyright and running through December 31 of the following year. [...] However, if renewal registration was not made within the statutory time limits, these copyrights expired {{at the end of their}} first terms and protection was lost permanently." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{right of}} {{integrity}} protects authors from having their copyrighted works altered {{in such a}} fashion as to constitute a [...] "distortion" [...] or [...] "mutilation" [...] of the original work, or {{in a way that}} harms the author's reputation or honour. Cases vary as to how the right of integrity should be interpreted, with some judges saying that [...] "distortion" [...] or [...] "mutilation" [...] should be taken {{to be part of the}} wider clause on reputation and honour to avoid subjective decisions, and others interpreting each clause as distinct types of violation. The right to object to false attribution protects individuals from being identified as the authors of works they have not contributed to; unlike the other moral rights it exists only for the individual's lifetime and the 20 years after death, not for the full <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright.</b> The United Kingdom's law on moral rights has been criticised for failing to correctly implement the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and for being unreasonably narrow in the types of creative works it covers.|$|E
500|$|It also {{marked the}} first time that {{copyright}} had been vested primarily in the author, rather than the publisher, and also {{the first time that the}} injurious treatment of authors by publishers was recognised; regardless of what authors signed away, the second 14-year <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> would automatically return to them. Even in the 21st century, the Statute of Anne is [...] "frequently invoked by modern judges and academics as embodying the utilitarian underpinnings of copyright law". In IceTV v Nine Network, for example, the High Court of Australia noted that the title of the Statute [...] "echoed explicitly the emphasis on the practical or utilitarian importance that certain seventeenth-century philosophers attached to knowledge and its encouragement in the scheme of human progress". Despite [...] "widely recognised flaws", the Act became a model copyright statute, both within the United Kingdom and internationally. Christophe Geiger notes that it is [...] "a difficult, almost impossible task" [...] to analyse the relationship between the Statute of Anne and early French copyright law, both because it is difficult to make a direct connection, and because the ongoing debate over both has led to radically different interpretations of each nation's law.|$|E

500|$|Similarly, Belgium took {{no direct}} {{influence}} from the Statute or English copyright theory, but Joris Deene of the University of Ghent identifies an indirect influence [...] "at two levels"; {{the criteria for}} what constitutes copyrightable material, which comes {{from the work of}} English theorists such as Locke and Edward Young, and the underlying justification of copyright law. In Belgium, this justification is both that copyright serves the public interest, and that copyright is a [...] "private right" [...] that serves the interests of individual authors. Both theories were taken into account in Donaldson v Beckett, {{as well as in the}} drafting of the Statute of Anne, and Deene infers that they subsequently affected the Belgian debates over their first copyright statute. In the United States, the Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution and the first Federal copyright statute, the Copyright Act of 1790, both draw on the Statute of Anne. The 1790 Act contains provisions for a 14-year <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> and sections that provide for authors who published their works before 1790, both of which mirror the protection offered by the Statute 80 years previously.|$|E

In that case, the United States Supreme Court rejected {{a challenge to the}} Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, also known pejoratively as the [...] "Mickey Mouse Protection Act." [...] Petitioners in that case argued that successive retroactive extensions of copyright were functionally unlimited and hence violated the limited times language of the clause. [...] Justice Ginsburg, writing for the Court, rejected this argument, reasoning that the terms provided by the Act were limited in duration and noted that Congress had a long history of granting retroactive extensions.|$|E
