5|$|The Lakers {{earned the}} <b>top</b> <b>pick</b> in the 1958 NBA draft {{and used it}} to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, {{averaged}} 24.9ppg and 15.0rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record. After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.|$|E
5|$|At his Pro Day workout, Vick ran the 40-yard dash in 4.33 seconds; {{his time}} has been clocked as low as 4.25, which is the fastest-ever for an NFL quarterback. Vick was {{selected}} first in the 2001 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons, becoming the first African-American quarterback to be taken with the <b>top</b> <b>pick.</b> The San Diego Chargers had the number-one selection but traded it to Atlanta Falcons {{the day before the}} draft for the Falcons' first- and third-round picks in 2001. Vick was taken in the 30th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft by the Colorado Rockies, despite not playing baseball since the 8th grade.|$|E
5|$|While {{new owner}} Charlie Thomas {{expressed}} interest in renewing with Moses Malone, who had been again chosen as MVP in 1981–82, the Rockets traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers for Caldwell Jones, as a declining regional economy made the Rockets unable to pay Malone's salary. When the Rockets finished a league worst 14–68, Celtics coach Bill Fitch was hired to replace outgoing Del Harris, and the team won the first pick of the 1983 NBA draft, used to select Ralph Sampson from the University of Virginia. Sampson had good numbers and was awarded the NBA Rookie of the Year award, but the Rockets still finished last overall, again getting the <b>top</b> <b>pick</b> at the upcoming 1984 NBA draft, used to select Hakeem Olajuwon from the University of Houston.|$|E

5|$|The 1986 Tampa Bay Buccaneers {{season began}} with the team trying to improve on an 2–14 season. This {{was one of the}} worst seasons in {{franchise}} history. There is some sentiment that the 1986 team was even worse than the winless team of 1976, and the 473 points conceded was not beaten by any NFL team until the 2001 Indianapolis Colts gave up 486. The Buccaneers selected Bo Jackson with the <b>top</b> <b>pick</b> in the draft, but were unable to convince him to join the team. Three weeks after the draft, Jackson signed a three-year baseball contract with the Kansas City Royals. Despite holding four of the first forty selections in the draft, and the presence of a great influx of fresh talent from defunct USFL teams, the Buccaneers were unable to find any impact players in either the draft or free agency. They entered the season with a roster nearly identical to the previous season's 2–14 team.|$|E
5|$|After a brief search, Ernie Accorsi hired former Jacksonville Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin {{to be the}} Giants' head coach. Coughlin was {{considered}} a disciplinarian, {{in contrast to the}} departed Fassel, whose lenient style was criticized in his final years with the club. Accorsi coveted quarterback Eli Manning, brother of Peyton and son of Archie, in the 2004 NFL Draft. Manning had indicated before the draft {{that he did not want}} to play for the San Diego Chargers, who held the <b>top</b> <b>pick.</b> The Chargers drafted him nonetheless, and then traded him to the Giants for their first round picks in 2004 and 2005. The Giants released Kerry Collins, who was unhappy with a backup role, and signed veteran quarterback Kurt Warner. The plan was for Warner to be the starter, while the team groomed Manning to ultimately take over the job. After losing to the Eagles in the 2004 season opener, the Giants, with Warner at quarterback, won five of their next six games, making them 5–2. After losing two close games, to the Bears and Cardinals, to drop to 5–4, Coughlin announced that Manning would start the rest of the season. Manning struggled, and the Giants did not score more than 14 points in their next four games. He performed better later in the season, but the Giants finished the season 6–10. Barber established a career-high in rushing with 1,518yards. He also had 52 catches and a total of 15 touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994–95 NCAA season, {{the sophomore}} was soon {{called one of}} the best {{eligible}} NBA prospects, along with his peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse. Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the <b>top</b> <b>pick</b> in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone {{he had no intention of}} going pro until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. He was giving up a lot of money, but was determined to stay in school. In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against a Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime. In the NCAA Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but his team lost 71–66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game. He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.|$|E

25|$|The lone {{bright spot}} {{during this period}} was the Spurs being awarded the <b>top</b> <b>pick</b> in the 1987 NBA draft through NBA Draft Lottery.

25|$|Heading {{into the}} draft Jones was again named {{the number one}} overall prospect.

The said trade was lambasted by most fans, and it cost Ginebra their performance for the year where they compiled a 9–26 record in all three conferences.

Much was made of Cowboys longtime head coach Tom Landry watching Aikman practice at Texas Stadium, UCLA's practice facility for game preparation. Landry never got to draft Aikman, because he was fired the next month, but his successor, Jimmy Johnson, did. UCLA and Aikman won, 17–3.|$|E

The proposed changes would take away the advantage of having the worst record in the league (currently the worst team is given a 25% chance at the pick), and would work to keep teams competitive throughout the entire season.|$|E
