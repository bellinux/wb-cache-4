25|$|Family life or sex {{education}} in the public schools, which traditionally has consisted largely of providing factual information at the secondary school level, is the most general or pervasive approach to preventing pregnancy among adolescents.... Adolescents who begin having sexual intercourse {{need to understand the}} importance of using an effective contraceptive every time <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex.</b> This requires convincing sexually active teens who have never used contraception to do so. In addition, sexually active teens who sometimes use contraceptives need to use them more consistently (every time <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex)</b> and use them correctly.|$|R

25|$|In 2007, a study {{ordered by}} Congress found that middle school {{students}} {{who took part in}} abstinence-only sex education programs were just as likely to have sex in their teenage years as those who did not. From 1999 to 2006, the study tracked more than 2,000 students from age 11 or 12 to age 16; the study included students who had participated in one of four abstinence education programs, as well as a control group who had not participated in such a program. By age 16, about half of each group students in the abstinence-only program as well as students in the control group were still abstinent. Abstinence program participants who became sexually active during the 7-year study period reported having similar numbers of sexual partners as their peers of the same age; moreover, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> {{for the first time at}} about the same age as other students. The study also found that students who took part in the abstinence-only programs were just as likely to use contraception when they did have sex as those who did not participate. Abstinence-only education advocates claim the study was too narrow, began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and ignored other studies that have shown positive effects.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, while Success was on {{exercise}} in South-East Asia, the ship's commanding officer was alerted to an alleged sex gambling game aboard, which challenged male sailors {{to record their}} sexual activities with female sailors in a 'ledger', and awarded them prize money based on with whom or where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex.</b> This {{was one of several}} incidents during the three-month deployment; two bars in Manila were damaged during shore leave, while at another bar in Qingdao, several sailors were involved in a public sex act. Three male sailors were removed from Success when the ship docked in Singapore, and were sent back to Australia to participate in a formal inquiry; this inquiry was found to be flawed because of bias and the denial of support to the three accused, and a second, independent inquiry was set up under former judge Roger Gyles in February 2010. The first part of Gyles' inquiry report was released in February 2011, which stated that there was an entrenched culture of sexual harassment, bullying, and predatory sexual behaviour towards female sailors, coupled with alcohol-fuelled misconduct, particularly amongst the male sailors of the ship's marine engineering department. Gyles found that although the harassment and misconduct had been occurring as early as 2004, failures to respond to earlier complaints led to a breakdown in discipline aboard Success. The former judge was unable to prove the existence of the claimed ledger, but found many of the other claims to be correct, including evidence that male sailors had placed bets around having sex with a particular female sailor.|$|E

500|$|Malone {{originally}} scripted Todd as {{a serial}} rapist. As {{part of the}} 1993 rape storyline, it was disclosed that Todd raped a woman named Carol Swift, {{a year or two}} before raping Marty, and that there were hints he raped other young women before Carol. Howarth considered Todd's rationale for raping Marty to be complex. [...] "Todd was in love with Marty," [...] he said. When Marty rejects Todd's romantic advances after their one-night stand, it is because he was cold to her that same night after <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex.</b> Marty's rejection upsets Todd and it festers. When he fails an exam after she tutors him, he blames her for the failure and begins attributing her as the reason for his problems. Howarth called Todd [...] "privileged and very rich".

500|$|Gandhi {{tried to}} test and prove to himself his brahmacharya, {{less than a}} year before his {{assassination}} in January 1948. In February 1947, he asked his confidants such as Birla and Ramakrishna if it would be wrong for him to experiment his brahmacharya oath. He began his experiments by publicly asking in February for volunteer women. He progressed from first letting different volunteers to sleep in the same room but different beds, then later in the same bed but clothed, and finally sleeping naked. Gandhi kept the bedroom doors open all night during these experiments. According to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece Manu, Gandhi feared in early 1947 that he and she may be killed by Muslims in the run up to India's independence in August 1947, and asked her when she was 18-year-old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their [...] "purity", for which she readily accepted. None of the women who participated in the brahmachari experiments of Gandhi indicated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> or that Gandhi behaved in any sexual way.
