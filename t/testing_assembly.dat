By using a functional simulator, programmers can execute and trace selected sections of source code to search for programming errors (bugs), without generating binary code. This is distinct from simulating execution of binary code, which is software emulation. The first functional simulator was written by Autonetics about 1960 for <b>testing</b> <b>assembly</b> language programs for later execution in military computer D-17B.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{automatically}} selecting items {{for inclusion in}} a test that has constraints on item content and statistical properties was applied to real data. Two tests were assembled by test specialists who assemble such tests on a routine basis. Using the same pool of items and the same constraints, the two tests were reassembled auto-matically. Test specialists {{not involved in the}} original manual <b>assembly</b> compared the <b>tests</b> constructed manually to the tests constructed automatically. The results indicated that the progress of automated <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> methods lies in improving item banking systems, classification schemes, and quality control measures, rather than in the development of different algorithms or in the improvement of computer time and cost. Index terms: heuristic algorithms, mathe-matical programming, <b>test</b> <b>assembly,</b> <b>test</b> construction, test design. The process of test construction is time consuming and expensive. Every year public and private testing organizations spend millions of dollars writing and editing items and then assembling these items into test forms for some measurement purpose. Until recently, the process of test construction or <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> has been virtually unassisted by modern psychometrics. A practical application of item response theory (IRT) suggested by Lord (1980) and Birnbaum (1968) is to use IRT in the <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> process.

40|$|IRT {{parameters}} {{have to be}} estimated, {{and because}} of the estimation process, they do have uncertainty in them. In most large scale testing programs, the parameters are stored in item banks, and automated <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> algorithms are applied to assemble operational test forms.

Besides, an alternative automated <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> algorithm is presented that is robust against uncertainties in the data.

The ISM Thermal Distortion Testing (ITDT) program was started with the primary objective to validate the ISM mechanical design process.

This-program's goal is to better ensure that ISIM meets all the mechanical and structural requirements by using test results to verify or improve structural modeling techniques. The first step to accomplish the ITDT objectives was to design, and then construct solid element models of a series 2 -D <b>test</b> <b>assemblies</b> that represent critical building blocks of the ISIM structure.

Low-voltage {{switchgear}} and controlgear assemblies with a rated short-circuit withstand strength above 10 kA, are required, by law, {{to conform}} to the South African standard, SANS 1473 - 1 (Low Voltage Switchgear and Controlgear Assemblies: Part 1 : Typetested, partially type-tested and specially <b>tested</b> <b>assemblies</b> with rated short-circuit withstand strength above lOkA). Standard SANS 1473 - 1 stipulates three categories of assemblies i. e. type-tested, partially type-tested and specially <b>tested</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The specially <b>tested</b> <b>assembly</b> is unique to the South African market, while the other two categories are stipulated in standard SANS IEC 60439 - 1 (Low Voltage Switchgear and Controlgear Assemblies: Part 1 : Type-tested and partially type-tested assemblies), which is internationally accepted in many countries as the applicable low-voltage assembly standard. Standard SANS 1473 - 1 specifies seven type-tests for certification as a type-tested assembly (TTA), but specifies, at most, three type-tests for certification as a specially <b>tested</b> <b>assembly</b> (STA).

40|$|In many high-stakes testing programs, testlets {{are used}} to {{increase}} efficiency. Since responses to items belonging to the same testlet not only depend on the latent ability but also on correct reading, understanding, and interpretation of the stimulus, the assumption of local independence does not hold. Testlet response theory (TRT) models {{have been developed to}} deal with this dependency. For both logit and probit testlet models, a random testlet effect is added to the standard logit and probit item response theory (IRT) models. Even though this testlet effect might make the IRT models more realistic, application of these models in practice leads to new questions, for example, in automated <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> (ATA). In many <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> models, goals have been formulated for the amount of information the test should provide about the candidates.

High-temperature {{evolution of the}} mechanical properties was investigated by arranging specific bending tests up to 1500 degrees C using SiC <b>testing</b> <b>assembly</b> which allowed to calculate the strain by means of curvature measurement. The mechanical properties improved with increasing the testing temperature, due to the inelastic deformation and stress relaxation which counteracted the sintering effects.

40|$|Many modern optical designs employ diamond-turned optical {{components}} and utilize phase retrieval for metrology during <b>testing,</b> <b>assembly,</b> and commissioning. The {{accuracy of the}} wavefronts obtained by phase retrieval depends on the fidelity of the system model used during the retrieval, including knowledge of the pupil amplitude, {{and the relationship between}} the digital sample spacing in the pupil and each point spread function (PSF), i. e., the plate scale. However, recent simulations have shown that errors in the estimation of both the plate scale and unknown pupil vignetting can both lead to mid-spatial-frequency groove-like errors in the wavefront maps obtained by phase retrieval. In particular, these errors manifest themselves as concentric rings resembling diamond-turning tooling marks, and can therefore easily confound metrology results involving diamond-turned components. Furthermore it was found that only moderate amounts of pupil vignetting, and errors in sampling ratio as low as 2 % produced groove errors consistent in magnitude with typical diamond-turning specifications.

However, the influence of grinding and aging when using a thinner layer of the material is unclear. This investigation aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of ceramic thickness (0. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm), grinding and aging (low-temperature degradation) on the mechanical behavior and surface characteristics of a full-contour Y-TZP ceramic. Y-TZP disc-shaped specimens (15 mm diameter) were manufactured with both thicknesses and randomly assigned into 4 groups considering the factors ‘grinding with diamond bur’ and ‘aging in autoclave’. Surface topography (roughness, 3 D profilometry and SEM), phase transformation, flexural strength and structural reliability (Weibull) analyses were executed. Grinding affected the surface topography, while aging did not promote any effect.
