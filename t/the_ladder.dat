5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>Ladder</b> match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> Michaels then set <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> He then hit Michaels with <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked <b>the</b> <b>ladder,</b> which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto <b>the</b> <b>ladder,</b> and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E
5|$|The event, {{featuring}} commentary by Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler and Booker T, {{began with}} the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match. During the bout, Sheamus slammed Sin Cara through a ladder propped between the ring apron and the announcers' table with a powerbomb. <b>The</b> <b>ladder</b> was bent in half and Cara was stretchered away from ringside. Near {{the end of the}} match, Barrett, Rhodes and Bryan were the only three in the ring. Bryan put Rhodes in a guillotine choke submission hold on top of <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> {{in the middle of the}} ring while Barrett sneaked up the other side of <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> After Bryan knocked Rhodes off <b>the</b> <b>ladder,</b> Barrett got Bryan onto his shoulders and tried to throw him off. Bryan countered with repeated elbow strikes to Barrett's head. Bryan then kicked Barrett in the head and unhooked the briefcase to win the contest.|$|E
5|$|The first {{main event}} match was the TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal, {{the winner of}} which would become the number one {{contender}} to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. It involved Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Gail Kim, Jackie Moore, ODB, Salinas, Rhaka Khan, Roxxi Laveaux, Traci Brooks, and Velvet Sky. This contest involved two stages; {{the first was a}} standard battle royal. After all but two wrestlers were eliminated, stage two, a ladder match, began. The winner of <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> match would become the number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship; the loser would have her head shaved. The final four were Kim, Laveaux, Love, and ODB. The next eliminated was ODB, followed by Love; both were eliminated by Laveaux. Only Kim and Laveaux remained for <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> match portion. Kim had won immunity on the May8 episode of Impact!, so if Laveaux won the match, then Love's head would be shaven. Love and Sky interfered in the contest several times. During the bout, as Kim and Laveaux stood on <b>the</b> <b>ladder,</b> Kim flipped over Laveaux, grabbed her around the legs, and slammed her into the mat back-first with a powerbomb. Laveaux's head was legitimately cut open during this stage. Later, while Laxeaux climbed <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> in an attempt to retrieve the contract, Love interfered by pushing <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> over. Kim followed by climbing <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> and grabbing the contract to win the encounter at ten minutes. Afterwards, Laveaux was forced to have her head shaven.|$|E
40|$|It {{becomes more}} and more {{recognized}} that children should be involved in a product’s design and evaluation process. Many findings report on the methodology for usability research with children. However, there has been relatively little analysis of likeability research with children. In this paper, we propose <b>the</b> <b>laddering</b> method—traditionally a marketing method among adults—for likeability research in the domain of child–computer interaction. Three exploratory cases will be described. The cases report on the use of <b>the</b> <b>laddering</b> method with children aged between 7 and 16 to evaluate the likeability of two games. The lessons learnt about the use of <b>the</b> <b>laddering</b> method will be discussed in great detail. In order to adapt <b>the</b> <b>laddering</b> method to work with children, we recommend a variation of this method and call it <b>the</b> ‘contextual <b>laddering</b> method’. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{main event}} match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Shawn Michaels) saw Adrian Neville challenging Bo Dallas in the first-ever ladder {{match for the}} NXT Championship. In {{the first half of}} the match, Dallas attempted to climb a ladder while he pinned Neville under <b>the</b> <b>ladder,</b> but Neville used his legs to push <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> over. Near the end of the match, Neville attempted his signature Red Arrow, but Dallas pushed him off the ropes to the apron and the floor. Neville recovered and used the ropes to springboard over a climbing Dallas and leapfrog him on <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> In response, Dallas powerbombed Neville onto a ladder in the corner of the ring. Dallas then charged while holding a ladder, but Neville kicked <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> into Dallas' face and slammed Dallas onto <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> Neville climbed to the top rope and dove off with his Red Arrow while Dallas was on <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> This incapacitated Dallas long enough for Neville to set up and climb <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> to retrieve the NXT Championship hanging above the ring. The show ended with Neville celebrating with his new championship.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a Ladder {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. The goal is to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the title belts suspended above the ring. The Hardys had the advantage {{for most of the}} match, but as Jeff was climbing <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> to try and grab the belts, Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> from underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to fall to the floor. Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> to get the belts and win.|$|E

5|$|As CTroop {{reached the}} forming up {{point for the}} assault it met heavy machine gun fire from the gun battery. ATroop {{bypassed}} them to occupy houses to cover the assault. The next to arrive was DTroop, which had a special ladder to cross the anti-tank ditch around the battery. Realising that the man carrying <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> had been killed crossing the beach and <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> left behind, they looked for another way to cross. They discovered wooden planks bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town. DTroop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the battery. With the machine guns taken, EandFTroops began their assault. The attack was successful but they discovered the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles. The real guns had been removed three days previously and positioned further inland.|$|E

5|$|Next, {{the finals}} of The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament were held between Christian Cage and Kaz in a ladder match that lasted 15 minutes and 13 seconds. In a ladder match, an object is hung above {{the ring and}} the first to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the object is the winner. During the match, Cage was legitimately busted open above his eye. Midway through the encounter, the contract fell off the clipboard that hung above the ring, which changed the objective to just grabbing the clipboard to win. Kaz won the contest after causing Cage to fall off <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> onto Styles and Tomko, who were interfering on Cage's behalf, and then ascending <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> to grab the clipboard, becoming number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the process.|$|E

5|$|The Roar {{missed the}} finals {{in the first}} two A-League seasons, {{finishing}} sixth in 2005–06 and fifth in 2006–07 on goal difference to Sydney FC, who finished fourth.

The Roar would suffer their worst season to date in 2009–10, finishing 2nd last on <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> of 10 teams. This would all change a season later, where the Roar would do the double by winning both the premiership and championship, topping the cake with an Australian sporting record of 28 unbeaten games {{at the end of the}} season, which continued into the 2011–12 A-League season, ending at 36 games. The record was brought to an end by Sydney FC on a wet and windy afternoon in Sydney's west by 2 goals to nil.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} match featured Paul London and Brian Kendrick, William Regal and Dave Taylor, MNM (Joey Mercury, and Johnny Nitro), and The Hardys (Matt and Intercontinental Champion Jeff) in a four-team ladder {{match for}} the WWE Tag Team Championship. In this match, {{the only way to}} win and capture the titles was by climbing a ladder and releasing the championship belts that were suspended above the ring. Towards the end of the match, while MNM and The Hardys were out of the ring, Regal and Taylor attempted to climb <b>the</b> <b>ladder,</b> but Kendrick managed to knock the pair off. Kendrick fought off Regal and Taylor as London climbed <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> and captured the titles to win the match for his team and retain the championships.

5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E
