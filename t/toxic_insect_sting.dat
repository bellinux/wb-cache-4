MÃ©todos: Estudio descriptivo transversal retrospectivo. Consultaron 2. 760 pacientes durante el perÃ­odo 1998 - 2004. Resultados: Se detectÃ³ un continuo aumento de consultas por picaduras, hasta alcanzar las 16 consultas por 1. 000 habitantes. Los pacientes tenÃ­an una media de edad de 32 aÃ±os, y un 62 % eran mujeres. El 71 % de las lesiones se localizaron en las extremidades y se infectaron el 19 % de ellas.

40|$|<b>Insect</b> <b>sting</b> allergy â€“ {{the facts}} Anyone who is stung by a bee or wasp {{is likely to}} suffer a painful {{swelling}} {{at the site of}} the sting. For most people, the sting is not dangerous. Some people also experience an allergic reaction to the venom. For most of these people, the reaction is mild resulting in swelling {{at the site of the}} sting. But for a small minority, an allergic reaction to an <b>insect</b> <b>sting</b> can be systemic â€“ that is, affecting parts of the body away from the site of the sting. Systemic reactions are sometimes severe and potentially life-threatening â€“ this is known as anaphylaxis. If you are in that category, you may find the prospect of being stung very frightening, but be assured that there are steps you can take to reduce the risk to yourself. This involves getting medical advice, carrying prescribed medication at all times, and taking precautions to avoid being stung. Anyone can become allergic to an <b>insect</b> <b>sting</b> â€“ not only people who already have allergies such as hayfever or food allergies. The first sting is not the one that causes the problem, but it may cause sensitisation â€“ the stage at which the person becomes allergic. If sensitisation occurs, it is a later sting that will provoke the symptoms. Being stung by one type of insect will not make you allergic to the venom of another...|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{allergic}} reactions to <b>insect</b> <b>stings</b> affect up to 5 % {{of the population}} during their lifetime, and up to 32 % of beekeepers. Such reactions can be fatal, albeit very rarely, and fear of a further systemic reaction (SR) can lead to significant anxiety {{and quality of life}} impairment. A recent Cochrane systematic review confirmed that venom immunotherapy (VIT) is an effective treatment for people who have had a systemic allergic reaction to an <b>insect</b> <b>sting.</b> VIT reduces risk of a further SR (relative risk 0. 10, 95 % confidence interval 0. 03 - 0. 28), but VIT also reduces risk of a future large local reaction, and significantly improves disease-specific quality of life. However, health economic analysis showed that VIT is generally not cost effective for preventing future SRs; most people are stung infrequently, most SRs resolve without long-term consequences, and a fatal outcome is extremely rare. VIT only becomes cost effective if one is stung frequently (eg, beekeepers) or if quality of life improvement is considered. Thus, for most people with <b>insect</b> <b>sting</b> allergy, anxiety and quality of life impairment should be the overriding consideration when making treatment decisions, highlighting the importance of a patient-centered approach. Areas which need to be explored in future research include efforts to improve the safety and convenience of VIT {{such as the use of}} sublingual immunotherapy; quality of life effects of venom allergy in children and adolescents as well as their parents; and the optimal duration of treatment...|$|R

40|$|<b>Insect</b> <b>sting</b> allergy is {{a common}} cause of {{anaphylaxis}} and may be fatal. Reported allergy to <b>insect</b> <b>stings</b> is confined to insects from the order Hymenoptera which includes bees, wasps, and ants. The population-based prevalence {{of a history of}} Hymenoptera sting systemic reactions (SRs) is approximately 0. 3 % to 7. 5 % depending on the diagnostic criteria used (Bilo 2005). In children, and based on few studies, the prevalence rate of SRs is lower than in adults, ranging from 0. 15 % to 0. 8 % (Bilo 2009). The prevalence of systemic reactions to sting exposure among beekeepers is high and ranges from 14 % to 32 % (Muller 2005). The relative prevalence of SRs to different Hymenoptera species varies according to the prevalence of species which deliver potentially allergenic venom in the local region. For example, in South-Eastern Australia the jack jumper ant (Myrmecia pilosula) {{is a common}} cause of SRs (Brown 2003), in the Americas imported fire ants (species of the genus Solenopsis) are common, but in both Europe and North America SRs are most commonly caused by wasps (species of the genus Vespula) or honey bees (Apis mellifera) (Bilo 2005). Although the incidence of <b>insect</b> <b>sting</b> mortality is low, ranging from 0. 03 to 0. 48 fatalities per 1, 000, 000 inhabitants per year (Antonicelli 2002; Bilo 2005), the true number is likely to be underestimated (Graft 2006).
