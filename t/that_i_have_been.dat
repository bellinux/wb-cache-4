5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> looking for a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I {{put him in the}} first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
25|$|Your honor, I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{convicted of}} violating an unjust statute. I will {{continue}} in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can. Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom—that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in our constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.|$|E

"I {{told him}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> deceived by his {{people in the}} borough, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> put to expense through the misrepresentations of the Duchess. I don't think I did ask for the money. But he sent a cheque, and of course I took it." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{reached the}} {{mainland}} again <b>I</b> <b>had</b> sworn <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> floating.|$|R
60|$|I did not answer, fearing to {{tell him}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> awake {{watching}} him.|$|R
25|$|I’m {{well aware}} that I {{sometimes}} “shoot from the hip” and speak on things about which I know very little. In this present situation, I published my personal opinions about drug addiction without knowing very much about the neuroscience behind addiction, or the addiction recovery field. Not only did I say some deeply regrettable and insensitive things, but as I’ve learned more about the questions and issues at hand, I accept <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> wrongheaded {{on a number of}} topics related to these issues. Even at 84, I’m still learning. Please bear with me, folks.|$|E
25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, it seems to me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E
60|$|So {{unforeseen}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> our departure in {{the first}} place; so rapid our journey; so unaccountable the conduct of Harry; and so sudden our return; that all united to overwhelm me. <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> at all in London seemed impossible; and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> there, and come away little the wiser, was almost distracting to one who, like me, had so longed to behold that metropolis of marvels.|$|R
60|$|Somebody {{said that}} it <b>was,</b> {{remarking}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> about to shoot Marie Marais and myself when help came.|$|R
6000|$|ROBERTS, to the others, convulsively: 'Ha, <b>ha,</b> <b>ha!</b> <b>I</b> {{supposed}} all the time, you know, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> robbed, and--and--' ...|$|R
25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} Captain Fabbroni's finest moment. He testified in 21 {{hearings}} and his testimony filled 285 pages. He accused the police, politicians {{and even the}} judiciary of being involved with the Camorra. Alfano claimed he was innocent. [...] "I am the victim of yellow journalism," [...] he told the judge. [...] "I have been ruined by the Carabinieri. The story <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the head of the}} Camorra is a legend. I was neither its head nor its tail. I admit that I have committed some excesses. What youth of my social class in Naples has not?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Empress {{remained}} strong-willed {{even after}} years of marriage. Pedro II revealed in a letter written to the Countess of Barral in early 1881 that: [...] "The [...] with the earrings which you mentioned, has been the cause for much recrimination {{on the part of}} someone [...] who thinks <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> to blame for their disappearance." [...] Her son-in-law, Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, wrote a letter recounting how she had accidentally broken her arm in October 1885: [...] "On Monday 26 when crossing the library on the way to dinner with the emperor who as usual preceded her by a few steps (and with whom, I infer from what she told us, she was arguing as she sometimes does), she caught her foot in a file under a table and fell down flat face forward." [...] Nonetheless, she continued to express undiminished love for her husband.|$|E
6000|$|As for myself, at the {{beginnings}} of my vocabulary, at so tender a period <b>that</b> <b>I</b> still made hunger noises and sleep noises, yet even then did <b>I</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a star-rover. Yes, <b>I,</b> whose lips <b>had</b> never lisped the word [...] "king," [...] remembered <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> once <b>been</b> {{the son of a}} king. More--I remembered <b>that</b> once <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a slave and a son of a slave, and worn an iron collar round my neck.|$|R
6000|$|All these, {{you will}} easily suppose, {{must be so}} many stabs into the very soul of one in my own case. It {{immediately}} occurred to me, [...] "Poor Amy! what art thou <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not? What hast thou <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not <b>been?</b> Nay, <b>I</b> am guilty of my own sin and thine too." [...] Then it came to my remembrance <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not only <b>been</b> the same with Amy, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the devil's instrument to make her wicked; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> stripped her, and prostituted her to the very man <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> naught with myself; that she had but followed me, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> her wicked example; and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> led her into all; and that, as we had sinned together, now we were likely to sink together.|$|R
60|$|I looked {{round and}} could see no one, so, {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> deceived by my imagination, I held my peace.|$|R
500|$|The episode guest starred Omi Vaidya, {{who played}} the part of Sadiq, the IT assistant. Vaidya later {{explained}} that, originally, [...] "a lot of people auditioned for that role, bigger Indian American actors". However Vaidya, who had watched the British version and {{was familiar with the}} camera style, [...] "took a scarf, created a turban out of it and walked to the audition room with it on" [...] because he thought that [...] "that was what was needed for the character and the show". He later called his guest appearance [...] "one of the best productions in the United States <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a part of." [...] Vaidya said that he enjoyed shooting the party scenes the most because they got to drink real beer and play video games on an Xbox 360, which had not been released at the time. Vaidya said that [...] "it was like being at a real party with everyone from The Office except that we had to shoot a few scenes while we were chatting and relaxing." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{impeachment}} trial of President Andrew Johnson, Morton {{voted in favor}} of conviction, as did most moderate and all Radical Republicans, and openly voiced his disappointment at Johnson's acquittal. Although Morton delivered a speech in the fall of 1865 arguing that the recently freed slaves were unready for the vote, and once worked to end Indiana's so-called [...] "Black Laws" [...] that restricted blacks' basic civil rights, and the state constitutional provision forbidding their entry into the state, he reversed his position after the war. By 1866 Morton had come to share the general Republican belief that the only means of guaranteeing loyalty to governments protective of black civil rights must be through giving adult males of every race the franchise. As he explained, [...] "I confess, and I do it without shame, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> educated by the great events of War." [...] He championed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, and when the Democrats began to resign en masse from the Senate during its debate to prevent a quorum, Morton engineered a maneuver that kept the bill in the docket and allowed it to be passed.|$|E
500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 2010 Hungarian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello {{attempted}} to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight. Schumacher closed the inside line to force Barrichello onto the outside, but Barrichello persisted on the inside at , despite the close proximity of a concrete wall and Schumacher leaving him only inches to spare. Barrichello said [...] "It is the most dangerous thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> through", and [...] "There is not a rule for that, but between ourselves we should take a line, stick to it and that's it." [...] Schumacher said that [...] "Obviously there was space enough to go through. We didn't touch, so I guess I just left enough space for him to come through." [...] Ross Brawn said [...] "at {{the end of the}} day he gave him enough space. You can argue that it was marginal, but it was just tough – tough racing." [...] A range of ex-drivers and commentators were highly critical of Schumacher. Although there was no accident, the race steward, the same Derek Warwick of the 1991 Nürburgring incident, wanted to black flag Schumacher since that [...] "would have shown a better example to our young drivers". The Hungaroring incident was ruled to be dangerous and Schumacher received a 10 place grid penalty for the next race. Schumacher accepted the decision, and apologised.|$|E

2500|$|Schlafly told Time {{magazine}} in 1978, [...] "I have cancelled speeches whenever my husband thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{away from home}} too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here I, Allan, could contain myself {{no longer}} and asked, [...] "What for?" [...] then, fearing her wrath, wished <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> silent.|$|R
500|$|Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan {{rated the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] and applauded {{the return of}} Duchovny, writing, [...] "welcome back, [...] you {{magnificent}} bastard." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a mixed review of the episode. On one hand, he praised {{the feel of the}} episode, writing, [...] "in many ways, this was an episode that brought back the intensity, magic, and the power of The X-Files <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> missing throughout this most mundane of seasons." [...] In this manner, Kessenich felt that Doggett became [...] "part of The X-Files for the first time." [...] However, Kessenich also felt that the plot involving Mulder's terminal brain disease was a mis-step, noting that Mulder would have never kept something so serious and personal from Scully. He wrote, [...] "a year ago, Mulder was not dying [...] what we once knew as truth has suddenly been replaced with a lie." [...] George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Contra Costa Times called the entry [...] "one of the season's more engaging episodes" [...] and wrote positively of the [...] "intriguing possibilities" [...] that it set up for the final part of the season. They were also positive about the manner in which Doggett and Mulder were able to connect in [...] "some mystical way". However, Avalos and Liedtke were critical of the episode's placement, noting that it would have worked better had it been the [...] "fourth or fifth episode of the season", as opposed to the eighth. Furthermore, they negatively wrote about the revelation that Mulder was suffering from a terminal brain disease, calling it a [...] "monumental story" [...] curve that did not bother [...] "to connect all the dots behind" [...] it.|$|E
2500|$|Dakshineshwar Ashram: Paramahansa Yogananda {{wrote to}} Rajarsi Janakananda from Calcutta {{during his visit}} to India in 1935-36, [...] "You would be pleased to know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> working incessantly for {{creating}} a permanent centre in Calcutta, the crown city of Bengal, and I think I am almost successful." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Secrisy of this Mutiny {{is beyond}} all {{conception}} so that I can not discover that any who are with me had the least knowledge of it. It is unbeknown {{to me why}} I must beguile such force. Even Mr. Tom Ellison took such a liking to Otaheite [...] that he also turned Pirate, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> run down by my own Dogs...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> said negligently <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{detained}} by unexpected {{business in the}} neighbourhood, and thus happened to catch sight of him coming out.|$|R
60|$|In {{the chamber}} beneath was my uncle Sepa. <b>I</b> told him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{watching}} the sun rise {{over the city}} of Alexandria.|$|R
60|$|It {{had seemed}} to me but a little time <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> away, and yet the boatman {{told me that it}} was hours.|$|R
2500|$|... "My {{decision}} {{to retire from}} professional hockey is something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> considering {{for some time and}} did not come easily. I will miss the day-to-day activity of being a member of a team and the camaraderie that I developed with my teammates will never be forgotten. [...] I played with the best, I played against the best — it was a blast. It really truly was. I enjoyed myself immensely." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{following}} morning, the clerk of the Crown went through formality of asking if Mitchel {{had anything to}} say why sentence should not be passed upon him. Mitchel said: [...] "I have to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found guilty by a packed jury—by the jury of a partisan sheriff—by a jury not empanelled even {{according to the law}} of England. That is the reason I object to the sentence being passed upon me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thorpe {{announced}} his retirement from Test cricket after the England selectors chose Kevin Pietersen instead of {{him for the first}} Test of The Ashes in July 2005. Thorpe averaged over 49.00 against Australia, but given the impending back complaint and 2005/2006 winter tour unavailability the selectors felt the decision to replace Thorpe with Pietersen the correct one. After announcing the squad England chairman of selectors David Graveney described it as [...] "the most difficult decision <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> party to in my time as a selector".|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{failed in}} convincing thee, Gelsomina," [...] {{continued}} Jacopo, [...] "that I {{am not the}} wretch <b>I</b> seemed, would <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> dumb!" ...|$|R
