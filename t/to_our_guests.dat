Once on a time I {{reckoned}} a big sailing ship, close-hauled on the wind with all she'd carry set, was beautiful; I hadn't seen you talking <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> across the fruit and flowers. Now I'm thankful for all beauty; things men made like sailing ships, and pretty girls. Betty in white by the bougainvillea, Olivia on the veranda in her black and gold.

6000|$|It {{seemed like}} a fatality. She looked astonished; and she said: [...] "How did you get here?" [...] No {{intrusive}} visitors were within hearing, this time. [...] "My dear!" [...] Cosway remonstrated, [...] "Mrs. Margery must have told you, when she sent me my invitation." [...] Adela turned pale. [...] "Mrs. Margery?" [...] she repeated. [...] "Mrs. Margery has said nothing to me; Mrs. Margery detests you. We must have this cleared up. No; not now--I must attend <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests.</b> Expect a letter; and, for heaven's sake, Edwin, keep out of my father's way. One of our visitors whom he particularly wished to see has sent an excuse--and he is dreadfully angry about it." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{will say}} in conclusion, that {{my share of}} the welcome <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> is none the less hearty because I talk so much nonsense, and I know that I curl say the same far {{the rest of the}} speakers.|$|R

6000|$|March 22.--Being Sunday, I read prayers <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests,</b> {{then went}} {{a long walk}} by the lake to Huntly Burn. It is {{somewhat}} uncomfortable to feel difficulties increase and the strength to meet them diminish. But why should man fret? While iron is dissolved by rust, and brass corrodes, can our dreams be of flesh and blood enduring? But I will not dwell on this depressing subject. My liking to my two young guests is founded on [...] "things that are long enough ago." [...] The first statesman of celebrity whom I personally knew was Mr. Dempster's grand-uncle, George Dempster of Dunnichen, celebrated in his time, and Dundas's father was, when Lord Advocate, the first man of influence who showed kindness to me.|$|E

Due to circumstances out of our control, the physical infrastructure was not in place on time and {{we are unable to}} fulfill on that vision safely and enjoyably for our guests. At this time, we are working tirelessly to get flights scheduled and get everyone off of Great Exuma and home safely as quickly as we can. We ask that guests currently on-island do not make their own arrangements to get to the airport as we are coordinating those plans. We are working to place everyone on complimentary charters back to Miami today; this process has commenced and the safety and comfort of our guests is our top priority. The festival is being postponed until we can further assess if and when we are able to create the high-quality experience we envisioned. We ask for everyone's patience and cooperation during this difficult time as we work as quickly and safely as we can to remedy this unforeseeable situation. We will continue to provide regular updates via email <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> and via our official social media channels as they become available." ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Research {{focused on}} {{analyzing}} the comprehensive recovery {{system of the}} service {{from the perspective of}} the internal client. Methodology: a sample was taken for convenience of 56 Hotels in the city of Cartagena, which applied interviews experts from the sector and staff directly related to the service, for the calculation and data analysis, the SPSS software was used. Results: Found that hotels in the sector apply comprehensive service recovery system, but there are a few opportunities for improvement given that surround the averages between 3. 9 and 4, 0, the most critical results can be seen in the participation of employees in the available data collection mechanisms, participation of employees in the analysis of information and little or no training for service failures. Conclusions: The hotel sector of Cartagena needs procedures for collecting information from employees regarding deficiencies in the service, as well as the involvement of all levels of the Organization in the identification and analysis of the information. Also, consensus on the actions to take is decisive to deliver value <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> and a rapid response helps to generate the perception on the client that is treated fairly by the organization...|$|E

40|$|The 2014 Report of the Physics Institutes of the Universität Leipzig {{presents}} a hopefully interesting overview {{of our research}} activities in the past year. It is also testimony of our scientific interaction with colleagues and partners worldwide. We are grateful <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> for enriching our academic year with their contributions in the colloquium and within the work groups. The open full professorship in the Institute for Experimental Physics I has been filled with an outstanding candidate. We could attract Prof. Ralf Seidel from the University of Münster. He {{is an expert in}} molecular biophysics that complements the existing strength in cellular biophysics. Prof. Hollands could fill all positions of his ERC Starting Grant, so that the work on the project Q̈uantum Fields and Curvature – Novel Constructive Approach via Operator Product Expansionïs now running at full pace. Within the Horizon 2020 project LOMID L̈arge Cost-effective OLED Microdisplays and their Applications(̈ 2015 - 2017) with eight European partners including industry the semiconductor physics group contributes with transparent oxide devices. A joint laboratory for single ion implantation was established between the Leibniz-Institute for Surface Modification (IOM) and the university under the guidance of Profs. Rauschenbach and Meijer. The EU IRSES Network DIONICOS D̈ynamics of and in Complex Systems,̈ a consortium of 6 European and 12 non-European partners, including sites in England, France and Germany as well as in Russia, Ukraine, India, the United States and Venezuela, started in February 2014. In the next four years the Leipzig node headed by Prof. Janke will profit from the numerous international contacts this network provides. With a joint project, Prof. Kroy and Prof. Cichos participate in the newly established priority research programme SPP 1726 M̈icroswimmers,̈ which started with a kick-off workshop in October 2014. In 2014 the International Graduate College S̈tatistical Physics of Complex Systemsr̈un by the computational physics group has commenced its third 3 -years granting period funded by Deutsch-Französische Hochschule (DFH-UFA). Besides the main partner Université de Lorraine in Nancy, France, now also Coventry University, UK, and the Institute for Condensed Matter Physis of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Lviv, Ukraine, participate as associated partners. During the last week of September the TCO 2014 conference T̈ransparent Conductive Oxides – Fundamentals and Applicationsẗook place in honor of the 100 th anniversary of the death of Prof. Dr. KarlW. Bädeker. In 1907 Karl Bädeker had discovered transparent conductive materials and oxides in Leipzig. About a hundred participants joined for many invited talks from international experts, intense discussion and new cooperations. At the end of November the by now traditional 15 th nternational Workshop on Recent Developments in Computational Physics C̈ompPhys 14 örganized by Prof. Janke took place in Leipzig. Around 60 scientists from over 10 different countries exchanged ideas and discussed recent progress in several fields of computational physics. Work has successfully continued in the Centers of Excellence (Sonderforschungsbereiche) SFB 762 F̈unctionality ofOxide Interfacesänd SFB TRR 102 P̈olymers under Multiple Constraints: Restricted and Controlled Molecular Order and Mobility(̈just renewed for 2015 - 2019).
