5|$|Caroline Island {{is heavily}} vegetated, and most islets possess three ringed zones of vegetation: an {{outermost}} herb mat, typically composed mainly of Heliotropium anomalum; an inward zone of shrub, primarily Heliotropium foertherianum; and a central forested region, typically dominated by groves of Pisonia grandis trees. Coconut palms {{have also been}} introduced and exist in substantial quantities on the larger islets. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> vegetation is consistent across the larger islets, with smaller islets lacking the central forest and the smallest vegetated solely by low herbs. Other common plants include Suriana maritima and Morinda citrifolia.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the rapid}} growth phase {{suggests}} the onset of sexual maturity in Albertosaurus, although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives.

5|$|Dvořák often adapted Bohemian {{folklore}} for his compositions, and {{his previous}} four symphonic poems {{were based on}} actual poems by the Czech poet Karel Jaromír Erben, especially Erben's collection of ballads Kytice. A Hero's Song broke away from <b>this</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> programmatic symphonic works, as Dvořák did not specify a specific accompanying text, and he only roughly outlined its plot in a later letter. The lack of a fixed programme has been hypothesized {{as a reason for}} its relative neglect when compared to Dvořák's other symphonic works. It has also been suggested that the work was intended to be autobiographical, an unusual approach for Dvořák. This was Dvořák's only symphonic poem that pursued Franz Liszt's idealized view of the genre, as Dvořák's other four works were based on eerie subjects not appropriate to Liszt's conception.|$|E
5|$|If countershading paints out shadows, the reverse, darkening {{the belly}} and {{lightening}} the back, would maximise contrast by {{adding to the}} natural fall of light. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> animal coloration is found in animals like the skunk and honey badger with strong defences—the offensive stink of the skunk, and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and stink of the honey badger. These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the danger, and giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators, or as an aposematic signal, to warn off experienced ones.|$|E
5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a {{much longer}} and more serious affair for both the Romans and Samnites, running for over twenty years and {{incorporating}} twenty-four battles that led to massive casualties on both sides. The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course: the Samnites seized Neapolis in the Capture of Neapolis in 327 BC, which the Romans then re-captured before losing at the Battle of the Caudine Forks and the Battle of Lautulae. The Romans then proved victorious at the Battle of Bovianum and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> meeting aggression in force and so inadvertently gaining territory in strategic counter-attacks {{was to become a}} common feature of Roman military history.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between war and Australian {{society has been}} shaped {{by two of the}} more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture: bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare. Indeed, Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942, while since then an alliance with the United States has underwritten its security. Arguably, <b>this</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> bandwagoning—both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs, as well as for more pragmatic security concerns—has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies. Regardless, a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident, with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises; a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges.|$|E
5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E
5|$|All {{along the}} ANZAC perimeter, Turkish troops {{continued}} trying to advance using fire and manoeuvre. This gradually petered {{out as the}} morning progressed, and the Turks tried to regain their own lines instead. The Australians and New Zealanders continued to fire on them, sometimes showing themselves above their trenches. The Turks were now able to return fire, which caused {{the majority of the}} ANZAC casualties. It was now clear to the Australians and New Zealanders that the Turkish attack was a failure. However, a report arrived at Turkish headquarters suggesting that some objectives had been captured. So the Turkish commanders issued orders, at 05:00, for a second assault, this time to be supported by an artillery bombardment. Over the next few hours several new attacks began. At 05:25 the 2nd and 5th Divisions attacked again, but instead of moving directly at the Australian lines, they advanced at an angle, and were again mown down. At No.1 Post in the No.4 Section the Canterbury Mounted Rifles observed the Turks forming in Malone's Gully, in preparation for another assault on Russell's Top. The location of the post was such that they could turn their machine-gun and engage the Turks from the rear, which broke up the attack. The Turks attacked Quinn's four more times, and on one occasion an officer and around thirty men managed to reach the junction of Courtney's and Quinn's before being killed. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> attack was kept up until around 10:00, when Allied observers reported a reluctance among the Turkish troops to leave their trenches.|$|E

30|$|Among {{the strains}} of Ophiostoma species sampled in this study, many lacked introns within the rns gene, but a few members did contain introns [O. piliferum, O. carpenteri, O. pluriannulatum, O. perfectum and O. californicum]. This is suggestive of either rapid gain or rapid loss of introns. Gain of introns could be {{achieved}} by horizontal transfer or by vertical transmission of these introns, random loss of introns could be achieved by the original intron containing allele being replaced by a cDNA version of the gene (Hausner 2012). <b>This</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> inheritance/maintenance of introns among the fungi have been observed among other rns introns (Haugen and Bhattacharya 2004; Haugen et al. 2004).|$|R

5|$|The ages of {{individual}} aetosaurs {{can be determined}} by examining their osteoderms. Some isolated osteoderms have been claimed to belong to juvenile aetosaurs based on their size and shape but these hypotheses have often been questioned. For example, juvenile osteoderms of Calyptosuchus were later identified {{as those of the}} small-bodied pseudosuchian Revueltosaurus (which is not an aetosaur), and juvenile osteoderms of Desmatosuchus have been reinterpreted as those of aetosaur Acaenasuchus, which had a relatively small body size at maturity. Studies of the bone structure of paramedian osteoderms indicate that new bone was deposited along the edges of each plate over the course of an aetosaur's lifetime. This means that lines of arrested growth on the undersides of paramedian osteoderms can be used to determine an individual's age. Comparing the ages {{of individual}} specimens with their total body lengths indicates that aetosaurs increased in length at relatively constant rates, but increased in body mass at different rates depending on whether they had wide bodies like Typothorax or narrow bodies like Aetobarbakinoides. Aetosaurs also seem to have grown more slowly than modern crocodilians. Analysis of the limb bones of aetosaurs indicates that they grew quickly when young and more slowly when adults. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> growth is seen in most other pseudosuchians.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the root system, comprising a vertical tap root and multiple horizontal laterals, develops in the seedling's first year. Thereafter, the sinker and laterals continue to lengthen, and new laterals appear. There are only three to five laterals at first, but this number typically increases to eight to ten within ten years. During the first winter, {{there is a great}} deal of root system development, especially elongation of the sinker root, but almost no shoot growth. By summer, the sinker root has generally almost reached the water table, and shoot growth increases substantially. Around February, the shoot forms a resting bud, and growth then ceases until October. On resumption of shoot growth, the shoots grow rapidly for a short time, while the plant is under little water stress; then, with the onset of water stress, the plants settles into a long period of slower shoot growth. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> summer-only shoot growth is maintained throughout the life of the plant, except that in mature plants, seasonal shoot growth may cease with the formation of a terminal inflorescence rather than a resting bud. Inflorescence development continues after shoot growth ceases, and flowering commences in February or March. March and April are the peak months for flowering, which ends in July or August.|$|E
