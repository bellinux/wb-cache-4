25|$|Typically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch {{in fresh}} water, {{migrate to the}} ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are {{restricted}} to fresh water through their lives. Various species of salmon display anadromous life strategies while others display freshwater resident life strategies. Folklore {{has it that the}} fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn; <b>tracking</b> <b>studies</b> have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems. The percent of straying depends on the species of salmon.

25|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} is a schooling {{species as}} a juvenile, transitioning {{to a more}} solitary fish with well defined home ranges as an adult. Adults do school to form spawning aggregations or temporarily while hunting, with evidence from laboratory studies indicates bluefin trevally are able to coordinate these aggregations over coral reefs based on the release of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from the reef. DMSP is a naturally occurring chemical produced by marine algae {{and to a lesser}} extent corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. The number of fish present in an area is also influenced by tidal factors and possibly the abundance of prey and other environmental factors. <b>Tracking</b> <b>studies</b> in Hawaii have found bluefin trevally patrol back and forth along a home range of patch reef walls during the day, only stopping for variable periods where major depth changes or discontinuities in the reef were present. Several fish patrol the same reef patch, reversing direction where the others do. While most fish patrol the one reef, some have been observed to make excursions to nearby reefs, before returning to their home reef later. Night time movements are less extensive than daytime movements, with the trevally moving rapidly between several small reef sections, before slowing down and milling in one patch for around an hour. The fish living in a particular region congregate in one area at night, before returning to their individual daytime range during the day. The reason for this congregation is unclear, but may be important to the social structure of the species. Long term studies have found the fish may range up to 10.2km over several months, however is much less restricted in its movements than its relative, the giant trevally. A Hawaiian biomass study found the species to be one of the most abundant large predators in the islands, however it is less abundant in the heavily exploited Main Hawaiian Islands compared to the remote Northwest Hawaiian Islands. The main difference in these populations was the relative lack of large adult fish in the inhabited areas compared to the remote, unfished regions. A study on carangids caught during a fishing tournament in Hawaii found the bluefin trevally is the most common trevally species taken, accounting for over 80% of the carangid catch. The authors note that this may not only reflect its abundance, but also it vulnerability to specific fishing methods used in the tournament. Apart from the typical predator-prey relationship the species shows (described later), an individual of the species has been seen to rub itself against the skin of a Galapagos shark, apparently to rid itself of parasites. This behaviour is also observed in rainbow runner and is a rare example of a commensal cleaner relationship where the cleaner does not gain anything.|$|E
500|$|The most {{abundant}} catshark {{species in the}} coastal waters of southern Australia, the Australian swellshark is a generally sluggish swimmer that is more active at night.

500|$|Records of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat are {{predominantly}} individuals captured in mist nets or harp traps in riparian habitats on ephemeral streams, floodways, pools or dams, usually at sites supporting large fringing eucalypts. Capture sites are consistently associated with riparian and floodplain habitats that support canopy eucalypts including Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus coolabah, Eucalyptus microtheca, Eucalyptus populnea, Eucalyptus polyanthemos and Eucalyptus citriodora. At Gundabooka National Park in western NSW the bristle-faced free-tailed bat was only trapped along drainage lines with fringing Eucalyptus camaldulensis and [...] Eucalyptus populnea. During radio <b>tracking</b> <b>studies</b> at the Gundabooka site bristle-faced free-tailed bats were observed to preferentially forage along drainage lines and open channels, rarely moving into adjacent mulga vegetation, and all roost sites identified were in tall eucalypts within or adjacent to riparian zones.|$|E

500|$|During the day, {{the yellow}} {{stingray}} is fairly inactive and spends much time buried under {{a thin layer}} of sediment or lying motionless in vegetation. <b>Tracking</b> <b>studies</b> have shown that it generally remains within a small home range of around , with individuals covering only a portion of the entire area on any particular day. It favors the boundaries between different terrain, such as sand and reef. Its periscopic eyes give it a 360° panoramic view of its surroundings; each eye bears an elaborate covering or [...] "operculum" [...] that allows fine control over the amount of light entering the pupil. Therefore, the resting ray is well equipped to detect approaching predators, which may potentially include any large carnivorous fish such as the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). The yellow stingray is most sensitive to sounds of 300–600Hertz, which is fairly typical among sharks and rays that have been investigated thus far. It and other stingrays have a large brain relative to other rays, comprising around 1–2% of the body weight.|$|E

The second reboot focuses {{on the origin of}} the character, and as a result, changes the previous back story. Staff opted to first work on the character's biography rather than cosmetic aspects. Crystal Dynamics sought to avoid the embellished physique of past renditions and pushed for realistic proportions. In redesigning the character's appearance, the designers began with simple concepts and added features that it felt made Lara Croft iconic: a ponytail, [...] "M-shaped" [...] lips, and the spatial relationship between her eyes, mouth, and nose.

500|$|Pacific loggerheads live in {{temperate}} to tropical regions. They forage in the East China Sea, {{the southwestern}} Pacific, {{and along the}} Baja California Peninsula. Eastern Australia and Japan are the major nesting areas, with the Great Barrier Reef deemed an important nesting area. Pacific loggerheads occasionally nest in Vanuatu and Tokelau. Yakushima Island {{is the most important}} site, with three nesting grounds visited by 40% of all nearby loggerheads. After nesting, females often find homes in the East China Sea, while the [...] Kuroshio Current Extension's Bifurcation region provides important juvenile foraging areas. Eastern Pacific populations are concentrated off the coast of Baja California, where upwelling provides rich feeding grounds for juvenile turtles and subadults. Nesting sites along the eastern Pacific Basin are rare. mtDNA sequence polymorphism analysis and <b>tracking</b> <b>studies</b> suggest 95% of the population along the coast of the Americas hatch on the Japanese Islands in the western Pacific. The turtles are transported by the prevailing currents across the full length of the northern Pacific, one of the longest migration routes of any marine animal. The return journey to the natal beaches in Japan has been long suspected, although the trip would cross unproductive clear water with few feeding opportunities. Evidence of a return journey came from an adult female loggerhead named Adelita, which in 1996, equipped with a satellite tracking device, made the 14,500 km (9,000 mi) trip from Mexico across the Pacific. Adelita was the first animal of any kind ever tracked across an ocean basin.|$|E
500|$|The greater noctule bat {{is known}} to {{participate}} in a fission-fusion society. These societies vary in size, but studies show that each society has a social order and a territory in a specific group of trees that are used for roosting and breeding. The greater noctule bat has been shown to travel between several roosting sites and to participate in several societies through radio <b>tracking</b> <b>studies.</b> [...] It has been conjectured that ranking in society dictates different roles in society, e.g. some bats are scouts, others are hunters. [...] There has been correlation between a specific bat's social ranking and the size of that bat's potential home range; the higher the social ranking, the lower the home range. The greater noctule bat has an observed active range of 2500km2. {{which is one of the}} largest observed ranges for any bat species. This large area of activity has several effects on the way the greater noctule bat forages and roosts. It has been noted that changes by humans to the natural environment could have had an effect on the way the greater noctule bat travels and roosts in its attempts to find suitable food sources. It has been noted that a lack of roosting sites near food sources could be the reason for the large home range that is displayed by the greater noctule bat. Differences observed between two populations of bats with drastically different habitats, Great Britain and Spain respectively, show that the greater noctule bat would not travel great distances for food unless absolutely necessary. This need to fly great distances for food has been theorized as a reason for the decline of the species. One study reported finding a greater noctule bat on the ground exhausted from flight. Another study of owl droppings found in areas in between GNB roosting sites has shown that the greater noctule bat is susceptible to predation in flight.|$|E
