The model predicts a decline in number of farms in 2014 compared with the current situation of 24 % with a more liberal exchange policy and a decline of 18 % with a restricted quota exchange policy. From these Markov chain model results, we analysed the impact of farm size distribution on 8 different milk quality parameters (<b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>count,</b> somatic cell count, coliform count, freezing point, urea-N, fat- and protein content and penalty-points).

The plate counts at 2 ℃ incubation temperature were higher than those at 20 ℃ by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude for the samples at stations in the Antarctic region. In contrast, the 20 ℃ counts for seawater from the Indian Ocean were slightly higher than 2 ℃ counts. The surface spreading method gave <b>bacterial</b> <b>counts</b> that were one order of magnitude higher than the filter method, and the counts with the MPN method using diluted medium were greater still, reaching about 10 % of <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>counts.</b> The results suggested that a fairly large proportion of the bacterial population in Antarctic seawater is in the actively growing state. More than 87 % of the bacterial strains isolated from surface water of the Antarctic Ocean were orange- and yellow-pigmented bacteria. Among the pigmented bacteria, Gram-negative, non-motile, orange-pigmented rods that appeared to constitute a single species belonging to Flavobacterium-Cytophaga predominated...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the quality of {{recovered}} wastewater from the treatment plant of Mutah University, analysis was performed on samples collected from influent, polishing pool, chlorination tank and the ultimately disposal site at the university campus. In this assessment following parameters were used: temperature, BOD 5, COD, effect of chlorination treatment, <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>counts</b> (TBC), type of bacterial species isolated {{and the development of}} antibiotic-resistant bacteria during the treatment. Though BOD 5 and COD values of treated water were within the acceptable range of Jordanian standards, the <b>bacterial</b> <b>counts</b> suggested that the efficiency of applied chlorination treatment was inconsistent. This discrepancy was particularly noticed on the water sample collected from polishing pool. Chlorine treatment of wastewater was not an efficient disinfectant method, besides it`s potential to promote the production of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Some of the coliform species isolated from influent and effluent samples were found to be chlorine resistant. Such resistance seams to be species specific. Also an unexpected bacterial growth profile was observed where the <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>counts</b> on some selective media were higher than the counts detected on enriched media. A re-evaluation for the current method of wastewater treatment is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Edible {{coatings}} are {{an environmentally}} friendly {{technology that is}} applied on many food products to provide and protect food quality. The objective of this work is to use Arabic Gum and Plantago seeds mucilage at concentration (15, 20 and 25 % w/v) as edible coating for chicken breast to prolong its shelf life at 4 ˚C. Coated samples produced the optimum deceases in pH, TBA, <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>count</b> and enhanced the sensory attributes compered to untreated chicken breast. Samples treated with 25 % Plantago showed the lowest value of TBA of 0. 141 mg malondialdehyde. kg- 1 compared to 0. 38 mg malondialdehyde. kg- 1 in control after 21 days of storage. Whereas, 25 % Arabic gum was the most effective in reducing <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>count</b> from 25 × 10 6 cfu. g- 1 in control to 0. 8 × 10 2 cfu. ...|$|E

The supernatant was discarded aseptically and the sediment in the centrifuge tube was homogenized in 100  μl of supernatant. The homogenized suspension was then used for <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>count</b> and identification of uropathogens.|$|E
40|$|Baron {{beach is}} a {{specific}} habitat due its characteristic as a narrow beach with outlet of sub-surface rivers. This research had been done in order to know its microbial characteristic. Research used survey method and bacterial identification was done based on comparative description. The research showed that during high tide of seawater, the <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>count</b> was 1. 0 to 6. 0 x 107 cfu/ml on NA and 2. 0 to 7. 0 x 107 cfu/ml on NA+ 0. 5 % NaCl. Furthermore, during the low tide of sea water, the <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>count</b> was 1. 4 to 8. 8 x 108 cfu/ml on NA, and 3. 2 to 9. 0 106 cfu/ml on NA+ 0, 5 % NaCl. This study found 14 genera of bacteria and dominated by Gram-negative bacteria. The result indicated seawater influenced the number of bacteria present in this environment...|$|E

This significant decrease in number in the Anacostia River during the cold months of the year {{can be explained by the}} low metabolic activity of Aeromonas at low temperatures...|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty samples of raw milk were {{randomly}} collected from six dairies in different locations in Kenitra City (Morocco) from October 2010 to March 2011 and were subjected to evaluation. The study has shown that 119 samples were of poor merchantability and 24 samples of bad sanitary quality. Microbiological enumeration revealed that the counts of total mesophilic aerobic bacteria, 6. 9 x 10 8 cfu mL - 1; faecal coliforms, 4. 2 x 10 7 cfu mL - 1 and Staphylococcus aureus, 1. 4 x 10 5 cfu mL - 1. Salmonella sp. were below detection level {{in all of the}} samples. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from one sample. The same contamination degree between dairies and districts (p> 0. 05) was detected. A significant correlation was observed between <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>counts</b> and faecal coliforms (r = 0. 51; p< 0. 001) and also between <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>counts</b> and temperature of storage (r = - 0. 37; p< 0. 001). The microbiological quality of raw milk sold in Kénitra city was judged marginal indicating the need for improved hygienic standards...|$|R
40|$|When Bacillus licheniformis was {{administered}} to the white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, although the <b>total</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>counts</b> in the intestinal tract of the shrimp remained constant, Vibrio numbers significantly decreased (P < 0. 05). Haemocyte counts together with phenoloxidase and superoxide dismutase activities of the shrimp were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in treatments than in the control. Thus, administration of B. licheniformis can improve the white shrimp's intestinal microflora and its immune ability...|$|R
