Lyrically, though the song {{appears to be}} about dancing and sex, in reality Madonna uses sarcasm to {{emphasize}} the longevity of her career. The lyrics explain {{that she does not}} want to retire from her career at that moment and possesses the ability to continue, as noted in the lines [...] "Don't stop me now, no need <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> breath, I can {{go on and on and}} on." ...|$|E

60|$|I waited <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> {{breath and}} {{expected}} some such outburst as managers usually get from criticized players. But not a word! Then I addressed {{some of them}} personally.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Alma, let {{my child}} alone: {{and if you}} want to play, go and play with Niebla down by the river. A nice thing <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> duckie in your hands--what next, I wonder!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So {{he may be}} in a dark-lantern sort of way. But he is a stick. If he had <b>to</b> say, 'Perdition <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> soul, but I do love her,' {{he would}} say it in just the same tone as, 'Here endeth the second lesson.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{read the}} paper over hastily," [...] said I; [...] "but it is my strong {{impression}} that no such circumstance is mentioned;--at least, {{it must have been}} touched on very slightly, since it failed <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> attention." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Blessed be the English and {{all that}} they profess. [...] Cursed be the Savages that prance in nakedness!' [...] 'Amen,' quo' Jobson, 'but where I used to lie [...] Was neither shirt nor pantaloons <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> brethren by: ...|$|E

60|$|I {{found the}} {{forecastle}} of the Spitfire {{a dark and}} rather unwholesome place. The ventilation was bad, {{and the smell of}} tar and oakum was so strong that for a moment I had to turn away <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> breath.|$|E
60|$|Seb. If I had conquered, They {{could not}} have with more {{observance}} waited: Their eyes, hands, feet, Are all so quick, {{they seem to have}} but one motion, <b>To</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> flying words.

6000|$|I paused <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> breath, {{and looked}} round on the grim, tired faces of my players. They made a stern group.

60|$|And {{then the}} morrow was come. Getting up at five <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> boat, I {{went down to}} the harbour; a grey mist hung over the sea, and the sun had barely risen, a pallid, yellow circle; the fishing-boats lolled on the smooth, dim water, and {{fishermen}} in little groups blew on their fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah... Well {{it is the}} rummest thing I {{ever heard}} of--marrying an old husband again, and so much new blood in the world! He's no <b>catch,</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> thinking. I'd have had a new one while I was about it." ...|$|R

"To {{celebrate}} {{the strength and}} longevity that my fans, friends, and family have supported me with I wrote this song [...] "Catch my Breath" [...] {{with one of my}} best friends that has seen me through everything.

6000|$|He sat a {{few moments}} looking at me. It was getting dark in the wood. Then he took up an ebony stick with a gold head, and rose. The stick seemed <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> at <b>my</b> imagination. I watched it curiously as we walked {{with the old man}} along the path to the gate. We went with him into the open road. When we reached the clear sky where the light from the west fell full on our faces, he turned again and looked at us closely. His mouth opened sharply, as if he would speak, but he stopped himself, and only said [...] "Good-bye—Good-bye." ...|$|R

The little brook: In {{a letter}} written in December, 1848, Lowell says: [...] "Last night I walked to Watertown over the snow with the new moon before me and a sky exactly like that in Page's evening landscape. Orion was rising behind me, and, as I stood on the hill just before you enter the village, {{the stillness of the}} fields around me was delicious, broken only by the tinkle of a little brook which runs too swiftly for Frost <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> it. <b>My</b> picture of the brook in Sir Launfal was drawn from it."
