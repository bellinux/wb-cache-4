2500|$|Spoon bits {{consist of}} a grooved shank with a point shaped {{somewhat}} like <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spoon, with the cutting edge on the end. The more common type is like a gouge bit that ends in a slight point. This is helpful for starting the hole, as it has a center that will not wander or walk. [...] These bits are used by chair-makers for boring or reaming holes in the seats and arms of chairs. Their design is ancient, going back to Roman times. Spoon bits have even been found in Viking excavations. Modern spoon bits are made of hand-forged carbon steel, carefully heat-treated and then hand ground to a fine edge.|$|E

60|$|There was a {{very small}} grate, made of {{cast-iron}} in one piece and painted buff, and a still smaller misfit of a cast-iron fender that confessed the gray stone of the hearth.

It was the custom in those days to warm every room separately from a separate fireplace, more prolific of dirt than heat, and the rickety sash window, the small chimney, and the loose-fitting door were expected to organize the ventilation of the room among themselves without any further direction.|$|E

60|$|The {{second of}} Chanticleer's two wives, ever since Phoebe's arrival, {{had been in}} a state of heavy despondency, caused, as it {{afterwards}} appeared, by her inability to lay an egg. One day, however, by her self-important gait, the sideways turn of her head, and the cock of her eye, as she pried into one and another nook of the garden,--croaking to herself, all the while, with inexpressible complacency,--it was made evident that this identical hen, much as mankind undervalued her, carried something about her person the worth of which was not to be estimated either in gold or precious stones. Shortly after, there was a prodigious cackling and gratulation of Chanticleer and all his family, including the wizened chicken, who appeared to understand the matter quite as well as did his sire, his mother, or his aunt. That afternoon Phoebe found a diminutive egg,--not in the regular nest, it was far too precious to be trusted there,--but cunningly hidden under the currant-bushes, on some dry stalks of last year's grass. Hepzibah, on learning the fact, took possession of the egg and appropriated it to Clifford's breakfast, on account of a certain delicacy of flavor, for which, as she affirmed, these eggs had always been famous. Thus unscrupulously did the old gentlewoman sacrifice the continuance, perhaps, of an ancient feathered race, with no better end than to supply her brother with a dainty that hardly filled <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tea-spoon! It must have been in reference to this outrage that Chanticleer, the next day, accompanied by the bereaved mother of the egg, took his post in front of Phoebe and Clifford, and delivered himself of a harangue that might have proved as long as his own pedigree, but for a fit of merriment on Phoebe's part. Hereupon, the offended fowl stalked away on his long stilts, and utterly withdrew his notice from Phoebe and the rest of human nature, until she made her peace with an offering of spice-cake, which, next to snails, was the delicacy most in favor with his aristocratic taste.|$|E

50|$|In the {{production}} of bucchero sottile, {{the shape of the}} pot held pride of place, with surface decoration playing a supporting role.

Further decoration could be added before the green ware was loaded into the kiln by using a toothed wheel or a comb-like instrument to create rows of dots arranged in fan patterns. On later examples a roller with recessed reliefs was used to transfer figures of deities or even narratives {{to the surface of the}} vessel.|$|R

25|$|Australia's {{unchanged}} opening pair Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh emerged looking typically {{aggressive and}} soon were also looking untroubled by England's blunt <b>bowling</b> attack. <b>The</b> opening pair Foster and Fraser were soon replaced by Emburey and Cook, but England's <b>bowling</b> looked out <b>of</b> depth, {{and struggled to}} work out where to bowl and Marsh and Taylor set about scoring freely.
