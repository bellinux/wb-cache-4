These devices provide extremely low ESR and high self-resonance characteristics, and are well-suited for resonant circuit applications or those where Q {{and stability of}} capacitance characteristics are required. CBR Series capacitors exhibit no change in capacitance with respect to time and voltage, and boast a negligible change in capacitance with reference to ambient temperature. Capacitance change is limited to ± 30 ppm/ ºC from- 55 °C to + 125 °C.

40|$|Abstract—To {{address the}} need for {{fundamental}} universally valid definitions of exact bandwidth and quality factor () of <b>tuned</b> <b>antennas,</b> as well as {{the need for}} efficient accurate approximate formulas for computing this bandwidth and, exact and approximate expressions are found for the bandwidth and of a general single-feed (one-port) lossy or lossless linear <b>antenna</b> <b>tuned</b> to resonance or antiresonance. The approximate expression derived for the exact bandwidth of a <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> differs from previous approximate expressions in that it is inversely proportional to the magnitude 0 (0) of the frequency derivative of the input impedance and, for not too large a bandwidth, it is nearly equal to the exact bandwidth of the <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> at every frequency 0, that is, throughout antiresonant as well as resonant frequency bands. It is also shown that an appropriately defined exact of a tuned lossy or lossless antenna is approximately proportional to 0 (0) and thus this is approximately inversely proportional to the bandwidth (for not too large a bandwidth) of a simply <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> at all frequencies. The exact of a <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna</b> is defined in terms of average internal energies that emerge naturally from Maxwell’s equations applied to the <b>tuned</b> <b>antenna.</b> These internal energies, which are similar but not identical to previously defined quality-factor energies, and the associated are proven to increase without bound as the size of an antenna is decreased. Numerical solutions to thin straight-wire and wire-loop lossy and lossless antennas, as well as to a Yagi antenna and a straight-wire antenna embedded in a lossy dispersive dielectric, confirm the accuracy of the approximate expressions and the inverse relationship between the defined bandwidth and the defined over frequency ranges that cover several resonant and antiresonant frequency bands.

5000|$|The performer's hand {{acts as the}} {{grounded}} plate (the performer's body {{being the}} connection to ground) of a variable capacitor in an L-C (inductance-capacitance) circuit, {{which is part of}} the oscillator and determines its frequency. In the simplest designs, the antenna is directly coupled to the tuned circuit of the oscillator and the 'pitch field' that is the change of note with distance, is highly nonlinear, as the capacitance change with distance is far greater near the antenna. In such systems, when the antenna is removed, the oscillator moves up in frequency. To partly linearise the pitch field, the antenna may be wired in series with an inductor to form a series tuned circuit, resonating with the parallel combination of the antenna's intrinsic capacitance and the capacitance of the player's hand in proximity to the <b>antenna.</b> This series <b>tuned</b> <b>circuit</b> is then connected in parallel with the parallel tuned circuit of the variable pitch oscillator. With the <b>antenna</b> <b>circuit</b> disconnected, the oscillator is tuned to a frequency slightly higher than the stand alone resonant frequency of the <b>antenna</b> <b>circuit.</b> At that frequency, the antenna and its linearisation coil present an inductive impedance; and when connected, behaves as an inductor in parallel with the oscillator. Thus, connecting the antenna and linearising coil raises the oscillation frequency. Close to the resonant frequency of the <b>antenna</b> <b>circuit,</b> the effective inductance is small, and the effect on the oscillator is greatest; farther from it, the effective inductance is larger, and fractional change on the oscillator is reduced.|$|R

The proposed antenna operated at 1.71 to 1.85 GHz. It used a differentially feeding scheme to suppress even-order modes.
