5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. <b>The</b> <b>subdivision</b> rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. <b>The</b> <b>subdivision</b> rule describes that pattern.|$|E
5|$|The quasi-isometry {{properties}} of the history graph can be studied using subdivision rules. For instance, the history graph is quasi-isometric to hyperbolic space exactly when <b>the</b> <b>subdivision</b> rule is conformal, {{as described in the}} combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem.|$|E

5|$|Since 2012 Chad {{has been}} divided into 23 regions. <b>The</b> <b>subdivision</b> of Chad in regions came about in 2003 {{as part of}} the {{decentralisation}} process, when the government abolished the previous 14 prefectures. Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. Prefects administer the 61 departments within the regions. The departments are divided into 200 sub-prefectures, which are in turn composed of 446 cantons.|$|E
5|$|The {{final element}} of the {{protection}} scheme of the first dreadnoughts was <b>the</b> <b>subdivision</b> of the ship below the waterline into several watertight compartments. If the hull were holed—by shellfire, mine, torpedo, or collision—then, in theory, only one area would flood and the ship could survive. To make this precaution even more effective, many dreadnoughts had no doors between different underwater sections, so that even a surprise hole below the waterline need not sink the ship. There were still several instances where flooding spread between underwater compartments.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Trigonognathus within the Etmopteridae is uncertain. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic data generally support <b>the</b> <b>subdivision</b> of the Etmopteridae into two clades, one consisting of Etmopterus and Miroscyllium {{and the other}} consisting of Centroscyllium and Aculeola. Phylogenetic analyses have variously placed Trigonognathus as closer to one clade or the other or as basal to both, depending on which morphological characters, nuclear DNA markers, and/or mitochondrial DNA markers were used.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid {{appears to}} have lived at Ripon, {{and for a time}} he acted as {{administrator}} of the see of Lindisfarne after Cuthbert's death in 687. In 691, <b>the</b> <b>subdivision</b> issue arose once more, along with quarrels with King Aldfrith over lands, and attempts were made to make Wilfrid either give up all his lands or to stay confined to Ripon. A proposal to turn Ripon into a bishopric was also a source of dispute. When no compromise was possible Wilfrid left Northumbria for Mercia, and Bosa was returned to York.|$|E
5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for <b>the</b> <b>subdivision</b> rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide {{it over and over again}} to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E
5|$|Snowdon Hill Quarry is a 0.6 hectare (1.3 acre) {{geological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest on {{the western}} outskirts.

5|$|In France, at some {{stage the}} apothecaries' pound of 12ounces was {{replaced}} by the larger civil pound of 16ounces. <b>The</b> <b>subdivisions</b> of <b>the</b> apothecaries' ounce were the same as in the other Romance countries, however, and were different from <b>the</b> <b>subdivisions</b> of <b>the</b> otherwise identical civil ounce.|$|R
5|$|The {{basic form}} of the apothecaries' system is {{essentially}} {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system. An apothecaries' pound normally consisted of 12 ounces. (In France this was changed to 16 ounces, and in Spain the customary unit was the marco, a mark of 8 ounces.) In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>subdivision</b> of an ounce was somewhat more uniform than that of a pound, and a common feature of all variants is that 12 ounces are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain is roughly the weight of a physical grain.|$|E
5|$|The {{measure and}} weight {{systems for the}} large {{mainland}} part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies were unified in 1840. The area consisted of the southern half of the Italian Peninsula and included Naples and Salerno. <b>The</b> <b>subdivision</b> of apothecaries' weight in the unified system was {{essentially the same as}} that for gold, silver, coins and silk. It was the most excentric variant in that the ounce was divided in 10drachms, rather than the usual8. The scruple, like in Venice but unlike {{in the rest of the}} Romance region, was divided into 20grains. The existence of a unit called aureo, the equivalent of 1½ dramme, is interesting because 6 aurei were 9 dramme. In the original Salerno weight system an ounce was divided into 9 drachms, and so an aureo would have been ⅙ of an ounce.|$|E
5|$|A violent multiple-vortex tornado struck {{portions}} of extreme northern Georgia and southeast Tennessee during the mid-evening hours of April 27. It touched down along Davis Ridge Road in Catoosa County, Georgia, and {{moved through the}} town of Ringgold at EF3 strength, destroying numerous homes and businesses. A Baymont Inn & Suites, located near Interstate 75 was partially destroyed by the tornado, along with a McDonald's, a Taco Bell, and several gas stations located on Highway 151 in Ringgold at the Interstate 75 interchange (exit 348). The Catoosa County Department of Family and Children Services and other businesses on Nashville Street in downtown Ringgold were also heavily damaged. The Kellerhals Center for Visual Arts Education at Ringgold High School was destroyed (RHS itself had minor damage), and Ringgold Middle School was heavily damaged. Past downtown Ringgold, the tornado reached EF4 intensity as it tore through a subdivision along Cherokee Valley Road at the north edge of town. Twelve homes were completely obliterated and swept away at that location (though they were not well-built). There were 74 destroyed homes and/or businesses, 60 with major damage, and 118 with minor damage {{for a total of}} 252 affected structures in the Ringgold area. Eight people were killed, mainly at <b>the</b> <b>subdivision</b> along Cherokee Valley Road.|$|E

5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in <b>the</b> <b>subdivision.</b> These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E
