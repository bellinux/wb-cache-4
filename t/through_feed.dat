40|$|Introduction: The {{literature}} documents numerous inconveniences of {{drug administration}} <b>through</b> <b>feeding</b> tubes. Actions {{to improve the}} quality of this practice are of great importance. Objective: The objective of this study is to describe the implementation process and results of an Integrated Program to improve drug administration <b>through</b> <b>feeding</b> tubes in a Brazilian general hospital. Methods: This is a descriptive study of a clinic quality improvement program which proceeded in four steps: (1) design of a data base with technical characteristics of oral drugs; (2) application of an identification label on non-crushable tablets; (3) evaluation, through focal groups, of nursing technicians' knowledge of drug administration <b>through</b> <b>feeding</b> tubes, and formal training; (4) prescription review of patients prescribed enteral nutrition and subsequent pharmaceutical intervention. Results: A list with 131 oral drugs used within the hospital was compiled with recommendations for their administration <b>through</b> <b>feeding</b> tubes. Seven non-crushable drugs were identified with "do not crush" labels. Formal training regarding drug administration <b>through</b> <b>feeding</b> tubes was elaborated incorporating findings from the focal groups and applied to the nursing team. Over eight months, we analyzed 888 prescriptions written for 185 patients and addressed 263 pharmaceutical interventions to the medical team (which they accepted in 100 % of the cases), and 105 interventions to the nursing team. Conclusions: Qualification programs with multiple strategies, as the one described here, may directly improve drug administration <b>through</b> <b>feeding</b> tubes and help to solve and prevent problems related to this practic...|$|R

50|$|Gravity {{delivers}} the apatite ore, carbon (coke) and silica (gravel) to the submerged-arc furnace <b>through</b> <b>feed</b> chutes {{situated in the}} roof of the furnace. This ensures a constant packed bed volume. The gaseous product, a mixture of carbon monoxide and phosphorus gas, leaves the furnace through two symmetrically placed outlet vents situated above the ferrophosphorus tap hole in {{the roof of the}} furnace. The ferrophosphorus is tapped off, usually once per day. Slag, however, is continuously tapped through two alternating, water-cooled tap holes located 400 mm above the furnace floor. The feed material forms the major electrical and flow resistance of the smelting furnace circuit. As the feed materials descend towards the hot zone in the furnace, they start to soften and melt, significantly lowering the electrical resistance. A conductive path is thus provided between the electrodes where the Joule heating is released to attain the high temperatures and energy levels needed to effect the essential endothermic reactions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} aimed to improve egg production by decreasing the intersequence pause days between the sequences of egg lay in girirani birds through chemical control of prolactin by using bromocriptine (an anti prolactin chemical) <b>through</b> <b>feed.</b> At 12 weeks of age, forty two girirani birds were randomly divided into control (n= 21) and treated (n= 21) groups. Birds in the treated group were fed bromocriptine <b>through</b> <b>feed</b> @ 350 µg/bird/day from 17 - 36 weeks of age and controls were fed the same ration without bromocriptine. Birds fed with bromocriptine <b>through</b> <b>feed</b> significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced the prolactin concentration compared to control birds. Estradiol and progesterone were quantified in both the groups. Treated birds showed higher (P< 0. 01) concentration of estradiol and progesterone concentration from 19 th to 72 weeks of age with intermittent fluctuations. Egg production, pause days, and hormonal parameters were correlated between the two groups. Prolactin is negatively correlated with egg production (r =- 0. 89), estradiol (r =- 0. 59) and progesterone (r =- 0. 37) hormones and positively correlated with inter sequence pause days with concomitant decrease in egg production. Birds fed bromocriptine <b>through</b> <b>feed</b> showed significantly (P< 0. 01) less pause days and more egg production. The results of this study showed that, controlling the prolactin secretion by chemical means resulted in 5. 12 % increase in egg production over control birds, further such an approach is more promising, practicable, economical without any traces of chemical in meat, egg and blood to improve egg production in backyard poultry farming. It is concluded that chemical control of prolactin plays a major role on pauses days, prolactin secretion and egg production in native breed of birds.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is {{an emerging}} animal welfare {{and public health}} issue linked to antimicrobial use (AMU) in livestock. This {{study was conducted in}} 2004 on 20 swine farms in Alberta and Saskatchewan. On-farm records and questionnaires were used to retrospectively describe the antimicrobial exposures of pigs <b>through</b> <b>feed,</b> water, and injection. Antimicrobial use in all production categories was described over 12 months. On-farm records and questionnaires provided sufficient data to describe antimicrobial exposure rates <b>through</b> <b>feed</b> and water. In contrast, on-farm records did not supply sufficient data to describe parenteral antimicrobial exposure rates. Records lacked data on the number of exposures per treatment, therefore parenteral AMU was described as an exposure incidence. Parenteral exposure records were often unavailable for pigs less than 22 kg, in which case questionnaires were used. The incidence of parenteral AMU was significantly higher in herds reporting exposure by questionnaire compared with existing records, suggesting that on-farm records did not reliably describe parenteral AMU. However, because antimicrobial exposures in feed and water were markedly more common than through injection, it was concluded that existing on-farm data would be a valuable resource for investigating AMU and AMR in pigs...|$|E
