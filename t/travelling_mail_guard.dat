The SNS <b>Mail</b> <b>Guard</b> (SMG) provides a highly trustworthy device for transferring electronic mail between networks of differing security levels in accordance with site specific policies. The site defines its message transfer policies based on specific tests of message contents. The develop-ment effort pursued high assurance through compliance with trusted software development requirements and through formal assurance of security properties. The resulting <b>mail</b> <b>guard</b> uses the type enforcement capabilities of the LOCK ® trusted computing base (TCB) to provide the most trustworthy facility achievable with current tech-nology. We have found that high assurance security does not visibly impact <b>mail</b> <b>guard</b> performance...|$|R

50|$|The cost of <b>travelling</b> by <b>mail</b> {{coach was}} about 1d. a mile more {{expensive}} than by private stage coach, but the coach was faster and, in general, less crowded and cleaner. Crowding was a common problem with private stage coaches, which led to them overturning; the limits on numbers of passengers and luggage prevented this occurring on the <b>mail</b> coaches. <b>Travel</b> on the <b>mail</b> coach was nearly always at night; as the roads were less busy the coach could make better speed.|$|R

50|$|Mail {{circulation}} - Generally, mail (letters & parcels) {{posted in}} the UK addressed to troops overseas was circulated by the GPO to the Home Postal Depot (HPD) in London {{where it was}} sorted by theatre and unit. It was then despatched to embarkation ports and loaded on vessels for transportation to the theatre’s BAPO. At the BAPO the mail was sorted and loaded onto supply trains for transportation to the railhead. At the railhead the <b>mail</b> <b>guard,</b> who had accompanied the mail from the BAPO, {{and members of the}} railhead APO transferred the mails to the supply column (usually lorries) for the journey to the Refilling Points where the attached Field Post Office (FPO) staff would receive the mail and then distribute it the Unit Post Orderlies (UPOs) who had travelled to the Refilling Point on regimental transport. Homeward bound mail was sent in the reverse direction back to the BAPO, which would be responsible for loading it onto vessels bound for the UK. On the mail's arrival in the UK it was put into the GPO system for delivery to the addressee.|$|R
