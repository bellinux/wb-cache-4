5|$|Beginning in March 2008, Rutgers {{attempted}} to convert Westerman to defensive tackle, {{so he could}} replace the departed Eric Foster. However, Westerman ended up playing defensive end during the season. Against Morgan State, Westerman blocked a punt and recovered the loose ball.

5|$|The Dodgers {{traded for}} Jones {{in part to}} replace Glenn Dobbs – a star {{tailback}} in Brooklyn's single-wing offense – because Dobbs was suffering from injuries. Jones himself was hurt early in the 1947 season, however, when {{he was hit by}} Bill Willis of the Cleveland Browns. Injuries to his knee, hip and clavicle forced him <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> for several weeks. He broke his hand when he returned and had to play exclusively on defense {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|In a December 26 practice, Virginia Tech linebacker Myron Newsome {{suffered}} an ankle injury {{that threatened to}} force him <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> the Orange Bowl. Newsome, {{who had been a}} starter during the regular season, eventually recovered to participate in the game, but his injury was a point of media interest in the days prior to kickoff. Two other Virginia Tech defenders were injured during practice prior to the game. Cornell Brown suffered a minor leg injury, while defensive end John Engelberger broke his nose.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} week, Florida crushed the {{mismatched}} Sewanee Tigers 71–6 in Jacksonville despite Sewanee's highly publicized aerial attack. Clyde Crabtree and Tommy Owens had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> with injuries. Goof Bowyer, Red Bethea, and Broward McClellan {{were seen as}} {{the stars of the}} game. The Gators played substitutes throughout the second half, putting the first stringers back in {{by the middle of the}} fourth quarter. Florida's center, Frank Clark, also drew praise for his play on the line. This score placed the Gators in first place for scoring within the Southern Conference, and still remains one of the seven highest single-game scoring totals in Gators team history.|$|E

5|$|Once elected, a {{governor}} serves a four-year term beginning {{on the date}} he is sworn into office; inauguration day is the second Monday in January. He remains governor until his successor takes the oath of office. The governor's term can be shorter if he resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or impeached. There is no limit to how many terms {{a governor}} may serve; however, the governor is limited to being elected to two consecutive terms {{at a time and}} may remain in office a maximum of eight years in any twelve-year period. To be eligible to run for a third term, the governor would have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> for one election period.|$|E

5|$|The Calgary Stampeders signed Williams as an {{international}} free agent on May 28, 2015. Williams made the Stampeders' active roster following preseason and made his CFL debut on July 18 against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He started three games at left tackle before being forced to leave the August 1st game against the Montreal Alouettes with an arm injury. After Williams reportedly had X-rays of his elbow taken, {{he was diagnosed with}} a hyperextended right elbow. He suffered multiple injuries {{during the rest of the}} regular season, causing him <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> several games. He returned in time to play in both playoff games for Calgary.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} criticized {{for a lack of}} {{production}} during the regular season and was ranked 103rd in total offense. The Hokies gained just 301 yards of offense on average during the regular season. Despite the meager statistical performance, Tech did have some standout players. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who had been expected <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> the season in reserve, finished the year as the team's starter. Running back Darren Evans was named a second-team All-ACC selection, as was guard Sergio Render. Taylor's favorite passing targets were wide receivers Danny Coale and Jarrett Boykin. Coale entered the ACC Championship Game having caught 32 catches for 352 yards, while Boykin grabbed 27 passes for 407 yards.|$|E
5|$|A {{free agent}} in March 2001, Henderson {{returned}} to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and {{on the final day}} of the season collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson. That final game was also Padre Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play. After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. With Gwynn having 3,141 hits, it was just the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3,000 career hits; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games together for the 1928 A's.|$|E

5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has {{caused a lot of}} anticipation, as it was expected that this would be the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> the Mississippi game {{in order to be able}} to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E
5|$|After {{five seasons}} with Lazio, Nedvěd was speculatively linked to several clubs (including Manchester United and Chelsea) {{before moving to}} Juventus in July 2001 for 75billionlire (€38.7million by fixed {{exchange}} rate). At Juventus, he replaced Zinedine Zidane, who had transferred to Real Madrid that summer. Nedvěd was a regular on Juventus' 2001–02 and 2002–03 Scudetto-winning teams. Although he was {{a substantial part of}} the club's championship season in 2003, he was also the subject of controversy. Nedvěd quit the Italian Footballers' Association in protest of the union's limit on non-European Union (EU) players; his native Czech Republic did not become an EU member until 2004. Although he was instrumental in leading Juventus to the 2003 UEFA Champions League final against Milan, he had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> the final due to an accumulation of yellow cards after his semi-final booking for a foul on Real Madrid midfielder Steve McManaman.|$|E
5|$|Bonneau {{came off}} the bench in {{the start of his}} {{freshman}} season for the SUNY Orange Colts, but he eventually was the team's leading scorer with 16.5 points and 1.9 steals per game, also averaging 3.8 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game. He had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> his sophomore season due to academic reasons. As a junior, he broke his wrist in training to miss the first six weeks of the season. Bonneau recognized that sitting out was of benefit to both his academic habits and his game. In 19 games with the Colts he averaged 30.9 points, 6.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.6 steals per game. After his second season at SUNY Orange, Bonneau drew interest by NCAA Division I colleges Providence and St. John's, but {{he was not able to}} enroll due to academic reasons.|$|E
60|$|On those days, if {{you were}} a poor {{creature}} and wanted to acknowledge it, you could leave the church {{for a few minutes and}} return to it, but the creditable thing was <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on.

5000|$|Another {{arrangement}} for an odd {{number of pairs}} is called a bump or rover movement, in which the number of tables is rounded down to (number of actual pairs - 1)/2. In a Mitchell movement, the extra pair normally <b>sits</b> <b>out</b> the first round and then, according to a schedule, substitutes for a different North-South pair for each subsequent round (the [...] "bumped" [...] pair having a <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> for that round). The extra pair are frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "rover pair" [...] because, unlike the other North-South pairs, they move at each round. In particular, the bump is preferable <b>to</b> the <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> for 11½ tables: it allows every pair to play at least 24 boards while having only 33 boards in play.|$|R
50|$|An {{estimated}} 10,500 CSU workers went {{on strike}} in March 1945 and began picketing all the studios resulting in delays of several films, including Selznick's epic Duel in the Sun and the Cole Porter story Night and Day. Unfortunately for CSU, the studios had some 130 films on the shelves {{at the time and}} were able <b>to</b> comfortably <b>sit</b> <b>out</b> a strike for the time being. Regardless, Disney, Monogram and several independents bargained with CSU while Columbia, Fox, MGM, Paramount, RKO, Universal, and Warner did not.|$|R
