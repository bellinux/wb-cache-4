40|$|We {{present the}} first cosmological galaxy evolved using the modern {{smoothed}} particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GASOLINE 2 with superbubble feedback. We show that superbubble-driven galactic outflows powered by Type II supernovae alone can produce L^* galaxies with flat rotation curves with circular velocities ∼ 200 km/s, low bulge-to-disc ratios, and stellar mass fractions that match observed values from high redshift to the present. These features are {{made possible by}} the high mass loadings generated by the evaporative growth of superbubbles. Outflows are driven extremely effectively at high redshift, expelling gas at early times and preventing overproduction of stars before z= 2. Centrally concentrated gas in previous simulations has often lead to unrealistically high bulge to <b>total</b> <b>ratios</b> and strongly peaked rotation curves. We show that supernova-powered superbubbles alone can produce galaxies that agree well with observed properties without the need for additional feedback mechanisms or increased feedback energy.

Previous {{studies have reported}} conflicting results of carnitine supplementation on plasma lipids in patients with chronic renal failure. We therefore performed a four center, double-blind placebo controlled trial to evaluate the effects of post-hemodialysis intravenous injection of L-carnitine in ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Thirty-eight patients received {{up to six months}} of L-carnitine infusions (20 mg/kg) post-dialysis and 44 patients received placebo infusions. In both groups of patients, baseline pre-dialysis plasma and red blood cell total carnitine levels were normal, but pre-dialysis plasma-free carnitine concentrations and free/ <b>total</b> <b>ratios</b> were subnormal, and plasma acyl levels were elevated. Post-dialysis plasma free and total carnitine concentrations were also subnormal. Plasma and red blood cell total carnitine levels rose eightfold in carnitine recipients, but were unchanged from baseline in those receiving placebo. There were no significant changes observed in plasma triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol or other lipoprotein parameters in either the carnitine or placebo treated groups. We conclude that carnitine metabolism is altered in uremia. Furthermore, in a randomly-selected hemodialysis population, L-carnitine injection at the dose of 20 mg/kg results in significant increases in blood (and perhaps tissue) carnitine levels, but this is not associated with any major effects on lipid profiles...|$|E
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the {{evolution}} of star-forming galaxies are studied using measures of the 2 -dimensional surface brightness profiles of a sample of 341 faint objects selected from the CFRS and LDSS redshift surveys that have been observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. The size function of disk scale lengths in disk-dominated galaxies (i. e. bulge to <b>total</b> <b>ratios,</b> B/T ≤ 0. 5) is found to stay roughly constant to z ~ 1, at least for those larger disks with exponential scale lengths α- 1 > 3. 2 h- 1 50 kpc, where the sample is most complete and where the disk and bulge decompositions are most reliable. This result, which is strengthened by inclusion of the local de Jong et al (1996) size function, suggests that the scale lengths of typical disks can not have grown substantially with cosmic epoch since z ~ 1, unless a corresponding number of large disks have been destroyed through merging. In addition to a roughly constant number density, the galaxies with large disks, α- 1 ≥ 4 h- 1 50 kpc, have, as a set, properties consistent with the idea that they are similar galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} ratio of ortho- to para-H 2 in {{photodissociation}} regions (PDRs). We draw attention to an apparent confusion in the literature between the ortho-to-para ratio of molecules in FUV-pumped vibrationally excited states and the total H 2 ortho-to-para abundance ratio. These ratios {{are not the same}} because the process of FUV pumping of fluorescent H 2 emission in PDRs occurs via optically thick absorption lines. Thus gas with an equilibrium ratio of ortho- to para-H 2 equal to 3 will yield FUV-pumped vibrationally excited ortho-to-para ratios smaller than 3, because the ortho-H 2 pumping rates are preferentially reduced by optical depth effects. Indeed, if the ortho and para pumping lines are on the "square root" part of the curve of growth, then the expected ratio of ortho and para vibrational line strengths is 3 (sup 1 / 2) approximately 1. 7, close to the typically observed value. Thus, contrary to what has sometimes been stated in the literature, most previous measurements of {{the ratio of}} ortho- to para-H 2 in vibrationally excited states are entirely consistent with a total ortho-to-para ratio of 3, the equilibrium value for temperatures greater than 200 K. We present an analysis and several detailed models that illustrate the relationship between the <b>total</b> <b>ratios</b> of ortho- to para-H 2 and the vibrationally excited ortho-to-para ratios in PDRs.

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} the microparticle deposition and distribution {{due to the}} presence of duct bends by employing the Eulerian approach with Reynolds stress turbulent model and a Lagrangian trajectory method. The air velocity, particle velocity and particle deposition velocity were validated with available experimental data. Several particle deposition ratios were proposed to describe the particle accumulation due to bends. Particle deposition velocities in and behind bends were analyzed numerically. It is found that bend walls with surfaces of higher capture velocity tend to accumulate more contaminant particles as seen with an increased factor of 1. 2 times on particle deposition velocity. Particle deposition reaches a maximum value near bend outlet, e. g. 15. 2 times deposition ratio for particles of d p= 23 μm, and decay exponentially to a status of fully developed deposition in approximately 10 D length. Compared to traditional consideration of sole deposition in bends, a new general concept of total deposition including that in bends and behind bends is proposed to better describe the particle deposition induced by bends since the enhancement deposition ratios behind bends compose 42 - 99 % in the <b>total</b> <b>ratios</b> for particles of d p= 3 - 23 μm. Furthermore, models of fast power and exponential decay trend are demonstrated to uncover the relationship among enhancement factor of deposition velocity behind bend, dimensionless distance behind bends and particle Stokes number.

40|$|International audienceLake level {{fluctuations}} {{and environmental}} changes {{during the late}} Holocene were inferred from changes in sedimentology, bulk and isotope organic geochemistry, and a diatom based transfer function in a sediment core from Boqueirao Lake, northeast Brazil. The age-depth model was established using fifteen AMS 14 C dates. Lake water level began increasing about AD 400, and reached its maximum during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), AD similar to 900 - 1100. Low lake water level was recorded during the Little Ice Age (LIA), AD similar to 1400 - 1820, which allowed macrophyte development in the littoral zone that was recorded by high C org /N <b>total</b> <b>ratios.</b> Considerable lake level variability was evident during the Current Warm Period (CWP). Humid/dry conditions in northeast Brazil during MCA/LIA, respectively, {{are related to the}} southward shift of Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during austral summer and fall. Those conditions contrast with records of a decrease/increase in the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) during these periods. This observation also contrasts with paleoclimate inferences from the circum-Caribbean region indicating a northward shift of the ITCZ northern hemisphere summer position during the MCA and a southward shift during the LIA. We suggest that these shifts in ITCZ seasonality were higher during the MCA and smaller during the LIA. Our aim was to answer whether the zonal atmospheric circulation cell between the Amazon and northeast Brazil was responsible for antiphasing with the SASM. A strong monsoon over South America during the LIA reinforced convection upon Amazon, increasing the northeast low in the upper troposphere and large-scale subsidence over northeast Brazil and the Atlantic Ocean leading to a northward repositioning of the South Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone. These factors in combination may have limited the southward seasonal shift of ITCZ, and they must have been responsible for drier conditions in northeast Brazil during the LIA...|$|E

The results were obtained by analysis of either the singles spectra, or spectra obtained by coincidence-sum techniques, or both. For the coincidence work gating was done either with high energy gamma rays or with beta particles. The spectra from the Yb isotopes were analyzed on a computer using a least-squares curve-fitting program. The photon detection efficiencies, necessary for the measurements, were calculated with a computer by performing numerical integrations. The following K-shell internal {{conversion coefficients}} were measured directly for first excited state to ground state transitions: 0. 632 ± 0. 016, for Gdl 54; 1. 48 ± 0. 05, for Ybl 70; 6. 9 : 1 : 1. 0, for Ybl 71 and 0. 375 ± 0. 009, for Prl 41. The total internal conversion coefficients were measured for the first excited state to ground state transitions in Gdl 54 and nyl 60 and found to be 1. 20 ± 0. 02 and 4. 52 ± 0. 11, which yield respective K-shell internal conversion coefficients of 0. 637 ± 0. 016 and 1. 54 ± 0. 06 when multiplied by K to <b>total</b> <b>ratios.</b> The results for these 2 +- 3 ̆e 0 + transitions in Gdl 54 and Dyl 60 and for this -t -forbidden Ml transition in Prl 41 are in good agreement with theory.

Ocean Drilling Program Site 1139 was drilled at a water depth of 1415 m on Skiff Bank's western edge. Hole 1139 A penetrated {{to a depth of}} 695 meters below seafloor (mbsf) with sediment recovered from the upper 462 m and igneous basement recovered from the lower 233 m. A total of 19 basement units were identified, including variably welded trachytic to rhyolitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (Units 1 - 5) and 14 lava flows with intermediate to mafic compositions (Units 6 - 19) (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2000, doi: 10. 2973 /odp. proc. ir. 183. 101. 2000). To better assess the mass transfer of major elements associated with these unique alteration patterns, we have conducted a detailed chemical analysis of both major and trace elements in samples from the basement units of Hole 1139 A. These data are reported here, along with whole-rock analyses for carbon, sulfur, and ferrous/ferric ratios (Table T 1). Downhole trends for SiO 2, C, Fe 3 +/Fe total, and loss on ignition (LOI) are shown. The trends serve to quantify the distinct alteration observed in some basement units within Hole 1139 A. For example, carbon increases dramatically below 570 mbsf and shows large enrichments in basement Units 5 - 19. The data also show that iron becomes more reducing with depth overall, with Fe 3 +/Fe <b>total</b> <b>ratios</b> dropping to as low as 0. 13 in basement Unit 18. The large variations in this ratio with depth probably reflect alteration zones with variable amounts of hematite and siderite.

40|$|Glauconites and {{phosphates}} {{have been}} detected in almost all investigated samples at Sites 798 (uppermost Miocene or lower Pliocene to Pleistocene) and 799 (early middle Miocene to Pleistocene). Autochthonous occurrences appear in very minor quantities (generally below 0. 2 %) throughout the drilled sequences, whereas allochthonous accumulations are limited to the lower Pliocene or uppermost Miocene sequence at Site 798 (glauconites) and to the upper and middle Miocene sequence at Site 799 (upper and middle Miocene: glauconites; middle Miocene: phosphates). X-ray fluorescence, microprobe, and bulk chemical analyses indicate high variabilities in cations and anions and generally low oxide totals. This is probably related to the substitution of phosphate and fluoride aniors by hydroxide and carbonate anions in phosphates and to the depletion of iron, aluminum, and potassium cations and the enrichment in hydroxide and crystal water in glauconites. Gradients in pore-water contents of dissolved phosphate and fluoride at Sites 798 and 799 suggest a depth of phosphate precipitation between 30 and 50 mbsf, with fluoride as the limiting element for phosphate precipitation at Site 798. Phosphate and fluoride appear to be balanced at Site 799. Crude extrapolations indicate that the Japan-Sea sediments may have taken up approximately 7. 2 * 10 ** 10 g P total/yr during the Neogene and Pleistocene. This amount corresponds to approximately 0. 3 % of the estimated present-day global transfer of phosphorus into the sediments and suggests that the Japan Sea constitutes an average sink for this element. The two main carriers of phosphorus into the present Japan Sea are the Tshushima and the Liman currents, importing approximately 6. 6 * 10 ** 10 g P and 5. 7 * 10 ** 10 g P per year, respectively. Bulk chemical analyses suggest that at least 36 % of P total in the sediments is organically bound phosphorus. This rather high value, which corresponds to the measured Japan-Sea deep-water P organic/P <b>total</b> <b>ratios,</b> probably reflects rapid transport of organic phosphorus into {{the depth of the}} Japan Sea...|$|E

A discrepancy in tooth size between the mandibular and maxillary arch is usually the cause of disharmonious occlusion ratios. One of the most widespread methods in determining of discrepancy in tooth size between the upper and lower jaw is the Bolton analysis of mesiodistal width of permanent teeth. Material and methods. The subjects of both sexes with the permanent dentition and occlusive ratio of Angle Class I classification had had the precise impressions taken on the basis of which the study models were obtained. 60 patients were selected for this investigation (30 males and 30 females) according to the following criteria: the presence of completely erupted teeth of permanent dentition from the first molar on one side to the first molar {{on the other side of}} the dental string; good quality of the study models; the absence of mesiodistal and occlusive abrasion, caries lesions, Class II fillings; the absence of prosthetic or composite restoration; the absence of anomalies in regard to shapes, structures and tooth development. We measured the mesiodistal width of each tooth from the first molar on one side to the first molar on the other side, from the mesial contact point to the distal contact point with the greatest interproximal distance. Results. The obtained results for mesiodistal tooth width of the right and left side do not show statistically significant differences. The mean values of the Bolton anterior ratio showed neither the sexual dimorphism nor did the mean values of the Bolton total ratio show any differences in sexes. The mean values of the Bolton anterior ratio in our examinees of both sexes are significantly higher compared to the values of Bolton norms.

30|$|The August 2008 ash samples {{have higher}} SiO 2 {{contents}} than {{do most of}} the 2011 rock samples (equivalent to erupted magma) and past ejecta (Fig. 12). This indicates that the 2008 samples are not simple mixtures of 2011 ejecta and past ejecta. The compositional variation of the 2010 and 2011 ash samples can be approximated by a mixture of the above two major ash constituents (Fig. 12). The ash components derived from the past ejecta are “partly altered pumice + scoria”, “partly altered lava” and “altered material”, while those derived from the erupted magma in 2011 are “juvenile material” and “fresh lava”. Ash samples of post-January 19, 2011 eruptions have lower bulk SiO 2 contents than those of earlier eruptions (Fig. 11). <b>Total</b> <b>ratios</b> of “juvenile material” and “fresh lava” particles are higher in the post-January 19, 2011 eruptions (19.2 – 72.7 vol%), than in the earlier eruptions (0.4 – 12.6 vol%). The relationship can be explained by compositional differences between the erupted magma and past ejecta. As sμmmarized in Subsection 5.2, the averaged composition of the erupted magma is 57 – 58 wt% SiO 2 (Suzuki et al., 2013), whereas most past ejecta have 59 – 63 wt% SiO 2 (Tajima et al., 2013) (Fig. 12). The contribution of 1716 – 1717 pumice fragments (57 – 58 wt% SiO 2; Miyamoto, 2012) to 2010 to 2011 ash samples seems small, because particle ratios of “partly altered scoria and pumice” are much lower than that of “partly altered lava” (Fig. 2). We thus conclude that the decrease in bulk ash SiO 2 content {{at the start of the}} sub-Plinian eruption (Fig. 11) was produced by an increased contribution of 2011 magma to the ash (Fig. 14). This model is consistent with the bulk ash compositions of March 2010 and January 19, 2011, which are comparable to the most frequent compositions of past ejecta (59 – 63 wt% SiO 2) excluding the 1716 – 1717 pumice (Fig. 12). We infer that the uncatego-rized “lava” particles in the second phreatomagmatic stage (June to August 2011; Subsection 5.1. 2) consist of the same constituents as are in the vulcanian stage (i.e. “fresh lava” and “partly altered lava”), because of similar bulk ash compositions (Figs. 11 and 12) and similar juvenile material ratios (Fig. 2) between the two stages.|$|E
