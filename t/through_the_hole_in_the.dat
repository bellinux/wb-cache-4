25|$|Most modern sewing {{machines}} use the lockstitch technique of sewing invented by Walter Hunt, {{which consists of}} two threads, an upper and a lower. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, a take-up arm, and finally <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> needle. The lower thread is wound onto a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine. Walter Hunt invented the first lock-stitch sewing machine in 1833. Hunt lost interest and did not patent his invention. In 1846, Elias Howe secured a patent on an original lock-stitch machine, and failed to manufacture and market it. Isaac Singer infringed on Howe's patent {{to make his own}} machine, making him wealthy. Elias Howe filed a lawsuit, alleging patent infringement. On July 1, 1854, a federal commission ruled in favor of Howe, ordering Isaac Singer as well as all sewing machine makers to pay Elias Howe royalties.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{developed}} {{hand signals}} to communicate {{things they did}} not want the guards or other prisoners to hear. When a prisoner wanted to pass a note down to a girlfriend, he would attach a little bundle {{to the end of a}} long rope woven from mattress fibers and throw the bundle down into the street. The girlfriend down below would run to catch the bundle and take out the note. This would also give her an opportunity to stuff a note, cigarettes, drugs, a photograph of their child, a weapon, into the bundle, which the inmate could then hoist back up <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall, before the guards came running to intercept the line. They called these rope and bundle setups palomas ("pigeons") and apparently, at any given time, seven or eight palomas could be flying down into the street, or back up to the prison, attached to their makeshift ropes.|$|E

During Ramadhan, he is sent to buy a blanket but, on the way home, a wayward cigar burns a hole in the blanket. Afraid of what his wife will say, Dang buys another blanket. The first blanket is given to Dang's stepson, Boejoeng. Later that week, Dang tries to break the fast early by {{stealing}} some biscuits. Rather than be found out by his stepson, Dang convinces Boejoeng to cover his head with his blanket. That evening Boejoeng, having seen Dang take the biscuits <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blanket, demands that his stepfather double his allowance or else he will reveal Dang's secret. This story was written for Kawan Bergeloet.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{reach of}} children, {{there is an}} Iron Age beehive quern-stone with {{removable}} wooden handle and plenty of grain for grinding. [...] Visitors are invited {{to look at a}} drawing of the inner structure of the object, and to try to work out how to grind the corn. [...] When turning the headstone, you can feel how the grain lessens the friction enough for the headstone to turn easily, while the roughness of the stone continues to provide enough friction to grind the corn: a paradox perhaps, but it works. [...] However, to allow entry of grain, the central wooden spindle of a quern-stone is by necessity very loosely fitted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> headstone, which means that the headstone can move sideways, and young children's fingers must be supervised.|$|E
2500|$|Over the {{six days}} from 4 May 1982, five {{inspections}} {{were made to}} see if any equipment was worth salvaging. Orders were issued to shore up the hole in Sheffield's starboard side and tow the ship to South Georgia. Before these orders were effected, however, the burnt-out hulk had already been taken in tow by the [...] Yarmouth. The high seas that the ship was towed through caused slow flooding <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ship's side, which eventually sank her.

All new Navy recruits are required to view a training video titled Trial by Fire: A Carrier Fights for Life, produced from footage of the fire and damage control efforts, both successful and unsuccessful. On the one hand, there were damage-control teams spraying firefighting foam on the deck to contain the flames, which was the correct procedure, while on the other hand, crewmen {{on the other side}} of the deck sprayed seawater, washing away the foam and worsening the situation by washing burning fuel <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flight deck into the decks below. [...] The burning fuel was not easily extinguished and was spread by water. Due to the first bomb blast, which killed nearly all of the specially trained firefighters on the ship, the remaining crew, who had no formal firefighting training, were forced to improvise.|$|E

2500|$|The {{steel balls}} were {{intended}} to prevent a nuclear detonation even if the explosives fired accidentally, or in any conceivable accident. The ball bearings {{had to be removed}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bomb casing during flight preparation, and after the bomb was winched into the aircraft. The ball bearings then had to be re-inserted into the lowered and upturned bomb before transport back to the bomb store. Quite obviously, without the ball bearings installed, these weapons were armed and live, and too dangerous to allow to be flown on exercises. Bomber Command exercises demonstrated that flight preparation followed by a scramble take-off could not be reduced below thirty minutes, and on exercises in bad weather and at night a ninety-minute scramble was the norm. At least one accident, dated 1960, was reported in the press when the plastic bung was removed and 133,000 steel ball bearings exited onto the aircraft hangar floor, leaving the bomb armed and vulnerable. The Royal Air Force were so nervous of the outcome of a fire in storage that permission was sought to store the bombs inverted, so that a loss of the plastic bung could not end with the steel balls on the floor, leaving the HEU unprotected against a subsequent explosion. Even without the partial nuclear detonation feared by the RAF, there was [...] "a risk of catastrophe" ...|$|E

[...] Once it reaches the sky the bundle comes undone and scatters stars across the sky.

2500|$|In 1984, Martin Peng of ORNL {{proposed}} an alternate {{arrangement of the}} magnet coils that would greatly reduce the aspect ratio while avoiding the erosion issues of the compact tokamak: a Spherical tokamak. Instead of wiring each magnet coil separately, he proposed using a single large conductor in the center, and wiring the magnets as half-rings off of this conductor. What was once a series of individual rings passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the reactor {{was reduced to a}} single post, allowing for aspect ratios as low as 1.2. The ST concept appeared to represent an enormous advance in tokamak design. However, it was being proposed during a period when US fusion research budgets were being dramatically scaled back. ORNL was provided with funds to develop a suitable central column built out of a high-strength copper alloy called [...] "Glidcop". However, they were unable to secure funding to build a demonstration machine, [...] "STX". Failing to build an ST at ORNL, Peng began a worldwide effort to interest other teams in the ST concept and get a test machine built. One way to do this quickly would be to convert a spheromak machine to the Spherical tokamak layout. Peng's advocacy also caught the interest of Derek Robinson, of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority fusion center at Culham. Robinson was able to gather together a team and secure funding on the order of 100,000 pounds to build an experimental machine, the Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak, or START. Several parts of the machine were recycled from earlier projects, while others were loaned from other labs, including a 40 keV neutral beam injector from ORNL. Construction of START began in 1990, it was assembled rapidly and started operation in January 1991.|$|E
