However, <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> manages to disable the sub using a high-pitched frequency, stranding it far below the ice.|$|E

5|$|The player's craft has {{a limited}} amount of armour, which is {{depleted}} as the helicopter is hit by enemy fire. Should armour reach zero, <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> will be destroyed, costing the player a life. The player must outmanoeuvre enemies to avoid damage, but can replenish armour by means of power-ups or by airlifting rescued friendlies or captives to a landing zone. Vehicles have a finite amount of fuel which is steadily depleted as the level progresses. Should the fuel run out, the vehicle will crash, again costing the player a life. <b>The</b> <b>craft</b> can refuel by collecting fuel barrels. Vehicles also carry limited ammunition, which must be replenished by means of ammo crates.|$|E
5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) later {{reports to}} Reyes and Scully that Comer has died. Reyes accuses Toothpick Man {{and others in}} the room of killing Comer. Meanwhile, Scully visits Doggett, who warns her not to trust the cultists. However, Scully goes to meet Josepho near Calgary. Josepho claims to be {{protecting}} William, but demands Mulder's head as collateral in exchange for the baby's release. When Josepho returns to the wreck site, the Overcoat Woman relates that the aperture of <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> began to glow when William started crying. <b>The</b> <b>craft</b> soon rises up out of the ground. Looking on the site from a distance, Scully and Reyes see <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> burst out of an enclosure and into space, lighting the ground beneath it on fire as it goes. The two find an unharmed William among the charred bodies of the cultists.|$|E
5|$|Although {{close to}} Jupiter, New Horizons {{instruments}} made refined {{measurements of the}} orbits of Jupiter's inner moons, particularly Amalthea. The probe's cameras measured volcanoes onIo, studied all four Galilean moons in detail, and made long-distance studies of the outer moons Himalia and Elara. <b>The</b> <b>craft</b> also studied Jupiter's Little Red Spot and the planet's magnetosphere and tenuous ring system.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crafting</b> {{system was}} similar to the one used in Korean MMORPGs, since it was based on random numbers. First, a player had to obtain a {{blueprint}} and the resources required for <b>crafting.</b> Then <b>the</b> player docked at a space station, selected <b>the</b> <b>crafting</b> menu, placed <b>the</b> blueprint on the corresponding slot and then checked the end result, which was shown before <b>the</b> <b>crafting</b> process started. Then the player started <b>the</b> <b>crafting</b> process, which took an amount of time based on the end product level. While <b>crafting,</b> <b>the</b> player wasn't able to do anything else, and only one item could be crafted at a time. If all did go well, the player got their product after <b>the</b> <b>crafting</b> was finished. <b>The</b> process had a chance to fail, in which case no product was produced and all of the resources used in production were lost. There was also a chance for a perfect crafting, which produced an item with stats better than originally anticipated. Such items could be sold for a very high price to other players.|$|R
5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch and steering, or pitch only. The former allows <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows the nose of <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> to be raised or lowered by motion control, with the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E
5|$|Anderson only {{attended}} {{film school}} for two days, preferring to learn <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> by watching films by the filmmakers he liked, {{as well as}} watching films accompanied by director's audio commentary. Anderson has cited Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Jonathan Demme, Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, Max Ophüls and Robert Downey, Sr. as his main influences as a filmmaker.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{strikes at}} the press event. <b>The</b> <b>craft</b> {{apparently}} draws power from the broadcasting equipment, and its influence is magnified. The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} the population are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs to the top of a building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E

5|$|During the {{ceremony}} of initiation, the candidate {{is expected to}} swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of <b>the</b> <b>craft,</b> others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate lattices {{are found}} in Indian Jaali work, carved in marble to adorn tombs and palaces. Chinese lattices, always with some symmetry, exist in 14 of the 17 {{wallpaper}} groups; they often have mirror, double mirror, or rotational symmetry. Some have a central medallion, and some have a border in a frieze group. Many Chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by Daniel S. Dye; he identifies Sichuan as the centre of <b>the</b> <b>craft.</b>|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry {{and women}} have a complex relationship, which can be readily divided into many phases with no {{demonstrable}} relationship to each other until the 20th century. A few women were involved in Freemasonry before the 18th century; however the first printed constitutions of the Premier Grand Lodge of England appeared to bar them from <b>the</b> <b>Craft</b> forever.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> in less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> was {{much more difficult to}} fly than had been expected, and would not be safe {{in the hands of an}} inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, a NASA {{press release}} {{said that the}} {{consensus}} was that Voyager 1 was then in the heliosheath. In a scientific session at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans {{on the morning of}} May 25, 2005, Dr. Ed Stone presented evidence that <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> crossed the termination shock in late 2004. This event is estimated to have occurred on December 15, 2004 at a distance of 94 AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{announced}} in June 2012 that the probe was detecting {{changes in the}} environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause. Voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space, which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the Sun. <b>The</b> <b>craft</b> thus began to enter the interstellar medium {{at the edge of}} the Solar System.|$|E
