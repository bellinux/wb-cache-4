2500|$|According to {{the fifth}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), DID {{symptoms}} include [...] "the presence {{of two or more}} distinct personality states" [...] accompanied by the inability to recall personal information, beyond what is expected through normal forgetfulness. Other DSM-5 symptoms include a loss of identity as related to individual distinct personality states, and loss referring to <b>time,</b> <b>sense</b> of self and consciousness. In each individual, the clinical presentation varies and the level of [...] functioning can change from severely impaired to adequate. [...] The symptoms of dissociative amnesia are subsumed under the DID diagnosis but can be diagnosed separately. Individuals with DID may experience distress from both the symptoms of DID (intrusive thoughts or emotions) and the consequences of the accompanying symptoms (dissociation rendering them unable to remember specific information). The majority of patients with DID report childhood sexual or physical abuse, though the accuracy of these reports is controversial. [...] Identities may be unaware of each other and compartmentalize knowledge and memories, resulting in chaotic personal lives. Individuals with DID may be reluctant to discuss symptoms due to associations with abuse, shame, and fear. DID patients may also frequently and intensely experience time disturbances.|$|E

Cooperative sensing can incur additional cooperation overhead, increased energy consumption, extra <b>sensing</b> <b>time</b> and delay in heterogeneous networks.

At the touch of the bale it was as if I had awakened from a dreamless sleep. I immediately perceived that if I wanted to keep awake and alive I must get a light or open a window, so as to get a grip of something with my eyes. And besides, I was cold. I kicked off from the bale, therefore, clawed on to the thin cords within the glass, crawled along until I got to the manhole rim, and so got my bearings for the light and blind studs, took a shove off, and flying once round the bale, and getting a scare from something big and flimsy that was drifting loose, I got my hand on the cord quite close to the studs, and reached them. I lit the little lamp first of all {{to see what it was}} I had collided with, and discovered that old copy of Lloyd's News had slipped its moorings, and was adrift in the void. That brought me out of the infinite to my own proper dimensions again. It made me laugh and pant for a time, and suggested the idea of a little oxygen from one of the cylinders. After that I lit the heater until I felt warm, and then I took food. Then I set to work in a very gingerly fashion on the Cavorite blinds, to see if I could guess by any means how the sphere was travelling.|$|E

But their proposed model do not differentiate between busy <b>time</b> <b>senses</b> due to the activity of stations within transmission range or carrier sense range (outside transmission range) because they treated these both ranges as single sensing range.

We also devise computationally efficient Algorithms [1 – 4] for modeling busy probability b(i) and average busy duration T_b(i).

Beyond honeybees, much of Beling’s work involved studying behaviors of wasps, fly pupae, etc. Finally, she also did some research in pest control.|$|E

He then flew these bees to New York, in a constantly illuminated environment to see if <b>time</b> <b>sense</b> (coming back to the same spot in 24 hour intervals) could happen without constant exogenous factors, i.e. external factors like sunlight or temperature. The experiment examined whether the change in geographic latitude and different time zones impacted what time the bees would come back for food. He found that bees returned to the same place in roughly 24 hour intervals even in the new location, indicating the presence of an endogenous clock, that is, a regulator intrinsic to the organism independent of the environment.|$|E
