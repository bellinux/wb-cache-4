40|$|Micro {{thruster}} is {{the power}} plant of mini-spacecraft. It enables the mini-spacecraft to realize orbit adjustment, station keeping and attitude controlling. Micro nozzle is one of key parts of the micro thruster. The surface roughness of its inner surface significantly influences the thrust performance of the thruster. In this paper, a residual surface model is developed for micro-nozzle obtained by micro machining using a ball end <b>mill</b> and a <b>taper</b> end <b>mill.</b> The residual surface model is then used to investigate {{the relationship between the}} surface quality and nozzle thrust performance in nozzle flow field. A thrust measuring apparatus is designed and manufactured to inspect the thrust performance of the machined micro nozzles. Both simulation and experiment results indicate that good machined surface quality is obtained with <b>taper</b> end <b>mill.</b> The nozzle machined with the <b>taper</b> end <b>mill</b> has better thrust performance than that with the ball end mill under the same inlet pressure...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to analyse the {{grinding}} processes and develop a search system of database for cutting tools. Design/methodology/approach: A tool grinding software with open architecture was used to analyse the grinding processes of square end <b>mills,</b> <b>tapered</b> square end <b>mills,</b> ball nose end <b>mills,</b> <b>tapered</b> ball nose end mills, radius end <b>mills,</b> <b>tapered</b> radius end <b>mills,</b> straight flute reamers, helical flute reamers, flat drills, twist drills, and step drills. According to the characteristics of these tools, 20270 data were established in the relational database. The SQL syntax was then utilized for writing the search algorithm, and the C++ Builder was employed for designing human machine interfaces of the search system of the tool database. Findings: A half of time on the tool design and the change of production line for grinding other types of tools can be saved by means of the proposed system. More specifically, the efficiency in terms of the overall machining time was improved up to 10. 58 %, 9. 36 %, 4. 64 %, and 7. 52 % for grinding the radius end <b>mill,</b> <b>tapered</b> radius end <b>mill,</b> twist drill, and step drill, respectively. Research limitations/implications: Special tools have diversification. They can not be taken into consideration in the database system owing to the tools have specific profiles. Therefore, it is difficult to encode by formal rules. Practical implications: The most commercial tool grinding software is the modular-based design and uses tool shapes to construct the CAM interface. However, it is very difficult for users to design new cutting tools. Utilizing the grinding processes to construct the grinding path of tools, and the search system of the database provides more flexible options to develop new cutting tools. Originality/value: The database and search system of cutting tools were presented in this paper. We can save time for production line change, tool design, and tool grinding by employing this kind of system. It also gives more convenience. That is, company’s productivity and benefit can be improved...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the retention forces of differently fabricated secondary crowns made of Co-Cr alloy and electroforming secondary crowns considering different taper angles. Cobalt-chromium primary crowns with 0 °, 1 ° and 2 ° taper angles were fabricated. Secondary crowns were made either by i) amilling and sintering, ii) castingor iii) electro-forming process. Pull-off tests were performed and {{data were analyzed}} by parametric statistics (p< 0. 05). With regard to the different <b>taper</b> angles, Co-Cr <b>milled</b> and cast groups, no impact on retention force was observed.

Primary crowns with different tapers (0 °, 1 °, and 2 °) were fabricated and secondary crowns that were either milled from breCam BioHPP blanks, pressed from pellets (BioHPP Pellet) or granules (BioHPP Granulat) were produced. Each specimen was measured 20 times in a pulloff-test and results were analyzed using 2 -/ 1 -way ANOVA and linear regression analyses (p< 0. 05). Within 0 ° <b>tapered</b> crowns <b>milled</b> secondary crowns showed lower retention forces compared to pressed pellet crowns. Crowns with a 1 ° taper, however, showed no impact of the fabrication method on retention force. At a 2 ° taper, granular pressed crowns displayed lower values than their milled counterparts.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cutting of}} bevel gears on {{universal}} 5 -axis milling machines represents a promising solution {{to replace the}} conventional cutting process. The process is highly flexible and does not require neither special gear generating machines nor special tools. Thus, it is particularly suitable for small batches, prototypes or to obtain a specific and unique product. In this way, we {{have focused on the}} machining of a large-sized spiral bevel gear, from the initial design to the final machining. A gear will be machined using different milling paths and scallop heights. Each of the different strategies will be applied in consecutive teeth, and afterwards these teeth will be analyzed to check some of the gear quality parameters (roughness, profile angle variation, single pitch error [...] .) with the final goal of finding the optimal cutting strategy. As finishing tool, an air turbine finishing tool was evaluated as an alternative technology apart from the typical <b>tapered</b> ball end <b>mill...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractMachining {{optimization}} algorithms in end-milling with helical cutters {{require an}} efficient and accurate {{model of the}} uncut chip thickness (UCT) at every location along the cutting flutes. Past work has either ignored the effects of tool tilt and orientation or treated them with simple assumptions about their coupling with tool shape. The current paper treats the problem with considerably greater generality using an arc-length parameterization of the axis-symmetric tool profile. Each discrete tool move was considered a 3 -axis motion. Ignoring tool run-out, UCT was calculated {{in the direction of}} direct correspondence to local oblique cutting geometry, i. e., perpendicular to the local cutting edge and cutting velocity. The flute curves were intersected with the engagement contour corresponding to the instantaneous tool-work contact and the UCT inspected within. For a candidate <b>taper</b> ball end <b>mill,</b> the UCT results of the new model were compared with the standard Martellotti model. The new model agrees closely with the Martellotti model in the flank region and predicts a more realistic variation in the ball region...|$|R
40|$|Multi-axis milling offers {{increased}} accessibility in milling {{of parts}} having geometrical constraints or free form surfaces, where variety of cutting tools and edge geometries are utilized to improve stability and {{productivity of the}} processes. In order to machine the desired geometries effectively, in conjunction with multi-axis orientations, special tools ranging from <b>taper</b> end <b>mills</b> to process specific form tools are utilized. For such cases, the cutter workpiece engagement boundaries (CWEB) and directional force vector definitions are very complex and cannot be defined analytically. Furthermore, irregular cutting edge geometries, such as variable helix, pitch and serrations introduce multiple time delays between successive cuts where the conventional analytical frequency domain stability solution cannot be used. Prediction of stability diagrams for such variety of tool forms and edge geometries requires both {{the process and the}} tool to be defined in a generalized manner. In this paper, a numerical frequency domain milling stability solution method is proposed. The CWEB for complex multi-axis cases are calculated by the general projective geometry approach, where the cutting tool envelope and the cutting edges are represented as organized point clouds. Zeroth-Order approximation (ZOA) frequency domain method is adapted by introducing a speed average time delay term to encompass regular and irregular tool geometries. The stability limits are predicted by iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem using the ZOA frequency domain with the proposed revision. The effect of the process damping is also introduced into the generalized stability solution in order to predict the increase in the stability limits at low cutting speeds. A previously proposed approach is used to calculate the average process damping coefficients, which are introduced as modifiers to the modal parameters. The proposed generalized methodology is applied on several cases and it is shown that stability limits can be predicted within a reasonable accuracy for wide variety of cutting tools and milling operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{most popular}} tools for {{generating}} the gears are hobs, whose materials are the High Speed Steel (HSS) {{in the many}} case. Because the HSS contains such the rare components as W, Mo, Co and V, the material cost is expensive. A sequence for manufacturing the hobs consists of (1) hob-thread roughing, (2) flute milling (3) normalizing the body, (4) backing-off hob thread, (5) quenching and tempering and (6) grinding. Thus the sequence is very complicated and the machinability of HSS also is very poor due to the alloy elements above mentioned. Therefore the manufacture cost is higher too. In this paper the cost-down methods are developed in rough threading the large-sized hobs {{and the availability of}} these methods are checked by exprimenting with two typical end mills on the backing-off lathe. In order to decrease the rough machining times, the above operations (1) and (4) among the above operations are simultaneously worked on the backing-off lathe. Thus, in case of module 20 hob, the rough threading and backing time 33 hours required in the ordinary way can be shortened up to 24 hours. Through these results, it is cleared that the threading in backing with the <b>tapered</b> surfy end <b>mill</b> is hopeful for decreasing the manufacture prices...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE To {{investigate}} the retention loads of differently fabricated secondary telescopic polyetheretherketone (PEEK) crowns on cobalt-chromium primary crowns with different tapers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cobalt-chromium primary crowns with 0 °, 1 °, and 2 ° <b>tapers</b> were constructed, <b>milled,</b> and sintered. Corresponding secondary crowns were fabricated by milling, pressing from pellets, and pressing from granules. For these nine test groups, the pull-off tests of each crown combination were performed 20 times, and the retention loads were measured (Zwick 1445, 50 mm/min). Data {{were analyzed using}} linear regression, covariance analysis, mixed models, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U-test, together with the Benferroni-Holm correction. RESULTS The mixed models covariance analysis reinforced stable retention load values (p = 0. 162) for each single test sequence. There was no interaction between the groups and the separation cycles (p = 0. 179). Milled secondary crowns with 0 ° showed the lowest mean retention load values compared to all tested groups (p = 0. 003) followed by those pressed form pellets with 1 °. Regarding the different tapers, no effect of manufacturing method on the results was observed within 1 ° and 2 ° groups (p = 0. 540; p = 0. 052); however, among the 0 ° groups, the milled ones showed significantly the lowest retention load values (p = 0. 002). Among the manufacturing methods, both pressed groups showed no impact of taper on the retention load values (p > 0. 324 and p > 0. 123, respectively), whereas among the milled secondary crowns, the 0 ° taper showed significantly lower retention load values than the 1 ° and 2 ° taper (p < 0. 002). CONCLUSION Based on these results, telescopic crowns made of PEEK seem to show stable retention load values for each test sequence; however, data with thermo-mechanical aging are still required. In addition, further developments in CAD/CAM manufacturing of PEEK materials for telescopic crowns are warranted, especially for 0 °...|$|R
