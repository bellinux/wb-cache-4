5|$|After the deicing {{truck was}} repaired, the pilot {{requested}} a second deicing, though {{the flight crew}} did not perform a walkaround of their airplane, and USAir procedures did not require them to do so. Following the second deicing, LaGuardia ground control granted Flight 405 permission <b>to</b> <b>taxi</b> to Runway 13. The flight crew completed the pre-flight checklist during the taxi.|$|E
5|$|At 14:50 CDT, Flight 191 {{pushed back}} from gate K5 and was cleared <b>to</b> <b>taxi</b> to runway 32R. Maintenance crews {{present at the}} gate did not notice {{anything}} unusual during push back, engine start, or taxi. Everything looked normal as the flight began its takeoff roll at 15:03.|$|E
5|$|The jet, already {{several hours}} behind schedule, then {{suffered}} further delays taxiing to the runway. The weather had created heavy ground traffic at LaGuardia, {{and it was}} reported that there were queues of aircraft waiting for permission for takeoff. Investigators estimated that the plane took between 25 and 45 minutes <b>to</b> <b>taxi</b> from the gate to the runway.|$|E

5|$|At 5:24pm Cooper was {{informed}} that his demands had been met, and at 5:39pm the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Cooper instructed Scott <b>to</b> <b>taxi</b> the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the tarmac and close each window shade in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes (to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer) and delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper permitted all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.|$|E
5|$|By 07:40, {{all five}} hijackers were aboard the flight, {{scheduled}} to depart at 07:45. Mohamed Atta sat in business class seat 8D with Abdulaziz al-Omari in 8G and Suqami in 10B. Waleed al-Shehri and Wail al-Shehri sat {{in first class}} seats 2B and 2A. At 07:46, one minute behind schedule, the aircraft received clearance to push back from Gate B32, and was cleared <b>to</b> <b>taxi</b> to the runway at 07:50. The aircraft began its takeoff run from Logan International Airport at 07:59 from runway4R.|$|E

Flight 1 became airborne at 10:07 AM EST. Following American Airlines procedures and Departure Control instructions, the aircraft initiated a left turn to a heading of 290. In {{the course of the}} turn, at 1,600 feet, the Boeing banked too far, flipped past 90 degrees, and began an upside-down, nose-first descent in a nearly vertical dive.|$|E

5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the staff member was advised of {{a telephone call from}} his wife and he went to answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed the drain cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began <b>to</b> <b>taxi</b> prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over and rolled some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Hiroshima was {{the primary}} target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as {{alternative}} targets. Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, in the Mariana Islands, about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, The Great Artiste, carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted <b>to</b> <b>taxi,</b> Tibbets leaned {{out the window to}} direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave for the cameras.|$|E

25|$|Uber {{is a major}} {{competitor}} <b>to</b> <b>taxi</b> companies, providing on-demand for-hire {{car service}} through a smartphone app in many US cities. Uber services are generally treated as black-car services from a legal standpoint and are not generally regulated under Taxi laws.

25|$|In June 2015, Honda {{announced}} {{its decision to}} phase out the commercialization of natural-gas powered vehicles {{to focus on the}} development of a new generation of electrified vehicles such as hybrids, plug-in electric cars and hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Since 2008, Honda has sold about 16,000 natural-gas vehicles, mainly <b>to</b> <b>taxi</b> and commercial fleets.|$|E
25|$|Tailwheel {{aircraft}} {{are more difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>taxi</b> during high wind conditions, due to the higher angle of attack on the wings which can then develop more lift on one side, making control difficult or impossible. They also suffer from lower crosswind capability and in some wind conditions {{may be unable to}} use crosswind runways or single-runway airports.|$|E
50|$|It {{is hoped}} that the {{measures}} will still be implemented due to support from Transport Minister, John Hayes, who has met with Gwynne and is considering adding measures to the Police and Crime Bill <b>to</b> protect <b>taxi</b> users with guide dogs, which the Government hope will gain Royal Assent in April 2017. As part of the Police and Crime Bill, the Government will be updating statutory guidance on safeguarding (including in relation <b>to</b> <b>taxis</b> and private hire vehicles). This also gives the Government an opportunity to update and strengthen the existing non-statutory guidance relating <b>to</b> <b>taxis</b> on accessibility issues within a single document. Hayes has asked his officials to conduct an analysis of local authority performance on the assistance dog and wider accessibility issues, and will be writing to each council on their performance to improve on both training and enforcement.|$|R

Patches of thick fog were also drifting across the airfield, preventing aircraft and control tower from seeing each other.|$|E

25|$|Helicopters can be {{designed}} to withstand limited contact with {{the surface of a}} body of water. The 1958 Vertol HUP-2 was an amphibious development of the twin-rotor Piasecki H-25 which strengthened its hull and replaced lower nose windows with tough aluminum. The HUP-2 was provided with a pair of stabilizing outrigger floats positioned amidships. The HUP-2 was able <b>to</b> <b>taxi</b> forward or backward on water, regardless of wind direction.|$|E
