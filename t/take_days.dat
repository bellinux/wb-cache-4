5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts flooded {{villages and}} disrupted transport networks. It was estimated by 18 November {{that at least}} 500km of roads had been damaged by flooding, with the Chennai-Kolkata highway damaged the previous day and stranding hundreds of vehicles and motorists; officials said it would <b>take</b> <b>days</b> to restore the link. As in Tamil Nadu, the Southern Railway diverted or cancelled numerous trains. Over 10,000 lorry drivers were stranded on the Tada-Kavali national highway in Nellore district; district officers established 61 relief camps in the flood-affected areas and deputed senior IAS officers to oversee the relief operations in Gudur, Naidupet and Atmakur divisions, respectively. Up to 500 tanks were breached as rivers overflowed, forcing the administration to suspend rescue operations in marooned villages, though administrators supplied 10,000 food and water packets through the rail network, which managed to operate some trains, while the APSRTC continued to run bus services to less-flooded areas such as Atmakuru, Udayagiri, Marripadu and Seetharampuram.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees signed Núñez as an {{international}} free agent in 2004.

25|$|Mathematical PID loop tuning induces {{an impulse}} in the system, and then uses the {{controlled}} system's frequency response {{to design the}} PID loop values. In loops with response times of several minutes, mathematical loop tuning is recommended, because trial and error can <b>take</b> <b>days</b> just to find a stable set of loop values. Optimal values are harder to find. Some digital loop controllers offer a self-tuning feature in which very small setpoint changes are sent to the process, allowing the controller itself to calculate optimal tuning values.|$|E
25|$|As a {{tactical}} weapon for military use, {{a significant problem}} with a BW attack {{is that it would}} <b>take</b> <b>days</b> to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents (smallpox, pneumonic plague) have the capability of person-to-person transmission via aerosolized respiratory droplets. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. While containment of BW is less of a concern for certain criminal or terrorist organizations, it remains a significant concern for the military and civilian populations of virtually all nations.|$|E
25|$|Polish cuisine {{has evolved}} over the centuries to become very eclectic due to Poland's history. Polish cuisine shares many {{similarities}} with other Central European cuisines, especially German and Austrian as well as Jewish, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Russian, French and Italian culinary traditions. It is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and beef (depending on the region) and winter vegetables (cabbage in the dish bigos), and spices. It is also characteristic in its use of various kinds of noodles the most notable of which are kluski as well as cereals such as kasha (from the Polish word kasza). Polish cuisine is hearty and uses a lot of cream and eggs. Festive meals such as the meatless Christmas Eve dinner (Wigilia) or Easter breakfast could <b>take</b> <b>days</b> to prepare in their entirety.|$|E

25|$|ENIAC {{could be}} {{programmed}} to perform complex sequences of operations, including loops, branches, and subroutines. However, instead of the stored program computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which had programs hard coded into the machines with function tables that each contained 1200 ten way switches. The task of taking a problem and mapping it onto the machine was complex, and usually took weeks. Due {{to the complexity of}} mapping programs onto the machine, programs were only changed after huge numbers of tests of the current program. After the program was figured out on paper, the process of getting the program into ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables could <b>take</b> <b>days.</b> This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, aided by the ability to execute the program step by step. A programming tutorial for the modulo function using an ENIAC simulator gives an impression of what a program on the ENIAC looked like.|$|E
25|$|As {{is it was}} prohibitively {{expensive}} for the hobbyist SysOp to have a dedicated connection to another system, FidoNet was developed as a store and forward network. Private email (Netmail), public message boards (Echomail) and eventually even file attachments on a FidoNet-capable BBS would be bundled into one or more archive files over a set time interval. These archive files were then compressed with ARC or ZIP and forwarded to (or polled by) another nearby node or hub via a dialup Xmodem session. Messages would be relayed around various FidoNet hubs until they were eventually delivered to their destination. The hierarchy of FidoNet BBS nodes, hubs, and zones was maintained in a routing table called a Nodelist. Some larger BBSes or regional FidoNet hubs would make several transfers per day, some even to multiple nodes or hubs, and as such, transfers usually occurred at night or early morning when toll rates were lowest. In Fido's heyday, sending a Netmail message to a user on a distant FidoNet node, or participating in an Echomail discussion could <b>take</b> <b>days,</b> especially if any FidoNet nodes or hubs in the message's route only made one transfer call per day.|$|E
500|$|In nymphs {{and adults}} {{of the family}} Ixodidae, the [...] is {{prominent}} and projects forwards from the body, a feature not present in the Argasidae. The eyes {{are close to the}} sides of the scutum, and the large spiracles are located just behind the coxae of the fourth pair of legs. The hard, protective scutellum, characteristic of this family, covers the whole dorsal surface in males but is restricted to a small, shield-like structure behind the capitulum in females and nymphs. They differ, too, in their life cycle; Ixodidae that attach to a host bite painlessly and generally unnoticed, and they remain in place until they engorge and are ready to change their skin; this process may <b>take</b> <b>days</b> or weeks. Some species drop off the host to moult in a safe place, whereas others remain on the same host and only drop off once they are ready to lay their eggs.|$|E

500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close. We already had victory in the bag and {{there were only a few}} seconds to go. But those few seconds were enough for Manchester to get back into the game. We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could <b>take</b> <b>days</b> or even weeks to recover from this but I must say that Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{essential}} {{aspect of}} From Dust is the environment simulation, which underlies the player's {{interactions with the}} world. Developers intended that the world appear as a 'living thing', a dynamic and spontaneous entity, irrespective of the player's actions upon it. Chahi emphasised the difficulty of balancing this technical simulation with individual enjoyment, commenting that sometimes: [...] "it would <b>take</b> <b>days</b> {{to find the right}} value for gameplay that's also aesthetically pleasing". Montpellier accommodated this dynamism through a system of rules which govern the elements of the simulation: flowing water and moving soil result in the emergence of rivers; lakes {{at the base of a}} volcano accumulate sediment, which increases their viscosity; and similar rules govern volcanic eruptions, lava flow, and the spread of vegetation. With each rule, the layers accumulate to the point at which the developers are able to create an entire landscape. According to Chahi, simulation is the most challenging part of the game, as it requires developers to put lots of effort into optimisation because of its high computation demands. Chahi added that the game's programme is similar to that of VS Assembly, where the computation will be stored in the cache memory, allowing for fast computing. The team intentionally avoided developing any algorithms for objects like rivers and volcanoes, as they hoped that it would flow dynamically and naturally.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{possible}} {{effect of}} Bell’s palsy is Wallerian Degeneration (WD), which may <b>take</b> <b>days</b> to become evident. [...] Because of the slow-acting {{nature of this}} pathology, a patient may present healthy electroneuronography results {{despite a lack of}} volitional control of the facial muscles immediately following the onset of Bell’s palsy. [...] This is because the degeneration has not yet reached completion, and some fibers are still intact. [...] Therefore, it is standard procedure to wait at least three days after symptoms present themselves to perform an electroneuronography test, in order to prevent false negatives. [...] At {{the other end of the}} spectrum, tests are generally not recommended after a period of twenty-one days. [...] Typically, electroneuronography recordings are taken on the third day of symptoms and repeated every four days until a plateau is reached.|$|E
2500|$|Bánh chưng and bánh tét: {{essentially}} {{tightly packed}} sticky rice with meat or bean fillings wrapped in dong (Phrynium placentarium) leaves. When these leaves are unavailable, banana leaves {{can be used}} as a substitute. One difference between them is their shape. Bánh chưng is the square-shaped one to represent the Earth, while bánh tét is cylindrical to represent the moon. Also, bánh chưng is more popular in the northern parts of Vietnam, so as bánh tét is more popular in the south. Preparation can <b>take</b> <b>days.</b> After moulding them into their respective shapes (the square shape is achieved using a wooden frame), they are boiled for several hours to cook. [...] The story of their origins and their connection with Tết is often recounted to children while cooking them overnight.|$|E
2500|$|After moulting, an {{arthropod}} {{is described}} as teneral, a callow; it is [...] "fresh", pale and soft-bodied. Within one or two hours, the cuticle hardens and darkens following a tanning process analogous {{to the production of}} leather. During this short phase the animal expands, since growth is otherwise constrained by the rigidity of the exoskeleton. Growth of the limbs and other parts normally covered by hard exoskeleton is achieved by transfer of body fluids from soft parts before the new skin hardens. A spider with a small abdomen may be undernourished but more probably has recently undergone ecdysis. Some arthropods, especially large insects with tracheal respiration, expand their new exoskeleton by swallowing or otherwise taking in air. The maturation of the structure and colouration of the new exoskeleton might <b>take</b> <b>days</b> or weeks in a long-lived insect; this can make it difficult to identify an individual if it has recently undergone ecdysis.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} World War II, Florida was experiencing unprecedented growth in population and tourism, along with a revitalized citrus industry recovering from a harsh freeze early in the decade; the increased traffic load quickly burdened the state's highway system. South Florida businessman and accountant firm owner Charles B. Costar was concerned that a trip down {{the east coast of}} Florida would <b>take</b> <b>days</b> on the available road network, passing through every small beachside town, siphoning off the traffic before visitors reached South Florida. After driving on the Pennsylvania Turnpike during a vacation there, he envisioned a similar high-speed turnpike in Florida. In 1953, Costar led a lobby group that resulted in state legislature creating the [...] "Florida Turnpike Act," [...] which Governor Dan McCarty signed into law on July 11, 1953, as well as the Florida State Turnpike Authority, which had the ability to plan, design, and construct bond-financed toll roads, in which Costar was instrumental to create, to be repaid through the collection of tolls from Turnpike customers.|$|E
2500|$|Lamm is also {{credited}} with devising the first detailed bank robbery getaway maps, {{which he called}} [...] "gits". Once Lamm targeted a bank, he mapped the nearby back roads, which he called [...] "cat roads", to {{a tenth of a}} mile. He meticulously developed getaway plans for each of his robberies. Before every heist, Lamm obtained a nondescript car with a high-powered engine, and often recruited drivers who had been involved in auto racing. Lamm pasted a chart on the dashboard for the driver, which included block-by-block markings of escape routes, alternative turns and speedometer readings. Before each run, Lamm and the getaway driver clocked each route to the second under various weather conditions. Practice runs on the escape routes and alternative routes would <b>take</b> <b>days</b> to master. Using this system, Lamm and his gang conducted dozens of successful bank robberies from the end of World War I to 1930, taking more than $1 million in total. They were considered the most efficient gang of bank robbers of the era.|$|E
