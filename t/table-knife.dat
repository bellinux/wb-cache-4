6000|$|... [Footnote 1: Lady Caroline's infatuation for Byron, {{expressed}} in various ways--once (in July, 1813) by a self-inflicted stab with a <b>table-knife,</b> or a broken glass--became {{the talk of}} society.|$|E

60|$|One of the <b>table-knives</b> soon {{effected}} the work, and {{the coat}} was rolled up as a pillow. Dan removed his boots, and Vincent, {{who was now}} beyond even remonstrating, laid himself down on his cool bed.|$|R

[...] cried Ruth, as she slipped her {{feet into the}} straps of her skees, preparing for her first lesson. [...] "These skees seem so dreadfully long and unmanageable, now I get them on. Like seven-foot <b>table-knives,</b> and my silly feet like orange seeds {{in the middle of}} the knives!" ...|$|R
60|$|That same evening I saw Saduko and the others, as I shall tell. I {{had been}} up to visit the King and give him my present, a case of English <b>table-knives</b> with bone handles, which pleased him greatly, {{although}} he did not in the least know how to use them. Indeed, without their accompanying forks these are somewhat futile articles. I found the old fellow very tired and anxious, but as he was surrounded by indunas, I had no private talk with him. Seeing that he was busy, I took my leave as soon as I could, and when I walked away whom should I meet but Saduko.|$|R
60|$|Jim's mother {{heard the}} hurrahing {{and pulled off}} her apron, and saw that Jim was safe and sound there before her. She {{gave him a look}} that made him slip round behind Blue Bob, and she went in and got a <b>table-knife,</b> and she came out and went to the pear-tree and cut a sucker.|$|E
60|$|She {{ran back}} along the path, and he {{followed}} her. They turned suddenly an abrupt corner, and came upon two men locked in one another's arms, and swaying backward and forward upon the short green turf. The lunatic, an immense fellow, more than six feet high, was clutching his opponent's throat with his left hand, while with his right he brandished a long <b>table-knife</b> with keenly-sharpened edge. The struggle was virtually over. The madman's strength was more than human, and desperately though he had struggled, Lord St. Maurice was lying exhausted and overcome in his arms.|$|E
6000|$|He ran at the {{boy with}} the knife, and Harry fled upstairs to his room, {{promising}} Black Sheep the finest thrashing in the world when Aunty Rosa returned. Black Sheep sat {{at the bottom of}} the stairs, the <b>table-knife</b> in his hand, and wept for that he had not killed Harry. The servant-girl came up from the kitchen, took the knife away, and consoled him. But Black Sheep was beyond consolation. He would be badly beaten by Aunty Rosa; then there would be another beating at Harry's hands; then Judy would not be allowed to speak to him; then the tale would be told at school and then---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We were at dinner," [...] Mr. Armstrong said, [...] "when {{without the}} least notice, {{just as we}} had finished, there was a rush through the door. All my friends had brought their rifles with them, and the instant the Kaffirs entered we knew what was up. Those who could caught their rifles, others {{snatched}} up <b>table-knives,</b> and the fight began. As you saw, several of our party were killed at once, {{but the rest of}} us made such a good fight with our clubbed rifles and knives that for the moment we cleared the room, then two of us held the door while the rest fell back into the inner room, where, fortunately, all the children were at the time, for the table was not large enough to hold us all, and they had had their meal first.|$|R
60|$|The middies live by {{themselves}} in the steerage, where, nowadays, they dine off a table, spread with a cloth. They have a castor at dinner; they have some other little boys (selected from the ship's company) to wait upon them; they sometimes drink coffee out of china. But for all these, their modern refinements, in some instances the affairs of their club go sadly to rack and ruin. The china is broken; the japanned coffee-pot dented like a pewter mug in an ale-house; the pronged forks resemble tooth-picks (for which they are sometimes used); the <b>table-knives</b> are hacked into hand-saws; and the cloth goes to the sail-maker to be patched. Indeed, they are something like collegiate freshmen and sophomores, living in the college buildings, especially {{so far as the}} noise they make in their quarters is concerned. The steerage buzzes, hums, and swarms like a hive; or like an infant-school of a hot day, when the school-mistress falls asleep with a fly on her nose.|$|R
6000|$|... [EN#13] [...] "Little health" [...] at Cairo {{prevented}} my {{choosing the}} instruments; {{and the result}} was that at last I had to depend upon my pocket-set by Casella. Even this excellent maker's maxima and minima failed to stand the camel-jolting. The barometer, lent by the Chief of Staff (Elliott Brothers, 24), contained amalgam, not mercury. The patent messrad, or odometer (Wittmann, Wien), with its works of soft brass instead of steel, was fit only to measure a drawing-room carpet. M. Ebner sold us, at the highest prices, absolutely useless maxima and minima, plus a barom√®tre aneroide, whose chain was unhooked when it left the box. M. Sussmann, of the Muski, supplied, for fifty francs, a good and useful microscope magnifying seventy-five times. The watches from M. Meyer ("Dent and Co.!") were cheap and nasty Swiss articles; but they were also subjected to terrible treatment:--I once saw the wearers opening them with <b>table-knives.</b> Fortunately M. Lacaze, the artist, had a good practical knowledge of instruments; and this did us many a good turn.|$|R
60|$|I {{asked her}} what she was doing there so late in the day, and she {{answered}} in a quiet even voice which had a shadow in it too, that she was gathering samphire of that kind which grows on the flat saltings and has a dull green leek-like fleshy leaf. At this season, she informed me, it was fit for gathering to pickle and put by for use during the year. She carried a pail to put it in, and a <b>table-knife</b> in her hand to dig the plants up by the roots, and she also had an old sack in which she put every dry stick and chip of wood she came across. She added that she had gathered samphire at this same spot every August end for very many years.|$|E

6000|$|... are amiable and obliging, frank, humorous, and polite, {{without the}} servility of the Hindoos; and their address {{is free and}} unrestrained. Their {{intercourse}} {{with one another and}} with Europeans is scrupulously honest; a present is divided equally amongst many, without a syllable of discontent or grudging look or word: each, on receiving his share, coming up and giving the donor a brusque bow and thanks. They have learnt to overcharge already, and use extortion in dealing, as is the custom with the people of the plains; but it is clumsily done, and never accompanied with the grasping air and insufferable whine of the latter. They are constantly armed with a long, heavy, straight knife,* [It is called [...] "Ban," [...] and serves equally for plough, toothpick, <b>table-knife,</b> hatchet, hammer, and sword.] but never draw it on one another: family and political feuds are alike unheard of amongst them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good,' {{returned}} the Doctor. 'We shall now {{turn our attention}} to the material evidences. (I was born to be a detective; I have the eye and the systematic spirit.) First, violence has been employed. The door was broken open; and it may be observed, in passing, that the lock was dear indeed at what I paid for it: a crow to pluck with Master Goguelat. Second, here is the instrument employed, one of our own <b>table-knives,</b> one of our best, my dear; which seems to indicate no preparation {{on the part of the}} gang--if gang it was. Thirdly, I observe that nothing has been removed except the Franchard dishes and the casket; our own silver has been minutely respected. This is wily; it shows intelligence, a knowledge of the code, a desire to avoid legal consequences. I argue from this fact that the gang numbers persons of respectability--outward, of course, and merely outward, as the robbery proves. But I argue, second, that we must have been observed at Franchard itself by some occult observer, and dogged throughout the day with a skill and patience that I venture to qualify as consummate. No ordinary man, no occasional criminal, would have shown himself capable of this combination. We have in our neighbourhood, it is far from improbable, a retired bandit of the highest order of intelligence.' ...|$|R
60|$|The wonder is, that, {{being an}} only child, and a sore problem when any {{question}} of discipline or punishment arose, I was not utterly spoiled. One person at least came very near to doing so, my grandfather, Monsieur Pierre de Ronvel. To be exact, {{he was my}} step-grandfather, for my mother's charming mother, with her ringlets and crinoline, after my real grandfather's death, had married a second time. He crossed the English Channel to visit my parents when I was in my tenth year--a tall, stiff, jerky man, with a sallow face, speckled fur-like hair that stood in a little wall round his forehead, and the liveliest black eyes. His manners were a felicity to watch even at my age. You would have supposed he had come courting my mother; {{and he took a}} great fancy to me. He was extremely fond of salad, I remember: and I very proud of my mustard and cress--which I could gather for him myself with one of my own <b>table-knives.</b> So copiously he talked, with such a medley of joys and zests and surprises on his face, that I vowed soon to be mistress of my stepmother tongue. He could also conjure away reels and thimbles, even spoons and forks, with a skill that precluded my becoming a materialist for ever after. I worshipped my grandfather--and yet without a vestige of fear.|$|R
5000|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 21 November the patient {{suddenly}} sent for champagne. His wife protested, but Fet seemed to be in great agitation and haste. [...] "Go and return as quickly as you can," [...] he ordered. As Maria left, Fet told his secretary (referred to later as Mrs. F.): [...] "Come with me, I will dictate to you". - [...] "A letter?" [...] she enquired. [...] "No", came the reply. Mrs. F. followed him and wrote the following: [...] "I see no reason for consciously prolonging my suffering. I willingly chose to do what would be inevitable anyway." [...] He signed this: [...] "21 November. Fet (Shenshin)", with a [...] "firm hand, certainly not that of a dying man," [...] according to the biographer Boris Sadovskoy. What followed was [...] "a kind of mental storm some people experience when facing death. Only a bout of temporary madness could account for his starting running about, fetching dinner and paper knives which obviously could do him no serious harm," [...] Sadovskoy wrote. As Fet grabbed a paper knife from the table before him, Mrs. F. managed to disarm him, injuring her hand. Chased by his bleeding secretary, Fet entered a dining-room, approached the cabinet where <b>table-knives</b> were kept and unsuccessfully tried to open it. Then, panting, he suddenly fell on a chair. According to the secretary, his eyes opened wide, as if facing some terrible sight, his hand rose as if to make a cross, then fell down lifeless. The cause of his death was later maintained to be heart attack. The funeral service was held on 22 November 1892, at the Moscow University church. Afanasy Fet was interred on 23 November in his family vault in Kleymyonovo, the old Shenshin family estate.|$|R
6000|$|The knight-expectant {{advanced}} up the hall, {{the whole}} length {{of which he}} had unfortunately to traverse, turning out his toes with so much zeal that he presented his leg at every step with its broadside foremost, so that it greatly resembled an old-fashioned <b>table-knife</b> with a curved point, when seen sideways. The rest of his gait was in proportion to this unhappy amble; and the implied mixture of bashful rear and self-satisfaction was so unutterably ridiculous that Leicester's friends did not suppress a titter, in which many of Sussex's partisans were unable to resist joining, though ready to eat their nails with mortification. Sussex himself lost all patience, and could not forbear whispering into the ear of his friend, [...] "Curse thee! canst thou not walk like a man and a soldier?" [...] an interjection which only made honest Blount start and stop, until a glance at his yellow roses and crimson stockings restored his self-confidence, when on he went at the same pace as before.|$|E
6000|$|One desperate {{experiment}} I {{am about}} to try. I sit writing here before putting the matter to issue. This morning, {{with the help of}} a <b>table-knife</b> that I had secreted at breakfast, I succeeded in breaking open a fairly obvious secret drawer in this wrecked writing-desk. I discovered nothing save a little green glass phial containing a white powder. Round the neck of the phial was a label, and thereon was written this one word, [...] "Release." [...] This may be--is most probably--poison. I can understand Elvesham placing poison in my way, and I should be sure that it was his intention so to get rid of the only living witness against him, were it not for this careful concealment. The man has practically solved the problem of immortality. Save for the spite of chance, he will live in my body until it has aged, and then, again, throwing that aside, he will assume some other victim's youth and strength. When one remembers his heartlessness, it is terrible to think of the ever-growing experience that... How long has he been leaping from body to body?... But I tire of writing. The powder appears to be soluble in water. The taste is not unpleasant.|$|E

6000|$|The {{prisoners were}} all sent for safe keeping to the penitentiary at Columbus, {{but on the}} night of November 7th, Morgan and six of his comrades made their escape, by digging into an air-space under the floor of his cell with their <b>table-knives,</b> passing through this to the prison walls, and letting {{themselves}} down with ropes made of their bed-clothes. At the station where they were to take the train for Cincinnati, Morgan was dismayed to realize that he had no money to buy a ticket; but one of his officers had been supplied by a young lady who sent him some bank notes concealed in a book. They rode all night in great fear and anxiety, and just before the train drew into Cincinnati they put on the brakes and slowed it enough to drop from it with safety. Then they lost no time in making for the Ohio River, where they hired a boy to set them over to Kentucky in his boat. Morgan had not found the Ohio people too plodding for him, as Aaron Burr had, but he was quite as glad to leave their state, which he never revisited, for he was killed the next year in Tennessee. He left behind him in Ohio by no means a wholly evil name, and some stories are told of him that more than hint at a generous nature. A Union soldier whom his men had taken tried to break his musket across a stone, and one of the Confederate officers drew his pistol to shoot him. Morgan forbade it. [...] "Never harm a man who has surrendered," [...] he said. [...] "He was only doing what I should have done in his place." ...|$|R
6000|$|The young gentleman {{disappeared}} {{upon his}} errand: the coach was called and came. Mrs. Walker slipped {{into it with}} her basket, and the page went downstairs to his companions in the kitchen, and said, [...] "It's a-comin'! master's in quod, and missus has gone out to pawn the plate." [...] When the cook went out that day, she somehow had by mistake placed in her basket a dozen of <b>table-knives</b> and a plated egg-stand. When the lady's-maid took {{a walk in the}} course of the afternoon, she found she had occasion for eight cambric pocket-handkerchiefs, (marked with her mistress's cipher), half-a-dozen pair of shoes, gloves, long and short, some silk stockings, and a gold-headed scent-bottle. [...] "Both the new cashmeres is gone," [...] said she, [...] "and there's nothing left in Mrs. Walker's trinket-box but a paper of pins and an old coral bracelet." [...] As for the page, he rushed incontinently to his master's dressing-room and examined every one of the pockets of his clothes; made a parcel of some of them, and opened all the drawers which Walker had not locked before his departure. He only found three-halfpence and a bill stamp, and about forty-five tradesmen's accounts, neatly labelled and tied up with red tape. These three worthies, a groom who was a great admirer of Trimmer the lady's-maid, and a policeman a friend of the cook's, sat down to a comfortable dinner at the usual hour, and it was agreed among them all that Walker's ruin was certain. The cook made the policeman a present of a china punch-bowl which Mrs. Walker had given her; and the lady's-maid gave her friend the [...] "Book of Beauty" [...] for last year, and the third volume of Byron's poems from the drawing-room table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop a bit, missie. I will go {{and light}} a candle; I have some in there, and they can't {{see the light}} from outside;" [...] and {{accordingly}} he vanished. In a few seconds he returned, and, taking her by the sleeve, led her along a winding passage between great boulders till {{they came to a}} beehole in the rocks, through which she could see the light shining. Going down on his hands and knees, Jantje crept through, and Jess followed him. She found herself in a small apartment, about six feet square by eight high, formed for the most part by the accidental falling together of big boulders, and roofed in with one great natural slab. The place, which was lighted by an end of candle stuck upon the floor, was very dirty, as might be expected of a Hottentot's den, and in it were collected an enormous variety of odds and ends. As, discarding a three-legged stool that Jantje offered her, Jess sank down on a pile of skins in the corner, her eye fell upon a collection worthy of an old rag and bone shop. The sides of the chamber were festooned with every imaginable garment, from the white full-dress coat of an Austrian officer down to a shocking pair of corduroys [...] "lifted' by Jantje from the body of a bushman, which he had discovered in his rambles. All these clothes were in various stages of decay, and obviously the result of years of patient collecting. In the corners again were sticks, kerries, and two assegais, a number of queer-shaped stones and bones, handles of broken <b>table-knives,</b> bits of the locks of guns, portions of an American clock, and various other articles which this human jackdaw had picked up and hidden away. Altogether it was a strange place: and vaguely it occurred to Jess, as she sank back upon the dirty skins, that, {{had it not been for}} the old clothes and the wreck of the American clock, she would have made acquaintance with a very fair example of the dwellings of primeval man.|$|R
50|$|Russell {{travelled}} to Asia and Australia. Off {{the coast}} of China during 1860 he witnessed the capture of the Taku Forts by combined British and French forces. Later, while he was serving on the ship Hougomont, the third mate went mad, and attacked him with a <b>table-knife.</b> Russell began to write {{of some of his}} experiences when he was confined to his quarters for a breach of discipline.|$|E
5000|$|Plighted troth: a Dramatic Tale by CF Darley, a very long, Elizabethan-style drama on a {{religious}} controversy (Catholic versus Protestant), was Macready's unluckiest misjudgment. Believing the gloomy, turgid affair to be {{a work of}} 'fine thoughts expressed in massive language', he had approached it with confidence. But it lasted only a single night. Darley had called his chief character Gabriel Grimwood: Eliza Grimwood {{happened to be the}} name of a girl brutally murdered in Waterloo Bridge Road, and the gallery fastened on this. 'Look here, old bloke,' somebody shouted, 'who cut Eliza's throat?' The louder the gallery laughed, the colder Macready's acting became. During the first scene, George Bennett sprained his ankle, and whenever he limped on, the pit told him to [...] "hook it, to the hospital!" [...] At the end of the play, after Elton had stabbed Macready with a <b>table-knife</b> and the dead man had fallen beneath the table, Bennett - emerging from a bed and limping down to look at the body - trod heavily on Macready's hand. 'Beast!' cried the tragedian. 'Beast of Hell!' He lay down angrily, and died all over again, and at length the curtain fell to hysterical laughter.|$|E
60|$|A {{magistrate}} has laws to administer: a censor {{has nothing}} {{but his own}} opinion. A judge leaves the question of guilt to the jury: the Censor is jury and judge as well as lawgiver. A magistrate may be strongly prejudiced against an atheist or an anti- vaccinator, just as a sanitary inspector may have formed a careful opinion that drains are less healthy than cesspools; but the magistrate must allow the atheist to affirm instead of to swear, and must grant the anti-vaccinator an exemption certificate, when their demands are lawfully made; and in cities the inspector must compel the builder to make drains and must prosecute him if he makes cesspools. The law may be only the intolerance of the community; {{but it is a}} defined and limited intolerance. The limitation is sometimes carried so far that a judge cannot inflict the penalty for housebreaking on a burglar who can prove that he found the door open and therefore made only an unlawful entry. On the other hand, it is sometimes so vague, as for example {{in the case of the}} American law against obscenity, that it makes the magistrate virtually a censor. But in the main a citizen can ascertain what he may do and what he may not do; and, though no one knows better than a magistrate that a single ill-conducted family may demoralize a whole street, no magistrate can imprison or otherwise restrain its members on the ground that their immorality may corrupt their neighbors. He can prevent any citizen from carrying certain specified weapons, but not from handling pokers, <b>table-knives,</b> bricks or bottles of corrosive fluid, on the ground that he might use them to commit murder or inflict malicious injury. He has no general power to prevent citizens from selling unhealthy or poisonous substances, or judging for themselves what substances are unhealthy and what wholesome, what poisonous and what innocuous: what he CAN do is to prevent anybody who has not a specific qualification from selling certain specified poisons of which a schedule is kept. Nobody is forbidden to sell minerals without a licence; but everybody is forbidden to sell silver without a licence. When the law has forgotten some atrocious sin--for instance, contracting marriage whilst suffering from contagious disease--the magistrate cannot arrest or punish the wrongdoer, however he may abhor his wickedness. In short, no man is lawfully at the mercy of the magistrate's personal caprice, prejudice, ignorance, superstition, temper, stupidity, resentment, timidity, ambition, or private conviction. But a playwright's livelihood, his reputation, and his inspiration and mission are at the personal mercy of the Censor. The two do not stand, as the criminal and the judge stand, in the presence of a law that binds them both equally, and was made by neither of them, but by the deliberative collective wisdom of the community. The only law that affects them is the Act of 1843, which empowers one of them to do absolutely and finally what he likes with the other's work. And when it is remembered that the slave in this case is the man whose profession is that of Eschylus and Euripides, of Shakespear and Goethe, of Tolstoy and Ibsen, and the master the holder of a party appointment which by the nature of its duties practically excludes the possibility of its acceptance by a serious statesman or great lawyer, it will be seen that the playwrights are justified in reproaching the framers of that Act for having failed not only to appreciate the immense importance of the theatre as a most powerful instrument for teaching the nation how and what to think and feel, but even to conceive that those who make their living by the theatre are normal human beings with the common rights of English citizens. In this extremity of inconsiderateness it is not surprising that they also did not trouble themselves to study the difference between a censor and a magistrate. And it will be found that almost all the people who disinterestedly defend the censorship today are defending him on the assumption that there is no constitutional difference between him and any other functionary whose duty it is to restrain crime and disorder.|$|R
