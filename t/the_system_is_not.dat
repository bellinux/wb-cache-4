5|$|The player takes {{control of}} the Gunhed Star Fighter through nine {{vertically}} scrolling areas. The player's mission is to destroy the Dark Squadron and its eight enemy Super Weapons. Every area contains one or more bosses, all of which must be destroyed before continuing in the game. Players lose a life if they are hit by an enemy or projectile, with the game continuing at a previously–crossed checkpoint, unless they grab a flashing orb which destroys all on-screen enemies and allows them to continue {{at the point where}} their previous ship was destroyed (represented by the icon illustrating the remaining number of ships turning gold). The game ends when all lives have been lost, but the game awards 1-ups when the player scores a particular number of points. The game provides four continues in which players can restart the game at that level in which their previous game ended provided <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> turned off.|$|E

25|$|Passenger trains {{have had}} {{for a long time}} a 3-wire version of the {{electro-pneumatic}} brake, which gives seven levels of braking force. In most cases <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fail-safe, with the wires being energized in sequence to apply the brakes, but the conventional automatic air brake is also provided to act as a fail safe, and in most cases can be used independently {{in the event of a}} failure of the EP brakes.|$|E
25|$|Such {{statements}} of the first law for closed systems assert the existence of internal energy {{as a function of}} state defined in terms of adiabatic work. Thus heat is not defined calorimetrically or as due to temperature difference. It is defined as a residual difference between change of internal energy and work done on the system, when that work does not account for the whole of the change of internal energy and <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> adiabatically isolated.|$|E
25|$|At a {{declination}} of −62°, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{visible from}} Britain's latitude of +53°, so it never received a Flamsteed designation in John Flamsteed's 1712 Historia Coelestis Britannica. The Bayer designation for this star system, Zeta (ζ) Reticuli, originated in a 1756 star map by the French astronomer Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. Subsequently, {{the two stars}} received separate designations in the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung, which was processed between 1859 and 1903, then in the Henry Draper Catalogue, published between 1918 and 1924.|$|E

50|$|By the mid-20th century, it <b>was</b> {{clear that}} <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{environmentally}} sustainable.

25|$|In India, {{pale skin}} is {{considered}} more attractive, while dark skin {{is associated with}} a lower class status, creating a massive market for skin whitening creams. Fairer skin tones also correlate to higher caste status in the Hindu social order – although <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> based on skin tone. Actors and actresses in Indian cinema tend to have light skin tones, and Indian cinematographers have used graphics and intense lighting to achieve more desirable skin tones. Fair skin tones are claimed to be an asset in Indian marketing.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, all ESC {{manufacturers}} {{emphasize that}} <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a performance enhancement nor {{a replacement for}} safe driving practices, but rather a safety technology to assist the driver in recovering from dangerous situations. ESC does not increase traction, so it does not enable faster cornering (although it can facilitate better-controlled cornering). More generally, ESC works within inherent limits of the vehicle's handling and available traction between the tyres and road. A reckless maneuver can still exceed these limits, resulting in loss of control. For example, in a severe hydroplaning scenario, the wheels that ESC would use to correct a skid may not even initially be {{in contact with the}} road, reducing its effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse steering shaft and clutch system with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|E

The route, a later {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> originally intended for passenger service unless a connection to Orange was completed.

40|$|Model {{reduction}} techniques {{permit to}} approximate a dynamical system by a simpler one.

25|$|A very {{important}} {{difference between a}} gas of massive particles and a photon gas with a black body distribution is {{that the number of}} photons in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> conserved. A photon may collide with an electron in the wall, exciting it to a higher energy state, removing a photon from the photon gas. This electron may drop back to its lower level in a series of steps, each one of which releases an individual photon back into the photon gas. Although the sum of the photon energies of the emitted photons are the same as the absorbed photon, the number of emitted photons will vary. It can be shown that, {{as a result of this}} lack of constraint on the number of photons in the system, the chemical potential of the photons must be zero for black body radiation.|$|E
25|$|Air {{brakes on}} the train are {{supplied}} with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive {{on the train}}. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air brake control valves sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, {{they are designed to}} activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied {{as in the case of}} the Lac-Mégantic accident. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the “reset safety control” on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train’s brakes in the event of an engine failure.|$|E
