5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the right to life is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E
5|$|The {{registration}} for, and issuing of, National identity cards, {{a legally}} required document for accessing various services, to these remote tribes has been problematic for many years, {{and in the}} past had even resulted in {{a large number of people}} from the Penan ethnic group being rendered effectively stateless. In recent years, <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> seen progressive improvement with the implementation of systems such as mobile registration units.|$|E
5|$|Transport links {{generally}} {{are regarded as}} an important factor which affects a company’s decision on where to locate, and thus invest, although the latest survey shows quality of telecommunications moving above transport in importance. Survey evidence indicates that a quarter of companies regard access to air services as {{an important factor in}} the decision of where in the UK to locate operations, whilst one in ten companies report that the absence of good air transport links has affected their decision to invest in the UK. The survey has been criticised as suffering from a poor response rate and therefore open to bias, though <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> been recognised and rationalised by the report's authors.|$|E

25|$|Some {{popular media}} outlets have {{in recent years}} spotlighted a {{replication}} crisis in psychology, arguing that many findings in the field cannot be reproduced.

25|$|With the {{invention}} of agriculture, humans were able to clear sections of rainforest to produce crops, converting it to open farmland. Such people, however, obtain their food primarily from farm plots cleared from the forest and hunt and forage within the forest to supplement this. The issue arising is between the independent farmer providing for his family and the needs and wants of the globe as a whole. <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> seen little improvement because no plan has been established for all parties to be aided.|$|E
25|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} escitalopram compared to its predecessor citalopram. The importance of this issue follows from the greater cost of escitalopram relative to the generic mixture of isomers citalopram prior to the expiration of the escitalopram patent in 2012, which led to charges of evergreening. Accordingly, <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> been examined in at least 10 different systematic reviews and meta analyses. The most recent of these have concluded (with caveats in some cases) that escitalopram is modestly superior to citalopram in efficacy and tolerability.|$|E

However, in June 1939 the people of Hatay had formed a new independent State and immediately after, the parliament voted to unite with Turkey. Since achieving independence in 1946, Syria has harbored a lingering resentment and <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> continued to be an irritant in Syrian-Turkish relations.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} modern Muslim {{scholars}} and Muslim intellectuals seem {{to conform to}} the idea of Jihad as fundamentally a peaceful religious endeavour of self-reformation and of defending and extending religion through civil means rather than chiefly a belligerent armed struggle, in accordance with Ghulam Ahmad's standpoint on the issue. Furthermore, some Islamic scholars have opined that Jesus has died (Ghulam Ahmad's assertion) or have expressed their own confusion on this matter, though the majority orthodox position of most Muslims with regard to <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> not changed.|$|E
25|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid to the relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church.

40|$|The {{contributors}} to <b>this</b> special <b>issue</b> <b>have</b> {{taken up the}} challenge of reconsidering some of the fundamental assumptions that have traditionally underpinned the history of internationalism. In doing so their articles (some more explicitly than others) have addressed two central questions: who were the internationalists and where was internationalism taking place? The {{answers to these questions}} seem deceptively simple. However, as the articles in <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>have</b> demonstrated, agents of internationalism are as diverse in age, gender and social status as the fields in which they operate...|$|R

25|$|The seven hills {{are in the}} {{geological}} formation of the Deccan Trap comprising hard and amygdaloidal basalts, bole beds (red bole) and lateritic soils. The hill temple {{has been subjected to}} frequent damage from rockfalls in the last many years. Many pilgrims have also been injured during these rock falls; some injuries also turning fatal. The circumlocutory path around the hill has steep rock slopes and the instability of the rock formations is attributed to the fractured and columnar joints in basaltic rocks. Hence, <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> been a subject of study by geologists to provide a solution to prevent damages to the temple and causing injuries to the pilgrims.|$|E
25|$|With {{the shift}} in {{shopping}} from publicly owned Main Streets to privately held shopping malls, the question of access to malls, and their shoppers, as a public forum has been an issue raised nationwide. <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> <b>has</b> become particularly relevant in New Jersey, where malls in both suburban and exurban areas have largely supplanted local downtown districts as shopping destinations, depriving individuals and organizations of a public location {{to reach out to}} neighbors for distribution of fliers and other forms of expression. While different conclusions have been reached elsewhere, New Jersey's approach {{has been one of the}} most expansive in providing groups with access to malls as a public forum, despite their private ownership.|$|E
25|$|The Anatolian {{refugees}} included {{people who}} had migrated from war zones and immediate vicinity attempting, by doing so, to escape persecution. For World War I, the relatively most reliable sources can be found for Anatolia, especially {{in relation to the}} Caucasus Campaign. There is a total number reached and reported by the Ottoman Empire at the end of 1916. On the basis of previous Ottoman census, the Turkish historian Kamer Kasim (Manchester University, Ph.D.), arrives at the conclusion that the movements of refugees from the Caucasus war zone had reached 1.500.000 people who were relocated in the Mediterranean region and Central Anatolia under very difficult conditions.
