Alongside the basic starch source, the early European beers might contain fruits, honey, numerous types of plants, spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs. What they did not contain was hops, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian Abbot and again in 1067 by Abbess Hildegard of Bingen.|$|E

These side-products are highly reactive and produce volatile aromatic amines which are responsible for the unpleasant odor.|$|E

For example, under certain circumstances, {{false statement}}s or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>that</b> the seller has may constitute misrepresentation.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>product</b> <b>that</b> was {{to become}} Marmite was invented in the late 19th century when German {{scientist}} Justus von Liebig discovered that brewer's yeast could be concentrated, bottled and eaten. In 1902 the Marmite Food Extract Company was formed in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England with Marmite as its main product and Burton {{as the site of}} the first factory. The by-product yeast needed for the paste was supplied by Bass Brewery. By 1907, the product had become successful enough to warrant construction of a second factory at Camberwell Green in London.|$|E
25|$|To {{show this}} relationship, {{suppose that the}} market price of a product is $1.00, and that a $0.50 tax is imposed on <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>that,</b> by law, is to be {{collected}} from the seller. If the product has an elastic demand, a greater portion of the tax will be absorbed by the seller. This is because goods with elastic demand cause a large decline in quantity demanded for a small increase in price. Therefore, in order to stabilize sales, the seller absorbs more of the additional tax burden. For example, the seller might drop {{the price of the}} product to $0.70 so that, after adding in the tax, the buyer pays a total of $1.20, or $0.20 more than he did before the $0.50 tax was imposed. In this example, the buyer has paid $0.20 of the $0.50 tax (in the form of a post-tax price) and the seller has paid the remaining $0.30 (in the form of a lower pre-tax price).|$|E

500|$|In April 2013, Kotaku {{published}} an exposé describing Doom 4 as trapped in [...] "development hell". Citing connections to id, the article claimed that Doom 4 had suffered under mismanagement and that development was completely restarted in 2011. Inside sources described the pre-2011 version – {{which was to}} portray the uprising of Hell on Earth – as heavily scripted and cinematic, comparing it to the Call of Duty franchise. The pre-2011 version was criticized as mediocre and the new version as [...] "lame" [...] and a [...] "mess". While Hollenshead initially stated that the Doom 4 team was doing something that fans would be happy with, id's Willits criticized the game's lack of character in QuakeCon 2013. In July 2015, Marty Stratton criticized Doom 4s lack of personality as id's primary reason to cancel the game, and pointed out its similarities to the Call of Duty franchise and that the game was not <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>that</b> id thought people wanted.|$|E

Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide commented that [...] "the film's mealy-mouthed messages about feminine empowerment will almost certainly fall on deaf ears, since even 11-year-olds know Spears's power resides largely in her taut torso". Claudia Puig of USA Today considered it [...] "less a movie than a mind-numbingly dull road trip", while The Washington Post reporter Ann Hornaday said, [...] "not a music video, not yet a movie, but more like an extended-play advertisement for <b>the</b> <b>Product</b> <b>that</b> is Britney". Jane Dark of Village Voice compared Crossroads to Mariah Carey's Glitter, saying, [...] "you {{spend a lot of}} time wondering, 'Better or worse than Glitter?'

500|$|... 343 {{started with}} a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through {{development}}. Halo 4s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told {{they were going to be}} working on Halo 4. [...] "We had people who we hired who hated Halo because of 'X,'" [...] said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. [...] "But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about <b>the</b> <b>product.</b> <b>That</b> is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team." [...] This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, Halo 4 executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make [...] "necessary mistakes", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties. Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. [...] With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an [...] "epiphany moment" [...] that proved the team was headed in the right direction was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was [...] "very traditional [...] ". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.|$|E
