50|$|The <b>Brown</b> <b>Paper</b> Bag Test was a type {{of racial}} {{discrimination}} in the United States. A <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag {{was used as a}} way {{to determine whether or not}} an individual could have certain privileges; only individuals with a skin color that is the same color or lighter than a <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag were allowed. The test was used in the 20th century within many social institutions such as African-American sororities, fraternities, and churches. In addition, <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bags were used in multi-racial social events. The term is also used in reference to larger issues of class and social stratification within the African-American population. The <b>Brown</b> <b>Paper</b> Bag Test arose from the practice of discrimination based on skin color.|$|R

40|$|A {{sandwich}} structure consisting of perlite composite foam as core and <b>Brown</b> <b>paper</b> as skin is developed and its flexural behaviour is studied in relation with properties of constituents and manufacturing variables of perlite composite foam core consolidated with sodium silicate binder by compaction. Tensile properties of <b>Brown</b> <b>paper</b> coated with binder {{were affected by}} sodium silicate content in diluted binder. The best performance of the <b>Brown</b> <b>paper</b> was found for strength and energy absorption when coated with undiluted binder. The {{sandwich structure}} was fabricated with the best performed <b>Brown</b> <b>paper</b> and perlite composite foam cores with various binder contents and compaction ratios. The performance of the sandwich structure for core shear strength, skin normal strength, and stiffness was similarly affected by manufacturing variables to those of perlite foam core. Load carrying capacity of perlite foam core reinforced with <b>Brown</b> <b>paper</b> for the sandwich structure was increased about 3 – 7 times the unreinforced one depending on how binder and compaction ratio are combined for manufacturing perlite foam core. The flexural failure of perlite composite foam core was initiated from the tension side of the flexural specimen. However, when the foam core was sandwiched with the <b>Brown</b> <b>paper,</b> the failure initiation site was shifted to the mid-plane of flexural specimen...|$|R
50|$|Colorism is not {{a synonym}} to racism as colorism can occur, and often does, within racial and ethnic groups. The <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag test was used in America for black people to be further divided: those lighter than a <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag were allotted some {{privilege}} that those darker were not permitted to. The <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag test and colorism add to the fuel of intersectionality: recognizing the different identities of an individual {{in order to better}} understand one's lived experiences which can be different by race, gender, sexuality, as well as color, amongst other qualities. The <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag test is not used outright today but there are still implications of colorism; for example in media, lighter skin black females are often more sexualized than their darker counterparts.|$|R
