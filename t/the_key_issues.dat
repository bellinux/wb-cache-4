25|$|UNCTAD V in {{the wake}} of the Nairobi Conference, held in Manila 1979 focused on <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> of: {{protectionism}} in developing countries and the need for structural change, trade in commodities and manufactures aid and international monetary reform,technology, shipping, and economic co-operation among developing countries. An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper written in 1979 focuses its attention on <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> regarding the LDCs` role as the Group of 77 in the international community.|$|E

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> pending {{before the}} law panel is a call on {{amending}} the Indian Penal Code amid allegations of abuse and arbitrary use of the law. The Law Ministry had urged the Commission to study the usage of the provisions of Section 124A (Sedition) of the IPC.|$|E

5000|$|In recent years, Metrobus {{was plagued}} by two strikes in 2004 and 2010 respectively. The first of those strikes lasted roughly two weeks, and wages were <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> in that dispute; while the {{introduction}} of a 50/50 cost-sharing health benefit system was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> in <b>the</b> 2010 dispute. The latter dispute lasted about three months, and was settled with a modest pay hike on January 27, 2011.|$|R

25|$|The pan-democrats {{have been}} calling for the NPCSC {{decision}} to be shelved, but pro-Beijing politicians had said the decision would be still relevant after 2017. It also became one of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> in the 2017 Chief Executive election, in which the pro-democrats pressured the candidates to relaunch the constitutional reform without the 831 basis.|$|E
25|$|The World Bank {{concludes that}} governments and feudal elites {{extending}} {{to the poor}} the right to the land that they live and use are 'the key to reducing poverty' citing that land rights greatly increase poor people's wealth, in some cases doubling it. Although approaches varied, the World Bank said <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> were security of tenure and ensuring land transactions costs were low.|$|E
25|$|The sixth UN {{conference on}} trade and {{development}} in Belgrade, 6–30 June 1983 was held {{against the background of}} earlier UNCTADs which have substantially failed to resolve many of the disagreements between the developed and developing countries and of a world economy in its worst recession since the early 1930s. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> of the time were finance and adjustment, commodity price stabilisation and trade.|$|E

25|$|A {{project manager}} {{is often a}} client {{representative}} and has to determine and implement the exact needs of the client, based on knowledge of the firm they are representing. The ability {{to adapt to the}} various internal procedures of the contracting party, and to form close links with the nominated representatives, is essential in ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> of cost, time, quality and above all, client satisfaction, can be realized.|$|E
25|$|The FP7 {{research}} program only reserved a moderate {{amount of funding}} for energy research, although energy has recently {{emerged as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> of the European Union. A large part of FP7 energy funding is also devoted to fusion research, a technology that {{will not be able to}} help meet European climate and energy objectives until beyond 2050. The European Commission tried to redress this shortfall with the SET plan.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> in the {{election}} was which two political parties would gain {{the largest number of}} Assembly seats. The St Andrews Agreement stated that the First Minister will be chosen from the largest party of the largest political designation and the Deputy First Minister from the largest party from the second largest political designation; however, the actual legislation states that the largest party shall make the nomination regardless of designation.|$|E

25|$|The country's first {{deepwater}} port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, {{drought and}} economic mismanagement {{have resulted in}} a buildup of foreign debt. In March 1999, the government signed an agreement with a joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission on a $54million enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). The economic objectives have been set for 1999–2002. Privatization remains one of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues.</b> Mauritania is unlikely to meet ESAF's annual GDP growth objectives of 4%–5%.|$|E
25|$|Another play, Photograph 51 by Anna Ziegler, {{published}} in 2011, has been produced at several {{places in the}} US, and in late 2015 was put on at the Noel Coward Theatre, London, with Nicole Kidman playing Franklin. Ziegler's version of the 1951–53 'race' for the structure of DNA sometimes emphasizes the pivotal role of Franklin's research and her personality. Although sometimes altering history for dramatic effect, the play nevertheless illuminates many of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> of how science was and is conducted.|$|E

50|$|The Liberals {{retained}} a strong majority. With a few exceptions, members were returned unopposed. Education was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> and <b>the</b> election caused more controversy, with several sitting members changing their political allegiances.|$|R
25|$|From 1860–63 Huxley {{developed}} his ideas, presenting them in lectures to working men, {{students and the}} general public, followed by publication. Also in 1862 a series of talks to working men was printed lecture by lecture as pamphlets, later bound up as a little green book; the first copies went on sale in December. Other lectures grew into Huxley's most famous work Evidence as to Man's place in Nature (1863) where he addressed <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> long before Charles Darwin published his Descent of Man in 1871.|$|E
25|$|Labour {{won more}} seats (though fewer votes) than the Conservative Party in the General Election in February 1974, which {{resulted}} in a hung parliament. As Heath was unable to persuade the Liberals to form a coalition, Wilson returned to 10 Downing Street on 4 March 1974 as Prime Minister of a minority Labour Government. He gained a three-seat majority in another election later that year, on 10 October 1974. One of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> addressed during his second period in office was the referendum on British membership of the EEC (see Europe, above).|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{economics}} generally {{rejects the}} view of energy economics that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on biodiversity and creativity - or natural capital and individual capital, in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> of uneconomic growth and quality of life. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge {{that much of what}} is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.|$|E

25|$|In July–August 1988 a $1 million {{passenger}} {{market analysis}} was completed and a feasibility study was started, {{for which the}} joint venture partners budgeted $19 million. In December, a VFT Concept Report was released, identifying <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> for a high-speed rail system, to be built and operated by private enterprise, with trains operating between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne at speeds up to 350km per hour. The report sought positive responses from the New South Wales, Victorian and federal governments and the Australian Capital Territory administration in facilitating access to land for survey and route investigation; ensuring cooperation by government agencies; and forms of support, including enactment of legislation to facilitate land acquisition.|$|E
25|$|When the Treaty of Tartu {{was signed}} on 14 October 1920, Finland agreed {{to return the}} Russian icebreakers that the Finnish White Guard had seized during the Civil War in 1918. As a result, {{the largest and most}} {{powerful}} state-owned icebreaker of Finland at that time, Wäinämöinen, was handed over to Estonia in 1922. Since both the size of the ships calling at the Finnish winter ports and the amount of exported goods, especially forest products, had increased considerably since the First World War, there was a definite need for a large and powerful icebreaker. One of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> was the beam of the existing icebreakers, , which was not enough for the new ships used to transport goods across the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|In {{the end the}} adversaries {{resolved}} their differences, but in a very ambiguous way, through intermediaries, {{without actually}} settling <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issues.</b> With {{the intervention of the}} Roosevelt administration and the national leadership of the CIO, the City agreed, in a series of telegrams exchanged in June, 1941 between LaGuardia and Philip Murray of the CIO, {{to maintain the status quo}} under the collective bargaining agreements with the TWU that the City had assumed, while agreeing to disagree as to whether they would bargain in the future. The parties also differed on practical details: the City took the position that promotions would be made according to Civil Service requirements, the CIO took the position that seniority provisions would still govern. The union not only survived, but regained much of the ground it had lost among transit workers during the next four years.|$|E
