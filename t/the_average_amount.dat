5|$|The early Middle Ages were {{a period}} of climatic deterioration, with a drop in {{temperature}} {{and an increase in}} rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. Climate change had a major impact on agriculture in this period and terms emerged to describe different quantities of land. In the period c. 1150 to 1300, warm dry summers and less severe winters allowed cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and made land more productive. Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying areas such as the Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. The main unit of land measurement in Scotland was the ploughgate, also known as the davoch and in Lennox as the arachor. It may have measured about , divided into 4 raths. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of land used by a husbandman in Scotland might have been around 26 acres.|$|E

40|$|When {{clustering}} asymmetric proximity data, only <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>amounts</b> {{are often}} considered by {{assuming that the}} asymmetry is due to noise. But when the asymmetry is structural, as typically may happen for exchange flows, migration data or confusion data, this may strongly affect {{the search for the}} groups because the directions of the exchanges are ignored and not integrated in the clustering process. The clustering model proposed here relies on the decomposition of the asymmetric dissimilarity matrix into symmetric and skew-symmetric effects both decomposed in within and between cluster effects. The classification structures used here are generally based on two different partitions of the objects fitted to the symmetric and the skew-symmetric part of the data, respectively; the restricted case is also presented where the partition fits jointly both of them allowing for clusters of objects similar with respect to <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>amounts</b> and directions of the data.

25|$|The annual {{rainfall}} regime {{is generated by}} two factors: general atmospheric circulation, physical and geographical conditions, respectively. Advection of temperate oceanic air from west and north-west direction, especially during the summer, as well as frequent ingress of cold air masses from the north or those temperate continental from north-east and east, during the winter, plus advection of maritime tropical air from the south-west and south, explain all influences of atmospheric action centres which are felt in this area. Taking into account these elements, plus relief influences, atmospheric rainfall are unevenly spread across the county. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of precipitation is 600–700mm, in Zalău being 634.2mm (calculated for the period 1961–1990).

25|$|By {{the fourteenth}} century most farming {{was based on the}} Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams. These were allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers, who were usually known as husbandmen or bonders. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of land used by a husbandman in Scotland, known as a husbandland, was 26 acres, or 2 oxgangs. They would also have had a share of hay meadow and common pasture. Below the husbandmen, lesser landholders and free tenants, were the cottars, who often shared rights to common pasture, occupied small portions of land and participated in joint farming as hired labour. Farms also might have grassmen, who had rights only to grazing. Pasture was often accessed by shieling-grounds, with shelters made of stone or turf, used for the grazing of cattle in summer. These would often be distant from the main settlements in the Lowlands, but might be relatively close in the more remote Highlands.|$|E
25|$|Western lowland gorillas {{primarily}} live in rain forests, swamp forest, brush, secondary vegetation, {{clearing and}} forest edges, abandoned farming fields and riverine forests. They live in {{primary and secondary}} lowland tropical forests that have elevations that extend from sea level up to 1,300 meters. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of rainfall in the areas where western lowland gorillas typically reside is about 1,500 millimetres a year with the greatest rainfall between the months of August and November. Western lowland gorillas are not typically observed {{in areas that are}} close to human settlements and villages. They have been known to avoid areas with roads and farms that show signs of human activity. These gorillas favor areas where edible plants are more copious. Swamp forests are now considered important feeding areas and habitats for the western lowland gorilla. These areas support the gorillas in both the wet and the dry season of the forest. The forests of the Republic of Congo are currently considered to host the majority of the western lowland gorilla population. The forests of the Republic of Congo serve as protection to the gorillas with the isolation of the large swampy forest areas.|$|E
