5|$|Eggs {{sometimes}} {{fall prey}} to brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus), and nest are raided by Madagascar harrier-hawks (Polyboroides radiatus). In the daytime, birds may be taken by banded kestrels (Falco zoniventris), while at night <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> risk of being captured by barn owls (Tyto alba).|$|E
5|$|Males {{and females}} {{of all ages}} can be {{distinguished}} by {{the position of the}} two round genital openings or gonopores. In females, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> the bases of the third pair of pereiopods, while in males <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> the base of the fifth (last) pereiopods, furthest from the head and the closest to the abdomen. Mature females have a small claw on the fifth pereiopod, and enlarged pleopods.|$|E

5|$|Pulmonary oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{an entirely}} avoidable event while diving. The limited duration and naturally intermittent nature of most diving makes this a relatively rare (and even then, reversible) complication for divers. Established guidelines enable divers to calculate when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> risk of pulmonary toxicity.|$|E

Meanwhile, several drug dealers receive anonymous phone calls about {{the whereabouts of}} their competitors; they are told that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> the same diner. Two U.S. Marshals receive a similar phone call about an escaped prisoner. The drug dealers arrive in pairs as the man attempts {{to gain access to}} the files. Just as he does, the two Marshals appear and order everyone onto the floor, causing a shootout.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, House is annoyed {{because he is}} not able to spend enough time with his friend, James Wilson. He {{attempts}} to negotiate with Amber, Wilson's girlfriend, about conditions under which they can both have Wilson's company. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> a standstill, thus House seeks Lisa Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) resolution. However, she will only lay out the conditions if House does his team's performance reviews (knowing that he hates doing paperwork). House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed churches, only believing Christians are {{expected}} to partake of the Lord's Supper. Further, partakers {{are expected}} to examine and prepare themselves for the sacrament. This involves determining whether one acknowledges their sinfulness and has faith in Christ to forgive them. Christians may have some degree of doubt regarding their salvation, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> least {{to be aware of}} their sin and have a desire to have faith.|$|E

5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E

5|$|The length time {{in which}} {{offspring}} stay with their mother varies, though it can last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or {{as long as a}} year. Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. Spermatogenesis in male giraffes begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.|$|E

The girls are dressed in beautiful gowns throughout the video, presumably designed by Roberto Cavalli, who designed the costumes for their then-upcoming tour. Vignettes of the girls singing together and separately are sewn {{together to create a}} collage. Fading in and out, the music video ends with the girls combined together although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> different places.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E

5|$|In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show {{high levels}} of mercury in their blood and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content. Exposure, and prolonged periods of cold, ice, and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations, respectively. Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> higher risk of thyroid disease.|$|E
5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave the nursery group when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> least two years old and join a male or female group.|$|E

5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
