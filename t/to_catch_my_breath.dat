60|$|I {{found the}} {{forecastle}} of the Spitfire {{a dark and}} rather unwholesome place. The ventilation was bad, {{and the smell of}} tar and oakum was so strong that for a moment I had to turn away <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E

"To {{celebrate}} {{the strength and}} longevity that my fans, friends, and family have supported me with I wrote this song [...] "Catch my Breath" [...] {{with one of my}} best friends that has seen me through everything. This song represents who I've been, what I've felt, and where I'm headed as not only an artist but as a 30 year old that is now smart enough to know that it's time <b>to</b> stop, <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> and be proud of not only what has been accomplished but of all the people that have helped me become the woman I am today." [...] — Clarkson on releasing the song.|$|R

6000|$|I paused <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and looked}} round on the grim, tired faces of my players. They made a stern group.

60|$|I {{was beaten}} and buffeted, smashed under {{by the great}} San Pablo whitecaps, and strangled by the hollow tide-rip waves which flung {{themselves}} into my eyes, nose, and mouth. Then the strange sucks would grip my legs and drag me under, to spout me up in some fierce boiling, where, even as I tried <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> a great whitecap would crash down upon my head.|$|E
6000|$|The sun was gilding {{the rim of}} {{the desert}} rampart when we began the ascent of the foothills of Buckskin. A steep trail wound zigzag up the {{mountain}} We led our horses, as it was a long, hard climb. From time to time, as I stopped <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> I gazed away across the growing void to the gorgeous Pink Cliffs, far above and beyond the red wall which had seemed so high, and then out toward the desert. The irregular ragged crack in the plain, apparently only a thread of broken ground, was the Grand Canyon. How unutterably remote, wild, grand was that world of red and brown, of purple pall, of vague outline! ...|$|E

"I haven't {{examined}} {{this one}} yet," [...] answered the Ork; [...] "but if {{they happen to}} be alike I shudder at our fate, for the other one was a prison, with no outlet except by means of the water. I stayed there all night, however, and this morning I plunged into the pool, as far down as I could go, and then swam as hard and as far as I could. The rocks scraped my back, now and then, and I barely escaped the clutches of an ugly sea-monster; but by and by I came to the surface <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> and found myself here. That's the whole story, and as I see you have something to eat I entreat you to give me a share of it. The truth is, I'm half starved." ...|$|E
6000|$|I am {{now in a}} {{precarious}} position, riding {{the ends of the}} down-curving roofs of two cars at the same time. With a quick, tense movement, I transfer both legs to the curve of one roof and both hands to the curve of the other roof. Then, gripping the edge of that curving roof, I climb over the curve to the level roof above, where I sit down <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> holding on the while to a ventilator that projects above the surface. I am on top of the train--on the [...] "decks," [...] as the tramps call it, and this process I have described is by them called [...] "decking her." [...] And let me say right here that only a young and vigorous tramp is able to deck a passenger train, and also, that the young and vigorous tramp must have his nerve with him as well.|$|E
6000|$|Following that long-legged Arizonian on {{foot was}} almost as strenuous as keeping him in sight on horseback. I managed it. We climbed steep slopes and the farther we climbed the thicker grew the brush. Often we would halt to listen for hounds, at which welcome {{intervals}} I endeavored <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b> We kept the hounds in hearing, which fact incited us to renewed endeavors. At length we got into a belt of live-oak and scrub-pine brush, almost as difficult to penetrate as manzanita, and here we had to bend and crawl. Bear and deer tracks led everywhere. Small stones and large stones had been lifted and displaced by bears searching for grubs. These slopes were dry; we found no water at the heads of ravines, yet the red earth was rich in bearded, tufted grass, yellow daisies and purple asters, and a wan blue flower. We climbed and climbed, until my back began to give me trouble. [...] "Reckon we--bit off--a big hunk," [...] remarked Edd once, and I thought {{he referred to the}} endless steep and brushy slopes. By and bye the hounds came back to us one by one, all footsore and weary. Manifestly the bear had outrun them. Our best prospect then was to climb on to the rim and strike across the forest to camp.|$|E

60|$|All Edinburgh and the Pentland Hills glinted {{above me}} {{in a kind}} of smuisty brightness, now and again {{overcome}} with blots of cloud; of Leith there was no more than the tops of chimneys visible, and {{on the face of the}} water, where the haar[24] lay, nothing at all. Out of this I was presently aware of a sound of oars pulling, and a little after (as if out of the smoke of a fire) a boat issued. There sat a grave man in the stern sheets, well muffled from the cold, and by his side a tall, pretty, tender figure of a maid that brought my heart to a stand. I had scarce the time <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> in, and be ready to meet her, as she stepped upon the deck, smiling, and making my best bow, which was now vastly finer than some months before when I first made it to her ladyship. No doubt we were both a good deal changed; she seemed to have shot up taller, like a young, comely tree. She had now a kind of pretty backwardness that became her well, as of one that regarded herself more highly and was fairly woman; and for another thing, the hand of the same magician had been at work upon the pair of us, and Miss Grant had made us both braw, if she could make but the one bonny.|$|E

50|$|It {{all started}} when James and I {{returned}} from the Sundance Film Festival, where we had screened 'Saw' to much success. Our 'representatives' promptly told us that we should get another deal for a film stitched up before it was released. It was presented {{as a kind of}} insurance - if 'Saw' was a flop, we had another film to fall back on. Seems logical. There was only one problem - I didn't have any ideas for a new film. I had barely been able <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> throughout the whole 'Saw' experience, let alone dream up another film idea. Instead of telling our representatives that they had to wait until I came up with an idea I really liked though, I locked myself in the bedroom of the crappy apartment we had rented in Hollywood and tried to force an idea out like a particularly stubborn hangover shit. It was creativity at gunpoint. If I could go back in time, I would politely tell everyone to go fuck themselves, but back then....no. I paced and paced and even took up smoking for a while, so stressed out was I.|$|E

Dear Friends, Just {{this morning}} I {{received}} a letter mailed June 8 th. It had traveled to four rather distant points before it finally caught up, {{but it was very}} welcome in any case. About two weeks ago a package of cookies also came my way after a trip nearly as long. I intended to notify you of my change in address, but before I had a chance <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> from the last trip, I was on my way on another. You will find my latest address in the upper right hand corner; it may be old before you send the next item, but at least it will cut down the trip by three or four stops. Letters and packages mean a great deal to a man in the Army, which is a familiar remark by now, but nevertheless it is true. Candy and cigarettes are always available at the Post Exchange, but they mean more when they come through the mails as a gift. Thanks again for your kindnesses, and I hope you get half the fun from sending as I do on the other end. Very truly yours, Pfc. Robert N. Fowler 								[Transcription ends...|$|E
60|$|It {{was a most}} lovely day now, {{and bright}} and sunshiny; and the further and further we went over the hills towards the prairie the lovelier and lovelier the trees and flowers got to be and the more it seemed strange and somehow wrong that {{there had to be}} trouble in such a world as this. And {{then all of a sudden}} I <b>catched</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and grabbed Tom's arm, and all my livers and lungs and things fell down into my legs.|$|R

60|$|It made me <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b> <b>My</b> {{heart began}} to thump like a hammer. But there was silence now--silence absolute. All those noises ceased, {{and it was as}} if they had never been. Not a sound; the stillness grew oppressive; it was like a weight upon one. All faces were turned toward the door; and one could {{properly}} expect that, for most of the people there suddenly realized, no doubt, that they were about to see, in actual flesh and blood, what had been to them before only an embodied prodigy, a word, a phrase, a world-girdling Name.|$|R
60|$|It was {{an awful}} scene. It made me <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> as I gazed. I could hardly stand on my feet, so violent was {{the motion of the}} ship. But while I reeled to and fro, the sailors only laughed at me; and bade me look out that the ship did not fall overboard; and advised me to get a handspike, and hold it down hard in the weather-scuppers, to steady her wild motions. But I was now getting a little too wise for this foolish kind of talk; though all through the voyage, they never gave it over.|$|R

60|$|The absurd {{impulse to}} run out after Jacobus (for I had been startled, too) once repressed, I took a chair, placed it not very far from her, sat down deliberately, and {{began to talk about}} the garden, caring not what I said, but using a gentle caressing {{intonation}} as one talks to soothe a startled wild animal. I could not even be certain that she understood me. She never raised her face nor attempted to look my way. I kept on talking only to prevent her from taking flight.
