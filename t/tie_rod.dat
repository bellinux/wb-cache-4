5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a conventional unequal-span biplane design with wooden wings, while the fuselage was built using aluminum tubing with steel <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> bracing. The landing gear was fixed and the tail included a balanced rudder with a rear skid originally, later {{changed to a}} tailwheel.|$|E
25|$|The rear {{suspension}} {{is essentially a}} GM X-car's (Chevrolet Citation, Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Omega and Pontiac Phoenix) front suspension moved {{to the rear of}} the Fiero. The uppers are top-plates and Chapman struts, while the lowers are attached with ball joints. In lieu of the steering rack which would have been installed in an X-car, <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> ends are attached to the engine cradle and used to align the rear wheels.|$|E

50|$|An infamous {{structural}} failure involving <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> is the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse in Kansas City, Missouri, on July 17, 1981. The hotel {{had a large}} atrium with three walkways crossing it suspended from <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> Construction errors led to several of the walkways collapsing, killing 114 people and injuring over 200.|$|R

25|$|The right-front {{wheel and}} {{suspension}} {{are believed to}} have been sent back into the cockpit, striking Senna {{on the right side of}} his helmet, forcing his head back against the headrest. In addition, a piece of the upright assembly, most likely a <b>tie</b> <b>rod,</b> penetrated the helmet visor, which was a new, thinner version, above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries and a ruptured temporal artery.|$|E
25|$|With 74 laps to go, Ernie Irvan blew a tire in turn four, {{and spun}} {{into the path}} of Davey Allison. Allison t-boned Irvan's {{spinning}} car, and the cars slid to a stop along the inside wall. Allison re-fired the car, but was unable to pull away. The car had a broken right front <b>tie</b> <b>rod,</b> and he lost all steering. He would lose 43 laps as the crew repaired the damage, ending his championship hopes.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{railroad}} tie {{used on the}} predecessors of the first true railway (Liverpool and Manchester Railway) consisted {{of a pair of}} stone blocks laid into the ground, with the chairs holding the rails fixed to those blocks. One advantage of this method of construction was that it allowed horses to tread the middle path without the risk of tripping. In railway use with ever heavier locomotives, it was found that it was hard to maintain the correct gauge. The stone blocks were in any case unsuitable on soft ground, such as at Chat Moss, where timber ties had to be used. Bi-block ties with a <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> are somewhat similar.|$|E

50|$|The {{accompanying}} photograph shows lateral iron supports {{between the}} flying buttresses; {{it is not}} known when these external <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were installed. The technology would have been available {{at the time of the}} initial construction, but the extra support might not have been considered necessary until after the collapse in 1284, or even later. In the 1960s, the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were removed; the thinking was that they were ungraceful and unnecessary. However, the oscillations created by the wind became amplified, and the choir partially disassociated itself from the transept. Subsequently, the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were reinstalled, but this time with rods made of steel. Since steel is less ductile than iron, the structure became more rigid, possibly causing additional fissures.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sharing of}} {{suspension}} and other components with other GM cars meant the rear suspension and powertrain was virtually {{identical to that}} of the Citation and Pontiac Phoenix; the Fiero even included rear <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> ends attached to a [...] "steering knuckle", although these were hard-mounted to the engine cradle and only used for maintaining the rear tire alignment. The front suspension was derived from the Chevette, and Chevette enthusiasts found that they could upgrade their undersized front brakes and rotors using Fiero parts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wings of}} the Type E had a {{strongly}} curved leading edge and a straight but swept back trailing edge. Towards the tip, the trailing edge was extended rearwards {{to make it more}} flexible for wing warping. [...] The wings were built around two spars and wire-braced, both above and below to points on the front and rear spars from a pair of fuselage-mounted inverted-V struts, one just forward of each cockpit and joined by a horizontal <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> [...] A kingpost was fixed to the rear spar toward the tip where the outer bracing wires were fixed. [...] When this post was moved fore and aft by separate control wires, the wing was warped for lateral control.|$|E
2500|$|Kenseth, {{who spent}} most of the race in the top ten, was {{involved}} in a crash, where Brad Keselowski hit him after breaking a <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> midway through the race causing Kenseth to go down 9 laps for repairs; Kenseth came back on to the track and intentionally wrecked race leader Logano in retaliation for Logano spinning him out of the lead two weeks earlier at Kansas. The fans went wild with applause and cheers in reaction. Kenseth was immediately disqualified for his actions. Then, Kenseth was summoned to the oval office after it was over. He was later suspended for two races with probation for 6 months. Car owner Joe Gibbs appealed citing an unprecedented and unfair penalty. On appeal, the probation period was reduced from six months to December 31, but the two race suspension was upheld by both the appeals panel and the Final Appeals officer Bryan Moss.

40|$|About {{two-thirds of}} the {{residual}} stress in cold-worked SAE 1050 steel <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> was relieved by heating 30 minutes at 600 degrees Fahrenheit. Cold-worked austenitic stainless-steel <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> could be heated at temperatures up to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit without lowering the important physical properties. The corrosion resistance, in laboratory corrosion test, of straight 18 : 8 and titanium-treated 18 : 8 materials appeared to be impaired after heating at temperatures above 800 degrees or 900 degrees fahrenheit. Columbium-treated and molybdenum-treated 18 : 8 steel exhibited improved stability {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. <b>Tie</b> <b>rods</b> of either material could be heated 30 minutes with safety at any temperature up to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. At this temperature most of the residual stress would be relieved...|$|R
50|$|The {{longitudinal}} baulks, {{and therefore}} the rails, were kept to gauge by 'transoms' - transverse timber spacers - and iron tie-bars. The transom kept the longitudinals from getting too close together; the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> stopped them spreading too far apart. In later years the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were replaced by strap bolts. These were bolted to the transoms and passed through a hole drilled through the longitudinal to a nut on the outside.|$|R

5000|$|While in {{automotive}} parlance {{the term}} [...] "ball joint" [...] usually {{refers to the}} primary ball joint connections {{at the ends of}} the control arms, this type of joint is used in other parts as well, including <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> ends. In these other applications, they are typically called <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> ends or, when they are an inner <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> end on a rack-and-pinion steering system, they are called inner socket assemblies. These joints are also used {{in a number of other}} non-automotive applications, from the joints of dolls to other mechanical linkages for a variety of devices, or any place where a degree of rotation in movement is desired.|$|E

25|$|The XM, {{released}} in 1964, {{was the first}} Falcon with an Australian-designed body; the rear taillights were raised for Australian conditions and the front end received a full-wrap chrome grill and surrounds. The steering linkage was upgraded with 9/16-inch <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> instead of the 1/2-inch <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> found in the US models. The suspension was also improved with the upper control arms lowered to reduce the notorious bump steer found in the North American Falcon (and early Mustangs), on which this model was based.|$|R
50|$|Osgood and Graustein {{used the}} {{rectangular}} hyperbola, its conjugate hyperbola, and conjugate diameters to rationalize <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> at 15 degree radial spacing, to {{a square of}} girders, from its center. The tie-rods to the corners (45°) correspond to the asymptotes, while the pair at 15° and 75° are conjugate, as are the pair at 30° and 60°. According to this model in linear elasticity, {{the application of a}} load compressing the square results in a deformation where the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> maintain their conjugate relations.|$|R
50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four <b>tie</b> <b>rods,</b> one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between the <b>tie</b> <b>rods),</b> an idler arm on the passenger side, and a pitman arm on the driver side. The pitman arm attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side. The inner <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the steering arms and outer <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|R
