5|$|Ruby and Sapphire {{received}} mostly positive reviews, though {{critics were}} divided in <b>their</b> <b>assessment</b> of the games, {{especially on the}} gameplay and graphics. Most of the complaints focused {{on the fact that}} the gameplay had not changed much since previous generations, and the connectivity issues revolving around the past generations. With the popularity of Pokémon waning at the time, the games sold less than previous generations. However, they were still critical and commercial successes; with around 16 million copies sold according to IGN, they are the best-selling games for the Game Boy Advance.|$|E
5|$|As {{the great}} numbers of troops from both armies gathered, {{it was widely}} assumed in the North {{that this would be}} the battle to end the war. Grant, {{reinstated}} by Halleck at Lincoln's and Stanton's urging, left Fort Henry and traveled by boat up the Tennessee River to rejoin his army with orders to advance with the Army of the Tennessee into Tennessee. Grant's main Union army was located at Pittsburg Landing, while 40,000 Confederate troops converged at Corinth. Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman assured Grant that his green troops were ready for an attack. Grant agreed and wired Halleck with <b>their</b> <b>assessment.</b> Grant, whose forces numbered 45,000, wanted to attack the Confederates at Corinth, but Halleck ordered him not to attack until Major General Don Carlos Buell arrived with his division of 25,000. Meanwhile, Grant prepared for an attack on the Confederate army of roughly equal strength. Instead of preparing defensive fortifications between the Tennessee River and Owl Creek, and clearing fields of fire, they spent most of their time drilling the largely inexperienced troops while Sherman dismissed reports of nearby Confederates.|$|E
5|$|Hours after Humberto made landfall, Rick Perry {{declared}} Galveston, Jefferson, and Orange counties as disaster areas, which allocated {{state resources}} {{to assist the}} affected residents. The governor applied for a presidential disaster declaration on September 21. Four Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams assessed the hurricane damage in the three most affected counties. Following <b>their</b> <b>assessment,</b> they determined that {{the damage caused by}} Humberto was not significant enough to require a disaster declaration. As such, Governor Rick Perry's request from FEMA was denied. Across the Bolivar Peninsula, an estimated 1,500 cubic yards of structural debris and 3,000 cubic yards of tree limbs were needed to be removed {{in the wake of the}} storm.|$|E

25|$|Standardized tests also remove teacher bias in assessment.

25|$|By late May 2007, Congress did {{not impose}} any {{timetables}} in war funding legislation for troop withdrawal.

30|$|It was {{revealed}} that managerial, institutional, and individual barriers {{stand in the way}} of the reform. First, the managerial, technocratic approach to reform implementation has caused teachers not to take ownership of the reform. Secondly, at the institutional level, two obstacles were identified in the way of reform: inadequate resources within schools and the accountability demands that foster grade inflation. Finally, regarding professional competencies, teachers appeared to be largely unprepared to conduct language assessments consistent with the LAR demands. In particular, they seemed to have difficulties with the contents of <b>their</b> <b>assessments,</b> with the reasons for doing assessments, and with adjusting <b>their</b> <b>assessments</b> in keeping with LAR communicative aspirations.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} {{a sample of}} {{publicly}} traded corporate bond issuers and institutional investors assess the four major nationally recognized rating agencies and their role in capital markets. The results show that issuers and investors differ dramatically in <b>their</b> <b>assessments</b> about rating agencies. Specifically, the majority of institutional investors require only one rating when they buy rated corporate bonds, but most issuers obtain two or more ratings. Issuers and investors also differ in <b>their</b> <b>assessments</b> about whether ratings accurately reflect creditworthiness and timeliness. The results suggest that differences reflect the different roles that rating agencies provide in the market place. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002. ...|$|R

25|$|By 2003, {{overfishing}} {{had occurred}} on 60 stocks. Another 232 stocks were not overfished. Overfishing had been stopped on 31 stocks, and a gain {{was made of}} 13 stocks that had been fully rebuilt. There were 617 other stocks which have limited data or for which criteria for overfishing had not been defined. These stocks mostly have harvests which are not significant, so they are not allocated research funding. <b>Their</b> <b>assessment</b> can be expensive {{and there is no}} evidence of overfishing. Rebuilding strategies are operating or are being developed for most stocks which are overfished.|$|E
25|$|Caragiale contrasted {{the other}} major writers of his generation, {{including}} his friends Mihai Eminescu, Ioan Slavici, Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea, and Sămănătorul journal founder Alexandru Vlahuţă, {{all of whom were}} advocating a return to the rural sphere and peasant traditionalism. In Moftul Român, he parodied the archaisms favored by Ştefănescu Delavrancea; during his final years, he also questioned the aesthetic value of Ştefănescu Delavrancea's medieval-themed play Apus de soare. Prominent nationalists and traditionalists tended to be reserved in <b>their</b> <b>assessment</b> of Caragiale's literary contributions—they include his friend Eminescu and historian Nicolae Iorga.|$|E
25|$|In February 2009, Health Canada {{announced}} that they were assessing whether acrylamide, which occurs naturally during the cooking of French fries, potato chips, and other processed foods, is a hazard to human health and whether any regulatory action needs to be taken.

25|$|The U.S. and ARVN units {{participating}} in Apache Snow knew, based on existing intelligence information and previous {{experience in the}} A Shau, that the operation was likely to encounter serious resistance from PAVN. Beyond that, however, they had little intelligence as to the actual strength and dispositions of PAVN units. The area was extremely remote and difficult to access. Aerial surveillance was difficult. U.S. battalion commanders had to generate their own tactical intelligence by combat patrols, capturing equipment, installations, documents, and occasionally prisoners of war to provide the raw data from which to draw <b>their</b> <b>assessment</b> of the North Vietnamese order of battle and dispositions. It was this time-consuming and hit-or-miss task force which characterized the main efforts of Colonel Honeycutt's 3/187th Infantry during the first four days of the operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} allegations {{which had}} been made against Huntley regarding sexual offences and the burglary charge which had remained on file were made public immediately after his conviction and sentencing. It was also revealed that Huntley had dribbled and refused to answer questions immediately after his arrest, which had led to him being sectioned under the Mental Health Act for nearly two months before he was declared fit to stand trial. Doctors at Rampton Secure Hospital {{found no evidence of}} mental illness in <b>their</b> <b>assessment</b> of Huntley, and the police's belief that Huntley had feigned madness was further strengthened when a former girlfriend contacted them and stated that Huntley would often feign mental illness during the 1990s {{when he came to the}} attention of police over various allegations.|$|E
25|$|The Admiralty had {{intended}} that the 80-gun ships {{should no longer}} be built, they being too short and lacking in stability {{so as not to}} be able to open their lower ports in anything much above a calm sea. The committee the Admiralty had set up disagreed with <b>their</b> <b>assessment</b> however, and the suggestion to switch to 74-gun ships in lieu of the 80s was rejected. The size of ships was to be limited according to the depth of water available in the country's ports, and so even the 90-gun ships were to remain smaller than some French and Spanish 74s. Despite these setbacks, the Admiralty had achieved much greater increases in the sizes of ships than with the previous establishments. Furthermore, the ship types of pre-1741 were restored (i.e. the 64s returned to being 70s, the 58s to 60s, etc.).|$|E
