40|$|The {{issue of}} whether mutual fund {{managers}} behave {{as though they are}} competing in a tournament {{has been the focus of}} several recent studies. Tournament behavior may be influenced by managers’ interim relative performance and whether they adjust their fund’s risk by their <b>trades</b> <b>to</b> win the tournament, improve their ranking, or prevent deterioration in their present ranking. It is an empirical issue as to whether a change in intertemporal risk is intentional or simply arises from risk mean reversion. Our methodology differentiates funds that actively <b>trade</b> <b>to</b> change risk from those whose risk is changed by trades with alternative motivations. Funds that are statistically identified as <b>trading</b> <b>to</b> change return variance or tracking error variance do not exhibit risk mean reversion. Rather, funds more commonly <b>trade</b> <b>to</b> reduce tracking error variance, particularly those with already low tracking error variances. We find weak evidence that underperforming funds intentionally <b>trade</b> <b>to</b> reduce return variance, and that <b>trades</b> designed <b>to</b> change tracking error variance are not associated with prior performance...|$|R
