5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on Christmas Eve {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. He explains that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He explains that they could not stand <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend all eternity together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the house every Christmas Eve.|$|E
25|$|It was at Southern, in {{the same}} year he joined the station, that Hargreaves made his screen debut with the series Gone Fishing – and so, what had {{previously}} been a pastime became the focus of his wider reputation. He recounted how on his first broadcast, sitting in the studio, apprehensive at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> about to talk live to a potential audience of millions, his director had reminded him that although that vast audience might be statistically daunting, it was more likely to be two or three people and perhaps a dog sitting in their front room. He aimed at conversing with such an audience {{for the rest of his}} career. The director of nearly all of Hargreaves' programmes at Southern Television was George Egan who, with cameraman Stan Bréhaut, became the third ingredient of a most creative outdoor team.|$|E

The following year, Butthole Surfers shocked many fans and critics by signing with the major label Capitol Records. In 2017, Paul Leary reflected: [...] "I {{grew up listening to}} The Beatles and Grand Funk Railroad and Dean Martin, and <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> on the same record label that they were on was too fucking weird, really weird. A lot of people gave us grief for doing that, but fuck: I wasn't going to turn that down." ...|$|E

Kaplan and Sheinwold concluded {{that it was impossible}} to prove either side of the issue. Goren was unconvinced that the Italians cheated and felt that the Americans did not do well because they were distracted by <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> cheated; Goren publicly apologised to the Italians.|$|R
5000|$|Hewat's {{first volume}} {{attempts}} to outline the earliest settlement of North America, {{and the reasons}} for the influx of British, French and other European migrants in the early 17th century due to religious conflict at home. He wrote: “Amidst cold, hunger, toil, disease, and distress of every kind, they comforted themselves with <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> removed far {{out of the reach of}} tyrants, and triumphed in their deliverance from an idolatrous and wicked nation.” ...|$|R
500|$|Back at Elsinore, Hamlet {{explains}} to Horatio {{that he had}} discovered Claudius's letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings {{and replaced it with}} a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, Osric, interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her, but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming [...] "the rest is silence". [...] Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself, and orders a military funeral to honor Hamlet.|$|E

[...] In [...] "Glitter in the Air", Pink asks many questions such as, [...] "Have you ever looked fear {{in the face and}} said I just don’t care?", and [...] "Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?"

2500|$|The {{turning point}} for Collins in his {{decision}} to become an astronaut was the Mercury Atlas 6 flight of John Glenn on February 20, 1962, and <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> able to circle the Earth in 90 minutes. He immediately applied for the second group of astronauts that year. To raise their numbers, the Air Force sent their best applicants to a [...] "charm school". Medical and psychiatric examinations at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas and interviews at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston followed. In mid-September he found {{that he had not}} been accepted, something that was a blow even though he did not really expect to be accepted. Collins still rates the second group of nine as the best group of astronauts ever selected by NASA.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her final}} departure, {{numerous}} rumours circulated in the British press predicting the character's {{return to the}} soap. In 2005 {{it was reported that}} EastEnders producers were attempting to lure Gillian Taylforth back with the offer of a £200,000 a year pay cheque. Gillian said: [...] "I've always wanted to go back because I love EastEnders — I have great friends in the cast and always enjoyed working with Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell)." [...] However, in January 2006 it was announced that the character was being killed off-screen in a storyline to facilitate the return of her young son Ben to his father Phil Mitchell. Taylforth has commented: [...] "I was a bit upset at first because it was 13 years of my life and I didn't like <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> killed off.

2500|$|Many Japanese {{women are}} embarrassed at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> heard by others during {{urination}} (see paruresis). To cover {{the sound of}} bodily functions, many women used to flush public toilets continuously while using them, wasting {{a large amount of}} water in the process. As education campaigns did not stop this practice, a device was introduced in the 1980s that, after activation, produces the sound of flushing water without the need for actual flushing. A Toto brand name commonly found is the [...] This device is now routinely placed in most new public women's rooms, and many older public women's rooms have been upgraded. The Otohime may be either a separate battery-operated device attached to the wall of the toilet, or included in an existing washlet. The device is activated by pressing a button, or by the wave of a hand in front of a motion sensor. When activated, the device creates a loud flushing sound similar to a toilet being flushed. This sound either stops after a preset time or can be halted through a second press on the button. It is estimated that this saves up to 20 liters of water per use. However, some women believe that the Otohime sounds artificial and prefer to use a continuous flushing of the toilet instead of the recorded flush of the Otohime.|$|E
2500|$|When Darwin proved {{unable to}} persevere at medical studies, his father {{sent him to}} Christ's College, Cambridge, for a Bachelor of Arts degree {{as the first step}} towards {{becoming}} an Anglican parson. Darwin was at first uncertain, he later wrote: [...] "from what little I had heard and thought on the subject I had scruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England; though otherwise I liked <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a country clergyman. Accordingly I read with care 'Pearson on the Creed' and a few other books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted. It never struck me how illogical it was to say that I believed in what I could not understand and what is in fact unintelligible. I might have said with entire truth that I had no wish to dispute any dogma; but I never was such a fool as to feel and say 'credo quia incredibile'.

2500|$|Penny finally does admit {{her love}} to Leonard, in [...] "The 43 Peculiarity". Penny and Leonard awkwardly {{stare at each}} other before running off in {{opposite}} directions. Leonard, though, is buoyed by optimism over Penny's admission. Alex Jensen asks Leonard out to dinner in [...] "The Egg Salad Equivalency", which boosts Leonard's ego because two beautiful women are interested in him, however, Alex's interest makes Penny insecure. After another dispute with Sheldon, Leonard tries to move in with Penny in [...] "The Spoiler Alert Segmentation", however she is not ready. During their Valentine's Day dinner in [...] "The Tangible Affection Proof", Leonard again tries to propose to Penny and she cuts him off quickly. She admits that she is very happy with him, but she also admits to commitment issues and <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> married forever really [...] "freaks" [...] her out. Leonard then tells her that when she is ready to get married, she can propose to him. In the season finale, Leonard leaves for an overseas job for four months and Penny is confident enough in their relationship to wait for him. [...] In [...] "The Gorilla Dissolution", Leonard and Penny become engaged. Throughout season 8, a running gag is their reluctance to decide upon a wedding date. In the season 8 finale, Penny asks Leonard to marry her that night in Las Vegas. Leonard happily accepts, but during the journey, after Penny expresses happiness that they will get married while knowing everything about each other, Leonard confesses to having shared a drunken kiss with another woman while on the boat in Europe, though he adds that the woman started it and he rejected her. Penny becomes hurt by the revelation, and even though she claims to forgive Leonard, there is clearly tension between them, leaving the season ending in a cliffhanger {{as to whether or not}} they will go through with the wedding.|$|E
