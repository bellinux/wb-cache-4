40|$|Introduction: Mantle cell {{lymphoma}} is a B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma {{characterized by}} a t(11; 14), resulting in overexpression of cyclin D 1. Conventional chemotherapy obtains frequent (but short) remissions, leading to a poor median overall survival (OS) of 3 – 5  years. To obtain {{more information about the}} prevalence and current treatment of Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in Belgium, we collected data in a Belgian registry of MCL. Materials and methods: All Belgian MCL patients, t(11; 14) and/or cyclin D 1 positive, seen in hematology departments over a one-year period (April 2013 –March 2014) were included. Data about patient characteristics, histology, <b>treatment</b> <b>lines,</b> and response were compiled and retrospectively analyzed. Results: Four hundred and four patients were included with a median age at diagnosis of 64  years (range 23 – 96  years) and a male predominance (72 %). For 2013, we calculated a prevalence of at least 36. 2 per million and an incidence of at least 7. 0 per million in the Belgian population. Characteristics at diagnosis involved lymphadenopathy (82 %), splenomegaly (44 %), B-symptoms (39 %), and hepatomegaly (10 %). Bone marrow invasion was present at diagnosis in 77 %. Stage at diagnosis was advanced in the majority of cases. The median number of <b>treatment</b> <b>lines</b> was 1. Type of first <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> included a combination of anthracyclin and cytarabine-based regimen (34 %), anthracyclin (39 %), and other. Rituximab was used in 88 % of first <b>line</b> <b>treatments.</b> In 44 % first <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> was followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Conclusion: The analysis of this Belgian MCL registry provides insight in the epidemiology, demographics, and current treatment of our Belgian MCL population.

30|$|For {{the nerves}} of the {{superior}} knee, the horizontal <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> is defined {{at a distance of}} 1 / 3 the vertical length of the thigh superior to the knee and connects the medial and lateral borders of the patella. In cases where the proposed horizontal <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> does not capture the target nerves, as indicated by an insufficient reduction in superior knee pain, treatment should be extended medially past the medial edge of the patella, as the majority of femoral cutaneous nerve branches occur medial to the vertical centerline of the thigh. The present study was the first to define and validate a <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> to target the major sensory nerves {{of the superior}} patella using anatomical landmarks. This novel approach obviates the need for additional location instrumentation and captures the vast majority of variations in the branching patterns of the targeted sensory nerves in the superior knee.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Pathogen {{transmission}} {{is a major}} concern when implementing sanitation systems in resource poor areas. Multiple studies have shown that ecological sanitation systems are an effective means for improving health in areas where standard systems cannot reach disparate populations. Emerging designs of ecological sanitation systems provide needed access to hygiene but they still require confirmation of their effectiveness in reducing pathogen loads in the waste and transmission of disease. "The Earth Auger" is a novel composting toilet design that has incorporated critical elements to accelerate pathogen die off and has proven to be popular among recipients. A subset of active composting toilets were monitored for 2 months, taking samples at different points in the <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> to determine the presence and quantity of total coliforms, E. coli, helminth ova and Salmonella. In addition, two scaled composting units were inoculated with Ascaris suum, Salmonella enterica, poliovirus 1, and MS 2 bacteriophage. Over a period of two months tested for E. coli and inoculated pathogens for die-off. Samples were used to determine pathogen die-off through the <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> according to time, pH, temperature and moisture content. Multi-variable linear regression compared E. coli levels in the <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> with community as a modifying variable, statistically significant reductions were observed from the bowl to the receiving tank (avg. log 10 reduction: - 1. 27; 95 % CI: - 2. 22 to - 0. 32), and from the bowl to into storage (avg. log 10 reduction: - 2. 71; 95 % CI: - 3. 55 to - 1. 87). There were no statistically significant differences seen between communities (p-value= 0. 566) or from the bowl {{to the end of the}} horizontal reaction tube (p-value= 0. 120). Additionally, sample sizes in study were too small to see statistically significant differences between communities and between different points along the <b>treatment</b> <b>line.</b> Helminths were found in some endpoints during field work, increasing in numbers through <b>treatment</b> <b>line,</b> but prevalence was low and die-off patterns could not be established. Tested environmental factors did not significantly contribute to indicator reduction. At the endpoints for this study, however, indicator levels in compost directly out of treatment system were still above acceptable values delineated by EPA biosolids class B and below WHO guidelines for excreta reuse in agriculture. Salmonella were not found in samples throughout the <b>treatment</b> <b>line.</b> Experimental composting units did not yield useful die-off results but suggested modest decreases in Ascaris suum ova and bacteriophages. Additional human subject participation would have greatly benefited bench-scale experiments and elicited more information about the system. Under the current deployment and usage practices, these composting toilets do not strongly reduce indicator organisms after initial treatment, which will limit the use of post-treatment compost and extend storage time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, {{treatment}} options {{for patients with}} multiple myeloma (MM) have improved substantially, resulting in better response rates and prolonged overall survival (OS). Nevertheless, MM remains a challenging disease, especially if renal insufficiency (RI) or extensive pre-treatment aggravates the assignment of the optimal treatment schedule. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the outcome of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in 167 patients with relapsed or refractory MM with focus on RI. The baseline creatinine clearance (CL) was normal in 94 patients (CL[*]≥[*] 80  ml/min), while RI was observed in 73 patients, including 40 patients with mild RI (50 [*]≤[*]CL[*] 2 previous <b>treatment</b> <b>lines.</b> OS was not significantly different between patients with normal and impaired renal function.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. I observed bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from a shore-based, rooftop theodolite station on the southeast side of Galveston Island to test their behavioral response to pingers. Pingers have been shown to alert some cetacean species to the presence of nets, but have not been tested adequately for bottlenose dolphins. Data were collected from September 1997 to August 1999 for behavioral variables (behavior, cohesion level, and group size) as well as for track variables (linearity, track speed, and reorientation) to determine differences between three levels of an experimental factor: active, dummy, and control. An active treatment consisted of pingers that contained batteries and were pinging, while a dummy treatment consisted of pingers that did not contain the batteries and would not ping, and the control with no pinger. Hypotheses were that with a change of pinger treatment, dolphins would not exhibit different: 1) behaviors, 2) cohesion levels, 3) group sizes; and 4) movement patterns. In addition, two criteria were used to select case-study tracks that exhibited possible reactions by the dolphins to pingers: 1) All tracks of dolphins that extended "through" the <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> or just next to either buoy, as if there was nothing to deter dolphin movement; and 2) All tracks that showed an approximate 180 -degree turn by dolphins upon nearing or reaching the <b>treatment</b> <b>line,</b> as if movement was deterred. The first criterion was expected to occur for dolphin groups during control or dummy days, while criterion 2 was expected to occur for dolphin groups during active treatment. Chi-square tests and MANCOVA's did not detect significant differences among treatments; however, case studies showed interesting trends. Four of 5 dolphin pods that turned 180 degrees occurred on days when the treatment was active. At no time did a dolphin or dolphin pod swim through the <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> during an "active" treatment. However, during "dummy" or "control" treatment days, 9 dolphins or dolphin groups, of 14 case study dolphin groups swam through the <b>treatment</b> <b>line.</b> It is apparent that the "active" pinger may have been deterring dolphins from passing across the <b>treatment</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{this study}} refined a basic {{approximation}} for targeting nerves of the inferior knee developed by Le Correller et al. and validated the new method {{with a larger}} sample of cadaver specimens (15 fresh versus 5 embalmed cadavers) than were used by Le Correller et al. (Le Corroller et al. 2011). Results from the TENS location on live volunteers and cadaveric dissections {{in the present study}} corroborate findings of previous studies on the innervation and branching patterns in the inferior knee, and confirm that a vertical <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> at the specified landmarks should allow for the successful treatment of inferior knee pain in most individuals (Kalthur et al. 2015; Kartus et al. 1999; Scott 2012; Tifford et al. 2000). In cases where this line does not capture all targeted branches, suboptimal results for treating inferior knee pain could be improved by extending treatment superiorly along the <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> {{to the center of the}} patella and inferiorly to 1  cm below the tibial tubercle, as a small percentage of nerve branches cross the <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> at the level of the patella or inferior to the tibial tuberosity. The location of this <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> is consistent with findings by Kalthur et al., who found that that the infrapatellar nerve branches were located between the lower pole of the patella to under the tibial tubercle in 65.6  % of cases, with the remaining 15.6  % and 18.7  % of cases located near the patella and tibial tuberosity, respectively (Kalthur et al. 2015). In the present study, two branches innervating the inferior knee were located within the measurement area in 72  % of knees, with a single branch in 14  % and three branches in 7  % of knees. These findings are consistent with those of a previous cadaver study, which found that the infrapatellar saphenous nerve had a single branch, two branches, and three branches innervating the inferior patella in 25  %, 62  %, and 10  % of knees, respectively (Kartus et al. 1999).|$|E

30|$|Another {{limitation}} of this study was that it excluded subjects with prior knee surgeries, distortions (including scar tissue), or neuropathies in the measurement area as the impact of these conditions on local anatomy variation was unclear. Treating nerves in areas of previous surgery or trauma may be difficult. Clinicians will need to ensure that treatment is proximal to any potential neuroma formation to adequately disrupt transmission of the pain signal, and that the nerve path relative to the <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> landmarks has not changed as a result of surgery or trauma. Other difficulties may include distorted local anatomy such as bone deformities which could render the <b>treatment</b> <b>line</b> landmarks ineffective. Scar tissue could present multiple difficulties in isolating and distinguishing the targeted nerve using imaging such as ultrasound as well as effectively treating the nerve once found.
