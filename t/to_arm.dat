5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, {{a survey of the}} castle was carried out, which recommended repairs to the site. A survey carried {{out at the end of}} the 1730s suggested that the castle had ten artillery positions, but that there were not enough guns on the island <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> both the castle and the other defences, and that some of the guns that were available were unusable.|$|E
5|$|Although many Canadians {{have come}} to view Brock {{as one of their}} own, Brock never really felt at home in Canada. On the whole, he viewed the country as a backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. Brock mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many of whom he {{suspected}} of being American sympathizers, and he was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces which could be trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh's warriors.|$|E

5|$|By July 1789, revolutionary {{sentiment}} {{was rising}} in Paris. The Estates-General was convened in May {{and members of}} the Third Estate proclaimed the Tennis Court Oath in June, calling for the king to grant a written constitution. Violence between loyal royal forces, mutinous members of the royal Gardes Françaises and local crowds broke out at Vendôme on 12 July, leading to widespread fighting and the withdrawal of royal forces from the centre of Paris. Revolutionary crowds began <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> themselves during 13 July, looting royal stores, gunsmiths and armourers' shops for weapons and gunpowder.|$|E
5|$|Convair's {{proposal}} {{gained an}} order for two prototypes in late 1951. Twelve production aircraft were ordered before a prototype had even flown. No armament was ever fitted to any Sea Dart built, but the plan was <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> the production aircraft with four 20mm Colt Mk12 cannon and a battery of folding-fin unguided rockets. Four of this order were redesignated as service test vehicles, and an additional eight production aircraft were soon ordered as well.|$|E

Engineers of the Factory No. 174 felt it was impossible to implement this project because it would lead to a significant overload of T-26's chassis.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1642, {{both sides}} began <b>to</b> <b>arm.</b> Charles raised an army using the medieval method of {{commission}} of array, and Parliament called for volunteers for its militia. Following futile negotiations, Charles raised the royal standard in Nottingham on 22 August 1642. At {{the start of}} the First English Civil War, Charles's forces controlled roughly the Midlands, Wales, the West Country and northern England. He set up his court at Oxford. Parliament controlled London, the south-east and East Anglia, as well as the English navy.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, Croatia doubled {{the size of its}} police force to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000-strong special police that were deployed in 12 battalions, adopting military organisation. In addition there were 9,000–10,000 regionally organised reserve police. The reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but they lacked weapons needed <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> many of the troops.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland {{served as}} a troopship for about the next year.

With her arming complete, and carrying an armed naval guard to man the guns, Kroonland sailed for Liverpool on 25 March 1917. Twelve days later, the United States formally declared war on Germany.|$|E

The Swedish soldiers in Scania were outnumbered and outequipped by the Danes. In May 1676, they invaded Scania, taking Landskrona and Helsingborg, then proceeding through Bohuslän towards Halmstad. The King had to grow up quickly. He suddenly found himself alone and under great pressure.|$|E
5|$|The Erzherzog Ferdinand Max class {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} ironclad warships and built for the Austrian Navy in the 1860s. They were the last broadside armored frigates to be built for the Austrian Empire, and the last vessels completed to see action against the Italians at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Intended to have been armed with new breech-loading Krupp guns, the outbreak of the Seven Weeks' War prevented the delivery of the guns, forcing the Austrian Navy <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> the ships with a battery of sixteen older 48-pounder muzzle-loading guns.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan was}} <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> every fifth T-26 with the 37mm {{gun in the}} right turret, but the final {{proportion}} was somewhat higher. About 450 twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 tanks mounting the 37mm gun in the right turret were produced in 1931–1933 (including only 20–30 tanks with the B-3 gun). There were 392 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks with gun plus machine gun armament in the Red Army on 1 April 1933.|$|E

On September 20, 1970, the group robbed a National Guard armory in Newburyport, Massachusetts and took 400 rounds of ammunition. They also stole weapons and set fire to the facility, causing about $125,000 in damage.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United Kingdom in 1904, Victorious served as the second flagship of the Channel Fleet. She remained in active service with the fleet in various units until 1908, when she was modernized and then placed in reserve. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in August 1914 she was mobilized with three of her sister ships into the 9th Battle Squadron, though by January 1915 she was again withdrawn from front-line service. In September her main guns were removed <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> a pair of monitors. Victorious was subsequently used as a repair ship. After {{the end of the war}} she was renamed Indus II; plans to use her as a harbor ship were cancelled and, in April 1923, she was sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> the most {{important}} place.

It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to the glory of the heroes and another for reverence.
