[...] His initial concern was the implementation of the overhaul of the state's financial and revenue structure that had been authorized by the constitutional convention. [...] In 1963, he proposed a comprehensive <b>tax</b> <b>revision</b> package that included a flat-rate state income tax, but general economic prosperity alleviated pressure on the state budget and the Michigan Legislature rejected the measure. Romney's early difficulties with the legislature helped undermine an attempted push that year of Romney as a national political figure by former Richard Nixon associates. One Michigan Democrat said of Romney, [...] "He has not yet learned that things in government are not necessarily done the moment the man at the top gives an order. He is eager and sometimes impatient." [...] But over his first two years in office, Romney was able to work with Democrats– who often had at least partial control of the legislature– and an informal bipartisan coalition formed which allowed Romney to accomplish many of his goals and initiatives.|$|E

40|$|Various <b>tax</b> <b>revisions</b> {{concerning}} individual income tax, company tax and {{the sales}} tax were featured in the 1995 Budget Proclamation of Botswana. This paper examines these <b>tax</b> <b>revisions</b> and their implications for individuals and businesses. It is concluded that, although the reductions in the individual income tax appear to benefit some individuals more than others, they do not generally erode the progressivity inherent in the tax structure. Consequently, {{the burden of the}} tax continues to fall more on higher income groups than on lower income groups. With regard to the company tax concessions, such concessions, which are substantial by any standard, could serve as a complementary factor to other strategies used to encourage investment. Finally, with regard to {{the sales tax}} changes, despite the broadening of the tax coverage and the raising of the tax rate applicable to certain products, selectivity of the tax is maintained, with the result that the income distribution effect of the tax remains not regressive overall...|$|R

40|$|The {{petroleum}} {{industry in the}} United States has received much attention recently due to the "energy crisis".

Investment {{in the stock market}} can be a rewarding experience. The bull market situation can provide substantial capital gains. Investment in the proper stock can be an excellent hedge against inflation. However, the selection of an industry and finally a specific stock for investment should be based upon a thorough analysis of investment values. The problem in this investigation was to determine the advisability of investing in the petroleum industry and to select the specific stock in the industry with the most potential for investment. The purpose of this report is to provide the investor with the preliminary background information necessary for making the decision to invest in an oil company stock. It must be noted that such an investigation can analyze the growth of a company, determine the stock price history, and project future trends. However, there still remains a degree of risk in any stock investment. The first section of this report evaluates the general stock market trend at the present time.

50|$|Taxation {{has been}} a topic of {{controversy}} since democratization in Bhutan. In June 2010, the first democratically elected government of Bhutan revised the import duty scheme on imported light private vehicles, raising taxes without following the procedures for bicameral presentment and debate required by the Constitution. The move was supported by some Bhutanese as curbing congestion and pollution while promoting mass transit development. The National Assembly opposition party contested the action in the High Court of Bhutan, Constitutional Bench, winning the initial suit. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Bhutan, the Attorney General argued that the <b>tax</b> <b>revision</b> was supported by pre-constitutional laws on direct and indirect taxation that remained unrepealed. The Attorney General also argued against judicial reviewability of political actions, a position based largely in United States jurisprudence developed by Louis Brandeis and supported by American case law. In December 2010, while the lawsuit was pending, the government ordered a halt of all imports subject to the tax, a move the opposition criticized as contempt of court. On February 24, 2011, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the High Court ruling against the government. The government lifted the import ban in early March 2011 and stated its intention to refund the taxes it had collected illegally, although it may reintroduce the tax revisions and pass them in the constitutional process. The government, though shaken by the ruling, has declared it will not resign over the debacle.|$|E

The purpose of the dissertation is to determine the effect of variables hypothesized to be most important in changing the strength of tax expenditure claims on state financial resources and to determine if some types of tax expenditure claims might respond differently to those variables. Tax expenditures are conceptualized as features of tax policy that eliminate or reduce the tax liability of certain groups or categories of taxpayers. They represent claims on financial resources, just like budget requests that receive direct appropriations. They are "weak" or "strong" {{to the extent that they}} are successful in becoming and/or remaining part of the tax code. A market-based theory of budgeting was employed to deduce causal variables and hypotheses. Four causal variables [...] fiscal condition, the tax burden, legislative budget procedures that expose tax expenditures to scrutiny and competition, and the availability of information about tax expenditures [...] when found in certain ideal combinations, were hypothesized to either minimize or maximize the strength of tax expenditure claims. A comparative case study methodology was used to evaluate the effect of the causal variables on tax expenditure claims. Four states were selected for study: Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Changes in tax expenditure provisions were examined in the four states over a fourteen-year period, 1980 - 1993. The case studies also examined income <b>tax</b> <b>revisions</b> where <b>tax</b> expenditures were repealed in order to reduce marginal rates. The four causal variables were found to be influential in determining the strength of tax expenditure claims. However, tax expenditure claims can also be weakened when states attempt to reduce the burden in one tax by repealing tax expenditures that apply to another tax, thus shifting the tax burden from one tax to another. Tax expenditures that are targeted at increasing investment to spur economic development can be very strong claims, even when the combination of causal variables predicts weak tax expenditure claims. Efforts to reduce high marginal income tax rates were also found to weaken tax expenditure claims...|$|R
