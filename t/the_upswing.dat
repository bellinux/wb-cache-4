25|$|After {{the advent}} of Islam and Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th century, the old Mediterranean economy {{collapsed}} and the volume of trade went down drastically. The Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, neglected to revive overland trade routes but was dependent on keeping the sea lanes open to keep the empire together. Bulk trade fell around 600-750 while the luxury trade increased. Galleys remained in service, but were profitable mainly in the luxury trade, which set off their high maintenance cost. In the 10th century, there was {{a sharp increase in}} piracy which resulted in larger ships with more numerous crews. These were mostly built by the growing city-states of Italy which were emerging as the dominant sea powers, including Venice, Genoa and Pisa. Inheriting the Byzantine ship designs, the new merchant galleys were similar dromons, but without any heavy weapons and both faster and wider. They could be manned by crews of up to 1,000 men and were employed in both trade and warfare. A further boost {{to the development of the}} large merchant galleys was <b>the</b> <b>upswing</b> in Western European pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land.|$|E

Skills are investigated using ISCO professional groups, with a distinction between Managers, Clerks, Craft and Manual workers. We show that patterns of change of such groups are significantly different from one another and are appropriate to account for the evolution of the overall skill structure. Results document the role that different types of technological change, education, wages and demand have on industries' job creation, broken down by professional groups. In manufacturing all professional groups except managers experience job losses that are mainly driven by the introduction of process innovation. In services, a polarised employment structure emerges, mainly driven by the expansion of demand. These relationships, however, do not always hold. During the downswing most established links break down; in particular, product innovation loses its positive impact on jobs while new processes drive the process of restructuring that is taking place, with diverse effects on each professional group...|$|R
