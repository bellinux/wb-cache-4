25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> an uninitiated dog {{owner or}} a new enthusiast {{mistakes}} the Koolie as a shy, reserved or even a timid animal. The Koolie's temperament needs to be understood in proper context when one seeks an optimal match of skills and demeanour. Koolies are intelligent animals, and the most experienced handlers know well that they need guidance in training. A steady and supportive approach will be productive, proving the Koolie's adaptability in diverse situations when given time.|$|E

Undergraduate students mostly interact with the collection through their classes; aside from that most of their experiences with this collection come from the public sculptures around campus.|$|E
25|$|Vector {{graphics}} formats are complementary to raster graphics. Raster graphics is {{the representation}} of images as an array of pixels and is typically used for {{the representation of}} photographic images. Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> both formats come together. An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology {{and the relationship between}} them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools.|$|E

25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> {{it may be necessary to}} restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> {{the laws of nature}} assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E

500|$|By 1972, {{after being}} a {{performer}} for nearly ten years, Morrison began experiencing stage fright when performing for audiences of thousands, {{as opposed to}} the hundreds as he had experienced in his early career.

He once said in an interview about performing on stage, [...] "I dig singing the songs but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> it's pretty agonising for me to be out there." [...] After a brief break from music, he started appearing in clubs, regaining his ability to perform live, albeit with smaller audiences.|$|E

He lives in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom in a moai situated between SpongeBob SquarePants' pineapple house and Patrick Star's rock. Squidward detests his neighbors for their perpetual laughter and boisterous behavior, though SpongeBob and Patrick are oblivious to Squidward's animosity towards them and regard him as a friend, [...] though <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> {{at least one of}} them is slightly aware of it, notably in the episode [...] "SB-129" [...] when Patrick voiced suspicion and was beginning to believe Squidward's hatred of them was real.|$|E

Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> things like that are revealing and entertaining and I kind of felt it was a bit gimmicky on this record." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's climatic battle {{sequence}} {{takes place}} through the nine worlds {{by the use}} of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we {{wanted to do was to}} make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly.

500|$|Some critics, such as James Berardinelli, saw a {{fundamental}} {{weakness in the}} film: the [...] "overemphasis on story may be a mistake, because <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> Licence to Kills narrative bogs down." [...] Berardinelli gave the film three {{out of a possible}} four stars, adding [...] "Licence to Kill may be taut and gripping, but it's not traditional Bond, and that, as much as any other reason, may explain the public's rejection of this reasonably well-constructed picture." [...] Raymond Benson, the author of nine Bond novels, said of the film: [...] "It boggles my mind that Licence to Kill is so controversial. There's really more of a true Ian Fleming story in that script than in most of the post-60s Bond movies." [...] John Glen has said Licence to Kill [...] "is among my best Bond films, if not the best".|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} tenet of attachment {{theory is that}} an infant needs to develop a relationship {{with at least one}} primary caregiver for the child's successful social and emotional development, and in particular for learning how to effectively regulate their feelings. Any caregiver is equally likely to become the principal attachment figure if they provide most of the child care and related social interaction. In the presence of a sensitive and responsive caregiver, the infant will use the caregiver as a [...] "safe base" [...] from which to explore. It should be recognized that [...] "even sensitive caregivers get it right only about 50 percent of the time. Their communications are either out of synch, or mismatched. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> parents feel tired or distracted. The telephone rings or there is breakfast to prepare. In other words, attuned interactions rupture quite frequently. But the hallmark of a sensitive caregiver is that the ruptures are managed and repaired." ...|$|E

Gowariker believed Roshan possessed the regal bearing and physique required {{to play the role}} of a king. For the role, Roshan learned sword-fighting and horse-riding, and also took Urdu lessons. Jodhaa Akbar was an economic success and earned [...] worldwide.

500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Natasha discovers Andrew is {{cheating}} on her with Summer. Natasha is hurt and angry and she lies to Andrew about being pregnant. Of Natasha's rash decision, Novakovic explained [...] "She is hurt and the whole cheating thing has really crushed her. She feels like the fool, no one goes behind her back.

Novakovic insisted that Natasha is making the plan up as she goes along. She has not thought it out or how the whole situation might end. Her main goal is to keep Andrew and Summer apart because they betrayed and hurt her. Natasha and Andrew attend a pre-natal class together and they get on quite well.
