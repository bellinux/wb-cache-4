5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern Hemisphere (<b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> in the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E
5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. When <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided {{they have the}} generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E
60|$|As it chanced on that stormy morning <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> {{strongly}} towards <b>the</b> mainland.|$|R
60|$|When I came {{to think}} of it the man <b>was</b> right; <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> off <b>the</b> land.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> as furiously as ever, and {{now from}} a {{distance}} came the low rumble of thunder.|$|R
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> towards the animals, indicating {{the sense of}} smell {{is more important than}} sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E
60|$|When Dave awoke, it {{was with}} a start. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> half a gale and the rain was falling.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> other way, {{but as a}} {{sergeant}} {{went up to the}} fire in obedience to the general's order, he said:-- ...|$|R
60|$|The {{lieutenant}} was not mistaken. In an hour <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> in furious gusts, {{and the sea}} breaking {{heavily in}} the little bay.|$|R
5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> from {{one side or the}} other. When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b> Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E
500|$|The surface {{air that}} flows from these {{subtropical}} high-pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected {{toward the west}} in both hemispheres by the Coriolis effect. [...] These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. [...] Because winds are named for the direction from which <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing,</b> these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the Southern Hemisphere. The trade winds of both hemispheres meet at the doldrums.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> briskly with them, and {{the tide}} running strong, {{and at a}} great pace they passed the ships lying at anchor.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> strongly, yet Andy {{measured}} the distance well and kicked the goal, amid a cheering {{that could be}} heard half a mile.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> a regular gale on the bay. It took off Tom's cap, {{and in a}} twinkle the {{headgear}} was out of sight.|$|R
2500|$|Leeway Angle (...) : The leeway drift {{direction}} {{minus the}} direction towards which <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> with a deflection {{to the right}} of downwind being positive and to the left being negative. A leeway angle of zero degrees indicates that the craft drifts directly downwind. See figure 1 and figure 2.|$|E
2500|$|Energy {{harnessed}} by {{wind turbines}} is intermittent, {{and is not}} a [...] "dispatchable" [...] source of power; its availability is based on whether <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing,</b> not whether electricity is needed. Turbines can be placed on ridges or bluffs to maximize the access of wind they have, but this also limits the locations where they can be placed. In this way, wind energy is not a particularly reliable source of energy. However, it can form part of the energy mix, which also includes power from other sources. Notably, the relative available output from wind and solar sources is often inversely proportional (balancing). Technology is also being developed to store excess energy, which can then make up for any deficits in supplies.|$|E
60|$|O, what a nice, smooth {{floor to}} dance upon! <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> on the waving reeds, <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> {{on the heart}} of man.|$|E
60|$|Leaving {{the board}} as a silent monument, the four {{continued}} {{on their way}} northward. Again <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> from <b>the</b> west, and they calculated that {{it was on the}} increase.|$|R
60|$|It was now {{intensely}} {{cold and}} <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> almost a gale. He was glad {{when he reached}} something of a hollow, where he could crouch down and regain his breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a sound," [...] I muttered, [...] "I fancied {{that it was}} a cry. But I {{could not}} tell. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing,</b> and <b>the</b> sea and rain! No, I could not tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] Kate answered. [...] "Can't {{you feel}} the spray on your cheeks? <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> it high up above the beach. Let me go first again. There is an inlet here. Be careful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Rick," [...] said Mr. Jarndyce, poking the fire, [...] "I'll take an oath it's {{either in}} the east or going to be. I am always {{conscious}} of an uncomfortable sensation now and then when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> in the east." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and they}} are likely to succeed, doctor, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> this way. Half the native houses are roofed with palm leaves, and will burn like tinder. Our only chance now is to drive the blacks out {{altogether}} and then fight the fire." ...|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> from <b>the</b> west, {{at about}} 25 {{miles per hour}} up the river, and so the {{sailboat}} had to tack {{back and forth across}} the river to make progress against <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> more furiously than ever. Up {{over the}} fields came the roar and {{crash of the}} surges on the outside shore. The Harbour {{to the east of}} Bayside was rough and stormy.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{when you}} came down here," [...] {{proceeded}} Mr. Skimpole, [...] "it was a fine day. The sun <b>was</b> shining, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing,</b> <b>the</b> lights and shadows were passing across the fields, the birds were singing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Colonel! I {{expected}} to find you at home to-night. The weather has been miserable for hunting {{and it is not}} getting any better. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> from the northwest and a storm is coming," [...] said Captain Boggs, a fine, soldierly looking man.|$|E
6000|$|We {{were two}} daughters of one race: [...] She was the fairest in the face: [...] <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> in turret and tree. [...] They were {{together}} and she fell; [...] Therefore revenge became me well. [...] O the Earl was fair to see! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do I think?" [...] cried Dan, who was Ralph's senior by six years. [...] "I think you'll {{become a}} second Davy Crockett or Dan'l Boone {{if you keep}} on. It's a wonder the deer let you come so close. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> toward the stream." ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{returned}} {{over the}} moors in <b>the</b> evening, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> in short, angry puffs, {{and the western}} horizon was heaped with sombre clouds which stretched their long, ragged tentacles {{right up to the}} zenith.|$|R
60|$|After dinner, {{when the}} sun was low behind the mountains, Geddie walked on the little strip of beach under <b>the</b> cocoanuts. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> mildly landward, and {{the surface of the}} sea was rippled by tiny wavelets.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no one}} about, for <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> {{with such}} fury that few cared to venture out of doors, and the boys {{therefore}} started back along the road by which they had come, without being observed.|$|R
