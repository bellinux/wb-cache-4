5|$|In July 1947—three {{months after}} Jackie Robinson made {{history with the}} Brooklyn Dodgers—Doby broke the MLB color barrier in the American League when he signed a {{contract}} to play with Bill Veeck's Cleveland Indians. Doby was {{the first player to}} go directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majors</b> from the Negro leagues. A seven-time All-Star center fielder, Doby and teammate Satchel Paige were the first African-American players to win a World Series championship when the Indians took the crown in 1948. He helped the Indians win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant in 1954, finished second in the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award voting and was the AL's RBI leader and home run champion.

He won the Golden Spikes Award in 2008 and was selected by the Giants with the fifth overall pick in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. Posey made his major league debut on September 11, 2009. After starting the 2010 season in the minor leagues, he was called {{back up to the}} major leagues in May.

In 2010, he became their everyday center fielder and leadoff hitter, winning the Willie Mac Award {{and helping the}} team win its first World Series since 1954. After the 2011 season (in which Torres battled injuries and lost playing time in September), he {{was traded to the}} New York Mets. He spent one season with the Mets, starting in center field for the most part except for a stretch in which he platooned with Kirk Nieuwenhuis, before re-signing with the Giants in 2013. He was used in a platoon split with Gregor Blanco in 2013 before suffering a season-ending Achilles injury in August. After going unsigned to begin 2014, Torres signed a minor league deal with the Boston Red Sox in June, but opted out of his contract in late July after not getting called up.|$|E
5|$|McLaughlin {{split the}} 1978 season between {{the major leagues}} and minors. McLaughlin made his season debut with Seattle on April 25, against the California Angels.

With the San Jose Missions, who were the Mariners Triple-A {{affiliate}} at the time, he went 5–2 with a 3.50 ERA, and 52 strikeouts in eight games, all starts. Two of those starts were complete games. McLaughlin was called back up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majors</b> in July after pitcher John Montague was placed on the disabled list.
