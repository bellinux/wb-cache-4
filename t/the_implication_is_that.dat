5|$|An {{alternative}} hypothesis suggest that lenticulae are actually small areas of chaos {{and that the}} claimed pits, spots and domes are artefacts resulting from over-interpretation of early, low-resolution Galileo images. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the ice is too thin to support the convective diapir model of feature formation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E

5000|$|The Perry Mason show (1957-1966) {{occasionally}} made {{reference to}} Palmdale, particularly when Paul Drake was given an investigatory assignment. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Palmdale <b>was</b> a great distance from Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|Parliament {{was most}} profoundly {{affected}} by this constitutional adjustment. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Parliament {{would no longer be}} involved {{in the formation of the}} Executive. They became two separate arms of government.|$|R
5|$|Excavation {{evidence}} {{from all the}} imperial borders which suggests that late forts were designed to accommodate much smaller garrisons than their predecessors from the Principate. Where such sites can be identified with forts listed in the Notitia, <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the resident units were also smaller. Examples include the Legio II Herculia, created by Diocletian, which occupied a fort just one-seventh {{the size of a}} typical Principate legionary base, implying a strength of c. 750 men. At Abusina on the Danube, the Cohors III Brittonum was housed in a fort only 10% the size of its old Trajanic fort, suggesting that it numbered only around 50 men. The evidence must be treated with caution as identification of archaeological sites with placenames in the Notitia is often tentative and again, the units in question may be detachments (the Notitia frequently shows the same unit in two or three different locations simultaneously). Nevertheless, the weight of the archaeological evidence favours small sizes for frontier units. Archaeological evidence suggests that the army in Britain in ca. 400 just one-third its size in 200 (17,500 effectives versus 55,000).|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} final {{contract}} with delle Croci was in 1516 whereas Cairano was definitively dead in 1517: if Cairano indeed worked on the monument, it can be deduced from the documents {{that he would not}} have had sufficient time to finish it completely within the period, and consequently a large part of it must have been done before this date. This means admitting Cairano's involvement prior to 1516, which is not attested in the documents. Indeed, the same contract of 1516 asserts that the work was incomplete when installed in the church; it is unknown what its condition was at the time; and the remains of Bernardino Martinengo were already housed in it from the previous year. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the progress on the monument may have been near completion, at least in the structure and architectural components. The incompleteness alluded to in the documents of 1516 likely refer to the decorative inserts of various types, including the bronzes definitively due to della Croci.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Eurymedon {{has been}} dated to 469 BC by Plutarch's anecdote about the Archon Apsephion (469/468 BC) {{choosing}} Cimon {{and his fellow}} generals as judges in a competition. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Cimon had recently achieved a great victory, and the most likely candidate is Eurymedon. However, since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred after the Athenian siege of Naxos (but before the Siege of Thasos), the date of Eurymedon is clearly constrained by the date of Naxos. Whilst some accept a date of 469 or earlier for this Naxos, another school of thought places it as late as 467 BC. Since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred before Thasos, the alternative date for this battle would therefore be 466 BC. Modern historians are split, some supporting 469 BC as the most likely date, and others opting for 466 BC.|$|E
50|$|Marginal utility as {{the source}} of value meant that the {{perceived}} need for an object was seen to be dictating the value, on an individual rather than a general level. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> individual mind is the source of economic value.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Omega clouds menace {{the entire}} galaxy, {{and the only}} way to escape them is to leave the galaxy entirely. In fact, the cycle of the clouds meant <b>that</b> they would <b>be</b> upon Earth in just 1,000 years.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Irish Catholics had no {{political}} {{status in the}} country. Many of them supported the Nationalist Party that chose a policy of abstentionism between 1921 and 1965, resulting in {{a large majority of}} Protestant members. They also alleged that local gerrymandering had increased since 1921.|$|R
5|$|The Aboriginal group {{forms the}} inner centre {{piece in the}} tondo of both bowls. As the same image was used for both bowls, <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Chinese ceramic {{painters}} were copying from the same drawing and finishing {{them at the same}} place and time. The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club, shield and spears, one woman with a baby on her shoulders – standing and turned slightly away {{from the rest of the}} figures – and another woman cowed by the men. This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony. As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet. The engraving is entitled Port Jackson, Nlle Hollande. Ceremonie preliminaire d'un mariage, chez les sauvages (ceremony before a marriage among the natives, Port Jackson, New Holland). Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin.|$|E

40|$|In future, {{professionals}} {{may lack}} {{the option to}} choose {{not to engage in}} learning activities over the lifespan” (Gooler, 1990). <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> one’s professional occupational preparation can become obsolete in a matter of years.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> an {{increase}} in the proportion of pregnant women who register at antenatal clinics, male involvements at the antenatal clinic, and the number of visits to the antenatal clinic yield the corresponding increase of the uptake of IPT 2 by 0.5 %, 0.5 %, and 0.1 %, respectively, with the other variables constant.|$|R
25|$|Covered target: The {{assistant}} {{is covered}} {{so that the}} thrower or archer cannot see exactly where they are. The covering is made of paper or some other flimsy material so that knives or arrows will pass through it. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the thrower or archer must estimate {{the position of the}} assistant using memory and other indirect guides and aim on that basis.|$|E
25|$|In 1675, Huygens {{patented}} {{a pocket}} watch. The watches which {{were made in}} Paris from c. 1675 and following the Huygens plan are notable for lacking a fusee for equalizing the mainspring torque. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Huygens thought that his spiral spring would isochronise the balance, {{in the same way}} that he thought that the cycloidally shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronise the pendulum.|$|E
25|$|Blind: The thrower or archer wears a blindfold. Generally the {{assistant}} first guides the blindfolded impalement artist into position facing towards the target board. The assistant then stands in place against {{the board and}} gives an audible signal to commence the stunt. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the impalement artist then has to aim {{on the basis of}} where they remember the target to be. There is a trick behind this stunt and budding impalement artists are warned not to attempt it unless coached by an experienced professional.|$|E
50|$|Forty {{years after}} Feltrinelli died, however, {{previously}} suppressed forensic reports surfaced in Corriere della Sera, arguing Feltrinelli had been mugged and later {{tied to the}} pylon before the bomb <b>was</b> detonated. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he had <b>been</b> killed and framed by Italian or Israeli security police. Others have speculated Feltrinelli was murdered by the KGB.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s, {{relevance}} {{became a}} fashionable buzzword, meaning roughly 'relevance to social concerns', such as racial equality, poverty, social justice, world hunger, world economic development, and so on. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> some subjects, e.g., {{the study of}} medieval poetry {{and the practice of}} corporate law, were not worthwhile because they did not address pressing social issues.|$|R
5000|$|A {{news item}} in the Canadian Medical Association Journal {{expressed}} concern that promotional material for the diet showed people eating high-calorie food such as hamburgers and chips, and that this could encourage binge eating since <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> [...] "if you fast two days a week, you can devour as much junk as your gullet can swallow during the remaining five days".|$|R
25|$|Aerotel's patent {{was found}} to relate to a {{patentable}} invention in principle because {{the system as a}} whole was new in itself, not merely because it is to be used for the business of selling phone calls. While this system could be implemented using conventional computers, the key to it was a new physical combination of hardware. The judge felt that this was clearly more than just a method of doing business as such. The method claims were construed as relating to a use of the new system and were also deemed to relate to a patentable invention in principle. The additional questions of whether the claimed invention was novel and involved an inventive step were not considered directly by the judge, although <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the invention was at least novel.|$|E
25|$|As {{the show}} is about to leave one stand, Special Agent Gregory of the FBI {{intercepts}} Brad, asking whether the circus doctor looks like the photograph of a man he is hunting (the photo is of Buttons without makeup). Having never seen Buttons without makeup, Brad doesn't recognize {{the man in the}} photo. The detective boards the train to continue his investigation. Brad mentions this to Buttons, who tells him that Sebastian has feeling in his injured hand – a sign that his disability is not permanent. Brad makes the connection between Buttons and the fugitive doctor and comments that the police will be taking fingerprints at the next stand. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Buttons should make himself scarce until the detective leaves the show to search elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|These {{studies of}} the timing between actions and the {{conscious}} decision bear upon {{the role of the}} brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears after the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision before the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset. However, these authors also found that awareness of action was anticipatory to activity in the muscle underlying the movement; the entire process resulting in action involves more steps than just the onset of brain activity. The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> banks <b>were</b> less {{competitive}} {{during that period}} than in subsequent years due to tight regulations that limited the formation and location of banks as well as restrictions on interest rates <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> charged or paid. As a result, bankers had [...] "power and prestige ... while profits were steady and certain". [...] These regulations were loosened in the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|You Ruo {{spoke from}} profundity {{the idea of}} the oneness of the ruler and the people in his advice to Duke Ai. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Duke's {{proposal}} to increase the taxation was due to the insufficiency of his revenues for state expenditure; to insure the sufficiency of state expenditure, then, what could take precedence over measures to insure sufficiency for his people? ...|$|R

500|$|The {{frame of}} the air-tractor sledge {{remained}} on the ice at Boat Harbour where Bickerton had left it. The last expedition to Cape Denison to see the frame was in 1976; the next expedition, in 1981, could find no trace of it. The ice in that location does not move, and <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the frame sank through the ice. [...] It is therefore possible the frame is still there.|$|E

"Actually, it's part of {{its rich}} {{heritage}} of leaping in to some horrific subject without any background or build-up at all. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Tony, the villain, had been grooming the child for some time {{before he went to}} prison, when she was only 12. But such a thing really would be too real, and too controversial, so the viewer only gets to see the result of those hinted-at dark machinations.|$|E
50|$|Daikaiju (mighty kaiju), {{specifically}} {{meaning the}} larger variety of monsters. Translates to large strange beast. The literal translation {{is about a}} size difference between a kaiju and a daikaiju however, <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> daikaiju <b>is</b> a greater beast. The exact definition of what determines a kaiju from a daikaiju is debated. Now this term was use for the most powerful kaiju, the prefix dai- emphasizing great power or status.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{presents}} {{the case that}} the legal culture in many ways undergirds the priestly model 2 ̆ 7 s hegemony over the therapeutic relationship between a woman and her doctor. To the extent that law provides this fundamental support, it legitimizes the mistreatment of women, especially with respect to their reproductive health. <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> movement toward a more just legal culture necessitates the extirpation of this support...|$|R
50|$|Media {{treatment}} of CFS {{has often been}} controversial; in November 1990, the magazine Newsweek ran a cover story on CFS which, although supportive of an organic cause of the illness, also featured the term Yuppie Flu. Reflecting a stereotype that CFS mainly affected yuppies, <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> CFS <b>was</b> a form of burnout.
