5|$|And matters {{continued}} {{thus for}} a considerable time. But a sedition and civil war came upon <b>the</b> <b>wretched</b> people and turned their cruelty toward us against one another. So we breathed {{for a little while}} as they ceased from their rage against us. But presently the change from that milder reign was announced to us, and great fear of what was threatened seized us.|$|E
5|$|Since this Life first {{appeared}} in McClure's Magazine not one important statement as of fact in it has been disproved or even seriously questioned. It {{is a product of}} much and highly intelligent labor, and were Christian Scientists open to argument or amenable to reason <b>the</b> <b>wretched</b> cult would not have survived its publication for a single month. It is unanswerable and conclusive, and nobody who has not read it can be considered well-informed as to the history or nature of Eddyism.|$|E
5|$|Neutral Denmark was {{invaded by}} Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940, and was {{occupied}} {{for the remainder}} of World War II. Food shortages, communication restrictions, and transportation closures followed. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served as officers in the Danish Army, they were interned as prisoners of war, but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months. Tikhon was imprisoned for a further month in 1943 after being arrested on charges of espionage. Other Russian émigrés, keen to fight against the Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism. On 4 May 1945, German forces in Denmark surrendered to the British. When economic and social conditions for Russian exiles failed to improve, General Pyotr Krasnov wrote to the Grand Duchess, detailing <b>the</b> <b>wretched</b> conditions affecting Russian immigrants in Denmark. She in turn asked Prince Axel of Denmark to help them, but her request was refused.|$|E
6000|$|Julian cordially {{agreed with}} her. [...] "I believe I should," [...] he said, quietly. [...] "All sinners, my dear aunt, {{are more or}} less miserable sinners. Nero must have been one of <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> of mankind." ...|$|R
6000|$|Arthur {{answered}} gravely, 'It's no joking matter. I {{have been}} all day at the garden wall, waiting to see her again! It depends on Miss Haldane to make me the happiest or <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> man living.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would you think, {{to look at}} me," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "that I am <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> girl living? It's true, Godfrey. What greater wretchedness can there be than to live {{degraded}} in your own estimation? That is my life now." ...|$|R

25|$|During {{his search}} for Bill Carson, Angel Eyes stumbles upon an embattled Confederate outpost after a massive {{artillery}} bombardment. Once there, after witnessing <b>the</b> <b>wretched</b> conditions of the survivors, he bribes a Confederate soldier (Víctor Israel, dubbed by Tom Wyner) for clues about Bill Carson.|$|E
25|$|In 1876–77, Ganguly {{concentrated}} on <b>the</b> <b>wretched</b> {{conditions of the}} workers in the tea gardens of Assam. He published {{a series of articles}} on the Slave Trade of Assam in K. K. Mitra's nationalist newspaper Sanjibani. Later, he even took the matter to the forums of the Indian National Congress.|$|E
60|$|And {{what did}} I do next? I went away travelling; one of <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> men who ever carried his misery {{with him to}} foreign countries. Go where I might on the {{continent}} of Europe, the dreadful idea pursued me that Cristel might be dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it, and that's {{what makes}} it so infernally bad for me. Forgive me, won't you? Think of me, old fellow, as <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> ass you ever met, but not such a cad as this would make me!" [...] As Mainwaring stepped out from the {{moonlight}} towards him with extended hand, Bradley grasped it warmly.|$|R

25|$|Wright's {{life was}} {{detailed}} in two biographies, Sorry: <b>The</b> <b>Wretched</b> Tale of Little Stevie Wright by Jack Marx (1999) and Hard Road: The Life and Times of Stevie Wright by Glenn Goldsmith (2004). On 14 July 2005, the Easybeats, with Wright as a member, were {{inducted into the}} ARIA Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|And {{while their}} music has {{much in common}} with the Buzzcocks and the Sex Pistols, their {{backgrounds}} and lyrics do not... they see their shows as punk PowerPoint presentations, though few sales meetings are as raunchy and cruel as YP shows, where <b>the</b> <b>wretched</b> losers who come to see them are peppered with abuse, lectured on the wonders of laissez-faire capitalism and showered with dollar bills.|$|E
25|$|But at {{the same}} time there was still a strong Caravaggisti school {{represented}} in the period by the amazing candle-lit paintings of Georges de La Tour. <b>The</b> <b>wretched</b> and the poor were featured in a quasi-Dutch manner in the paintings by the three Le Nain brothers. In the paintings of Philippe de Champaigne there are both propagandistic portraits of Louis XIII' s minister Cardinal Richelieu and other more contemplative portraits of people in the Catholic Jansenist sect.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't tell me that, Mrs. Presty! I'm one of <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> men living, and I {{ask for the}} {{consolation}} {{of seeing}} my child. Kitty hasn't forgotten me yet, I know. Her mother can't be so cruel as to refuse. She shall fix her own time, and send me away when she likes; I'll submit to anything. Will you ask Catherine to let me see Kitty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--if {{you advise}} it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should have {{employed}} a careless friend, {{and if it}} should prove to have an indifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but I am <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> being in <b>the</b> world at a civil falsehood." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a very}} {{handsome}} equipage, and was in keeping with all the outward belongings of Miss Kingsbury, who mingled {{a sense of duty}} and a love of luxury in her life in very exact proportions. When her coupé was not standing before some of <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> doors in <b>the</b> city, it was waiting at the finest; and Clara's days were divided between the extremes of squalor and of fashion.|$|R
25|$|The anime/manga Deadman Wonderland {{features}} two albinos named Chan and En as bodyguards to {{the main}} antagonist of the series, the director of Deadman Wonderland named Hagire Rinichirou. They are twin brother and sister, and are incredibly loyal to Hagire, seeing him as a father figure and killing people who merely insult him. There is also a third albino, {{one of the main}} characters, named Shiro, who appears an innocent and complacent young girl, but has a cruel and psychopathic alter ego knows as <b>the</b> <b>Wretched</b> Egg, which is Hagire's lifetime obsession.|$|E
25|$|On 28 July 1847, Whyte {{recorded}} {{the neglect of}} his fellow passengers, who 'within reach of help' 'were to be left enveloped in reeking pestilence, the sick without medicine, medical skill, nourishment, or {{so much as a}} drop of pure water'. However, conditions on other Irish emigrant ships were still worse. Two Canadian priests who visited the Ajax described the holds of other vessels where they had been 'up to their ankles in filth. <b>The</b> <b>wretched</b> emigrants crowded together like cattle and corpses remain long unburied'. Whyte contrasted this with the condition of German immigrants arriving at Grosse Isle. These were all free of sickness, 'comfortably and neatly clad, clean and happy'. The Times also commented on the 'healthy, robust and cheerful' Germans.|$|E
25|$|Maidens sing a delicate, sentimental song ("On {{the blue}} Vistula") to {{entertain}} Marina as her chambermaid dresses her hair. Marina declares her preference for heroic songs of chivalry. She dismisses everyone. Alone, she sings of her boredom ("How tediously and sluggishly"), of Dmitriy, {{and of her}} thirst for adventure, power, and glory. The Jesuit Rangoni enters, bemoans <b>the</b> <b>wretched</b> state of the church, attempts to obtain Marina's promise that when she becomes Tsaritsa she will convert the heretics of Moscow (Russian Orthodox Church) to the true faith (Roman Catholicism), and encourages her to bewitch the Pretender. When Marina wonders why she should do this, Rangoni angrily insists that she stop short of nothing, including sacrificing her honor, to obey the dictates of the church. Marina expresses contempt of his hypocritical insinuations and demands he leave. As Rangoni ominously tells her {{she is in the}} thrall of infernal forces, Marina collapses in dread. Rangoni demands her obedience.|$|E
6000|$|Who shall say {{how soon}} these women may change places? The last has but two more stages—the {{hospital}} and the grave. How many females situated as her two companions are, and as {{she may have been}} once, have terminated <b>the</b> same <b>wretched</b> course, in <b>the</b> same <b>wretched</b> manner! One is already tracing her footsteps with frightful rapidity. How soon may the other follow her example! How many have done the same! ...|$|R

60|$|Three {{times each}} day did the odious trumpet sound the same notes of defiance. Thrice daily did the steel-clad Rowski come forth {{challenging}} the combat. The first day passed, {{and there was}} no answer to his summons. The second day came and went, but no champion had risen to defend. The taunt of his shrill clarion remained without answer; and the sun went down upon <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> father and daughter in all the land of Christendom.|$|R
25|$|While in France, Frantz Fanon {{wrote his}} first book, Black Skin, White Masks, an {{analysis}} of the impact of colonial subjugation on the African psyche. This book was a very personal account of Fanon’s experience being black: as a man, an intellectual, and a party to a French education. Although Fanon wrote the book while still in France, most of his other work was written while in North Africa (in particular Algeria). It was during this time that he produced his greatest works, A Dying Colonialism and <b>The</b> <b>Wretched</b> of the Earth. In it, Fanon lucidly analyzes the role of class, race, national culture and violence in the struggle for decolonization. In this work, Fanon expounded his views on the liberating role of violence for the colonized, as well as the general necessity of violence in the anti-colonial struggle. Both books established Fanon in the eyes of much of the Third World as one of the leading anti-colonial thinkers of the 20th century. In 1959 he compiled his essays on Algeria in a book called L'An Cinq: De la Révolution Algérienne.|$|E
500|$|Opponents of the Jacobins saw the Ventôse Decrees as {{a cynical}} ploy {{to appeal to}} the militant extreme left. Sincere or not, Saint-Just made impassioned {{arguments}} for them. One week after their adoption, Saint-Just urged that the Decrees be exercised vigorously, and hailed them for ushering in a new era: [...] "Eliminate the poverty that dishonors a free state; the property of patriots is sacred but the goods of conspirators are there for <b>the</b> <b>wretched.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wretched</b> are the powerful of the earth; {{they have the right to}} speak as masters to the governments who neglect them." ...|$|E
500|$|The sermon is {{properly}} titled [...] "A Sermon on <b>the</b> <b>Wretched</b> Conditions of Ireland". Its introductory passage from scripture comes from Psalms 144: 14–15 – [...] "That {{there be no}} complaining in our streets. Happy is the people that is in such a case." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{hurried off}} like fools, quite {{inflated}} with our victory, to try {{if we could}} not chase the Austrians out of Dresden. They made a mockery of us from the tops of their mountains. So I have withdrawn, like a bad little boy, to conceal myself, out of spite, in one of <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> villages in Saxony. And here the first thing will be to drive the Circle gentlemen (Reich's army) out of Freyberg into Chemnitz, and get ourselves soon to quarters, and something to live upon.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Theign scarce {{waited for}} his {{disappearance}} to turn in wrath to Lady Grace. [...] "I denounce <b>the</b> indecency, <b>wretched</b> child, of your public defiance of me!" ...|$|R
500|$|The bass recitative, [...] "" [...] (<b>The</b> <b>wretched</b> are confused), is {{accompanied}} by the strings. It changes to arioso during the middle section, which lets God respond to the pleas of the sinners: [...] "Ich muss ihr Helfer sein" [...] (I must be their helper). Even in the outer sections, the string writing enforces a certain rigidity of the rhythm.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon himself {{occupied}} Berlin, {{causing the}} king, queen {{and the rest}} of the royal family to flee, despite Louise's illness, in the dead of winter to Memel in the easternmost part of the kingdom. On the journey there, there was no food or clean water, and the king and queen were forced to share the same sleeping arrangements in [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>wretched</b> barns they call houses", according to one witness traveling with them.|$|E
500|$|Several commentators, {{most notably}} [...] and more {{recently}} , have interpreted the repeated quaver figures passed between different groups of instruments as [...] "unmistakably depict the gesture of breaking bread." [...] Spitta also felt that the detached notes, which subsequently accompany quite different text, added [...] "a tender, dreamy tinge" [...] to the movement. For [...] and subsequent commentators like , however, the motif represented the [...] "uncertain, tottering steps ... of <b>the</b> <b>wretched</b> ones who are being supported and led into the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I swear,' cried Mr Slyme, {{giving the}} table an {{imbecile}} blow with his fist, and then feebly leaning his head upon his hand, while some drunken drops oozed from his eyes, 'that I am <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> creature on record. Society is in a conspiracy against me. I'm the most literary man alive. I'm full of scholarship. I'm full of genius; I'm full of information; I'm full of novel views on every subject; yet {{look at my}} condition! I'm at this moment obliged to two strangers for a tavern bill!' ...|$|R
60|$|Fanny was passionate {{with the}} tea-cups and the bread {{as long as}} her passion lasted, and then protested that she was <b>the</b> <b>wretchedest</b> girl in <b>the</b> world, and she wished she was dead. After that, her crying became remorseful, and {{she got up and}} put her arms round her sister. Little Dorrit tried to stop her from saying anything, but she {{answered}} that she would, she must! Thereupon she said again, and again, 'I beg your pardon, Amy,' and 'Forgive me, Amy,' almost as passionately as she had said what she regretted.|$|R
