40|$|This paper aims {{to model}} and {{investigate}} the discrete {{urban road network}} design problem, using a multi-objective time-dependent decision-making approach. Given a base network made up with <b>two-way</b> <b>links,</b> candidate link expansion projects, and candidate link construction projects, the problem determines the optimal combination of one-way and <b>two-way</b> <b>links,</b> the optimal selection of capacity expansion projects, and the optimal lane allocations on <b>two-way</b> <b>links</b> over a dual time scale. The problem considers both the total travel time and the total CO emissions as the two objective function measures. The problem is modelled using a time-dependent approach that considers a planning horizon of multiple years and both morning and evening peaks. Under this approach, the model allows determining the sequence of link construction, the expansion projects over a predetermined planning horizon, the configuration of street orientations, and the lane allocations for morning and evening peaks in each year of the planning horizon. This model is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem with mathematical equilibrium constraints. In this regard, two multi-objective metaheuristics, including a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a multi-objective B-cell algorithm, are proposed to solve the above-mentioned problem. Computational results for various test networks are also presented in this paper. postprin...|$|R

We explore this <b>two-way</b> <b>link</b> in settings in which aspirations and income (and the distribution of income) evolve jointly.

These general results arise by transformation from very simple properties of the familiar Azzalinitype skew-symmetric distributions. They specialise again to relationships between R-symmetric and log-symmetric distributions, between various models related to the inverse Gaussian and Birnbaum–Saunders distributions, relationships involving the sinh–arcsinh transformation, and others. Simple random variate generation is a practical consequence of these relationships...|$|R

We find that intermediate factors like R&D intensity and technology import intensity can impact positively the productivity of domestic firms. Furthermore, we find that bigger market size and highly productive domestic sectors are likely to attract more foreign capital into Indian industries. ...|$|E

In addition, it investigates the impact of liberalization on {{the dynamics of the}} FDI and GDP relationship. A long-run cointegrating relationship is found between FDI and GDP after allowing for heterogeneous country effects. The cointegrating vectors reveal a bidirectional causality between GDP and FDI for more open economies. For relatively closed economies, long-run causality appears unidirectional and runs from GDP to FDI, implying that growth and FDI are not mutually reinforcing under restrictive trade and investment regimes.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} that stresses the role of increasing returns and the division of labour, transportation technology, trade, and skill heterogeneity in explaining the emergence of cities, what determines their size, and why large cities are both more productive and more unequal than small towns. The model establishes a clear <b>two-way</b> <b>link</b> between city size and productivity: a larger city size increases productivity via a selection process; whereas higher productivity in-creases city size by providing incentives for rural-urban migration. This circularity may account for periods of massive urbanisation and productivity gains in which many new cities appear and existing cities grow. Our model also provides some first insights into the various relationships between skill heterogeneity, urbanisation, agglomeration, and income inequality...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Current {{wireless}} {{systems are}} one-way (similar to walkie-talkies), meaning that disjoint time or frequency segments {{are used to}} transmit and to receive. Realization of two-way wireless has challenged the research community for many years. This article 1 establishes the theory and presents practical realization of two-way (true full-duplex) wireless. In contrast to the widely accepted beliefs, it is shown that two-way wireless is not only feasible, but is fairly simple, with virtually no degradation in signal-to-noise-ratio 2. The innovation is in the antenna design and multiple levels for cancelling self-interference. Methods are developed to support Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) two-way transmission, and asynchronous <b>two-way</b> <b>links</b> (useful in networking applications). The developed hardware uses offthe-shelf components, antennas have a simple structure, are omnidirectional (can be directional, if needed), do not suffer fro...|$|R
