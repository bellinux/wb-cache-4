After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E

The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace.
