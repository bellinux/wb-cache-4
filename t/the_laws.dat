5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and {{the preface}} states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> to them. Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of Exodus is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon <b>the</b> <b>Laws</b> of Hammurabi.|$|E

5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of physics are {{the same for all}} observers.

40|$|As Betz {{observed}} in 1979, Paul never says that Christians {{are supposed to}} 'do' the Torah. This article seeks to develop the argument of omission in relation to Paul and <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> What else does he not say? According to Rom. 2. 17 - 29, Jews 'rely on' <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> 'boast' in <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> know God’s will through <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> are educated in <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> have light, knowledge and truth because of <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> are to 'do', 'observe' and 'keep' <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> on occasions 'transgress' <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> and possess <b>the</b> <b>law</b> as a 'written code'. Not only does Paul not say these things about Christians vis-à-vis <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> he shifts <b>the</b> focus from <b>the</b> <b>law</b> to something else using the same words and concepts.

5|$|Wulfhelm was {{translated}} from the Bishopric of Wells to be Archbishop of Canterbury in about 926. While he was archbishop, he was a frequent attendee of the royal court, and King Æthelstan of England says in his law code that Wulfhelm was consulted on the drafting of <b>the</b> <b>laws.</b> Wulfhelm also advised the king on the Ordinance on Charities issued by Æthelstan. One of the surviving manuscripts of Æthelstan's laws has an epilogue that stated that the law was declared and decided at a synod held at Grately where Wulfhelm was present. From other parts of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> issued by the king, it appears that Wulfhelm also presided at a council held at Thunderfield, at which the reeves of London pledged to keep the king's peace. The implication of the various accounts of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of Æthelstan is that Wulfhelm was highly involved in royal {{efforts to improve the}} law code.|$|E
5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
