5|$|In {{internal}} politics {{he attempted}} to strengthen {{the power of the}} monarchy, but this was mostly thwarted by the szlachta, who valued their independence and democratic powers. Władysław suffered continuing difficulties caused by the efforts of the Polish Sejm (parliament) <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> King's power and limit his dynastic ambitions. Władysław was fed up with the weak position of the king in the Commonwealth; his politics included attempting to secure a small, preferably hereditary territory – like a duchy – where his position would be much stronger.|$|E

As the Byzantine army approached, the Arabs tactically withdrew from Syria and regrouped all their forces at the Yarmouk plains close to the Arabian Peninsula, where, after being reinforced, they defeated the numerically superior Byzantine army.

Although Taglioni danced and the sets were retained, the translation was eventually carried out by Meyerbeer's friend Theodor Hell. Meyerbeer wrote additional ballet music for Taglioni for the Berlin production.|$|E

Abercrombie first landed an advance force <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> area where the forces were to disembark, and found it {{recently}} deserted; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the French in their hasty departure. The bulk of the army landed, formed into columns, and attempted to march up the west side of the stream that connected Lake George to Lake Champlain, rather than along the portage trail, whose bridges Montcalm had destroyed. However, the wood was very thick, and the columns could not be maintained.|$|E
5|$|The Keynesian Revolution was {{associated}} with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period.

After the war, Winston Churchill attempted <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.|$|E

40|$|Given a model M, {{consisting}} of communicating finite state machines (CFSMs), {{that represents the}} required behaviour of an implementation I, {{it is important to}} test I against M. This paper considers part of <b>the</b> testing process: <b>checking</b> <b>the</b> transition structure of I against that of M. One possible approach, <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> <b>the</b> transition structure of I, is to generate the product machine from M and then test the global transitions using standard finite state machine test techniques. This approach may, however, suffer from a combinatorial explosion. Instead, this paper introduces approaches that may allow local states and transitions of I <b>to</b> be <b>checked</b> without <b>the</b> generation of the product machine. The paper then considers the extension of these approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> of global states...|$|R

5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E
