5|$|The {{choice of}} Tromsø as a {{location}} for a telemetry stations {{was in part}} tied to the Tromsø Geophysical Observatory—which had been located in Tromsø since 1928—and the planned University of Tromsø. The Canadian Space Agency was at the time working on the Alouette 2 program and were seen by NDRE as a natural cooperation partner. The NASA's International Satellite for Ionospheric Studies was also being designed and NASA therefore decided <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>equipment</b> for a telemetry station in Tromsø to be operational by August 1966.|$|E
5|$|In April 2008, {{following}} the successful discovery of HMAS Sydney, several parties began {{calling for a}} dedicated search for Centaur. By the end of 2008, the Australian Federal and Queensland State governments had formed a joint committee and contributed A$2 million each towards a search, and tenders <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>equipment</b> (including the search vessel, side-scan sonar systems, and a remotely operated inspection submersible) were opened in February 2009, and awarded during the year. The search, conducted from the Defence Maritime Services vessel Seahorse Spirit and overseen by shipwreck hunter David Mearns, commenced during the weekend of 12–13 December 2009. The initial search area off Cape Moreton covered , with the search team given 35 days to locate and film the wreck before funding was exhausted.|$|E

It is known that they were also capable of building and operating mining equipment such as crushing mills and dewatering machines. [...] Large diameter vertical wheels of Roman vintage, for raising water, have been excavated from the Rio Tinto mines in Southwestern Spain. They were closely involved in exploiting gold resources such as those at Dolaucothi in south west Wales and in north-west Spain, a country where gold mining developed on a very large scale {{in the early part}} of the first century AD, such as at Las Medulas.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the request}} of death penalty {{commission}} chairman Gerry, Medico-Legal Society members; electrotherapy expert Alphonse David Rockwell, Carlos Frederick MacDonald, and Columbia College professor Louis H. Laudy, were given the task of working {{out the details of}} electrode placement. They again turned to Brown to supply the technical assistance. Brown asked Edison Electric Light <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>equipment</b> for the tests and treasurer Francis S. Hastings (who seemed {{to be one of the}} primary movers at the company trying to portray Westinghouse as a peddler of death dealing AC current) tried to obtain a Westinghouse AC generator for the test but found none was to be had. They ended up using Edison's West Orange laboratory for the animal tests they conducted in mid-March 1889. Superintendent of Prisons Austin E. Lathrop asked Brown to design the chair, but Brown turned down the offer. Dr. George Fell drew up the final designs for a simple oak chair and went against the Medico-Legal Society recommendations, changing the position of the electrodes to the head and the middle of the back. Brown did take on the job of finding the generators needed to power the chair. He managed to surreptitiously acquire three Westinghouse AC generators that were being decommissioned with the help of Edison and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, a move that made sure that Westinghouse's equipment would be associated with the first execution. The electric chair was built by Edwin F. Davis, the first [...] "state electrician" [...] (executioner) for the State of New York.|$|E

50|$|Pinguely and Haulotte {{were both}} {{taken over by}} the steel {{conglomerate}} Creusot-Loire. Creusot-Loire went bankrupt in 1984, and the future of Pinguely and Haulotte was in doubt. In 1985, both companies were bought by Pierre Saubot. Saubot had spotted a new market for aerial work platforms, and that work was assigned to Haulotte. Pinguely manufactured tower cranes in the meantime, mainly to fulfill a contract with the French Army. By the mid-90s, Haulotte was the leading manufacturer of aerial work platforms in France. The companies were kept separate through the 80s, and in 1995 became Pinguely-Haulotte. It was decided to concentrate on the aerial platform business, although Pinguely had won a contract worth FF300 million <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>equipment</b> to the French Army.|$|E
