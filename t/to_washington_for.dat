5|$|In August 1943, Smith and Strong flew to Lisbon via Gibraltar in {{civilian}} clothes, where {{they met with}} Generale di Brigata Giuseppe Castellano at the British embassy. While Castellano had hoped to arrange terms for Italy to join the United Nations against Nazi Germany, Smith was empowered to draw up an armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, but {{he was unable to}} negotiate political matters. On September 3, Smith and Castellano signed the agreed-upon text on behalf of Eisenhower and Pietro Badoglio, respectively, in a simple ceremony beneath an olive tree at Cassibile, Sicily. In October, Smith traveled <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> two weeks to represent Eisenhower in a series of meetings, including one with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park, New York, on 10 October.|$|E

5|$|On 4 January, several incidents, {{including}} a couple exchanges of gunfire, {{suggested that the}} embassy's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until the USS Guam and USS Trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers, at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January. The embassy had just six Marine guards, whose job was limited to protecting the chancery. Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived. The request was denied, but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning.|$|E
5|$|The Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, was {{instructed}} to prepare designs for pattern coins. Initially, Longacre worked with Liberty head designs such as were common at the time, but Snowden asked that a flying eagle design be prepared. This occurred as Booth's experiments continued; the first cent patterns with the flying eagle design were {{about the size of}} a quarter. To promote the new alloy, the Mint had 50 half cents struck in it, and had them sent <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> Treasury officials to show to officials and congressmen. In early November 1856, Longacre prepared dies in what would prove to be the final design, depicting a flying eagle on the obverse and a wreathed denomination on the reverse, in the size sought by Booth.|$|E
5|$|When Borah went <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> the Senate's regular {{session in}} December 1907, he was {{immediately}} {{a figure of}} note, {{not only for the}} dramatic events in Idaho, but for keeping his Western habits, including wearing a ten-gallon hat. It was then the custom that junior senators wait perhaps a year before giving their maiden speech, but at Roosevelt's request, in April 1908, Borah spoke in defense of the president's dismissal of over a hundred African American soldiers in the Brownsville Affair, their cause pressed by the fiery Ohio senator, Joseph B. Foraker. The soldiers were supposed to have shot up a Texas town, and Borah stated that their alleged actions were as wrongful as the murder of Steunenberg. The accusations were later deemed to be motivated by racism, and in 1972, long after the deaths of Roosevelt, Borah, and most of the soldiers, the dismissals were reversed.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{accompanied}} Khánh {{and reported}} the coup's progress at to Lodge roughly twice an hour. The US ambassador then relayed the information promptly <b>to</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>For</b> 90 minutes up until 06:00, Wilson reported that matters were on track. During {{the early stages}} of the coup, the Airborne Brigade command post was used as the headquarters of the rebels, before they set up at JGS headquarters after matters were stabilized. At 06:10 Khiêm arrived at the Airborne Brigade command post to join Khánh and 35 minutes later the IV Corps commander, General Nguyễn Hữu Có came to join the coup. Paratroopers and infantry cut off the roads into the city to prevent any would-be loyalist units from storming into the capital, but no such attempt was made. In total, 3,000 troops from eight battalions were involved in the coup and tanks were brought in from Mỹ Tho to the south.|$|E

Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season. On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history. Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence. After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.|$|E
5|$|Sherman was renominated for Congress in 1860 and {{was active}} in Abraham Lincoln's {{campaign}} for President, giving speeches on his behalf in several states. Both were elected, with Sherman defeating his opponent, Barnabas Burns, by 2,864 votes. He returned <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> the lame duck session of the 36th Congress. By February 1861, seven states had reacted to Lincoln's election by seceding from the Union. In response, Congress passed a constitutional amendment proposed by Representative Thomas Corwin of Ohio. Known today as the Corwin Amendment, it {{was an attempt to}} forge a compromise to keep the remaining slave states in the Union and entice the seceded states to return. Corwin's legislation would have preserved the status quo on slavery and prohibited any future amendment granting Congress power to interfere with slavery in the states. Sherman voted for the amendment, which passed both houses of Congress and was sent to the states for ratification. Few states ratified it, and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, outlawing slavery, rendered the compromise measure moot.|$|E

After recuperating in Florida, Dulles returned <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> work and radiation therapy. With further declining health and evidence of bone metastasis, he resigned from office on April 15, 1959.|$|E
25|$|After Congress had {{declared}} war on Mexico in 1846, President James K. Polk called for nine regiments of volunteers. Kemper and his friend Birkett D. Fry of Kanawha County traveled to the national capital on December 15, 1846, hoping to secure commissions in the First Regiment of Virginia Volunteers. After traveling to Richmond and back <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> more networking, Kemper learned {{that he had been}} appointed the unit's quartermaster and captain under Col. John F. Hamtramck. During the Mexican-American War, Kemper received favorable reviews and met many future military leaders, but his unit arrived just after the Battle of Buena Vista and mainly maintained a defensive perimeter in Coahuila province.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} now died down. In February 1838 Seminole chiefs Tuskegee and Halleck Hadjo approached Jesup {{with the}} proposition that they would stop fighting if {{they were allowed to}} stay south of Lake Okeechobee. Jesup favored the idea, foreseeing a long struggle to capture the remaining Seminoles in the Everglades, and calculating that the Seminoles would be easier to round up later when the land was actually needed by white settlers. However, Jesup had to write <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> approval. The chiefs and their followers camped near the Army while awaiting the reply, and there was considerable fraternizing between the two camps. Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett rejected the arrangement, however, and instructed Jesup to continue his campaign. Upon receiving Poinsett's response, Jesup summoned the chiefs to his camp, but they refused his invitation. Unwilling to let 500 Seminoles return to the swamps, Jesup sent a force to detain them. The Seminoles offered very little resistance, perhaps seeing little reason to continue fighting.|$|E
