Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation {{that there may have}} been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books that were in the cathedral library at the same <b>time</b> <b>do</b> not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.|$|E

25|$|The {{order of}} the program varies from club to club and country to country. Many noon-time clubs and other clubs that are {{constrained}} by <b>time</b> <b>do</b> their prepared speeches first, followed by Table Topics, followed by evaluations. Dinner clubs in the United States tend to do Table Topics first, and then everyone sits back and relaxes for the after-dinner prepared speeches. Alternatively, some clubs that are very time-conscious do prepared speeches first, then evaluations, saving Table Topics for last.|$|E

25|$|According to {{contemporary}} convention, Planck scale is {{the scale of}} vacuum energy, below which space and <b>time</b> <b>do</b> not retain any physical significance. This prescription mandates a general neglect of the Stoney scale within the scientific community today. Previous to this mandate, Hermann Weyl made a notable attempt to construct a unified theory by associating a gravitational unit of charge with the Stoney length. Weyl's theory led to significant mathematical innovations but his theory is generally thought to lack physical significance.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} acts was the reform regarding the central administration of the State, with which Crispi wished to strengthen the role of head of government. The bill aimed to separate the roles of the government from those of parliament, trying to untie the first by the political games of the second. The first point of the law was to give the cabinet the right to decide on the number and functions of the ministries. The prospect was also to keep the King (as well as provided the Albertine Statute) free to decide on the organization of the various ministries. Moreover the reform provided the establishment of the secretaries, who were supposed to help ministers and, at the same <b>time,</b> <b>do</b> them as spokesmen in parliament.|$|E
25|$|The redshifting for a {{particular}} quasar provides temporal (time) information about reionization. Since an object's redshift corresponds to the time at which it emitted the light, {{it is possible to}} determine when reionization ended. Quasars below a certain redshift (closer in space and <b>time)</b> <b>do</b> not show the Gunn-Peterson trough (though they may show the Lyman-alpha forest), while quasars emitting light prior to reionization will feature a Gunn-Peterson trough. In 2001, four quasars were detected (by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) with redshifts ranging from znbsp&=nbsp&5.82 to znbsp&=nbsp&6.28. While the quasars above znbsp&=nbsp&6 showed a Gunn-Peterson trough, indicating that the IGM was still at least partly neutral, the ones below did not, meaning the hydrogen was ionized. As reionization is expected to occur over relatively short timescales, the results suggest that the universe was approaching the end of reionization at znbsp&=nbsp&6. This, in turn, suggests that the universe must still have been almost entirely neutral at znbsp&>nbsp&10.|$|E

25|$|Two taped episodes {{had to be}} {{replaced}} as a contestant was related to a CBS employee and therefore ineligible {{to be on the}} show. The other contestants who appeared on that episode were awarded their prizes, but the episode was never aired and cannot be shown because of policies imposed by Barker over prizes on the show. There have been similar instances over the years of ineligible contestants appearing on stage, but these individuals were not edited out of the final broadcast since it was discovered in post-production. Usually, these episodes air with a disclaimer from the announcer added in post-production that one of the contestants was found ineligible (not specifying which one). Standards and Practices guidelines for game shows state that if an ineligible contestant wins a One-Bid and the other contestants on Contestants' Row at the <b>time</b> <b>do</b> not win a subsequent One-Bid, they are not considered to have made an appearance on the show and are immediately eligible again once the error has been discovered.|$|E
25|$|The name swamp adder is an invented one, and the {{scientific}} treatises of Doyle's <b>time</b> <b>do</b> not mention any kind of adder of India. To fans of Sherlock Holmes who enjoy treating the stories as altered accounts of real events, the true identity of this snake has been a puzzle {{since the publication of}} the story, even to professional herpetologists. Many species of snakes have been proposed for it, and Richard Lancelyn Green concludes the Indian Cobra (Naja naja) is the snake which it most closely resembles, rather than Boa constrictor, which is not venomous. The Indian cobra has black and white speckled marks, {{and is one of the}} most lethal of the Indian venomous snakes with a neurotoxin which will often kill in a few minutes. It is also a good climber and is used by snake charmers in India. Snakes are deaf in the conventional sense but have vestiges to sense vibrations and low-frequency airborne sounds, making it remotely plausible to signal a snake by whistling.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{how fast}} the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the {{children}} all drive to the beach {{in order to get}} the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (because since nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who tell him how they're glad that the land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to get some of the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some <b>time</b> <b>do</b> they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, who suddenly decided to listen to his father and come help the children kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).|$|E
