30|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, German {{classical}} economist Friedrich Liszt put forward {{the theory of}} national <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> system when studying the issue of national political and economic development. This is the earliest research on <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> from the national level. Some economists such as Christopher Freeman and Richard Nelson have combined Schumpeter’s “technical innovation” with Liszt’s “national system” theory to form the theory of national <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> systems (Freeman and Perez 1987). After introducing the concept of efficiency into <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> activities, <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> efficiency has become {{an important part of}} research in the field of <b>technological</b> <b>innovation.</b> With regard to the concept of <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> efficiency, scholars have conducted much in-depth discussions on it, and given various forms of definition from different angles. The concept of <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> efficiency is “technical innovation”. Kaukomen (1997) put forward the concept of <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> when studying the effect of R&D, mainly discussing the <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> {{from the perspective of the}} adaptability of R&D and industrial economy. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also put forward the concept of “technical innovation”, saying that it is necessary to establish national <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> systems or regional <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> systems to integrate <b>innovations</b> in <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> systems to improve national or regional <b>technological</b> <b>innovation.</b>|$|R

Firstly, on the basis of defining county agricultural <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> ability and the definition of index, according to the principle of purposefulness, scientificity, systematicness, integration of dynamic state and static state, integration of quantitativeness and qualitativeness and so on, we construct the multi-level measuring system of county agricultural <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> ability, including 4 first-level indices, namely <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> environment, <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> basis, <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> ability, and <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> efficiency; 15 second-level indices, such as technological policy, technological system mechanism, technological institution construction, ability of innovation subject, ability of industrial expansion, scale merit, technological contribution rate. Moreover, this system has 45 third-level indices. Then, by using unascertained mathematics method and AHM method, we establish the multi-level unascertained composite measuring model of county agricultural <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> ability index.

5|$|Bernstein {{states that}} Washington's lynching {{was a unique}} event because it {{occurred}} {{in a city with}} a reputation for progressiveness, but was attended by thousands of people who were excited by the brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale posits that Washington's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching, demonstrating its acceptance in modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how <b>technological</b> <b>innovations,</b> such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's condemnation of their actions.|$|E

5|$|Public {{condemnation}} {{of the use of}} breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal breaker, but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family. Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880, 18,000 working in 1900, 13,133 working in 1902, and 24,000 working in 1907. <b>Technological</b> <b>innovations</b> in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys, but adoption of the new technology was slow.|$|E
