5|$|At {{the start}} of 1974, the LCL had {{undertaken}} some progressive reforms.

Wilson and the new {{executive director of the}} LCL, John Vial were at the forefront, but the LM was optimistic about its future and refused unless the LCL changed leaders and allowed for explicitly separate urban and rural factions, which did not happen.|$|E

5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened <b>to</b> <b>broach.</b> In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E

On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.|$|E

There she landed 49 convicts, 31 marines and 23 civilians.|$|E
5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E

5|$|U-9, {{commanded}} by Kapit√§nleutnant Otto Weddigen, {{had been ordered}} to attack British transports at Ostend, but {{had been forced to}} dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir that struck her on the starboard side; the ship's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55. As Hogue approached her sinking sister, Captain Wilmot Nicholson realized that it had been a submarine attack and signalled Cressy to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water.

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1861, Carroll {{traveled}} to St. Louis to work with secret agent, Judge Lemuel Dale Evans, who had been appointed by Secretary of State William H.

She also gathered information from the head librarian, who was the brother of Confederate General Joe Johnston. She took military matters into her own hands when she initiated {{an interview with a}} riverboat pilot, Capt. Charles M. Scott, about the feasibility of the planned Union Mississippi River expedition. Scott told her that he and other pilots thought the advance ill-conceived because there were many defensible points on the Mississippi River that could be reinforced. It could take years just to open up the river to navigation by trying <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> those points. Carroll questioned Scott about the feasibility of using the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers for a Union invasion of the South. Scott provided Carroll with technical navigation details. Based on this information, Carroll wrote a memorandum to Assistant Secretary of War Thomas A. Scott and Attorney General Edward Bates in late November 1861, advocating that the combined army-navy forces change their invasion route from the Mississippi to the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics.

[...] He praised the bear scenes, which he thought was the episode's most [...] "amusing" [...] part. The review continued, [...] "The parts with the immigrants are also good, especially since they make their point deftly. Add to that the hilarious sound of 'American Apu' {{and this is a}} strong program." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered {{the best part of the}} episode to be when Homer tries to teach Apu American history, noting Homer's [...] "relevant and complex" [...] diagram of a stovepipe hat. Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "One of the most outspoken, and certainly angriest of episodes succeeds as a savage satire on the scapegoating of immigrants. Homer has never been so frighteningly dumb, although he does come through with a rousing liberal speech." [...] The episode is The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's third favorite episode of the show. The episode received a negative review from Dave Foster of DVD Times. He considered [...] "Much Apu About Nothing" [...] to be one of the season's most [...] "tiring" [...] episodes, [...] "mostly because Apu is not a strong enough character to focus an episode on no matter how much writer David Cohen develops him". Foster commented that the episode deals with a political issue which is [...] "difficult <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> in twenty minutes and is therefore reached and sewn up in a rather haphazard manner".|$|E
500|$|The 1/52nd, {{along with}} 1/43rd and 1/95th, {{returned}} to the Peninsula in June 1809, where they were designated the [...] "Light Brigade", {{under the command of}} General Craufurd. Alighting in Lisbon and hearing of the army's engagement with the French, they undertook a forced march to Talavera, arriving mere hours after the battle. The march was an extraordinary achievement, covering 42 miles in 26 hours, at a time when an infantry march of 15 miles a day was standard. Henceforth, the 1/52nd generally remained in advance of the army, as a forward party, a role which was to be theirs throughout much of the war. In February 1810, Portuguese Cazadores were added to Craufurd's brigade, creating the Light Division, the 1/52nd forming a brigade with 1st Cazadores and four companies from the 95th, under Lt-Col Barclay. While holding a forward outpost, the Light Division was involved in the Battle of the C√¥a, in July 1810, and took part in the Battle of Bussaco, where the Light Division held the left against the main French charge, which they successfully repulsed, inflicting high casualties; 1200 Frenchmen were killed, wounded or captured, while the Light Division suffered only 120 casualties. When Wellington's army retreated back to the Lines of Torres Vedras, late 1810, the Light Division acted as rearguard. The French were unable <b>to</b> <b>broach</b> the Torres Vedras defences, but engaged the British army in a number of small skirmishes, such as those fought by the Light Division, under the temporary command of Sir William Erskine, at Casal Novo ‚Äì where they unwittingly came upon 11 French divisions in the fog ‚Äì and Sabugal (April 1811), an engagement of which Wellington later wrote: [...] "I consider that the action that was fought by the Light Division [...] with the whole of the [...] 2nd Corps, to be the most glorious that British troops were ever engaged in." ...|$|E
