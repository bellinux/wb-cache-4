5|$|The Zytglogge's {{exterior}} was repainted by Gotthard Ringgli and Kaspar Haldenstein in 1607–10, {{who introduced}} the large clock faces that now dominate {{the east and}} west façades of the tower. The corner towerlets were removed again some time before 1603. In 1770–71, the Zytglogge was renovated by Niklaus Hebler and Ludwig Emanuel Zehnder, who refurbished the structure in order to suit <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> the late Baroque, giving the tower its contemporary outline.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} issue during Desha's tenure was his disdain for Horace Holley, president of Transylvania University. From the time Holley assumed {{the post of}} president in 1818, the university had risen to national prominence and attracted well-qualified and well-respected faculty members such as Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, Daniel Drake, Charles Caldwell, William T. Barry, and Jesse Bledsoe. However, Holley's New England Unitarian beliefs were too liberal for <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> many in Kentucky. Many called Holley an infidel and charged {{that he was a}} drinker and a gambler. He was criticized for spending time at the horse races and for furnishing his home with nude classical statues.|$|E

Many of them, such as The Traumatic Romance of Liang and Zhu (1926) and Lady Meng Jiang (1927), were popular, but not considered artistically worthy.|$|E

After Bilandic's tenure in office, newly elected Mayor Jane Byrne attempted {{to end the}} festival {{as well as many}} other programs associated with the former mayor. Many Chicagoans disapproved of Mayor Byrne's attempt to stop the festivities (although attendance at ChicagoFest had begun to wane). She and her successor, Mayor Harold Washington, dedicated more time and energy to promoting <b>the</b> <b>Taste,</b> slowly phasing ChicagoFest out in the process. Mayor Washington finally put an end to ChicagoFest when in 1983 it was moved from Navy Pier to Soldier Field and attendance continued to wane. <b>The</b> popularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Chicago has prompted other cities to spawn numerous offshoots and equivalents throughout the United States, such as <b>the</b> <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Champaign, CityFest in Detroit, <b>the</b> <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danforth in Toronto, <b>the</b> <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Kalamazoo, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Addison, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Denver, <b>Taste</b> in Dallas, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Madison, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Austin, <b>the</b> <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Peoria in Peoria, Illinois, and the Bite in Portland to name a few.

5|$|Though {{originally}} set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to {{the genre}} of French opera, particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence of vocal virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera to suit <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> a Parisian audience at the Académie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline. This reworking was given the title Orphée et Eurydice, and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice, {{once the}} new Cunard board had been constituted, turned his {{attention}} to the new cruise ship being built for the company. The ship, codenamed Q4, had been proposed and planned under the auspices of his predecessor, John Brocklebank. However, with the ship now approaching completion and requiring fitting out, it would fall to Smallpeice and his board to appoint interior and exterior designers and approve design schemes for the new ship. Smallpeice, having assessed a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, decided on significant alterations to the interior layout, abolishing the old three class layout and replacing it with a flexible layout which could be split into two classes for North Atlantic crossings and combined into a single class layout for cruising in the Caribbean. This new layout was expected to suit <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> American passengers, predicted to be the largest passenger group on the new liner.|$|E
5|$|Under Louis XII the courtesans of France {{settled in}} Blois from 1498 to 1515, {{and the city}} became {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of France. As a result, many people {{purchased}} residences in Blois and the Loire Valley. Named after Robertet's barony of Alluyes, construction of the Hôtel d'Alluye began in 1498 or 1500 and was completed in 1508. It was built during his tenure as secretary and notary to Louis XII, and a diplomatic document from the Republic of Florence described the hôtel as new in September 1508. The hôtel particulier is an example of French Renaissance architecture; this, coupled with its ornamentation, were intended to reflect <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> Robertet, who was well known for his artistic collections. One of the first examples of Renaissance architecture in Blois, the hôtel indicates the influence of the Quattrocento on him.|$|E

5|$|When Deep Purple's first line-up came {{together}} in 1967, {{there was a moment}} of transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, in line with the hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, image-driven, sex-celebrating glam metal {{emanating from}} Hollywood's Sunset Strip, spearheaded by Van Halen and {{followed}} by bands such as Mötley Crüe, Quiet Riot, Dokken, Great White, Ratt and W.A.S.P., quickly replaced other styles of metal in <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> many British rock fans. New Jersey act Bon Jovi and the Swedish Europe, thanks to their successful fusion of hard rock and romantic pop, also became very popular in the UK, with the former even headlining the 1987 Monsters of Rock Festival. Record companies latched on to the more polished glam metal subgenre over the NWOBHM bands, which maintained a fan base elsewhere in Europe, but found themselves crowded out of the UK and US markets {{by the success of}} these American groups. While the attention devoted to the NWOBHM bands waned, a new succession of far less mainstream metal subgenres began to emerge and attract many British metalheads. Power metal and thrash metal, both stemming from the NWOBHM and maintaining much of its ethos, were gaining critical acclaim and commercial success {{in the second half of}} the 1980s with their even faster and heavier sound. Bands such as Helloween, Savatage, Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax captured much of the market share of those metalheads who were not content with the sound or style of more mainstream, pop-oriented metal bands.|$|E
