5|$|The {{earthquake}} and its precursor tremor struck {{during the afternoon}} near an extremely populated area, with most buildings in the area already left in precarious conditions by previous earthquakes. It affected roughly 400,000 people directly, {{most of whom were}} estimated <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> at least strong (MM VI) shaking. Hospital officials confirmed at least 46 injuries after its occurrence; falling debris struck several people, while two others were left in critical condition. In the city centre, two workers had to be rescued from a collapsed church and were promptly hospitalised. The morning after, officials confirmed an elderly man had died after being knocked unconscious in a rest home when the earthquake struck. Mass casualties were avoided owing to a combination of building evacuations prompted by the weaker shock and an epicentre removed from populous areas.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third millennium BC, the Ninevite V culture flourished in Northern Mesopotamia and the Middle Euphrates region.

25|$|The city appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> {{an early}} decline, as {{evidenced}} by the relatively poor remains from the Christian era. The Byzantine era saw the area around the forum transformed into a fort; several important buildings were destroyed in order to provide the necessary materials for its construction. Dougga was however never completely abandoned, and for a long time, it was the site of a village populated by the descendents of the city’s former inhabitants, as is evidenced by the small mosque situated in the Temple of August Piety and the small bath dating to the Aghlabid period on the southern flank of the forum.|$|E

Maria would later tell her social worker Kimberly Clark that during the OBE she had {{observed}} a tennis shoe on the third floor window ledge to {{the north side of the}} building. Clark would go to the north wing of the building and by looking out of the window could see a tennis shoe on one of the ledges. Clark published the account in 1985. The story has since been used in many paranormal books as evidence a spirit can leave the body.|$|E
25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> and the effects these experiences have had on their lives. The study was conducted as an online survey with over 2,000 respondents {{from around the world}} participating. The results revealed that around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in a positive way. About 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or been touched by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E

25|$|One of Bowlby's main {{findings}} through his research with these children was that 17 {{out of the}} 44 thieves experienced early and prolonged separation (six months or more) from their primary caregiver {{before the age of}} five. In comparison, only two out of the 44 children who did not steal had experienced prolonged separation from their primary care giver before the age of five. More specifically, Bowlby found that 12 out of the 14 children were categorized as affectionless were found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> complete and prolonged separation before the age of five. These findings were important and brought more attention to the impact of a child's early environmental experiences on their healthy development.|$|E
25|$|By the early-to-mid-1st century AD, {{the growth}} of the Empire saw the {{establishment}} of glass working sites at locations along trade routes, with Cologne and other Rhineland centres becoming important glass working sites from the Imperial period, and Syrian glass being exported as far as Italy. During this period vessel forms varied between workshops, with areas such as the Rhineland and northern France producing distinctive forms which are not seen further south. Growth in the industry continued into the 3rd century AD, when sites at the Colonia Claudia Agrippinensis appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> significant expansion, and by the 3rd and early 4th centuries producers north of the Alps were exporting down to the north of Italy and the transalpine regions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} a number of Islamic ex-gay (i.e. people {{claiming}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> a basic change in sexual orientation from exclusive homosexuality to exclusive heterosexuality) groups aimed at attempting to guide homosexuals towards heterosexuality. A large body of research and global scientific consensus indicates that being gay, lesbian, or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment. Because of this, major mental health professional organizations discourage and caution individuals against attempting to change their sexual orientation to heterosexual, and warn that attempting to do so can be harmful.
