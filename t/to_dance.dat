5|$|Heine's prose {{passage in}} De l'Allemagne tells of supernatural young women called the Wilis. They have died before their wedding day and rise from their graves {{in the middle}} of the night <b>to</b> <b>dance.</b> Any young man who crosses their path is forced <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> to his death. In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that they hate men.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Wilis have cornered {{a terrified}} Hilarion. They use their magic {{to force him}} <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> until he is nearly dead, and then drown him in a nearby lake. Then they turn on Albrecht, {{sentencing}} him to death as well. He pleads to Myrtha for his life, but she coldly refuses. Giselle's pleas are also dismissed and Albrecht is forced <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> until sunrise. However, the power of Giselle's love counters the Wilis' magic and spares his life. The other spirits return to their graves at daybreak, but Giselle has broken through the chains of hatred and vengeance that control the Wilis, and is thus released from their powers. After bidding a tender farewell to Albrecht, Giselle returns to her grave to rest in peace.|$|E
