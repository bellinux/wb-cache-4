Evidence is at the verbal level (increased fluency, more frequent use of the target language, and reduced amounts of procedural talk), paralinguistic level (straighter posture, stronger voice quality) and in fewer nonfunctional behaviors (pencil <b>tapping,</b> <b>head</b> scratching) (Storch, 1998, 2008).|$|E

30|$|The {{evaluation}} of the primary implant stability is usually performed after placement. Some of the main methods include mobility test, resonance frequency analysis, and the measurements of the removal torque values and the insertion torque values (ITVs). In particular, the measurement of the removal torque values is an objective evaluation method, but its clinical application is difficult {{because it is an}} irreversible and invasive method. Mobility test is useful for the {{evaluation of}} an implant whose osseointegration was surely obtained, but {{there is a possibility that}} the primary stability could decrease by the impact of the <b>tapping</b> <b>head.</b> On the other hand, the measurement of ITVs and the measurement of implant stability quotient (ISQ) values by using a resonance frequency analyzer are non-invasive, convenient, and objective evaluation methods. Therefore, these methods are used for evaluation in various researches investigating the primary stability including immediate loading implants [8 - 11].|$|E
40|$|The {{perception}} of musical meter is fundamental for rhythm production and perception in much music. Underlying {{structures such as}} pulse, meter, and metrical subdivisions are often described as successive points in time. This paper investigates whether experienced musical meter may not only include such points in time, but also trajectories between the points–that is, metrical shapes. Previous studies {{have pointed out that}} {{there seems to be a}} relationship between musical meter and periodic body motion like foot <b>tapping,</b> <b>head</b> nodding and dancing. This paper investigates musical meter in music styles with an intimate relationship with dance, and whether metrical points and trajectories can be understood by investigating performers’ periodic body motion. Two motion capture studies form the empirical basis of this paper; first, a percussionist and a dancer performing Brazilian samba; second, a fiddler and two dancers performing Norwegian telespringar. The analysis showed that it seemed to be a relationship between the periodic fluctuation in audio amplitude and the performers’ periodic foot motion on sixteenth note level in samba. Furthermore, motion analysis revealed similar periodic shapes in both percussionist and dancer foot motion. In telespringar there seemed to be a relationship between the metrical beat level and the fiddler’s foot stamping. In addition, the beat duration pattern, as indicated by the fiddler’s periodic foot stamping, seemed to correspond to the shape of the dancers’ vertical body motion. The results support the view that there is a close relationship between musical meter and performers’ periodic body motion. This suggest that the underlying meter may not only include metrical points in time, but that each metrical beat/subdivision duration has a corresponding metrical trajectory with a certain shape. If this is the case, then perceivers’ and performers’ implicit knowledge of the underlying reference structure in samba and telespringar might incorporate knowledge about the underlying metrical shape...|$|E
