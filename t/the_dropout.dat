40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} dropouts from type- 2 diabetes (T 2 D) care in communal primary health care. Design: An observational study. Setting: In a Finnish city, {{patients with}} T 2 D {{who had not}} contacted the public primary health care system during the past 12 months were identified with a computer based search and contacted by a trained diabetes nurse. Subjects: Dropouts from T 2 D treatment. Main outcome measures: Demographic factors, laboratory parameters, examinations, medications, and comorbidities. Results: Of the patients with T 2 D, 10 % (n= 356) were dropouts and 60 % of them were men. Median HbA(1 c) was 6. 5 (QR for 25 % and 75 %: 6. 0, 7. 7) %, (45 [42, 61] mmol/mol). Of <b>the</b> <b>dropouts,</b> 14 % had HbA(1 c) 9. 0 % (75 mmol/mol), and these patients were younger than <b>the</b> other <b>dropouts</b> (mean age 54. 4 [SD 10. 8] years vs. 60. 6 [9. 4] years, p Conclusions: Ten percent of T 2 D patients were dropouts of whom those with a poor glycaemic control were younger than <b>the</b> other <b>dropouts.</b> BP and LDL cholesterol concentrations were non-optimal among the majority of <b>the</b> <b>dropouts.</b> Metformin was prescribed less frequently to <b>the</b> <b>dropouts</b> than is usual for T 2 D patients.

25|$|As a result, {{several generations}} of Franco-Ontarians grew up without formal {{education}} since <b>the</b> <b>dropout</b> rate for francophones was quite high during this period.

40|$|Dropouts {{have been}} a focus of the {{educational}} community for many years. It is widely believed that {{dropping out of school}} negatively effects the individual throughout his or her lifetime and bears negatively on the society at large as well. Extensive studies on <b>the</b> urban <b>dropout</b> support this claim. This study, however, examines these claims from a rural setting, rather than urban point of view. ^ Through in-depth document review and personal interviews, I reviewed data on family education background, enrollment history, scores on standardized achievement tests, marks earned from grade 6 to 12, retentions, special education, I. Q. scores, attendance and length of time in the school district. My interviews focused on <b>the</b> <b>dropouts</b> 2 ̆ 7 history with discipline, GED, jobs, groups and labeling, best and worst teacher, marks, extracurricular activities, pregnancy, emotional concerns, credits, and regrets. ^ Contrary to <b>the</b> research on <b>dropouts</b> in urban settings, I found rural dropouts presented themselves to be relatively well-adjusted contributors to society. They appeared happy and were working, getting married, having children, buying vehicles and homes, learning a trade and planning for their future. As relatively successful students for most of their years in school, <b>the</b> <b>dropouts</b> had also participated in extracurricular activities. ^ In conclusion, <b>the</b> rural <b>dropouts</b> in this study were not the failures that the related literature has described. Instead, <b>the</b> rural <b>dropout</b> could be perceived as quite successful. The rural environment not only accepted <b>the</b> <b>dropouts,</b> but welcomed them as contributing members of society. In fact, the favorable treatment in the world beyond school, coupled with the harsher treatment they received by teachers and personnel while in school, may have helped these students make the decision to drop out of school. ...|$|R

500|$|Kneale's concept {{concerned}} [...] "the {{world of}} the future, {{and a way of}} keeping the population happy without being active". According to Kneale, the notion for the play came from the [...] "worldwide dread of populations exploding out of all control" [...] leading him to devise a world where pornography hooks the population [...] "on a substitute for sex rather than the real thing and so keeping the population down". Kneale was also influenced by <b>the</b> <b>dropout</b> counterculture of the late 1960s, recalling [...] "I didn't like the Sixties at all because of the whole thing of 'let it all hang out' and let's stop thinking [...] which was the all too frequent theme of the Sixties which I hated". Dissatisfaction with the youth culture of the time was a preoccupation of Kneale's—in the mid-sixties he had worked on The Big, Big, Giggle, an unmade script about a teenage suicide cult, and following The Year of the Sex Olympics he returned to the theme of youth out of control in his 1969 play Bam! Pow! Zapp!, and in the fourth and final Quatermass serial in 1979. Many cultural icons of the youth movement, including members of The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Monty Python, were fans of Kneale's work. For The Year of the Sex Olympics Kneale extrapolated the possible consequences of the youth movement's desire for freedom from [...] "traditional" [...] cultural inhibitions, asking as the academic John R. Cook puts it, [...] "In a world of no limits, will the result quickly be apathy if there is nothing any more to get excited about, nothing precious or illicit to fight for in the teeth of the censor?".|$|E
