5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> number of weather elements into a small space on weather maps. This allows map users to analyze patterns in atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed & direction, cloud cover, precipitation, and other parameters. The most common station plots depict surface weather observations although upper air plots at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton, in his Principia Mathematica of 1687, {{proved that}} an object moving under the {{influence}} of gravity must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the conic sections, and he demonstrated how <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> comet's path through the sky to a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.|$|E
5|$|As the band's main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor was {{considered}} the only constant member and creative force within the group through much of its history. However, this changed in 2016 when Atticus Ross was introduced as a permanent member of Nine Inch Nails, alongside {{the announcement of the}} Not the Actual Events EP. Furthermore, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him onstage. These touring bands comprise a revolving lineup, and often rearrange songs <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> live setting. Nine Inch Nails often employs thematic visual elements to accompany on stage performances as well, which frequently include elaborate light shows.|$|E

5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a spell card (a Tarot card linked {{to one of the}} Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called the Velvet Room. In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a spell card's particular Persona family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> chosen Persona family.|$|E
5|$|On lap thirty-one, Buemi {{tried to}} pass Glock on the outside heading into turn three but lost control of his car under braking and rammed {{into the side of}} Glock. Buemi {{sustained}} a broken left, front suspension and front wing damage, causing him to retire. The incident called for the race's third safety car period. During the safety car deployment, most of the drivers made pit stops for intermediate tyres. Alonso, who was called in by Ferrari when Vettel changed his strategy, had a pit stop that proved problematic. He arrived into his pit box sideways after locking his tyres. One of his mechanics could not fit his front right wheel because he dropped a wheel nut; he was required <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> spare wheel nut onto the tyre, causing Alonso to be stationary for longer than usual. He lost third place to Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} {{formation}} lap, Heinz-Harald Frentzen stalled his Sauber whilst attempting {{to leave the}} grid {{and was forced to}} start from the pitlane. The other cars started from the grid in the order they were at the point the race was stopped. Michael Schumacher had a poor start and Gerhard Berger took the lead on track (but Schumacher still led the race overall due to the amount of time he was ahead of Berger before the race was stopped). Hill, from third, made contact attempting to overtake Schumacher at the Tosa corner, dropping Hill {{to the back of the}} field and was forced to make a pitstop in order <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> new nose cone. Hill battled back to finish in sixth position.|$|E

5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th {{century the}} native Welsh princes built {{a number of}} stone castles. The size of these varied {{considerably}} from smaller fortifications, such as Dinas Emrys in Snowdonia, to more substantial castles like Deganwy Castle and the largest, Castell y Bere. Native Welsh castles typically maximised the defensive benefits of high, mountainous sites, often being built in an irregular shape <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> rocky peak. Most had deep ditches {{cut out of the}} rock to protect the main castle. The Welsh castles were usually built with a relatively short keep, used as living accommodation for princes and nobility, and with distinctive rectangular watch-towers along the walls. In comparison to Norman castles the gatehouses were much weaker in design, with almost no use of portcullises or spiral staircases, and the stonework of the outer walls was also generally inferior to Norman built castles. The very last native Welsh castles, built in the 1260s, more closely resemble Norman designs; in the case of Dinas Brân including a round keep and Norman gatehouse defences.|$|E
5|$|Following the Canadian Grand Prix on 18 June, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours between 21–23 June {{to prepare for}} the upcoming French Grand Prix. Coulthard set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Arrows driver Jos Verstappen lost control of his car after suffering a mechanical problem and crashed into the barriers at turn two. Verstappen sustained neck strain and withdrew from testing. He was later passed fit to compete in the Grand Prix. Coulthard remained fastest on the second day. Fisichella damaged the underside of his car's chassis, limiting his testing time as Benetton made repairs to his car. Häkkinen was quickest {{on the final day of}} testing. Michael Schumacher stopped on circuit as his Ferrari engine failed, causing his team <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> new engine into the chassis. Ferrari went to their private testing facility, the Fiorano Circuit, on 27 June where test driver Luca Badoer shook down three Ferrari F1-2000 cars and also took part in pit stop practices.|$|E

Bruce Ismay.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} discussion is mostly presented {{in terms of}} linear functions {{but the use of}} least squares is valid and practical for more general families of functions. Also, by iteratively applying local quadratic approximation to the likelihood (through the Fisher information), the least-squares method may be used <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> generalized linear model.|$|E
25|$|Fixed-contour cuffs are {{designed}} to optimally fit one specific limb shape. Applying a fixed-contour cuff on a limb with a different shape {{will result in a}} distal gap. Fixed-contour cuffs cannot be adjusted <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> wide range of limb shapes. Variable-contour cuffs are better for non-cylindrical limb shapes, as explained below.|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} before, if {{a selected}} arc is an elliptic arc, the adjacent arcs are also elliptic arcs. Therefore, we can effectively <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> correct ellipse {{if we use}} those arcs. However, if we select a non-elliptic arc as an inlier and add adjacent outlier arcs <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>an</b> ellipse, we cannot <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> correct ellipse.|$|R
