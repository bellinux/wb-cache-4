Nevertheless, the annual North v South games were among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>popular</b> <b>and</b> competitive in the sport, running annually from 1849 until 1900 and intermittently thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>popular</b> <b>and</b> beloved {{kings of}} England, known as the Merry Monarch, in {{reference}} to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans.

The final line of the verse was probably the inspiration for the title of Lerner and Loewe's 1956 musical My Fair Lady. The tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants.|$|E

5|$|With the 19th century rise of {{nationalism}} and romanticism {{and the growing}} number of translations of the sagas, interest in the battle of Svolder increased outside of Iceland. Around 1830, the Faroese poet Jens Christian Djurhuus composed a ballad on the battle titled Ormurin langi, following Snorri's account. The ballad was well received and remains among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>popular</b> <b>and</b> well-known Faroese ballads.

5|$|During the Mongol {{invasion}} in 1240, the monastery {{is believed to}} have been damaged seriously. The Mongols damaged the cathedral and removed its gold-plated domes. The cloister subsequently fell into disrepair and there is no documentation of it for the following two and a half centuries. By 1496, the monastery had been revived and its name was changed from St. Demetrius' Monastery to St. Michael's after the cathedral church built by Sviatopolk II. After numerous restorations and enlargements during the sixteenth century, it gradually became one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>popular</b> <b>and</b> wealthiest monasteries in Ukraine. In 1620, Iov Boretsky made it the residence of the renewed Orthodox metropolitan of Kiev, and in 1633, Isaya Kopynsky was named a supervisor of the monastery.|$|E

His next series, Dragon Ball, {{would become one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>popular</b> <b>and</b> successful manga in the world. Having sold more than 240 million copies worldwide, it is the second best-selling manga of all time and is considered {{to be one of the}} main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Balls anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{the band}} {{released}} its self-titled debut album, {{which became a}} commercial and critical success, leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza festival. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. A follow-up record was released in 1996, with Evil Empire. The band's third album, The Battle of Los Angeles, followed in 1999, and in 2003, the album was ranked number 426 on the same list. During their initial nine-year run, they became one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>popular</b> <b>and</b> influential bands in music history, according to music journalist Colin Devenish. They were also ranked No.33 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band had a large influence on the nu metal genre which came to prominence {{during the second half}} of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Many Puranas tell Krishna's {{life story}} or some {{highlights}} from it. Two Puranas, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana, contain {{the most elaborate}} telling of Krishna's story, but the life stories of Krishna in these and other texts vary, and contain significant inconsistencies. The Bhagavata Purana consists of twelve books subdivided into 332chapters, with a cumulative total of between 16,000 and 18,000 verses depending on the version. The tenth book of the text, which contains about 4,000 verses (~25%) and is dedicated to legends about Krishna, has been <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>popular</b> <b>and</b> widely studied part of this text.|$|E
5|$|McCartney was in {{the midst}} of {{business}} disagreements with his bandmates when he announced his departure from the group on 10 April 1970.

More legal disputes followed as McCartney's attorneys– his in-laws John and Lee Eastman–fought the three remaining Beatles' business manager, Allen Klein, over royalties and creative control. An English court legally dissolved the Beatles on 9 January 1975, though sporadic lawsuits against their record company EMI, Klein, and each other persisted until 1989.

5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>popular</b> <b>and</b> {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in {{part due}} to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|The historiography of Cornelio Saavedra {{is closely}} related to that of Mariano Moreno. As Saavedra had a {{conflict}} with him in the Junta, the perspectives towards him complement those about Moreno. The first liberal historians praised Moreno {{as the leader of the}} Revolution and a great historical man; Saavedra was treated either as a weak man overwhelmed by Moreno, or as a counter-revolutionary. This perspective did not acknowledge that Saavedra, as head of the Regiment of Patricians, was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>popular</b> <b>and</b> influential man of the city since before the Revolution, and that he was reported to be staunch, cunning and ruthless.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel is one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>popular</b> <b>and</b> easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
