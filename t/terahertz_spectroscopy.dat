50|$|Polaritonics is an {{intermediate}} regime between photonics and sub-microwave electronics (see Fig. 1). In this regime, signals are carried by an admixture of electromagnetic and lattice vibrational waves known as phonon-polaritons, rather than currents or photons. Since phonon-polaritons propagate with frequencies {{in the range}} of hundreds of gigahertz to several terahertz, polaritonics bridges the gap between electronics and photonics. A compelling motivation for polaritonics is the demand for high speed signal processing and linear and nonlinear <b>terahertz</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> Polaritonics has distinct advantages over electronics, photonics, and traditional <b>terahertz</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> in that it offers the potential for a fully integrated platform that supports terahertz wave generation, guidance, manipulation, and readout in a single patterned material.|$|E

50|$|Zinc {{telluride}} {{together with}} lithium niobate {{is often used}} for generation of pulsed terahertz radiation in time-domain <b>terahertz</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> and terahertz imaging. When a crystal of such material is subjected to a high-intensity light pulse of subpicosecond duration, it emits a pulse of terahertz frequency through a nonlinear optical process called optical rectification. Conversely, subjecting a zinc telluride crystal to terahertz radiation causes it to show optical birefringence and change the polarization of a transmitting light, making it an electro-optic detector.|$|E
50|$|The few {{examples}} given above represent {{only a small}} subset of several further phenomena which demonstrate that the coherent optical response of semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures is strongly influenced by many-body effects.Other interesting research directions which similarly require an adequate theoretical analysis including many-body interactions are, e.g., phototransport phenomena where optical fields generate and/or probe electronic currents, the combined spectroscopy with optical and Terahertz field, see article <b>Terahertz</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> and technology, and the rapidly developing area of semiconductor quantum optics, see article Semiconductor quantum optics with dots.|$|E

In this regime, Rabi oscillations are strongly coupled to intraband motion, and interband transitions mainly take place during short times when electrons pass near the Brillouin zone center where electron populations undergo very rapid changes. Asymmetry of the residual population distribution induces an electric current controlled by the carrier-envelope phase.

The repetition frequencies {{of the two}} fs lasers are stabilized by use of two phase-locked loops sharing the same reference oscillator. For AOS THz-TDS, the difference frequency between the repetition frequencies is optimized, and the signal-to-noise ratio is measured {{as a function of}} the measurement time. The spectra of a THz frequency comb and its individual modes are measured using TFCS. A spectral resolution of 100 MHz is obtained in both types of spectroscopy. PACS numbers: 07. 57. Pt, 07. 57.

50|$|<b>Terahertz</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> detects and {{controls}} properties of matter with electromagnetic fields {{that are in}} the frequency range between a few hundred gigahertz and several terahertz (abbreviated as THz). In many-body systems, several of the relevant states have an energy difference that matches with the energy of a THz photon. Therefore, THz spectroscopy provides a particularly powerful method in resolving and controlling individual transitions between different many-body states. By doing this, one gains new insights about many-body quantum kinetics and how that can be utilized in developing new technologies that are optimized up to the elementary quantum level.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, the {{relative}} rigid structure of PPII {{has been used}} as a [...] "molecular ruler" [...] in structural biology,e.g., to calibrate FRET efficiency measurements. However recent experimental and theoretical studies have called into question this picture of polyproline peptide as a [...] "rigid rod". A recent study using <b>terahertz</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> and density functional theory calculations highlighted that polyproline is in fact much less rigid than originally thought. Interconversions between the PPII and PPI helix forms of poly-proline are slow, due to the high activation energy of X-Pro cis-trans isomerization (Ea ≈ 20 kcal/mol); however, this interconversion may be catalyzed by specific isomerases known as prolyl isomerases or PPIases.|$|E

40|$|The carrier {{dynamics}} of photoexcited electrons {{in the vicinity}} of the surface of (N H 4) 2 S -passivated GaAs were studied via <b>terahertz</b> emission <b>spectroscopy</b> and optical-pump terahertz-probe <b>spectroscopy.</b> <b>Terahertz</b> emission <b>spectroscopy</b> measurements, coupled with Monte Carlo simulations of terahertz emission, revealed that the surface electric field of GaAs reverses after passivation. The conductivity of photoexcited electrons was determined via optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy and was found to double after passivation. These experiments demonstrate that passivation significantly reduces the surface state density and surface recombination velocity of GaAs. Finally, it was demonstrated that passivation leads to an enhancement in the power radiated by photoconductive switch terahertz emitters, thereby showing the important influence of surface chemistry on the performance of ultrafast terahertz photonic devices. © 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

40|$|The far-infrared {{properties}} of all five known polymorphic {{forms of the}} drug sulfathiazole have been studied by <b>terahertz</b> pulsed <b>spectroscopy</b> and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy. The observed spectra of the different polymorphs are distinctly different. <b>Terahertz</b> pulsed <b>spectroscopy</b> proves to be a rapid and complementary alternative to other physical characterization techniques {{reported in the literature}} for distinguishing between the five forms. Variable-temperature measurements (293 - 473 K) of all polymorphic forms have been performed. The phase transitions observed have been related to thermal analysis data. Form I is the form stable at high temperature of sulfathiazole with a melting point of about 475 K. Form II melts at around 470 K and recrystallizes at higher temperatures to form I. Forms III, IV, and V all convert to form I via a solid-solid phase transition at temperatures below 450 K. The phase transitions can be monitored by <b>terahertz</b> pulsed <b>spectroscopy.</b> Polymorphic impurities of the samples can be detected in the room temperature spectra and their effect on the phase transition behavior can be studied...|$|R
