40|$|Many {{of the new}} {{generation}} of satellites to be flow by DLR/GSOC apply the new packet telemetry and <b>telecommand</b> protocols as defined in the ESA Packet Telemetry and <b>Telecommand</b> Standards. Consequently, GSOC had to upgrade its multi-mission control center facilities in order to include the required new functionality. Due to the fact that, for many of its missions, GSOC requires cross support from other agencies, the existing capabilities particularly those relating to external ground stations interfaces had to be retained and in some cases expanded. The new Packet <b>Telecommand</b> Standard had a major impact on the GSOC <b>telecommand</b> System architecture, the "Frame Operations Procedure" (FOP) of the "Command Operations Procedure" (COP- 1) protocol had to be integrated into the existing system. This was primarily to ensure that ESA standard compliance was retaind within the GSOC control center itselfs and also to provide independence from the many ground stations integrated into the support network. This paper describes the approach taken by GSOC to upgrade the capabilities of its <b>telecommand</b> system.

A multiple model framework for fusion of sensor information from laser and camera using parametric models of planar and cylindrical surfaces is suggested.
