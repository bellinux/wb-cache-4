5|$|Lionel Luthor is {{a fictional}} {{character}} portrayed by John Glover {{in the television}} series Smallville. The character was initially a recurring guest in season one, and became a series regular in season two and continued until being written out of the show in season seven. The character returned to the show in season ten again as a recurring guest role as a parallel universe (Earth-2) version of the character. In Smallville, Lionel Luthor {{is the father of}} Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), and founder and CEO of LuthorCorp. Lex Luthor's father was first introduced in Superman comics by Jerry Siegel in 1961 and has since appeared in other Superman-related media under different names. Smallville is the first appearance in which the character has been an intricate part of a Superman adaptation. Series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar created Lionel Luthor for Smallville to provide an antithesis to <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> style of Jonathan Kent (John Schneider) and Martha Kent (Annette O'Toole).|$|E

25|$|Adoption is {{a process}} whereby a person assumes <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> of another, usually a child, from that person's {{biological}} or legal parent or parents, and, in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parent or parents. This process could {{take a long time}} going through court.|$|E

Afterwards she shows <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> where they can wait and helps them {{to find their way}} around <b>the</b> hospital. <b>The</b> <b>parent</b> advisor has a coffee with <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> or just listens to them. <b>The</b> <b>parent</b> advisor is in close contact with the operating team and is able to inform <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> about <b>the</b> duration of the operation.

To find out whether either of <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> carries <b>the</b> syndrome, both <b>parents</b> have to be tested. In several cases, the syndrome was identified with the child, because of an autism disorder or another problem, and later it appeared that <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> was affected as well. <b>The</b> <b>parent</b> never knew about it up till the moment that the DNA-test proved <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> to be a carrier.|$|R

Steel framing supports a cantilevered awning roof. The roof and side and rear walls are clad with wide-profile metal sheeting. There is a metal sheeted balustrade along the sides and front. The sub-floor contains a bar and other members facilities.|$|E
25|$|Mothers {{with one}} or more {{immature}} daughters in addition to their infants are in contact with their infants less than those with no older immature daughters, because the mothers may pass <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> responsibilities to their daughters. High-ranking mothers with older immature daughters also reject their infants significantly more than those without older daughters, and tend to begin mating earlier in the mating season than expected based on their dates of parturition the preceding birth season. Infants farther {{from the center of the}} groups are more vulnerable to infanticide from outside groups. Some mothers abuse their infants, which is believed to be the result of controlling parenting styles.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{and studies}} {{find that there}} are no {{differences}} in <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> of homosexuals or the adjustment of their children. These conclusions have been accepted, adopted and ratified by the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatry Association, the American Pediatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Child Welfare League of America and the National Association of Social Workers. As a result, based on the robust nature of the evidence available in the field, this Court is satisfied that the issue is so far beyond dispute that it would be irrational to hold otherwise; the best interests of children are not preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption.|$|E

25|$|Older offspring, {{which are}} around two years old, may also live in {{families}} and help their parents. In addition to helping build food caches and repairing the dam, two-year-olds {{will also help}} in feeding, grooming and guarding younger offspring. Beavers also practice alloparental care, in which an older sibling may take over <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> duties if the original parents die or are otherwise separated from them. This behavior is common and is seen in many other animal species, such as the elephant and fathead minnow. While these helping two-year-olds help increase the chance of survival for younger offspring, they are not essential for the family, and two-year-olds only stay and help their families {{if there is a}} shortage of resources in times of food shortage, high population density, or drought. When beavers leave their natal territories, they usually do not settle far. Beavers can recognize their kin by detecting differences in anal gland secretion composition using their keen sense of smell. Related beavers share more features in their anal gland secretion profile than unrelated beavers. Being able to recognize kin is important for beaver social behavior, and it causes more tolerant behavior among neighboring beavers.|$|E

500|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club favorably noted its [...] "sheer and utter joyfulness" [...] {{and lack of}} cynicism, unlike many other shows that garnered a cult following of parents and adults. He complimented the characters' stylized appearance, the stories' relative complexity for children's television, and the solid jokes which make the show enjoyable for parents as well as children. He gave the series a B+. The show has been critically praised for its humor and moral outlook by Brian Truitt of USA Today. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club later commented that Friendship Is Magic {{is an example of}} a show that, while considered [...] "girly", has been able to tap into the nerd culture to allow it to gain wider acceptance than other comparable forms. Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media, an organization focusing on <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> aspect of children's media, gave the show a rating of four out of five stars, emphasizing its messages of friendship, tolerance and respect, but advised parents to be wary of the [...] "influence the characters might have on their kids' desires, since it's rooted in a well-known product line of books, toys, and just about everything in between." [...] Liz Ohanesian, for L.A. Weekly, said that the show is [...] "absolutely genuine in its messages about friendship but never takes itself too seriously". Matt Morgan, writing for Wireds [...] "GeekDad" [...] column, praised the show for having [...] "rebooted the long-time Hasbro property while managing to lace it with geeky undertones" [...] and being one of the few [...] "girl-focused shows that a geeky dad can appreciate with his daughter". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Lloyd called the show [...] "smarter and sassier and more aesthetically sophisticated" [...] than any of the previous My Little Pony cartoons, and praised its ability to appeal to both children and their parents, in that it is [...] "smart and sprightly and well-staged, and never horribly cute". TV Guide listed Friendship Is Magic as one of the top sixty animated shows of all time in a September 2013 list.|$|E
50|$|That same day, the State filed a {{petition}} {{on behalf of}} the children to terminate parental rights of both <b>parents.</b> <b>The</b> petition alleged that (1) <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> had abused <b>the</b> children, (2) <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> were unfit or incompetent, (3) <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> did not remedy the circumstances leading to the children's removal, (4) <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> failed to make adjustments required to allow return of the children, (5) <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> only made token efforts toward retaining their parental rights, and (6) the children's best interests favored adoption by other parents.|$|R
50|$|When a {{subsidiary}} of a corporation files for bankruptcy, there may be reason to suspect that it was deliberately undercapitalized and mismanaged {{for the benefit of}} <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> corporation. <b>The</b> main cause of failure may have been excessive payments to <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> for goods or services provided by <b>the</b> <b>parent,</b> or inadequate charges for goods or services provided to <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b> In effect, capital provided by other investors was channeled to <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> corporation until <b>the</b> subsidiary failed. These cases can be extremely difficult to prove, but the Deep Rock doctrine ensures that <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> corporation's claims are only settled after all other claims.|$|R

2500|$|The {{state had}} no {{explicit}} regulations {{with respect to}} foster care and parenting by gays and lesbians, either singly or in relationships, until, on May 24, 1985, the state Department of Social Services, {{with the approval of}} Governor Michael Dukakis, created a rule that foster children be placed in [...] "traditional family settings". In December 1986, a commission that reviewed the foster care system recommended that sexual orientation could not be used to disqualify foster parents. As Dukakis delayed accepting that recommendation, advocates for gay and lesbian rights threatened protests against his presidential campaign. The ban on gay foster parents was enacted into law in the 1989 budget. After a lawsuit challenging the ban was settled out of court, the Dukakis administration withdrew the policy in April 1990. In the 1990s, court decisions further expanded <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> rights of gays and lesbians. In September 1993, the state's highest court ruled that state law allowed for second-parent adoption by a parent of the same sex as a biological parent. In July 1999, the same court awarded visitation rights to each of two mothers after their separation.|$|E
