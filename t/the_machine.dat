5|$|Audioslave was an American rock {{supergroup}} {{formed in}} Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave {{as a combination}} of Soundgarden and Rage Against <b>the</b> <b>Machine,</b> but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, {{it was noted that}} they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against <b>the</b> <b>Machine,</b> the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{existence}} of debris in the inter-electrode area in micro-EDM interrupts <b>the</b> <b>machining</b> process. Applying ultrasonic vibration to <b>the</b> <b>machining</b> fluid helps circulate <b>the</b> <b>machining</b> fluid {{and remove the}} debris from the gap area, and thus reduce short-circuits and abnormal discharges. In this study, the effect of applying ultrasonic vibration to machining fluid in micro-EDM was experimentally investigated. It was found that {{a significant increase in}} <b>the</b> <b>machining</b> speed was realized by applying ultrasonic vibration. Also, with the vibration of <b>the</b> <b>machining</b> fluid, micro-hole drilling with ultra-small discharge energy became possible...|$|R
