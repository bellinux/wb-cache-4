5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a long day at work and tries <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap.</b> Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap,</b> but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E

His wife went to wake him at 23:00 as he had requested but she found Sakharov dead on the floor. According to the notes of Yakov Rapoport, a senior pathologist present at the autopsy, it is most likely that Sakharov died of an arrhythmia consequent to dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 68. He was interred in the Vostryakovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.|$|E

60|$|At last {{gaining the}} boat we pushed off, and away we steamed down the Hudson. There were few {{passengers}} on board, {{the day was}} so unpleasant; and they were mostly congregated in the after cabin round the stoves.

50|$|The scene {{returns to}} the exhibit in the morning, where Master Po concludes {{the story of how}} the new masters formed the Masters' Council in Gongmen City. Unfortunately, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) discovers them, Po {{initially}} thinking he is an exhibit. While not being furious, he still sets Po to work to repair the roof he damaged breaking in before the exhibit opens in 20 minutes (using a trowel that Po thinks is a legendary weapon). Unfortunately, Po manages to accidentally lock himself in a sarcophagus that once served as Su Wu's prison cell and is trapped, so he decides <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> power <b>nap</b> instead, leaving the roof unfixed.|$|R

25|$|When Marge {{escapes from}} the {{courtroom}} {{and goes to the}} library to see who Becky really is, she realizes that she is insane and being unfair to Becky, after finding nothing bad about her and a newspaper tablet of how Marge ruined Becky's marriage. Finally, she returns home, only to find Homer tied up, Lisa's arms and legs stuck to the wall, Maggie stuck in a cage, and Becky holding a knife in her hands. When Becky is about to 'kill' Homer, Marge snatches the knife from her and attempts to strangle her. It turns out that Bart is filming a scene in his movie for the school (now a music video). Homer also reveals that while he was fixing Marge's car, he accidentally drained the brake fluid. Marge apologizes to Becky, but Becky admits she was going to kill Marge and steal her family, but decided not to after she couldn't get a shovel. Suddenly the mental hospital doctors show up and shoot three tranquilizer darts into Marge's neck, which don't take effect. Marge tells them that she has too much to do <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap.</b> She instructs Lisa to take Maggie out of the cage and tells Homer that she has some 'S for him' - scrubbing and mopping, since he is dressed for the job anyway. As Marge giggles, Homer fires a dart borrowed from the doctors into her, which sends her straight to sleep.|$|E
500|$|Matt Groening's {{animated}} series The Simpsons, {{of which}} Kubrick was a fan, and Futurama frequently reference 2001, {{along with other}} Kubrick films. In the opening of Episode 8F06 of The Simpsons (Lisa's Pony) the 'Dawn of Man' scene from 2001 is recreated with primates that include Homer; while all the primates are inspired to new levels of intellect by the monolith, the Homer primate uses it as a back rest <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap.</b> [...] The Simpsons had in the episode [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] Bart throwing a felt-tip marker into the air; in slow motion it rotates, before a match cut replaces it with a cylindrical satellite. [...] In 2004 Empire magazine listed this as the third best film parody of the entire run of the show. The satellite docking sequence is also parodied as Homer Simpson floats through the spaceship eating potato chips. [...] In the Futurama episode [...] "Love and Rocket" [...] a sentient spaceship revolts {{in a manner similar}} to Hal. Games Radar listed this as number 17 in its list of 20 Funniest Futurama parodies, while noting that Futurama has referenced Space Odyssey on several other occasions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the comic strip came from Dennis Ketcham, the real life son of Hank Ketcham, who was only four {{years old when he}} refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap</b> and somehow messed up his whole room. Hank tried many possible names for the character, and translated them into rough pencil sketches. But when his studio door flew open and his then-wife Alice, in utter exasperation, exclaimed, [...] "Your son is a menace!", the [...] "Dennis the Menace" [...] name stuck. The character of Henry Mitchell bore a striking resemblance to Ketcham. The Mitchell family of Dennis, Hank/Henry, and Alice were all named after the Ketchams.|$|E
50|$|The {{soldier and}} his {{servants}} go to {{town where the}} king has organized a running competition. The contestant who manages to get a specific crock several miles away {{in the distance and}} bring it back before the deadline would marry the king's daughter.

60|$|It was {{so quiet}} and {{peaceful}} and altogether lovely there in the Green Forest, where Lightfoot the Deer lay resting behind a pile of brush {{near the top of}} a little hill, that it didn't seem possible such a thing as sudden death could be anywhere near. It didn't seem possible that there could be any need for watchfulness. But Lightfoot long ago had learned that often danger is nearest when it seems least to be expected. So, though he would have liked very much <b>to</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap,</b> Lightfoot was too wise to do anything so foolish. He kept his beautiful, great, soft eyes fixed in the direction from which the hunter with the terrible gun would come if he were still following that trail. He kept his great ears gently moving to catch every little sound.|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> counterattack <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{back the}} {{airfield}} and Point 107 was organised {{for the following}} day at Hargest's headquarters. He was exhausted and had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>nap</b> before <b>a</b> conference to work out detailed plans for the counter-attack, much to the disgust {{of some of the}} other participants. Afterwards, he became pessimistic of the chances of success and unsuccessfully sought to have the attack called off. The attack did fail but Hargest, still well behind the frontlines, mistakenly believed it to be going well until he found that his brigade had returned to their starting positions. His pessimism began to affect Puttick, who asked Freyberg to allow the 5th Infantry Brigade to withdraw, which it duly did. This began an eventual retreat and evacuation from Crete on 31 May, with Hargest flying out for Egypt by seaplane, his brigade following by sea.|$|R
50|$|The Stooges {{are sent}} to the front line, where they decide <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> long <b>nap.</b> After {{learning}} that Sgt.

As they successfully get it out, Moe falls in a puddle of mud, which Curly admonishes him about going swimming; this angers Moe as he kicks Curly into the cannon where his head becomes lodged. As Larry and Moe get Curly's head out of the cannon, it points to where Curly is and they then point the cannon straight upward. Naturally the shell goes up and then down which manages to explode on them.|$|R
5000|$|On June 2-7, 2010, at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, Laak set {{the world}} record in longest time spent playing poker in a single session. He halted at 115 hours.

Guinness allows one 5-minute break every hour, in which Laak could do whatever he wanted, and Laak could [...] "bank" [...] those 5-minute breaks into longer breaks if he played through. Laak banked several breaks <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> 30-minute <b>nap</b> (allowed), but he vows {{that he did not}} use caffeine or any stimulants. Playing $10/$20 No Limit Hold'em (with uncapped buyins), Laak finished up $6,766 and donated half of his winnings to charity. He did this for Camp Sunshine, a charity that helps sick children enjoy summer camp. His feat was witnessed live on streaming video by over 130,000 people.|$|R

Colligan's departure, like Crawford's, seemed to be amicable as the band wrote, [...] "We wish him the best and I'm sure he'll be no stranger at a Cab show or anytime we're back in town." [...] The same day Colligan posted his own explanation for leaving the band on his official MySpace blog.

Oftenest I have unwisely uttered my wisdom in the ears of sick persons, when the inquietude of fever made them toss about upon my cushion.

50|$|A ghostly legend {{passed down}} among {{students}} {{begins with the}} story of a visit by the Russian National Ballet where it took up accommodations in the historic Schenley Hotel prior to opening its tour of the United States in Pittsburgh. The prima ballerina, tired from travel, decided to rest before the premiere performance, drifted off, and slept through her curtain call and the whole of the performance. The company's director, either so incensced by her missing the premiere, or so impressed by the stage presence of her understudy, decided to replace the prima ballerina with the young upstart {{for the remainder of the}} tour. The ballerina was so distraught that she took her own life that night, ashamed and humiliated that she would be replaced by the young understudy. It is now said if one were <b>to</b> ever <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap</b> or fall asleep for whatever reason in the Tansky Family Lounge, also known as the Red Room, they will always wake up just in time for whatever exam, class, meeting, appointment, etc. they may have missed.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the parameters of nocturnal sleep that mediate the relationship between morningness-eveningness preference and the sleep architecture of naps in university students. This study had a cross-sectional, descriptive correlational design. The sleep architecture of 52 students invited <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> afternoon <b>nap</b> in the laboratory was recorded. The morningness-eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) {{was used to evaluate}} morningness-eveningness preference. An actigraph was used to collect students' nighttime sleep data in the week preceding the study. Polysomnography was used to measure the sleep architecture of the participants' naps. After adjustments for potential factors, although the MEQ did not directly correlate with the percentage of sleep stages in naps, the effects of the MEQ on the percentage of Stage 1 sleep, slow-wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep; sleep duration; and sleep efficiency of naps were mediated by the total sleep time in the preceding week. This preliminary study suggests that nap quality was affected by morningness-eveningness preference through the mediation of total nocturnal sleep time. Therefore, future studies should be carefully designed to consider nighttime sleep patterns when analyzing the effects of chronotypes on daytime sleep...|$|R

After Faye emerges from the Eternal Maze with the potion, the teddy bear vanishes. Faye gives the potion to Fidget, and the couple are finally reunited, but they must find their missing daughter now. In the extra cut-scene, after putting the book named Dream Chronicles: The Eternal Maze back to bookshelf, Faye declares that finding Lyra is all to her.
