25|$|In the Middle East and the Ottoman Empire {{the effect}} of {{liberalism}} was significant. During the 19th century, Arab, Ottoman, and Persian intellectuals visited Europe to study and learn about Western literature, science and liberal ideas. This led them <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> about their countries' underdevelopment and concluded {{that they needed to}} promote constitutionalism, development, and liberal values to modernize their societies. At the same time, the increasing European presence in the Middle East and the stagnation of the region encouraged some Middle Eastern leaders, including Mahmud II and his son Abdülmecid I, Muhammad Ali Pasha, and Amir Kabir, to make socio-political changes and start modernization projects. In 1826, intellectual and academic Rifa'a al-Tahtawi was sent to Paris in one of the Muhammad Ali's scholar missions. Tahtawi studied ethics, social and political philosophy, and mathematics. He read works by Condillac, Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu and Bézout, among others, during his séjour in France.|$|E
500|$|The {{band had}} {{spent much of}} 2002 {{recording}} new material at Studio 880 in Oakland, California for an album titled Cigarettes and Valentines, creating [...] "polka songs, filthy versions of Christmas tunes, [...] salsa numbers" [...] for the project, hoping to establish something new within their music. After completing twenty songs, the rough demo master tapes were stolen that November. The musicians insisted they had no leads on its whereabouts until 2016, when during an interview with NME Armstrong and Dirnt stated that they eventually recovered the material, and that the band is now using the tapes for ideas. The band consulted longtime producer Rob Cavallo about what to do next. Cavallo told the members <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> if the missing tracks represented the group's best work. Armstrong said that the band members [...] "couldn't honestly look at ourselves and say, 'That was the best thing we've ever done.' So we decided to move on and do something completely new." [...] The band members agreed to spend the next three months writing new material.|$|E
500|$|Drawing {{attention}} to the intrinsically manipulative nature of the medium, Nolan uses narrative and stylistic techniques (notably mise en abyme and recursions) to stimulate the viewer <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> why his films are put together in such ways and why the films provoke particular responses. He sometimes uses editing {{as a way to}} represent the characters' psychological states, merging their subjectivity with that of the audience. For example, in Memento the fragmented sequential order of scenes is to put the audience into a similar experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories. In The Prestige, the series of magic tricks and themes of duality and deception mirror the structural narrative of the film. His writing style incorporates a number of storytelling techniques such as flashbacks, shifting points of view and unreliable narrators. Scenes are often interrupted by the unconventional editing style of cutting away quickly from the money shot (or nearly cutting off characters' dialogue) and crosscutting several scenes of parallel action to build to a climax. In 2017, noted film theorist and historian David Bordwell wrote about Nolan's fascination with subjective storytelling and crosscutting, [...] "It's rare to find any mainstream director so relentlessly focused on exploring a particular batch of storytelling techniques ... Nolan zeroes in, from film to film, on a few narrative devices, finding new possibilities in what most directors handle routinely. He seems to me a very thoughtful, almost theoretical director in his fascination with turning certain conventions this way and that, to reveal their unexpected possibilities." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, the BBC {{reported}} that the company Primark was using child labour {{in the manufacture of}} clothing.

Some customs hold that the other participants recite them quietly to themselves as well. In some families, this means that the requirement remains on an adult [...] "child" [...] until a grandchild of the family receives sufficient Jewish education to take on the responsibility. If a person has no children capable of asking, the responsibility falls to their spouse, or another participant.

2500|$|Uri Misgav, {{writing for}} Haaretz, {{claims that the}} Iron Dome {{developers}} have created a technological marvel and saved many lives, but at the strategic level the invention also causes damage by [...] "allowing Israelis to inflate their sense of victimhood". In his view, the Iron Dome allows the various Israeli governments to undertake a [...] "limited (military) operation" [...] and therefore shift discussion away from other topics such as the economic recession and corruption concerns. According to Misgav, the Iron Dome does not only shoot down missiles, it also [...] "shoots {{down some of the}} capacity of Israelis for free thought, [...] it reduces their motivation <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> how and why the present 'round of escalation' has started, who escalated it? Who does it serve? And why is it that suddenly rockets are falling from the sky?" [...] Misgav further writes that the Iron Dome will not return peace to the residents of southern Israel nor the residents of the Gaza Strip who he claims live [...] "under siege".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{with similar}} claims was RUC Special Patrol Group officer Billy McCaughey, {{who was one}} of the first RUC {{officers}} on the scene of the massacre. He told Toby Harnden, [...] "the sides of the road were running red with blood and it was the blood of totally innocent Protestants". Afterwards, McCaughey says, he began passing RUC intelligence to loyalist militants and also to participate in their operations. McCaughey was convicted in 1980 of a sectarian killing, the kidnapping of a Catholic priest, and an attempted bombing. However, McCaughey had colluded with loyalists before the Kingsmill attack, and later admitted taking part in the Reavey killings the day before – he claimed he [...] "was at the house but fired no shots". McCaughey also gave his view on how the massacre affected loyalists:I think Kingsmills forced people <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> where they were going, especially the Protestant support base, the civilian support base – the people who were not members of the UVF but would let you use a building or a field. Those people, many of them withdrew. It wasn't because of anything the UVF did. It was fear of retaliation.|$|E

5000|$|Despite their {{impressive}} (although still sometimes disputed) achievements, Kanzi {{and other}} apes, {{who participated in}} similar experiments, failed <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions <b>themselves.</b> Joseph Jordania suggested that the ability <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions is probably the central cognitive element that distinguishes human and animal cognitive abilities. (However, a parrot named Alex was apparently able <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> simple questions. He asked what color he was, and learned [...] "grey" [...] after being told the answer six times.) Enculturated apes, who underwent extensive language training programs, successfully learned to answer quite complex questions and requests (including question words [...] "who", [...] "what", [...] "where"), although so far they failed to learn how <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions <b>themselves.</b> For example, David and Anne Premack wrote: [...] "Though she Sarah understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions - unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else". The ability <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions is sometimes assessed in relation to comprehension of syntactic structures. Jordania suggested that this approach is not justified, as (1) questioning is primarily a cognitive ability, and (2) questions can be asked {{without the use of}} syntactic structures (with the use of specific intonation only). It is widely accepted that the first questions are asked by humans during their early infancy, at the pre-syntactic, one word stage of language development, with the use of question intonation.|$|R
