40|$|The article aims to {{describe}} the cultural landscape of the Opole Silesia (Polish: Śląsk Opolski, German: Oppelner Schlesien) in the Romantic period. The description {{is based on the}} analysis of the region’s folkloristic narratives, namely folk tales, collected by Jozef Lompa (1797 - 1863). The <b>title</b> <b>category</b> of a “triple borderland” is explained {{on the basis of a}} triadic geopolitical model consisting of three symbolic areas. The first one refers to the cultural patterns of Polish Romanticism with its literary and scientific language. The second relates to “symbolic violence” associated with Prussian cultural policy against Polish identity in Silesia. Both of these areas are associated by the author with the notion of “ethos”, as proposed by Ferdinand Tönnies. Finally, the third area, the Silesian “ethnos” itself, is deeply rooted in tradition and cultural memory. Torn between the first and the second area, it simultaneously acted as an intermediary between them...|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} of carbon disulphide (CS 2) exposure to {{risk factors for}} ischaemic heart disease was recently examined using data from a 1979 cross sectional study of 410 male textile workers, of whom 165 were exposed and 245 were unexposed to CS 2. Average eight hour CS 2 exposure concentrations ranged from 0. 6 to 11. 8 ppm by job <b>title</b> <b>category</b> among the exposed workers. A significant and positive linear trend in low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (LDLc) and diastolic blood pressure with increasing CS 2 exposure was found after adjustment for potential confounders. When exposure was examined as a categorical variable (none, low, moderate, and high), the high exposure group had an adjusted mean LDLc that was 0. 32 mmol/l greater than the non-exposed group (p = 0. 02), and an adjusted mean diastolic blood pressure that was 3. 16 mm Hg greater than the non-exposed group (p = 0. 09). The effect of CS 2 on diastolic blood pressure was strengthened in analyses limited to exposed workers: the high exposure group had an adjusted mean diastolic blood pressure that was 5 mm Hg {{greater than that of}} the low exposed group (p = 0. 03). Triglyceride, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting glucose concentration, and systolic blood pressure were not affected by exposure. Blood lead concentration was positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The results indicate that relatively modest exposure to CS 2 may raise LDLc concentration and diastolic blood pressure and suggest mechanisms by which exposure to CS 2 may influence risk of ischaemic heart disease. Also the results provide further support for the hypothesis of a possible association between blood lead concentration and blood pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} leadership requirements from the standpoint of prospective employers for full-time, entry-level engineering positions and create a survey instrument to evaluate them. Using the sequential exploratory mixed methods approach, the researchers used emerging qualitative data to inform the development of the quantitative survey instrument. The qualitative phase of this study sought to understand if industry needs for leadership for two engineering undergraduate populations are the same or different. An analysis was first performed on job postings in the engineering career services database of job postings at a large Midwestern university. The two engineering majors chosen were construction engineering and electrical engineering; one which has leadership explicitly stated in the ABET Program Level Criteria and one which does not. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with recruiters with job postings specifically targeted for only construction engineering or electrical engineering undergraduates. Five leadership themes emerged from the interviews: initiative/confidence, communication, interpersonal interactions, teamwork, and engagement. Using the transcripts and findings from the interviews, a quantitative survey instrument was developed to further explore the relative importance of the five themes. Cognitive interviews were conducted to refine and improve the instrument before release. The survey response rate was 25 % (193 of 840). A confirmatory factor analysis determined validity and reliability of the instrument. The survey instrument was used to determine that the relative importance of the five themes is generally the same regardless of major being hired or job <b>title</b> <b>category</b> of the recruiter; the most important theme was initiative/confidence, followed by communication, interpersonal interactions, teamwork, and engagement. This study should be refined and repeated at other universities to investigate a larger sample size. In addition, this study serves as the starting point to determine which curricular and non-curricular activities should be included in engineering undergraduate programs to best prepare students for careers in the twenty-first century...|$|E
40|$|Oral Presentation Session BAim: To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} {{and levels of}} putative ‘periodontal pathogens’ present in the subgingival/submucosal microbiota surrounding teeth or implants in subjects with differing periodontal/peri-implant health statuses. Materials and Methods: 22 subjects {{were included in the}} study. Within each subject, 4 sites were selected for sampling: (1) healthy implant, (2) diseased implant [PPD≥ 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (BOP) and radiographic bone loss], (3) healthy tooth and (4) periodontally-diseased tooth (presence of BOP, PPD≥ 4 mm). Subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. After DNA extraction, quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) was used to detect and quantify six bacterial species: Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Staphylococcus. aureus. The absolute counts were log 10 -transformed before statistical analysis. Results: The most commonly-detected species were F. nucleatum (n= 85), T. denticola (n= 84) and S. aureus (n= 82); while P. gingivalis had the lowest detection frequency (n= 61). The overall detection frequencies of target species was generally higher in diseased compared to healthy sites with no statistically significant differences for any particular species (p> 0. 05, Cochran Q test). Regarding bacterial loads, {{no significant differences were found}} among groups except for F. nucleatum (p= 0. 023, Friedman’s 2 -way ANOVA). Submucosal/subgingival plaque from diseased teeth (3. 95) and implants (3. 54) harbored significantly more F. nucleatum than healthy implants (3. 06) and teeth (2. 93). Both periodontal and peri-implant sites, independent of health status, were found to harbor S. aureus. The loads (log 10) of S. aureus were ca. 3. 5 for all the 4 groups (p= 0. 232), which was the highest of all the species detected. Conclusions: Our results indicate that putative periodontal pathogens are common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites independent of the health status, which may explain the high risk of peri-implantitis in patients with untreated periodontal diseases. S. aureus is commonly present in the subgingival/submucosal microbiota surrounding both teeth and implants. close.. 2013 Annual Scientific Meeting Logo..
