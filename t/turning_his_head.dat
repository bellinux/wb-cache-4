500|$|The episode used several special effects. However, {{in order}} to ensure that the episode felt [...] "camera-real" [...] to {{preserve}} the theme of magic and illusions, many of the more intense effects were replaced with more conventional effects. For instance, the scene wherein Bill LaBonge's hand erupted into flames was created through the use of stunt man, rather than through expensive and, ultimately, [...] "less convincing" [...] CGI effects. The scene featuring The Amazing Maleeni <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> 360 degrees was created using a prosthetic head, courtesy of John Vulich's Optic Nerve Studios.|$|E
500|$|Peter {{goes back}} to the Bugle and claims to have been hiding the whole time. Betty pulls him aside and tells him that she is simply too old to date him and is sorry; Peter, still downtrodden, remembers what the Rhino said and asks a {{reporter}} if he knows about anyone by that name. The reporter tells him about L. Thompson Lincoln, a philanthropist who is rumored to be a dangerous crime lord. That night Peter goes to Lincoln's office as Spider-Man {{to find out if the}} rumors are true. Lincoln prefers to be called [...] "Tombstone" [...] and wields incredible strength; he pins him down and suggests that he work for him, fighting crime like usual but <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> when it comes to his crimes. Spider-Man refuses to do so and runs off.|$|E
500|$|The player mainly {{controls}} British Special Air Service (SAS) recruit Sergeant John [...] "Soap" [...] MacTavish {{for most}} of the game, starting with his enrollment in the 22nd SAS Regiment. The player also controls United States Marine Corps (USMC) Sergeant Paul Jackson during five of the levels on Act 1. Captain John Price (voiced by actor Billy Murray) is an SAS officer who is playable in two flashback missions from 1996 in which he is still Lieutenant. The player also assumes the role of an American thermal-imaging TV operator aboard a Lockheed AC-130 gunship during one level, and a British SAS operative infiltrating a hijacked airliner to save a VIP in a secret level titled [...] "Mile High Club". Finally, the player may control Yasir Al-Fulani, the president of the unnamed Middle Eastern country in the game before he is executed, although he has no freedom of action beyond <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was critical of}} the episode's intricacy, writing, [...] "'The Amazing Maleeni' is a convoluted episode that ultimately lacks verve and excitement. Even if one can {{figure out what is}} going on, there remains the question of how much, or even whether, to care." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two stars out of five. The two noted that, had the episode used real magic tricks instead of [...] "resort to CGI, the episode would have been much more than a simple [...] "cheat". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the fact that the explanation behind Maleeni <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> around 360 degrees was never satisfactorily explained. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris compared the episode's plot to the 1999 movie Arlington Road, noting that while [...] "the scheme is fun to watch while it unfolds, [...] in the end, it's not credible; too much is left open to chance for it really to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|As onlookers gazed in horror, and as McKinley lurched {{forward a}} step, Czolgosz {{prepared}} to take a third shot. [...] He was prevented from doing so when James Parker, an American of part-African part-Spanish descent from Georgia who had been behind Czolgosz in line, slammed into the assassin, reaching for the gun. [...] A split second after Parker struck Czolgosz, so did Buffalo detective John Geary {{and one of the}} artillerymen, Francis O'Brien. [...] Czolgosz disappeared beneath a pile of men, some of whom were punching or hitting him with rifle butts. [...] He was heard to say, [...] "I done my duty." [...] McKinley staggered backwards and to the right, but was prevented from falling by Cortelyou, Milburn, and Detective Geary; they guided him across some fallen bunting to a chair. [...] The President tried to convince Cortelyou he was not seriously injured, but blood was visible as he tried to expose his injury. [...] Seeing the pummeling being taken by Czolgosz, McKinley ordered it stopped. [...] Czolgosz was dragged away, but not before being searched by Agent Foster. [...] When Czolgosz kept <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to watch the President while being searched, Foster struck him to the ground with one punch.|$|E

2500|$|After having {{reduced the}} lead to a slow margin, Australia were faced with a pitch which had {{deteriorated}} and made batting increasingly difficult. So as to ensure a healthy first-innings lead, the Australian batsmen switched gears quickly from aggressive to defensive. The Indian bowlers were rewarded with Martyn's wicket in the fourth ball of the 92nd over, by which time Australia had already gained a lead of 13. At {{the end of the}} first session, Australia added 79 runs for the loss of Martyn's wicket. The second session saw some more circumspect batting, as Australia added 84 runs from the 28 overs [...] bowled in that period, but for the loss of Simon Katich's wicket. The highlight of the second session was Ponting's double hundred, which was crafted from 368 with a neat single off Ashish Nehra's bowling. His double hundred was described as being [...] "magnificent" [...] by S Rajesh, noted Cricinfo statistician, [...] "for its complete mastery over the Indian bowlers". Ponting was also dominant as he neared his double century, singling out Kumble for some punishment. His knock also continued his excellent form in the year 2003, in which he had already notched up an average excess of 100, in tests. Another incident, a setback for Australia briefly, was Steve Waugh's decision to retire after being hurt. Waugh came out to bat with a standing ovation, but the second ball he faced, from Agarkar, was a short one to which he turned his back, <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> towards third slip. The ball hit him on his elbow, and after a quick examination from the physio, he decided to go off. The last session, though, made the difference, as Australia added 88 runs for 6 wickets, of which, Anil Kumble took three. After Waugh retired hurt, Simon Katich came in and hung around, adding 64 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. But he was soon out to Kumble(437/5). Steve Waugh returned at this stage, wearing an arm-guard over his hand, but he looked far from comfortable in his 19-run knock. He padded up once too many times to Kumble, which turned out to be his downfall, as he lost his wicket that way(502/6). Then Ponting lost the tail as India steadily worked their way through the match, with some perseverance from Kumble. Ponting was soon dismissed off Kumble, at 555/9, after missing an attempted heave down the track, and being stumped. Ponting's 468-ball innings was termed as [...] "restrained" [...] and [...] "mature", and had less aggression or flamboyance compared to his double century at Adelaide. His approach towards batting was similar to that of Rahul Dravid's in Adelaide: he was in command of his shots and the bowlers, so he had to occupy the crease for a long time. An important aspect of Ponting's knock which stood out was his footwork: he scored at a rate of 1.5 off the front-foot, but scored at a pace of 5.4 from the back-foot. He remarkably remained in control for 87% of the balls he faced from other Indian bowlers, except Kumble, against whom he had a relatively low in-control percentage of 81%. Sambit Bal noted that despite being uncomfortable against Ashish Nehra and Ajit Agarkar early on, Ponting played an innings of ambition. He added, ...|$|E
