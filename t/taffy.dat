Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) is the fourth, stand-in member, and proves surprisingly knowledgeable about cat diseases. Will's girlfriend, substitute teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), suggests holding a benefit concert for the decathlon team instead of selling additional <b>taffy.</b> Former McKinley student Sunshine Corazon (Charice), who defected to rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, is awarded the closing number at the concert after promising to bring her six hundred Twitter followers.|$|E
5|$|Dutton was {{the subject}} of trade talks between the Maroons and the Chicago Black Hawks {{following}} the 1928–29 NHL season. The teams had been negotiating to send Cyclone Wentworth to Montreal in exchange for Dutton and Babe Siebert before the Black Hawks purchased the contract of <b>Taffy</b> Abel, which ended the Hawks pursuit of Dutton. The Maroons continued to make him available, with the Toronto Maple Leafs showing interest following the 1929–30 season. Finally, he was sold to the New York Americans along with Mike Neville, Hap Emms and Frank Carson for $35,000.|$|E

5|$|In Kentucky, {{a family}} watches in {{confusion}} as {{a herd of}} cattle starts running past their home, on fire. A spaceship explodes before it returns to Mars, {{and hundreds of other}} Martian ships leave Mars and head towards Earth. President James Dale, along with his aides, addresses the United States concerning the historic event. The President's science aides set up a first contact meeting with the Martians in Pahrump, Nevada as President Dale watches the development on TV with his wife Marsha and his daughter <b>Taffy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Richie and Florence {{are awarded}} the Medal of Honor by <b>Taffy,</b> she {{being the only}} {{surviving}} member of the government. Byron, who survived his brawl with the Martians, arrives in D.C. to reunite with his former wife Louise and their two sons Cedric and Neville (who saved Dale's life back in the White House using two guns they stole from a dead Martian) as the devastation is being cleaned up. Barbara, Cindy and Tom Jones emerge from a cave with some animals to see dozens of crashed Martian ships in the adjacent Lake Tahoe.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to assassinate President Dale, the Martians invade Earth, {{starting}} with Washington, D.C. As they attack the White House (and incinerate the White House tour guide), the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier. <b>Taffy</b> vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the mother ship, the Martians expand their invasion {{to the rest of}} Earth, defacing world landmarks for their own amusement as they do so. That night, the Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea for peace and his life. The Martians seem convinced, but then use a false hand to kill the President.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1930s, Chicago Black Hawks {{owner and}} staunch American {{nationalist}} Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager {{to compile a}} team of only American players; at the time, <b>Taffy</b> Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. With eight out of 14 players Americans, the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens, New York Americans, and the Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record. In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were facing an upset, having fallen 3–0 in the seven-game series to the fifth-place Detroit Red Wings. Toronto rebounded, and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup, becoming {{the first of four}} teams in the NHL to come back from a 3–0 series deficit and the only team to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E

50|$|In the Battle off Samar on 25 October 1944, escort {{carriers}} of Task Unit 77.4.3 ("Taffy 3") and their escort of destroyers and destroyer escorts found {{themselves as the}} sole force standing between vulnerable troop transport and supply ships engaged in landings on the Philippine island of Leyte and a powerful Japanese surface fleet of battleships and cruisers. In desperation, lightly armed Avengers and FM-2 Wildcats from <b>Taffys</b> 1, 2 and 3 resorted to tactics such as strafing ships, including {{the bridge of the}} Japanese battleship , while the destroyers and destroyer escorts charged the enemy.

5000|$|Newlyweds Louis and Esther Rheb, {{moved into}} {{their new home}} at 3352 Wilkens Avenue. [...] In 1917, Louis, self-taught, started making <b>taffies,</b> brittles, fudge and jellies in his basement. The candies were sold in the markets twice a week; Esther going to Hollins and Louis to Bel Air. In the mid-30s, they opened in the Lexington Market. Louis {{continued}} to develop more recipes, and Esther learned to hand-dip the centers in a smooth and velvety chocolate which they had blended to complement each piece of candy. Many people came to Wilkens Avenue to buy candy, so they converted their garage into a store. The Grand Opening took place in 1950. Nowadays, it is Rheb's main store. On Valentine's Day, outside of Rheb's on Wilkens Avenue, there is typically {{a long line of}} customers.|$|R
5000|$|The Labour Party {{opposition}} {{is portrayed as}} a platoon of British soldiers referred to as [...] "the Marauders", battling against superior forces and always coming off second-best.

The platoon was usually depicted as backbiting, inept, bolshie and uncooperative, which was {{the main reason for}} their constant defeats. Much of <b>Taffy's</b> woe originates among his own followers, especially from left-wingers such as [...] "Barmy" [...] Benn (Tony Benn) and [...] "Fatty" [...] Heffer (Eric Heffer), whose [...] "cruel cockney humour" [...] often has the last word, lowering morale on his own side and was a feature in almost every instalment.|$|R

25|$|In particular, The Cradle of the Deep, an {{autobiography}} {{written by a}} silent movie actress, Joan Lowell, in March 1929, became a national bestseller that topped non-fiction part of The New York Times Best Seller list.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war Biafra had 3,000 soldiers, but at the end of the war the soldiers totalled 30,000. There was no official support for the Biafran Army by any other nation throughout the war, although arms were clandestinely acquired. Because of the lack of official support, the Biafrans manufactured many of their weapons locally. Europeans served in the Biafran cause; German born Rolf Steiner was a lieutenant colonel assigned to the 4th Commando Brigade and Welshman <b>Taffy</b> Williams served as a Major until the very end of the conflict. A special guerrilla unit, the Biafran Organization of Freedom Fighters, was established, designed to emulate the Viet Cong, targeting Nigerian supply lines and forcing them to shift forces to internal security efforts.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] was sunk {{after taking}} {{a great deal of}} {{punishment}} from Intrepids air group. However, Center Force was able to limp back through San Bernardino Strait with [...] {{and a number of other}} ships intact. Intrepid was called north to go after a reported Japanese carrier group, Northern Force, which it encountered on October 25. Anti-aircraft fire was once again extremely intense, but this time Air Group 18 made it through the day without the loss of a single pilot. The groups strikes were reported likely to have sunk a light carrier and to have damaged both a carrier and a second light carrier. Northern Force was a diversion, however: Center Force had turned around and reentered San Bernardino Strait, heading for the American beachheads at Leyte. After reports filtered in alerting Admiral William Halsey Jr. to the danger posed by the remainder of Center Force, he ordered TG 38.2 to head south at full speed to reengage. The task group arrived hours too late to catch the Japanese battleships, which had once more fled in the face of the U.S. fleet. Though Admiral Kurita devastated the escort carrier unit [...] "Taffy 3" [...] (taskforce) on the 25th, through fierce combat the much smaller, thinly armored <b>Taffys</b> had managed to hold off and even force the withdrawal of his warships. The mission of Air Group 18 on the 26th was to locate and destroy the remainder of Center Force as they were escaping back towards the Japanese home islands. Obscuring cloud cover, intense anti-aircraft fire and sheer flight distance contributed to mixed results for the air group. The initial search and subsequent strike located parts of Center Force in the Cuyo East Pass off the western coast of Panay. The bombers of VB-18 seriously damaged a [...] and torpedoed a [...] in addition to doing slight damage to a number of other vessels. A third sortie failed to locate Kuritas forces and returned to Intrepid empty-handed. This was something of a letdown for the pilots of Air Group 18, but they were still proud of their results at Leyte: five strikes against two separate Japanese forces causing serious damage to both, including the sinking of carriers and one of the largest battleships ever constructed.|$|R
25|$|The Black Hawks began {{play in the}} 1926–27 season, {{along with}} new {{expansion}} franchises Detroit Cougars and New York Rangers. The team had to face immediate competition in Chicago from Eddie Livingstone's rival Chicago Cardinals, which played in the same building. McLaughlin took a very active role in running the team despite having no background in the sport. McLaughlin hired Bill Tobin, a former goaltender who had played in the Western league, as his assistant, but directed the team himself. He was also very interested in promoting American hockey players, then very rare in professional hockey. Several of them, including Doc Romnes, <b>Taffy</b> Abel, Alex Levinsky, Mike Karakas and Cully Dahlstrom, become staples with the club, and under McLaughlin, the Black Hawks were the first NHL team with an all-American-born lineup.|$|E
25|$|The {{show has}} {{simulated}} not only air combat, but also surface sea combat, {{as in the}} case of <b>Taffy</b> 3's stand against the Japanese Center Force, and the Royal Navy's pursuit and destruction of the German battleship Bismarck, which included the Bismarck being hit by torpedo bombers. These episodes have been cited as a source for several English Wikipedia articles, such as the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Simulated models include views from the cockpit, pilots visible through canopies, and battle damage. Orders of battle, comparisons of aircraft, and dissections of particular maneuvers are also presented. Jet and prop powered aircraft and ships from various eras from the First World War to the late 20th century are featured. The series often presents interviews of pilots and experts, so far mostly Americans or their allies such as a survivor of the HMS Hood (as was a German survivor of the Bismarck), though the first episode of the second season showed interviews with Japanese and German pilots.|$|E

500|$|When {{the players}} {{returned}} to their teams {{at the end of}} the war, Tucker was slated to be the starting center fielder for the 1946 season, working alongside Wally Moses and <b>Taffy</b> Wright. Unlike the previous season, he struggled with the bat at first, and was relegated to his original status on the White Sox roster as a good fielder but a poor hitter. At the end of June, Tucker had a batting average of [...]229, nearly 150 points lower than his average at the same point in 1944. His form recovered in the second half of the season and he finished the year with a batting average of [...]288 and 20 doubles, both career highs. As the 1947 Chicago White Sox season began, Tucker remained in his center field position after hitting [...]400 in the last month of the 1946 season, while rookie Dave Philley played in left field and <b>Taffy</b> Wright and Bob Kennedy platooned in right field. However, he started the year by missing some playing time due to a stomach ailment, and did not play regularly for the White Sox until the middle of May. After returning to regular play, Tucker alternated playing time with Philley, and he finished the season with a [...]236 batting average in 89 games.|$|E
500|$|The {{tradition}} of having goats {{in the military}} originated in 1775, when a wild goat walked onto the battlefield in Boston during the American Revolutionary War and led the Welsh regimental colours {{at the end of}} the Battle of Bunker Hill. Another Welsh military goat, TaffyIV, served in the First World War. <b>Taffy,</b> of 2nd Battalion, Welsh Regiment, is officially recorded as [...] "The Regimental Goat". He embarked for the war on 13 August 1914 and saw action in the Retreat from Mons, the First Battle of Ypres (including the Battle of Gheluvelt) and the Battles of Festubert and Givenchy, before dying on 20 January 1915. He was posthumously awarded the 1914 Star, British War Medal and the Victory Medal.|$|E

500|$|It {{was from}} Minneapolis that Johnson was recruited, {{along with his}} {{defensive}} partner <b>Taffy</b> Abel, {{to play for the}} newly formed New York Rangers. Offered the position at the age of 28, Johnson insisted on a three-year contract as he believed it would be the only one he would get. He made his NHL debut in the Rangers opening game on November 16, 1926 in a 1–0 victory over the Montreal Maroons. A rugged and physical defenceman, Johnson appeared in only 27 of the Rangers' 44 games as he suffered a broken collar bone early in the season, but still finished second on the Rangers with 66 penalties in minutes. [...] In 1927–28, his total of 146 penalty minutes led the team and was second in the NHL to Eddie Shore's 165. He added a career high 10 goals, and helped the Rangers win their first Stanley Cup. Additionally, he was voted by the fans as the most valuable player of either New York team.|$|E
