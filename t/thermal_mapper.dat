Large temperature increases occur in dusty conditions, with global dust storms being present in the northern, but not southern, hemisphere.

The results provide further confirmation of the presence of permanent CO_ 2 frost deposits near the south pole and show that the stability of these deposits can be explained by their high reflectivities. In the north, the observed absence of solid CO_ 2 during summer was primarily the result of enhanced CO_ 2 sublimation rates due to lower frost reflectivities during spring.

The diurnal variation decreases with depth with an exponential scale of about 5 centimeters. The maximum temperature of the soil sampled from beneath rocks at the VL 2 site is calculated to be 230 K.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the first {{measurements of the}} annual heat budgets of the polar caps of Mars from spacecraft observations. The primary motivation for this work is to understand why seasonal CO_ 2 frost deposits at the north pole of Mars disappear in the summer, whereas seasonal CO_ 2 deposits near the south pole do not. This behavior {{is not expected to}} first order because both Martian poles receive the same total amount of sunlight {{at the top of the}} atmosphere over the course of a year. Understanding why the Martian north and south polar caps behave in an asymmetric fashion is important because the vapor pressures of permanent polar CO_ 2 deposits determine the planet-wide surface pressures of CO_ 2 gas, which is the dominant constituent of the Martian atmosphere. Annual radiation budgets for the core regions of the north and south polar caps are determined from solar reflectance and infrared emission observations obtained by the Infrared <b>Thermal</b> <b>Mappers</b> (IRTMs) aboard the two Viking orbiters. The results show that the absence of CO_ 2 frost at the north pole during summer is primarily due to an asymmetry in the rates of CO_ 2 frost sublimation at surface in the north and south during spring. Further analysis traces this difference to seasonal frost reflectivities being approximately 20...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the applicability of}} airborne remote sensing to the characterization and quantification of the spatial dynamics of water surface temperature (WST) within estuaries. For this, a series of successive airborne Thematic <b>Mapper</b> <b>thermal</b> images was acquired of Kirkcudbright Bay, an estuary in the United Kingdom, on two dates. Spatial dynamics were determined by two techniques: (1) qualitatively, which involved interpreting features ‘by eye’; and (2) by the velocimetric technique of maximum cross correlation (MCC). Qualitatively, complex spatial dynamics were identified {{over a wide range}} of spatial and temporal scales, associated with the creation and dissipation of eddies, and the convergence and divergence of fronts, all of which were superimposed on the synoptic tidal flow. MCC was effective for producing synoptic velocity fields, but the minimum cell size was constrained by image noise, limiting the ability to analyze small-scale spatial dynamics. The effectiveness of MCC was related to the ratio of spatially correlated variance to spatially independent variance, as estimated from the variogram. Suggestions for optimizing the application of airborne remote sensing to estuarine spatial dynamics are presented...|$|R

40|$|The Japanese Hayabusa- 2 {{mission is}} a sample-return mission {{currently}} {{on its way}} to the C-type asteroid Ryugu. Hayabusa- 2 carries the small lander MASCOT (Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout), whose scientific payload includes the infrared radiometer MARA. The primary science goal of MARA is to determine Ryugu's surface brightness temperatures at the landing site for a full asteroid rotation, which will be measured using a long-pass filter, an 8 to 12 µm bandpass, as well as four narrow bandpasses centered at wavelengths between 5 and 15 µm. From these measurements, surface thermal inertia will be derived, but because MARA performs single pixel measurements, heterogeneity in the field of view cannot be resolved. Yet, the surface will likely exhibit different surface textures, and thermal inertia in the field of view could vary from 600 (small rocks) to 50 Jm- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1 (fine regolith grains). Sub-pixel heterogeneity is a common problem when interpreting radiometer data, since the associated ambiguities cannot be resolved without additional information on surface texture. For MARA, this information will be provided by the MASCOT camera, and in the present paper we have investigated to what extent different thermal inertias can be retrieved from MARA data. To test the applied approach, we generated synthetic MARA data using a thermal model of Ryugu, assuming different thermal inertias for sections of the field of view. We find that sub-pixel heterogeneity systematically deforms the diurnal temperature curve so that it is not possible to fit the data using a single thermal inertia value. However, including the area fractions of the different surface sections enables us to reconstruct the different thermal inertias to within 10 % assuming appropriate measurement noise. The presented approach will increase robustness of the Ryugu thermal inertia determination and results will serve as a ground truth for the global measurements performed by the <b>thermal</b> infrared <b>mapper</b> (TIR) on the Hayabusa- 2 main spacecraft...|$|R
