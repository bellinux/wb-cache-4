5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid {{is a major}} pest of sugar beet, bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} of the plants. Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. The plants are stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E
5|$|After some time, Rodrigues is {{eventually}} taken {{to meet an}} older Ferreira. Ferreira says he committed apostasy while being tortured, and states that after 15 years {{in the country and}} a year in the temple, he believes Christianity is futile in Japan. Rodrigues repudiates him, but Ferreira is implacable. That night in his prison cell, Rodrigues hears five Christians being tortured. Ferreira tells him that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> apostatized; it is his apostasy the Japanese demand. As Rodrigues looks upon a fumi-e, he hears an inner voice of Christ giving him permission to step on it, and he does.|$|E
5|$|Apu {{refuses to}} help any further, so Bart takes {{it upon himself}} to foil Kang and Kodos' plan. He asks Krusty for help, but Krusty informs Bart that he has already helped the Duff Brewery set up free laser gun stands around Springfield. Bart then goes to his father, Homer, for help, and the duo quickly pursue Kang and Kodos to the brewery. However, the aliens escape, and before departing, they reveal that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> {{released}} Buzz Cola throughout Springfield's water supply. As the cola seeps into the ground, it releases the undead from the Springfield Cemetery, who invade Springfield.|$|E

5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to enter, and see which attractions <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> completed. Bonus levels are hidden throughout the zones and can also be triggered by finishing a zone with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free falling and can pick up power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if finishing a zone with 50 or more rings. In these, the player must collect blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer; players are rewarded with a Chaos Ring upon completion. Collecting all Chaos Rings rewards the player with the best possible ending, in which Sonic and Tails make cameo appearances.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices. The keyboard {{can also be used}} instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the same purpose as clicking. The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> experienced.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an eight-player co-operative multiplayer mode called the Chaos Squad, which tasks players {{to complete a}} series of missions, as decided by the players themselves. Players defend vats of Overcharge Delirium XT from waves of OD'd at night and stop their progression by setting up fortifications and barriers, {{in a manner similar}} to tower defense games. It is inter-connected with the single-player mode allowing players to transfer their story character, with all the weapons and gadgets <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> accumulated, to the mode. Although players work together, players also try to earn more Style points during play than their co-op partners.|$|E

During a meeting with Walter Skinner, Mulder continues to insist that the events have been orchestrated by the military and not by aliens. Meanwhile, the Russian vaccine seems to have no effect on Marita. The First Elder tells the Well-Manicured Man that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> decided to turn the Rebel over to the Colonists. Jeffrey shows Scully a video of him talking about aliens while under hypnosis while he was a child, claiming his mother had forced him to make those statements.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring to believe that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Hal {{is riding}} {{the school bus}} home one day when he is {{approached}} by Ginny Ryerson, the articulate, competitive star of the debate team. She urges him to join her and replace her former partner, Ben Wekselbaum, who has {{dropped out of high}} school after falling silent mid-speech and losing the New Jersey State High School Policy Debate Championship. Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the federal government should support the teaching of sexual abstinence in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her hopefully, and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E
5|$|The High Sparrow chides Queen Margaery Tyrell {{that she}} needs to provide King Tommen Baratheon with an heir, and that she should try to convert her {{grandmother}} Olenna to the Faith, subtly remarking that Olenna's safety cannot be guaranteed otherwise. Margaery meets with Olenna, who attempts to convince her to leave King's Landing and return to Highgarden. Margaery refuses, stating that as Queen, her place is supposed to be at King Tommen's side. Margaery discreetly slips her a piece of paper with the sigil of House Tyrell drawn on it, indicating that she is still loyal to her family, upon which Olenna agrees to leave. Cersei Lannister then confronts Olenna, and tries to convince her to stay and fight the Sparrows. Olenna points out that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> lost and blames the Sparrows' rise to power on Cersei's lack of foresight. Despite having no allies in King's Landing, Cersei decides to stay and fight.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E

5|$|As the CPL playoffs {{began on}} February 5, a February 21 {{championship}} game clash between Okafor and Alexander was pondered {{in the local}} press after the 32-team brackets were announced. The CPL playoffs began with victories over Perspectives Charter by 71–37 and North Lawndale Charter High School 75–63. Against North Lawndale, Alexander had 27 points, 15 rebounds and 5 blocks. On February 16, Curie defeated Simeon 71–64. Alexander had 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 6 blocks earning a February 19 CPL semifinals rematch against Hyde Park Academy High School who <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> beaten twice this season. Alexander and Curie won 58–56 to reach the anticipated city championship matchup with Young and Okafor at the Jones Convocation Center. Alexander had a triple double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 blocks. The matchup was the most anticipated city championship game since at least 1998 when fellow McDonald's All-Americans Quentin Richardson of Young and Corey Maggette of Fenwick High School were both top 15 players. On February 20, Alexander improved his first place total in the Mr. Basketball USA Tracker, holding eight first place and two second place votes. Curie won the city championship 69–66 in quadruple overtime as Alexander had 20 points, 14 rebounds and 4 blocks according to Chicago Tribune and Comcast SportsNet, while the Chicago Sun-Times and Sports Illustrated credited him with just 12 rebounds. This came against Okafor who had 16 points and 9, 8 or 4 rebounds before fouling out with 2:13 remaining in regulation depending on which of the three sources you believe. The CPL Championship game was attended by Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel and was the lead story on the late edition of SportsCenter. Seven days later, Curie was forced to forfeit all of its wins and the CPL championship due to the academic ineligibility of seven of its players. The title will remain vacant.|$|E
