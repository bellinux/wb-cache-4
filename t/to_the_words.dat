5|$|Celsus (25 BC– AD 14) {{described}} ligation and excision procedures, {{and discussed}} the possible complications. Galen advocated severing {{the connection of}} the arteries to veins, claiming it reduced both pain {{and the spread of}} gangrene. The Susruta Samhita (4th–5th century AD) is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of Hippocrates, but emphasizes wound cleanliness. In the 13th century, European surgeons such as Lanfranc of Milan, Guy de Chauliac, Henri de Mondeville, and John of Ardene made great progress and development of the surgical techniques.|$|E
5|$|In August 1992, Antex Publishing of Lexington {{released}} Farmer's autobiography entitled Richie. In {{addition to}} the standard printing, the publisher offered {{a special edition of}} the book in which direct quotes from Farmer were rendered in blue type, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of Jesus in red letter editions of the Bible. Long-time Wildcats radio broadcaster Cawood Ledford wrote the book's foreword. By the end of October, the book had sold 30,000 copies, and a second printing from the publisher was ordered. Farmer participated in several book signings across the state, as well as filming television advertisements for local products and conducting speaking engagements for dental insurance provider Delta Dental to promote good oral health in his native eastern Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|L'Orfeo is, in Redlich's analysis, {{the product}} of two musical epochs. It {{combines}} elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century {{with those of the}} emerging Florentine mode, in particular the use of recitative and monodic singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while sinfonias and instrumental ritornelli illustrate the action, the audience's attention is always drawn primarily <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> The singers are required to do more than produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.|$|E
5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E

25|$|The sparse Gujarati case system {{serves as}} a {{springboard}} for Gujarati's grammatically functional postpositions, which parallel English's prepositions. It is their use with a noun or verb that is what necessitates the noun or verb taking the oblique case. There are six, one-syllable primary postpositions.

Many observers, including UNICEF, criticized her actions by claiming that Stone had reacted instinctively <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, because she had not done her research on the causes, consequences and methods of preventing malaria.|$|E
25|$|Legislation {{passed to}} {{implement}} the Constitution, or to adapt those implementations to changing conditions, broadens and, in subtle ways, changes the meanings given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the Constitution.

If an action of Congress or the agencies is challenged, however, it is the court system that ultimately decides whether these actions are permissible under the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|William Shakespeare {{wrote his}} play Hamlet {{sometime}} between 1599 and 1602. The Ur-Hamlet {{is thought to}} be his primary source; his version owes but the outline of the story to Saxo. In character, Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet is diametrically opposed to his prototype. Amleth's madness was certainly altogether feigned; he prepared his vengeance a year beforehand, and carried it out deliberately and ruthlessly at every point. His riddling speech has little more than an outward similarity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of Hamlet, who resembles him, however, in his disconcerting penetration into his enemies' plans.|$|E

25|$|Biblical {{literature}} uses several {{words in}} its original languages to refer to different types of alcoholic beverages. Some of these words have overlapping meaning, particularly {{the words in the}} Hebrew language compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> in Koine Greek, the language of both the Septuagint and the New Testament. While some deuterocanonical books may have been originally written in Hebrew or the Aramaic language, some were written in Greek. Hence, the meanings of the words used for alcoholic beverages in each of these languages has bearing on alcohol in the Bible.|$|E
25|$|The {{text of the}} Torah {{says that}} the name of Simeon refers to Leah's belief that God had heard that Jacob {{preferred}} her sister, Rachel, implying a derivation from the Hebrew term shama on, meaning he has heard of my suffering; this is a similar etymology as the Torah gives for the theophoric name Ishmael (God has heard), implying that the names are cognate. The name is sometimes interpreted as meaning he who listens <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of God, {{and at other times}} thought to derive from sham 'in, meaning there is sin, which is argued to be a prophetic reference to Zimri's sexual miscegenation with a Midianite woman, a type of relationship which rabbinical sources regard as sinful.|$|E
25|$|A {{third and}} {{distinctive}} image is of Jesus representing an ascetic figure; a prophet of the heart. Although the Qur'an {{refers to the}} ‘gospel’ of Jesus, those specific teachings of his are not mentioned. The Sufi movement is where Jesus became revered, acknowledged as a spiritual teacher with a distinctive voice from other prophets, including Muhammad. Sufism is a tendency, within Islam, to explore the dimensions of union with God through many approaches including asceticism, poetry, philosophy, speculative suggestion and mystical methods. Although Sufism to the western mind may seem to share similar origins or elements of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism and Buddhism, the ideology is distinctly Islamic since they adhere <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the Qur'an and pursue imitation of Muhammad as the perfect man.|$|E

Between 1994 and 1995 Andrews {{recorded}} two solo albums– the first saluted the music of Richard Rodgers and the second paid tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of Alan Jay Lerner. In 1995, she starred in the stage musical version of Victor/Victoria. It was her first appearance in a Broadway show in 35 years.

When she was the only Tony Award nominee for the production, she declined the nomination saying that she could not accept because she felt the entire production was snubbed.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have tested}} the {{difference}} between what men and women can recall after a presentation. Three speakers were involved, one being female and two being male. Men and women were put into the same lecture hall and had the same speaker talk to them. The results suggested that information presented by the women speaker was more easily recalled by {{all the members of the}} study. Researchers believe this to be a significant difference between genders because women's voices have better acoustics, ranging from low tones to high tones. Since their voices have this range, semantic encoding is increased for the pitches that stimulate the auditory component of the brain; this resonates better in the ear function. Since pitch ranges from low tones to high tones, it draws people's attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> attributed with the tone. As the tone changes, words stand out and from these differences memories can be stored. Recall is made easier since the association the brain can make is between words and sounds spoken.|$|E
25|$|Members of the BAPS branch {{support the}} {{ontology}} of Akshar through various accounts from Swaminarayan’s time by pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut, {{specifically in the}} chapters of Gadhada I-21, Gadhada I-71, Gadhada III-26, Vadtal 5 and others. In Vachanamrut Gadhada I-21, Swaminarayan states that “Akshar has two forms”; one is impersonal, known as “Brahmamahol” or Akshardham, and “in its other form, that Akshar remains {{in the service of}} Purushottam Nãrãyan.” The personal form of Akshar is understood to serve Purushottam within his divine abode and also when God incarnates on earth. Swaminarayan clarifies this in Vachanamrut Gadhada I-71 stating that “when God incarnates on earth… he is always accompanied by his Akshardham. ” Pointing to these and many other statements by Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut, the BAPS denomination of Swaminarayan Hinduism supports the Akshar doctrine within the Akshar Purushottam Upasana. To explain their understanding that this Akshar first incarnated on earth as Gunatitanand Swami, they point to evidence from other scriptures and authoritative sources in which Swaminarayan and others revealed Gunatitanand Swami as Akshar.|$|E
