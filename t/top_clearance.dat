40|$|Effects of {{superficial}} {{gas velocity}} and <b>top</b> <b>clearance</b> on gas holdup, liquid circulation velocity, mixing time, and mass transfer coefficient are investigated {{in a new}} airlift loop photobioreactor (PBR), and empirical models for its rational control and scale-up are proposed. In addition, the impact of <b>top</b> <b>clearance</b> on hydrodynamics, especially on the gas holdup in the internal airlift loop reactor, is clarified; a novel volume expansion technique is developed to determine the low gas holdup in the PBR. Moreover, a model strain of Chlorella vulgaris is cultivated in the PBR and the volumetric power is analyzed with a classic model, and then the aeration is optimized. It shows that the designed PBR, a cost-effective reactor, is promising for the mass cultivation of microalgae. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. </p...|$|E

This may be attributed to modification degree of the spur gear that is considered by using average circle method. As the gear tooth increase, the shape of gear is much closer to a regular cylinder. This is because the relative error of the gear billet volume is less affected by the irregular tooth shape.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} macro-and micro-mixing characteristics in an airlift internal loop reactor with low aspect ratio (H/D <= 5) using the electrolytic tracer response technique and the method of parallel competing reactions respectively. The micro-mixing has never been investigated in airlift loop reactors. The dual-tip electrical conductivity probe technique is used for measurement of local bubble behavior in the reactor. The effects of several operating parameters and geometric variables are investigated. It is found {{that the increase in}} superficial gas velocity corresponds to the increase in energy input, liquid circulation velocity and shear rate, decreasing the macro-mixing time and segregation index. Moreover, it is shown that <b>top</b> <b>clearance</b> and draft diameter affect flow resistance. However, the bubble redistribution with a screen mesh on the perforated plate distributor for macro-mixing is insignificant. The top region with a high energy dissipation rate is a suitable location for feeding reactants. The analysis of present experimental data provides a valuable insight into the interaction between gas and liquid phases for mixing and improves the understanding of intrinsic roles of hydrodynamics upon the reactor design and operating parameter selection.

40|$|The vortex-ingesting {{stirred tank}} reactor uses a {{combination}} of a helical screw impeller and concentric draft-tube to entrain and recycle headspace gas and disperse it as bubbles in a liquid reaction solvent. This study presents an experimental characterisation of a 0. 29 m diameter vortex-ingesting gas-liquid stirred reactor, operated with solids mass fractions from 0 to 25 %, over a range of specific power inputs up to 3 W/kg and for a variety of tank geometries. As was found in previous studies the most important geometric variable is the draft-tube <b>top</b> <b>clearance,</b> since this has the most direct effect on the gas ingestion rate. The presence of low solids fractions causes {{a significant increase in the}} minimum speed required for vortex ingestion of the gas. At low impeller speeds and low solids mass fractions, accumulation of particles in the annulus surrounding the draft-tube reduces the pumping capacity of the impeller. This mechanism also reduces the gas holdup and gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient, although not always in a monotonic fashion. In this design of reactor, aeration results in only a small decrease in the specific power input and so the just-suspended condition is not much affected by the presence of gas...|$|E

In the present work, the effect of geometrical relations on gas holdup and liquid velocity, and consequently on the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient, was studied in a 6 -liter airlift bioreactor with AD/AR = 0. 63; AD, downcomer cross-sectional area, and AR, riser cross-sectional area. Measurements of the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa) were taken in a water-air system using a modified sulfite oxidation method. Different conditions were examined by varying parameters such as superficial air velocity in the riser (UGR), bottom clearance (d 1) and <b>top</b> <b>clearance</b> (d 2). It was observed from the experimental results that d 1 and d 2 have a remarkable effect on kLa values. The effect is due to their influence on gas holdup and liquid velocity, consequently affecting kLa. Superficial air velocity in the riser (UGR) ranged from 0. 0126 to 0. 0440 m. s- 1 and kLa varied between 40 to 250 h- 1, whereas gas holdup (ε) reached values up to 0. 2. The volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa), gas holdup in the riser (εR) and downcomer (εD) and superficial liquid velocity in the riser (ULR) for all the geometrical relations were successfully correlated with dimensionless numbers, namely, the Sherwood number (Sh) and the Froude number (Fr) {{as well as with}} geometrical relations such as the bottom space ratio (B = d 1 /DD) and top space ratio (T = (d 2 + DD) /DD) ...|$|E

40|$|Oneof themost {{important}} factors influencing the overall performance of cylindrical pin-finheat sinks is the bypass phenomenon. Depending upon the total bypass area {{in comparison to}} the flow area between pin fins, {{a significant portion of the}} approaching airflow bypasses the heat sink. In this study, the effects of side and top bypass on the hydraulic and thermal performances of a cylindrical pin-fin heat sink will be investigated in laminar forced convection. Theoretical models, based on laws of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, are developed to predict flow velocity, pressure drop, and heat transfer from the heat sink and the bypass regions. These models will help in determining hydraulic and thermal resistances in each region. Both in-line and staggered arrangements are analyzed in this study. Analytical and empirical correlations are used to determine friction factors and heat transfer coefficients in both arrangements. The effects of thermal spreading and joint resistances are neglected in this study.
