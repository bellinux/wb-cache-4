5|$|A further {{source of}} {{difference}} between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the Anglican communion at her English coronation. Anne had been brought up a Lutheran, but she may have discreetly converted <b>to</b> <b>Catholicism</b> at some point, a politically embarrassing scenario which alarmed ministers of the Scottish Kirk and caused suspicion in Anglican England.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the 1681 Scottish Test Act {{required}} {{all public}} officials and MPs to swear unconditional {{loyalty to the}} King but with the crucial qualifier they 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.' Tolerance for James' personal Catholicism did not extend <b>to</b> <b>Catholicism</b> in general and his failure to understand this resulted in his deposition and exile by the Glorious Revolution.|$|E

After 1612, she suffered sustained bouts of ill health and gradually withdrew from the centre of court life.

No pogrom took place, which was unusual in Europe in the 14th century, according to historian Raphael Patai.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund's {{father and}} uncle were Roman Catholic, {{but his mother}} was Calvinist.

5|$|Virginia {{converted}} <b>to</b> <b>Catholicism</b> in {{fulfillment of}} a promise {{which she had}} made to herself while observing Patrick Breen pray in his cabin.

Ross Browne's story about his severe discomfort upon learning that he was staying with alleged cannibals, printed in Harper's Magazine in 1862. Many of the survivors encountered similar reactions.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{royal decree}} of 1428, Louis I had also ordered that only Catholics be granted {{land in the}} Sebeş {{district}} of Timiş county. As a result of official pressure, many Romanian noblemen converted <b>to</b> <b>Catholicism.</b> For example, {{the members of the}} powerful Drágffy family turned Catholic in the 15thcentury. The Ottomans raided Transylvania {{for the first time in}} 1394. Sigismund I of Hungary (13871437) organized a crusade against them, but the battle of Nicopolis (now Nikopol, Bulgaria) ended in disaster for the Christian forces in 1396.|$|E
5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children <b>to</b> <b>Catholicism.</b> He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E

5|$|As Crown Prince Cảnh {{had died}} of {{smallpox}} during {{the war against the}} Tây Sơn, it was assumed that Cảnh's son would succeed Gia Long, but in 1816 Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, the son of Gia Long's second wife, was appointed instead. Gia Long chose him for his strong character and his deeply conservative aversion to Westerners, whereas Cảnh's lineage had converted <b>to</b> <b>Catholicism</b> and had shunned Confucian traditions such as ancestor worship. Gia Long told his son to treat the Europeans—especially the French—respectfully, but not to grant them any position of preponderance.|$|E

5|$|Diệm deposed head {{of state}} Bảo Đại in a {{fraudulent}} referendum in 1955 and proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam). The VNA thus became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Born into a nominally Buddhist family, Đính had converted <b>to</b> <b>Catholicism</b> {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. The change of religion was widely perceived to be a factor in his rapid promotion above more capable officers. A devout member of the Catholic minority, Diệm dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary and heavily disenfranchised and disadvantaged the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{broke from}} communion with the Catholic Church, over issues {{relating}} to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England.

He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former took the country back <b>to</b> <b>Catholicism</b> while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism.|$|E
