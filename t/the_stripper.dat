5|$|The Whitehall Theatre {{opened in}} 1930 {{at the north}} west end of the street, on a site that had {{previously}} been Ye Old Ship Tavern in the 17th century. The revue Whitehall Follies opened in 1942, which drew controversy over its explicit content featuring <b>the</b> <b>stripper</b> and actress Phyllis Dixey. The theatre became known for its farces, reviving a tradition on Whitehall that had begun with court jesters at the palace during the 16th century. These included several plays featuring actor-manager Brian Rix throughout the 1950s and 60s, and 1981's satirical Anyone for Denis, written by John Wells and Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams. The venue was Grade II listed in 1996, and renamed the Trafalgar Studios in 2004.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. <b>The</b> <b>stripper</b> then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
25|$|Striptease {{involves}} a slow, sensuous undressing. <b>The</b> <b>stripper</b> may prolong the undressing with delaying tactics {{such as the}} wearing of additional clothes or putting clothes or {{hands in front of}} just undressed body parts such as the breasts or genitalia. The emphasis is on the act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement, rather than the state of being undressed. In the past, the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished, though today's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude. The costume <b>the</b> <b>stripper</b> wears before disrobing can form part of the act. In some cases, audience interaction can form part of the act, with audience urging <b>the</b> <b>stripper</b> to remove more clothing, or <b>the</b> <b>stripper</b> approaching the audience to interact with them.|$|E

50|$|The Lusty Lady of San Francisco is {{a notable}} example of {{collectivization}} of <b>strippers</b> in <b>the</b> U.S. When <b>the</b> <b>strippers</b> of <b>the</b> establishment successfully unionized in 1996 through the Erotic Dancers' Alliance, {{the owners of}} the club closed it. In response, <b>the</b> <b>strippers</b> formed a cooperative in 2003 to run the club themselves, now renamed the Looking Glass Collective.|$|R

25|$|It is {{fortunate}} that the urea conversion reaction is slow—because {{if it were}} not it would go into reverse in <b>the</b> <b>stripper.</b> As it is, succeeding stages of the process must be designed to minimize residence times, at least until the temperature reduces {{to the point where the}} reversion reaction is very slow.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium {{carbamate}} {{solutions are}} notoriously corrosive to metallic construction materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steel—especially in the hottest {{parts of the}} plant such as <b>the</b> <b>stripper.</b> Traditionally corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuously injecting {{a small amount of}} oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Because the carbon dioxide feed is recovered from ammonia synthesis gas, it contains traces of hydrogen that can mingle with passivation air to form an explosive mixture if allowed to accumulate.|$|E
50|$|The other simple batch {{distillation}} configuration is <b>the</b> batch <b>stripper.</b> <b>The</b> batch <b>stripper</b> consists of <b>the</b> same parts as the batch rectifier. However, in this case, the charge pot is located above the stripping column.|$|R

When asked about friend and convicted drug dealer Darryl Moore, Jones said that he did not know Moore was a drug dealer and felt surprised and betrayed. Jones also said he did not think he got a fair say in his April meeting with Goodell.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Lim {{returned}} to Kuala Lumpur in July 1966, under his family members' accompaniment. In Malaysia, Lim was alleged for having an extramarital affair with Nelson <b>the</b> <b>stripper,</b> but Lim denied. Nelson also {{spoke to the}} reporters in Australia; she stressed that she and Lim were just ordinary friends {{and that she was}} totally unaware of his whereabouts during his disappearance. Malaysian Parliament opposition members even invited her to Malaysia to answer queries about her relationship with Lim, which she declined; but she said that she could send a pile of photographs of her to them if they wanted.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} {{the action of the}} weapon {{combined}} functions of several different machine guns of the same era. The action consisted of a sliding breech block connected to a rotary crank, which in turn was operated by an off-set connecting rod, driven by the piston rod of the weapon. The feeding system was also unconventional, utilizing a box magazine mounted {{on the left side of}} the gun, holding 10 stripper clips with five rounds each. <b>The</b> <b>stripper</b> clips were fed one at a time through the gun from left to right where the empty clips were ejected (japanese type 11 light machine gun utilised similar feature). It used the rear sight and the barrel of the Krag–Jørgensen rifle.|$|E
50|$|The {{story of}} the video show Darren Styles and Ultrabeat {{entering}} a strip club and <b>the</b> <b>strippers</b> giving them lap dances and teasing them. Rebecca Rudd is also singing in the strip club. The story shows one of <b>the</b> <b>strippers</b> photographing Mike, Chris and Darren in the strip club with Darren's mobile phone and the sending it in a picture message {{to one of his}} contacts. They are then forced to leave in a hurry after the mobile phone starts receiving an incoming call.|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the party}} {{attendees}} expressed displeasure that <b>the</b> <b>strippers</b> had delivered a very short performance despite being paid several hundred dollars apiece to perform. The team captain who had hired <b>the</b> <b>strippers</b> tried to convince the women to {{come back into the}} house and complete the performance. Both women came back into the house, but upon being approached by the player who had earlier held up the broomstick, again refused to perform and locked themselves in the bathroom. By this point, a number {{of the party}} guests had left, and the residents of the house, including David Evans, were asking the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When <b>the</b> <b>strippers</b> left <b>the</b> bathroom and the house for the second time, a resident locked the door so they (and the guests who had left the house) could not get back in.|$|R
25|$|The {{overhead}} {{sour gas}} from <b>the</b> <b>stripper</b> contains hydrogen, methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, propane, and, perhaps, some butane and heavier components. That sour gas {{is sent to}} the refinery's central gas processing plant for removal of the hydrogen sulfide in the refinery's main amine gas treating unit and through a series of distillation towers for recovery of propane, butane and pentane or heavier components. The residual hydrogen, methane, ethane, and some propane is used as refinery fuel gas. The hydrogen sulfide removed and recovered by the amine gas treating unit is subsequently converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit or to sulfuric acid in a wet sulfuric acid process or in the conventional Contact Process.|$|E
25|$|The show's set {{included}} {{a door in}} the background. During the show, Sales would answer {{a knock at the}} door and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: when he opened the door, he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think <b>the</b> <b>stripper</b> image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon back and forth in the doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E

After consulting with [...] "Ben Franklin" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>stripper,</b> Michael decides to tell Jan about the lap dance. However, Jan is less upset by his unfaithfulness to her than by his violation of company policy. Relieved, Michael makes lovey dovey talk to Jan even as she suggests firing him over the incident.|$|E

Tom seems so cheery that Leslie begins to suspect he is faking being sad. Ron pulls Tom aside and asks whether he could ask Wendy on a date once the divorce is finalized. Tom consents, but is visibly disappointed. Determined to cheer him up, Leslie agrees to compromise her morals and take Tom to his favorite strip club, the Glitter Factory. Leslie is horrified by the club and tries to encourage <b>the</b> <b>strippers</b> to change their lives. Ron is also uninterested in <b>the</b> <b>strippers,</b> but happily consumes the free breakfast buffet.|$|R

At the bachelorette party, with the current and former female employees plus Angela's sister Rachael (Rachael Harris), the group is shocked to see that <b>the</b> <b>stripper</b> hired for entertainment is Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) son Jake (Spencer Daniels). Angela is then kidnapped by Dwight's cousin Mose (Michael Schur). After hearing about Angela's kidnapping, Dwight and the male employees visit the bar that Kevin owns, where Dwight, at Jim's insistence to bury the hatchet, is forced to apologize to Kevin and confirm that his firing was not personal but based solely on his job performance, which cheers him up. The two decide to make amends. Mose then leads Dwight and Jim out to his car where Angela is stuck in the trunk and finally let out.|$|E

500|$|Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles reprised {{their roles}} as Jack and Judy Geller. The set for the Geller house was used {{previously}} in [...] "The One Where Joey Moves Out", for Jack's birthday party and in the season seven episode [...] "The One Where Rosita Dies", when Ross and Monica visit their parent's garage. The flashback in Thanksgiving 1987 was Monica and Chandler's first meeting along with Rachel and Chandler. Bright commented that the show tries not to contradict itself; [...] "once we establish something, {{we try not to}} undo it." [...] In [...] "The Pilot" [...] it appears Rachel meets Chandler for the first time. She also meets him in a later flashback episode, [...] "The One Where <b>The</b> <b>Stripper</b> Cries". To excuse the continuity error, Bright adds they do not remember each other meeting because they look different.|$|E
500|$|After the {{publication}} of the [...] "Dear Boss" [...] letter, [...] "Jack the Ripper" [...] supplanted [...] "Leather Apron" [...] as the name adopted by the press and public to describe the killer. The name [...] "Jack" [...] was already used to describe another fabled London attacker: [...] "Spring-heeled Jack", who supposedly leapt over walls to strike at his victims and escape as quickly as he came. The invention and adoption of a nickname for a particular killer became standard media practice with examples such as the Axeman of New Orleans, the Boston Strangler, and the Beltway Sniper. Examples derived from Jack the Ripper include the French Ripper, the Düsseldorf Ripper, the Camden Ripper, the Blackout Ripper, Jack <b>the</b> <b>Stripper,</b> the Yorkshire Ripper, and the Rostov Ripper. Sensational press reports combined with the fact that no one was ever convicted of the murders have confused scholarly analysis and created a legend that casts a shadow over later serial killers.|$|E
500|$|Mansfield's {{public persona}} and career image became another subject in popular culture. Francesca Lia Block's Weetzie Bat books often refer to Mansfield; their {{characters}} Dirk and Weetzie watch The Girl Can't Help It, and the Witch Baby's mother {{is part of}} a sinister cult that masquerades as a Jayne Mansfield fan club. In Lynda Curnyn's 2004 novel, Bombshell, the character Grace is advised not to become a Jayne Mansfield when it is suspected that she is pregnant without a boyfriend or a husband. Mansfield's films and events of her life also became subjects of inspiration in popular culture. In the 1963 movie, <b>The</b> <b>Stripper,</b> the aspiring stripper Lila Green, played by Joanne Woodward, is mistaken as Mansfield. In the 2005 novel Who Wrote the Book of Love? by Lee Siegel, Lucky Lee, an American boy in Southern California in the 1950s, becomes infatuated with Marilyn Monroe and Mansfield in his journey through sexual enlightenment. In the book Lucky Lee uses famous quotes from films and literature - like [...] "Wow! What a body!" [...] and [...] "Me Tarzan, you Jayne!" [...] In the book it is spelled Jayne instead of Jane, to make a pun to allude to Mansfield. Dutch writer Jan Cremer wrote a large part of his autobiographical novel I, Jan Cremer– III about their relationship.|$|E
