5|$|Hill censer: The hill censer, {{a vessel}} used for burning incense, {{dates to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). The censers are shaped like {{mountains}} and were used for religious rituals. The shape of the hill censer acts as a visual aid for envisioning the sacred mountains that {{were said to have}} been inhabited by Taoist immortals. Hill censers were originally designed for Taoist rituals, but were later used by Chinese Buddhists. Hill censers often include carvings of wilds animals and birds. Some censers depict waves at the foundation of the vessel, said to be the waves of the East China Sea. A hole {{at the top of the}} censer releases <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> the incense.|$|E

25|$|A common belief among users is that <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> a hookah (waterpipe, narghile) is {{significantly}} less dangerous than that from cigarettes. The water moisture {{induced by the}} hookah makes the smoke less irritating and may give {{a false sense of}} security and reduce concerns about true health effects. Doctors at institutions including the Mayo Clinic have stated that use of hookah can be as detrimental to a person's health as smoking cigarettes, and a study by the World Health Organization also confirmed these findings.|$|E
25|$|The New Testament makes several typological {{references}} to incense, including a Christological {{reference to the}} coals from the altar of incense taken behind the veil on the Day of Atonement (Hebrews 9:3-4), and {{a reference to the}} prayers of believers as incense (Revelation 8:4). In later Christian typology <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> incense in the tabernacle typically signifies offered prayer. This was developed in medieval Christian art. In the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church incense is still used in liturgical rites as well as in some popular devotions outside of church liturgies.|$|E
25|$|Each hookah session {{typically}} lasts {{more than}} 40 minutes, {{and consists of}} 50 to 200 inhalations that each range from 0.15 to 0.50 liters of smoke. In an hour-long smoking session of hookah, users consume about 100 to 200 times <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> a single cigarette; A study in the Journal of Periodontology found that water pipe smokers were marginally more likely than regular smokers {{to show signs of}} gum disease, showing rates 5-fold higher than non-smokers rather than the 3.8-fold risk that regular smokers show. According to USA Today, people who smoked water pipes had five times the risk of lung cancer of non-smokers.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we build}} the {{relational}} models between <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier and <b>the</b> flow of gas, {{the depth and}} mean temperature <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer in critical value, respectively. These models {{are based on the}} analysis of gas flow in narrow space <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier which is combined with the classic Hydraulic Jump model in the field of mechanics. For different initial conditions of gas, we simulate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier height on flue gas flow via the fire dynamics simulation software FDS. The results show that: the air entrainment and <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer in critical value are decreasing constantly while the critical mean temperature <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer is raising during the increasing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier. Thus, when it gets the zero value, the air entrainment and <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer in critical value will get the maximum and the critical mean temperature <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer will get the minimum. And when <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier greater than or equal the value of z_ 0, the value of air entrainment will be zero...|$|R

25|$|In 1982, {{one year}} after the initial destruction, the {{community}} sponsored Jaffna Public Library Week and collected thousands of books. Repairs on parts of the building were in progress when the Black July pogrom-induced civil conflict began in 1983. By 1984, the library was fully renovated; however, the library was damaged by bullets and bombs. The military forces were stationed in the Dutch fort and the rebels positioned themselves inside the library creating a no man's land as the fighting intensified. In 1985, after an attack on a nearby police station by Tamil rebels, soldiers entered the partially restored building and set off bombs that shredded thousands of books yet again. The library was abandoned with its shell and bullet-pocked walls, blackened with <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> burnt books.|$|E
25|$|The {{footbridge}} to {{the south}} of the station is also noteworthy and is Grade II-listed in its own right. The railway line bisected Kew, {{but it was not until}} 1912 that the bridge was provided to allow residents to cross the tracks safely. It is a rare surviving example of a reinforced concrete structure built using a pioneering technique devised by the French engineer François Hennebique. The bridge has a narrow deck and very high walls, originally designed to protect its users' clothing from <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> steam trains passing underneath. It also has protrusions on either side of the deck to deflect smoke away from the bridge structure. It was restored in 2004 with a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, in a project led by The Kew Society. In July 2017, concerns were expressed about the structural safety of the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the crash}} on Stanley Hill {{approximately}} 150 yards inside the southeast boundary of Fort McClellan, the survivors exited the airplane as a fire developed. Survivor Sgt. Dennis Lachut of Fort Lewis, Washington, limped {{three miles from}} the crash site through steep, wooded terrain and {{was taken to a}} nearby residence by the driver of a passing pickup truck. The Anniston airport manager was notified by GP Express that the plane did not arrive and could not be reached approximately 11 minutes after the scheduled arrival time; however, this information was not shared with local search and rescue authorities. A search was not started until Sgt. Lachut directed rescuers toward the crash site around noon. Rescuers arrived on foot about 2:15 p.m. and evacuated the remaining survivors by four-wheel-drive vehicle to Northeast Alabama Regional Medical Center in Anniston. Heavy rains at the time made travel difficult, obscured visibility, and also quickly knocked down the post-accident fire, <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> which may have alerted authorities to the crash and approximate location more quickly.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>smoke</b> point <b>of</b> any oil {{is defined}} by the {{temperature}} at which light blue <b>smoke</b> rises from <b>the</b> surface. <b>The</b> <b>smoke,</b> which contains acrolein, is an eye irritant and asphixiant. <b>The</b> <b>smoke</b> point <b>of</b> oils vary widely. Depending on origin, refinement, age, and source growth conditions, <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> point for any given type of oil can drop nearly 20 °C. For example, <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> point <b>of</b> olive oil can vary from being suitable for high temperature frying to only safely used for stir frying. As a cooking oil is refined its smoke point increases. This is because many of the impurities found in natural oils aid in their breakdown. In general the lighter the oil, <b>the</b> higher its <b>smoke</b> point. It is important to choose the appropriate oil for each cooking technique and temperature as cooking oils degrade rapidly when heated about their smoke point. It is recommended that oils heated beyond their smoke point should not be consumed as the chemicals created are suspected carcinogens.|$|R

25|$|On 21 March 1813, Devon took {{eight men}} and his 12-year-old brother, Midshipman Frederick Devon, in Brev Dragerens gig. William Dunbar, Master of Blazer, took 11 men in Blazers cutter. Together the two boats went up river {{in search of}} a {{privateer}} reported to be in the area. Off the Danish port of Brunsbuttel they sighted two boats, one of which hailed them, ran up Danish colours and opened fire, fortunately {{over the heads of the}} British. Devon boarded the gunboat in <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> her second broadside, and possibly the explosion of some cartridges on her deck, and captured her. Blazers cutter came up and together the British sailors succeeded in imprisoning the Danish crew below deck. The gunboat turned out to be the Jonge-Troutman. She was under the command of Lieutenant Lutkin, had a crew of 25 men and carried two 18-pounders and three 12-pounders. Dunbar and the cutter then turned their attention to the second gunboat, the Liebe, and captured her too. She was under the command of Lieutenant Writt and had the same establishment as the Jonge-Troutman. The British suffered no casualties and the Danes suffered two wounded.|$|E
25|$|Mist and cloud made air {{observation}} difficult {{on the morning}} of 16 August, until a wind began later in the day, although this blew <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> battle over the German lines, obscuring German troop movements. Corps squadrons were expected to provide artillery co-operation, contact and counter-attack patrols but low cloud, mist and smoke that morning resulted in most German counter-attack formations moving unnoticed. Flash-spotting of German artillery was much more successful and many more flares were lit by the infantry, when called for by the crews of contact aeroplanes. Army squadrons, Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and French aircraft flew over the lines and attacked German aerodromes, troops and transport as far as the weather allowed. V Brigade tried to co-ordinate air operations over the battlefield with the infantry attack. Two De Havilland D.H.5 aircraft per division were provided, to engage any German strongpoints interfering with the infantry attack on the final objective. Two small formations of fighters were to fly low patrols, {{on the far side of}} the final objective of the Fifth Army, from the beginning of the attack for six hours, to break up German attempts to counter-attack and to stop equivalent German contact-patrols.|$|E
25|$|Swadesh Deepak {{started his}} journey in the {{literary}} world, {{when he was about}} 14 years (factually born in 1939). After partition of India in 1947, the family settled in Rajpura Town, where Swadesh Deepak completed his matriculation and would travel by train to Ambala City and Cantt for his graduation and Post Graduation studies (in English and Hindi). The seeds of his grim, dark story telling and the characters always carrying a loaded Gun, were sown during the partition of India, in blood bath, when he watched his father, a teacher of Urdu and Persian, taking to gun to save his village from the onslaught of marauding crowds of looters; along with few friends of his, who also owned guns; thus kept the hordes of looters at bay from their roof tops, for about 7 days and nights. Swadesh and his elder sister watched many people falling dead or being maimed. It was the Gurkhas regiment from the Indian Army which saved all the Hindu families of the village and brought them to India; in a Refugee Camp of Tents in the city of Kurukshetra. After reaching India, his father suffered from tuberculosis due to <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder and dust which had affected his lungs. Father was in a Sanatorium for about 5 years, where one of his lung was removed. The family was taken care of by the maternal grandfather, and brought to Ambala City (Baldev Nagar Camp, built by the displaced populace). When his father joined back,the family shifted permanently to Rajpura Town, which was constructed by the refugees from Bahawalpur, Rawalpindi, Balochistan and Multan, with the help of Indian Govt.|$|E
