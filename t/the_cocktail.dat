5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{preparation}} of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly {{dates back to the}} 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> {{in the latter part of}} the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.|$|E

5|$|Chile and Peru both {{claim the}} pisco sour as their {{national}} drink, and each asserts {{ownership of the}} cocktail's base liquor—pisco; consequently, the pisco sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of Latin American popular culture. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations {{in the style of}} preparing the pisco sour are distinct in both production and taste. Peru celebrates a yearly public holiday in honor of <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> during the first Saturday of February.|$|E
5|$|Robotron: 2084 was commercially successful; Williams sold {{approximately}} 19,000arcade cabinets, and mini {{cabinets and}} cocktail versions were later produced. The different arcade versions have since become {{varying levels of}} rarity; <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> and cabaret versions are very rare, while the upright cabinets are more available. It {{is one of the}} most collected arcade games, and is consistently higher priced than other titles among collectors.|$|E
5|$|Variations of the pisco sour {{exist in}} Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. There are adaptations of <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> in Peru using fruits such as maracuya, aguaymanto, and apples, or {{traditional}} ingredients {{such as the}} coca leaf. In Chile, variants include the Ají Sour (with a spicy green chili), Mango Sour (with mango juice), and Sour de Campo (with ginger and honey). In Bolivia, the Yunqueño variant (from its Yungas region) replaces the lime with orange juice.|$|E
50|$|Campari is an {{essential}} ingredient in <b>the</b> classic Negroni <b>cocktail,</b> <b>the</b> Garibaldi <b>cocktail,</b> <b>the</b> Americano (which was named {{at a time when}} few Americans were aware of Campari), and the spritz (an aperitif popular in northern Italy).|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} <b>cocktails,</b> <b>the</b> {{origin of the}} Godfather's name is uncertain. The amaretto brand Disaronno claims the drink was <b>the</b> {{favorite}} <b>cocktail</b> of American actor Marlon Brando, known for playing the titular character in the popular American film adaptation of Mario Puzo's The Godfather, which prominently features the Italian mob. This may be an allusion to <b>the</b> <b>cocktail's</b> prominent use of amaretto, an Italian liqueur.|$|R

Walter Caesar also became the first caesar mix in Canada {{to be approved by}} Ocean Wise by using ocean-friendly clam juice from the North Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|From August 29 to September 1, 2013, {{a series}} of events were held in Mansfield, Ohio, to {{celebrate}} the 20th anniversary of the film. The events included a screening of the film at the Renaissance Theatre, where it originally premiered, tours of some of the filming locations, and a cocktail at the Ohio State Reformatory which served as Shawshank State Penitentiary for the film. <b>The</b> <b>cocktail</b> party was attended by Gunton, Scott Mann and James Kisicki, who signed autographs and shared stories with the fans. Darabont sent a video greeting the fans who celebrated the anniversary. More than 6,000 fans of the film attended these events.|$|E
5|$|Historian Luis Alberto Sánchez writes that, after Morris {{closed his}} bar, {{some of his}} {{bartender}}s left to work in other locales. Bruiget began working as a bartender for the nearby Grand Hotel Maury, where he continued to serve his pisco sour recipe. His success with the drink led local Limean oral tradition to associate the Hotel Maury as the original home of the pisco sour. As other former apprentices of Morris found other work, they also spread the pisco sour recipe. During the 1930s the drink made its way into California, reaching bars {{as far north as}} the city of San Francisco. By at least the late 1960s <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> also found its way to New York.|$|E

5|$|In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath {{attributed}} {{the invention of}} the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb {{the invention of the}} whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E
5|$|The Bulletin {{noted that}} a 2011 edition of the drink {{produced}} in Oregon was made with bacon vodka manufactured on site at the restaurant The Blacksmith. A report by The Sarasota Herald-Tribune in April 2012 observed that a variety on <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> made by mixologist Paul Yeomans in Florida was concocted utilizing bacon salt and tomato water, infused with cucumber vodka. This version was a favorite selection among customers at The Table Creekside in Sarasota, Florida. The Food Network recommended additional ingredients including lemon juice, bourbon, Worcestershire sauce, and horseradish.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by David M. Stern and {{directed}} by Neil Affleck. The revelation of Ned's age was heavily debated between the Simpsons staff, and the decision to make him 60 years old could have been inspired from a joke by Simpsons writer Ron Hauge. A scene in the episode features the song Viva Las Vegas by Elvis Presley, although the staff originally wanted {{a version of the}} song performed by Bruce Springsteen. The Moody Blues guest-starred as themselves in the episode, and the episode marked the first appearance of <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> waitresses Amber and Ginger, who were voiced by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille respectively.|$|E

5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E
5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the game}} was slow to gain popularity. Defender did not attract much {{attention}} at the 1980 AMOA show. In retrospect, Jarvis believed many passersby were intimidated by its complexity. The game, however, was well received in arcades, and crowds gathered around the cabinet during its first nights of play testing. The success spurred Williams to release a cocktail version as well. Defender eventually became Williams' best selling arcade game, with over 55,000units sold worldwide. By 2004, {{the game was}} a popular collector's item; the upright cabinets were common, while <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> models were more rare. Since its release, it {{has become one of}} the highest grossing arcade games ever, earning over US$1billion. Williams employee Larry Demar was surprised at the game's popularity, stating that it was the only game he'd seen able to earn that quantity of quarters. Six months after its release, the game was one of the top earners in the United States video game industry. Mark Stearny of JoyStik magazine called Defender the most successful game in 1981, commenting that it outperformed Pac-Man.|$|E

5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of <b>the</b> <b>cocktail</b> napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.|$|E

5000|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{invention}} of <b>the</b> Prawn <b>Cocktail</b> is often credited to British television chef Fanny Cradock in the 1960s; however, {{it is more likely}} that Cradock merely popularised her version of an established dish that was not well known until then in Britain.
