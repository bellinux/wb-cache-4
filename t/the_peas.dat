However, this tends to affect taste, texture and nutritional content, and is no longer common.

Baking soda may react with acids in food, including vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid). It is also used in breading such as for fried foods to enhance crispness and allow passages for steam to escape, so the breading is not blown off during cooking.|$|E

2500|$|In the Southern United States, eating {{black-eyed peas}} or Hoppin' John (a {{traditional}} soul food) on New Year's Day {{is thought to}} bring prosperity in the new year. <b>The</b> <b>peas</b> are typically cooked with a pork product for flavoring (such as bacon, fatback, ham bones, or hog jowls) and diced onion, and served with a hot chili sauce or a pepper-flavored vinegar.

2500|$|The common {{commercial}} {{variety is}} called the California Blackeye; it is pale-colored with a prominent black spot. In the American South there are countless varieties, many of them heirloom, that vary in size from the small lady peas to very large ones, as {{may be seen in}} the state and municipal farmers' markets. [...] The color of the eye may be black, brown, red, pink or green. [...] All <b>the</b> <b>peas</b> are green when freshly shelled and brown or buff when dried. [...] A popular variation of the black-eyed pea is the purple hull pea; it is usually green with a prominent purple or pink spot. The currently accepted botanical name for the black-eyed pea is Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata, although previously it was classified in the genus Phaseolus. [...] Vigna unguiculata subsp. dekindtiana is the wild relative and [...] Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis is the related asparagus bean. Other beans of somewhat similar appearance, such as the frijol ojo de cabra (goat's eye bean) of northern Mexico, are sometimes incorrectly called black-eyed peas, and vice versa.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>peas</b> of the Tall Sugar-pea, when dry, are pale greenish-brown, thickly {{covered with}} dots of dark purple so minute {{as to be}} visible only through a lens, and Mr. Laxton has never seen or heard of this variety {{producing}} a purple pea; but in the crossed pod one of <b>the</b> <b>peas</b> was of a uniform beautiful violet-purple tint, and a second was irregularly clouded with pale purple. The colour lies in the outer of the two coats which surround the pea. As <b>the</b> <b>peas</b> of the purple-podded variety when dry are of a pale greenish-buff, it would at first appear that this remarkable change of colour in <b>the</b> <b>peas</b> in the crossed pod {{could not have been}} caused by the direct action of the pollen of the purple-pod: but when we bear in mind that this latter variety has purple flowers, purple marks on its stipules, and purple pods; and that the Tall Sugar-pea likewise has purple flowers and stipules, and microscopically minute purple dots on <b>the</b> <b>peas,</b> we can hardly doubt that the tendency to the production of purple in both parents has in combination modified the colour of <b>the</b> <b>peas</b> in the crossed pod. After having examined these specimens, I crossed the same two varieties, and <b>the</b> <b>peas</b> in one pod but not the pods themselves, were clouded and tinted with purplish-red in a much more conspicuous manner than <b>the</b> <b>peas</b> in the uncrossed pods produced at the same time by the same plants. I may notice as a caution that Mr. Laxton sent me various other crossed peas slightly, or even greatly, modified in colour; but the change in these cases was due, as had been suspected by Mr. Laxton, to the altered colour of the cotyledons, seen through the transparent coats of the peas; and as the cotyledons are parts of the embryo, these cases are not in any way remarkable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Identifying key yield {{components}} {{can help}} establish better crop management strategies to increase crop yield. The present {{research was conducted}} in south-western Saskatchewan in 1999 and 2000 to determine the interrelationships among various yield components and their direct and indirect effects of each component on seed yield of field pea (Pisum sativum L.). The semi-leafless cultivar Carrera was planted at the populations 2 of 35, 50, 65 and 80 plants m on conventional summerfallow (CS) and no-till wheat stubble (NT). The coefficients (b values) from path analyses revealed that the seed yield of field pea depended primarily upon total number of pods per unit area (b = 1. 41 for <b>the</b> <b>pea</b> on CS and 1. 39 on NT) and secondarily upon seeds per pod (b = 0. 59 for <b>the</b> <b>pea</b> on CS and 0. 44 on NT). The association between weight per seed and yield was either weak (b = 0. 14 for <b>the</b> <b>pea</b> on CS) or negligible (b = 0. 07 for <b>the</b> <b>pea</b> on NT). Among the various yield-related variables, total number of pods per unit area was the greatest yield contributor that largely relied on plants m 2 1 (b = 1. 35 for <b>the</b> <b>pea</b> on CS and 0. 97 on NT) and on pods plant (b = 0. 78 for <b>the</b> <b>pea</b> on CS and 0. 74 on NT) ...|$|R
