A nonspinning three-axis {{stabilized}} space vehicle having a two-dimensional large structure and a rigid {{body at the}} center is chosen for analysis. The <b>torquers</b> acting on the vehicle are modeled as antisymmetric forces distributed in a small but finite area. In the limit they represent point <b>torquers</b> which also are treated as a special case of surface distribution of dipoles. Ordinary and partial differential equations governing the forced vibrations of the vehicle are derived by using Hamilton's principle.

If level, {{the final phase of}} alignment is switched on; gyrocompassing.The stable element is exactly level and Schuler-tuned but the gyros are not yet aligned with the earth rotation axis. Therefore the stable element tends to turn off-level, which is sensed by the Y accelerometer which signal is fed to the gyro <b>torquer</b> to rotate the azimuth axis of the stable element. This process continues for a few minutes until the correction signal is getting smaller and can be kept almost zero for 50 seconds, which gives confidence that the system is level and aligned. This is visible for the pilot because the green Nav light flashes.|$|E

The sensor fusion algorithm used {{is based on}} an alternative implementation of Wahba’s problem, in order to accommodate gyro measurements, as introduced in. This implementation uses a virtual vector base, propagated by the gyro reading, fused with the vectors provided by the sun sensor and the magnetometer, as per Wahba’s problem. This forms essentially a complementary filter in SO(3) between the gyro and the vector measurements. The reference vectors in ECI frame are calculated by and IGRF model, respectively, given the satellites position is known by the GPS and SGP4 model.The control system is based on a spin <b>torquer,</b> which is used as a reaction wheel for pitch control and also to stiffen roll and yaw to the satellite's orbit plane (Gyroscopic torque and momentum bias).

40|$|Magnetic <b>torquers</b> are {{specifically}} designed to generate a magnetic field onboard the satellites for their attitude control. A control torque is generated when the magnetic fields generated by the magnetic <b>torquers</b> couple with the geomagnetic fields, whereby the vector of the generated torque is perpendicular to both the magnetic fields. In this paper, two control algorithms for a momentum bias satellite implementing two and three magnetic <b>torquers</b> onboard have been developed. The structured algorithms are for an optimum torque generation and eventually controlling the satellite attitudes (roll/yaw) and nutation using a proportional (P) controller as well as managing the excess angular momentum via a proportional-integral (PI) controller. The developed control algorithms were tested using the complex and simplified geomagnetic field models for a LEO satellite mission in a nominal attitude operation. Their attitude torque generation performances were compared and {{it is found that}} the optimum torques can be generated by both the developed control algorithms.

30|$|From unit-level {{measurements}} and examinations {{of the magnetic}} noise prior to the system-level measurement, we determined that battery charging and the magnetic <b>torquer</b> generate time-varying magnetic noise over the required level. During the system-level spacecraft function test in the shielding room, noise from the spacecraft exceeded the environmental noise when the battery was fast-charging and when the magnetic <b>torquer</b> was in operation. Field variation generated by the battery charging current had an amplitude of ~  6  nT at 2.5  m from the spacecraft center, corresponding to an amplitude of ~  0.5  nT {{at the tip of}} the deployed MAST. Variation during <b>torquer</b> operation was about 70 times larger. Therefore, caution is warranted when using data acquired during fast battery charging after an eclipse and at all times when using data acquired during <b>torquer</b> operation, which occurs at perigee in every orbital revolution.|$|E

Magnetometer Sensing System calibration and Coarse Attitude determination testing with the new calibration parameters is a geometrical problem. Telemetered earth magnetic field data was collected at twenty-six different vehicle attitudes. The spacecraft attitudes selected were distributed as widely apart as possible throughout the Geocentric Inertial Coordinate reference frame. It is also desirable to sample the Earth's magnetic field over as many different locations of the spacecraft's passage over the Earth as possible, within the limitation of the +/- 28. 5 deg orbital inclination. A full range of magnetic moment outputs from the <b>torquer</b> bars needs to be sampled, +/- 3600 ampmeters squared, as well as data when the <b>torquer</b> bars have zero current.

For the stabilization of elastic oscillations, a linear feedback <b>torquer</b> control law u(s) is obtained applying linear quadratic optimization to the linearized arm model augmented with a servocompensator about the terminal state.

A <b>torquer</b> control law, which {{is a function of the}} trajectory error, is derived for controlling the joint angles. The knowledge of the system dynamics is not required for the derivation of the controller. This controller includes a reference model to generate command joint angle trajectories, and a dynamic system in the feedback path which requires only joint angle and rate for feedback. The <b>torquer</b> controller asymptotically decouples the elastic dynamics into two subsystems, representing the transverse vibration of the elastic link in two orthogonal planes. For the damping of the elastic vibration, a force control law using modal velocity feedback is synthesized.

40|$|Early {{telemetry}} {{from the}} spin-stabilized IMAGE spacecraft {{indicated that the}} vehicle’s initial nutation was not decaying. This behavior was especially puzzling because the spacecraft’s passive nutation damper behaved as expected while IMAGE {{was attached to the}} spinning upper stage. The lack of damping was also puzzling because the damper was a tubular ring partially filled with liquid mercury; a simple, reliable device with a long flight history. In a partially-filled ring damper, the excess kinetic energy associated with nutation is dissipated by fluid viscosity when inertial forces cause the liquid to move through the tube. However, post-launch analysis indicated that the IMAGE damper liquid was immobilized by surface tension. This was an unanticipated consequence of the vehicle’s low spin rate. When it became apparent that passive damping did not work, a ground-commanded open-loop damper was developed using the spacecraft's magnetic <b>torquer</b> and onboard logic that was intended for ground test of the <b>torquer.</b> This work-around successfully resolved the IMAGE nutation damping problem...|$|E

40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{is renowned}} for its superb {{pointing}} accuracy of less than 10 milli-arcseconds absolute pointing error. To accomplish this, the HST relies on its complement of four reaction wheel assemblies (RWAs) for attitude control and four magnetic <b>torquer</b> bars (MTBs) for momentum management. As with most satellites with reaction wheel control, the fourth RWA provides for fault tolerance to maintain three-axis pointing capability should a failure occur and a wheel is lost from operations. If an additional failure is encountered, the ability to maintain three-axis pointing is jeopardized. In order to prepare for this potential situation, HST Pointing Control Subsystem (PCS) Team developed a Two Reaction Wheel Science (TRS) control mode. This mode utilizes two RWAs and four magnetic <b>torquer</b> bars to achieve three-axis stabilization and pointing accuracy necessary for a continued science observing program.

40|$|TUBSAT- 1 (Technical University Berlin Satellite) is an {{experimental}} low-cost satellite being {{financed by the}} German BMFT. The dimensions and weight {{are determined by the}} NASA Gas-Program and it will be ejected from the Space Shuttle within the German spacelab mission D 2 by December 19, 1991, into a 298 km circular orbit and at a 28. 5 ° inclination. To enable a large variety of useful experiments to fly with TUSSAT, it was necessary to develop a rather precise attitude control and stabilization (ACS) system. The ACS should be low cost, flexible (in view of changing ACS modes and parameters during the mission time), minimum component number and a low power consumption. A sun/star orientation with an additional spin mode was chosen and developed. The system is based on a microcomputer, fixed momentum wheel (FMW), one magnetic <b>torquer,</b> one sun and two star sensors. The closed loop pitch control consists of FMW, sun and star (for the eclipse phase) sensors, achieving a pitch pointing accuracy of 0. 26 ° for any slew maneuver by using momentum transfer from the wheel to the satellite. Control of the wheel momentum (desaturation) without affecting the pitch axis orientation can be accomplished by executing a pitch slew maneuver. Positioning the magnetic <b>torquer</b> (which is mounted perpendicular to the pitch axis) to interact with the geomagnetic field vector. The pitch axis reorientation maneuver due to interaction between the magnetic <b>torquer</b> and the magnetic field vector component can be controlled by the one axis star sensor (roll/yaw rotation).
