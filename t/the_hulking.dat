5|$|Fallout 3 {{takes place}} in the year 2277, and within the region that covers most of the ruined city of Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and parts of Maryland. The game's {{landscape}} includes war-ravaged variants of numerous real-life landmarks such as the White House, the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, Arlington National Cemetery and the Washington Monument, with a small number of settlements dotted around the Capital Wastelands that consist of descendants of survivors from the Great War, including one that surrounds an unexploded bomb, another consisting primarily of ghoul inhabitants, and another formed within <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> remains of an aircraft carrier. While the city can be explored, much of the interior zones are cut off by giant rubble over many of the roads leading in, meaning that access can only be achieved by using the city's former underground metro tunnels (loosely based on the real-life Washington Metro).|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} film, {{criminal}} leader and drug addict Kane underwent a similar treatment; he became <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> and nearly indestructible Robocop II, {{but was still}} psychotic and addicted to the drug Nuke.|$|E
25|$|Erasmus {{introduces}} the player character, the Hero, to the Greece-like kingdom of Silmaria, whose king was recently assassinated. Thus, the traditional Rites of Rulership {{are due to}} commence, and the victor will be crowned king. The Hero enters the contest {{with the assistance of}} Erasmus, Rakeesh, and many old friends from previous entries in the series. The Hero competes against competitors, including the Silmarian guard Kokeeno Pookameeso, the warlord Magnum Opus, <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> Gort, and the warrior Elsa Von Spielburg.|$|E
60|$|The {{audience}} was strange to us. The Indians, half-breeds, French-Canadians; <b>the</b> huge, <b>hulking,</b> bearded farmers or traders, or trappers, whatever they were, were new to our baseball experience.|$|R
50|$|Remy {{has become}} more isolated. He is invited for a drink by Scott Moss, a white {{supremacist}} neo-Nazi skinhead, along with Scott's skinhead friends: Erik, James, and <b>the</b> weight-lifting, <b>hulking</b> Knocko.|$|R
60|$|Upon her reveries {{the door}} opened and a burly warrior {{appeared}} in <b>the</b> opening--a <b>hulking</b> fellow, with thick lips and an evil, leering face. The slave girl sprang to her feet, facing him.|$|R
25|$|Gameplay in Battlefront is conquest-based. Each faction has {{a finite}} amount of reinforcements, and each is given {{control of a}} set number of command posts in a given level. The object is to either {{eliminate}} enemy forces or capture and hold all command posts simultaneously for 20 seconds. Several ground and air vehicles {{are available on the}} battlefield. These range from <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> AT-AT to the fast speeder bike and vary based on the level. There are more than 25 vehicles in-game. Some larger vehicles also function as mobile command posts, which cannot be captured, but are lost if the vehicle is destroyed. In addition, some maps have indigenous forces. These can be neutral to both factions, such as Jawas, hostile to one faction, such as Wookies, or hostile to both factions, such as Tusken Raiders. Command posts belonging to hostile natives can also be captured to minimize their presence.|$|E
500|$|After {{destroying}} a drug {{laboratory in}} Latin America, James Bond—Agent 007—travels to Miami Beach to receive instructions from his superior, M, via CIA agent Felix Leiter. He is to observe bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger {{at the hotel}} there. Bond sees Goldfinger cheating at gin rummy and stops him by distracting his employee, Jill Masterson, and blackmailing Goldfinger into losing. After Bond and Jill consummate their new relationship, Bond is knocked out by Goldfinger's Korean manservant, <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> giant Oddjob. When Bond awakens, he finds Jill dead, covered in gold paint, having died from [...] "skin suffocation." ...|$|E
500|$|Chapter six, [...] "New Monsters", {{introduces}} 47 new monsters, {{the weakest}} {{of which is}} the Carcass Eater and the strongest {{of which is the}} Dream Vestige. Newquist praised ooze like Blood Animote, while the Nuketown podcast commended the Swarm templates. Smith praised the Brain in a Jar, swarm-shifter templates, Necropolitan, Revived Fossil and Skulking Cyst, but called <b>the</b> <b>Hulking</b> Corpse and Murk [...] "surprisingly benign". Mike MacKenzie, of RPGnet, called the Skin Kite and Angel of Decay [...] "ghastly", the Revived Fossil and Necropolitan [...] "less interesting" [...] and the Half Vampire an [...] "extraordinarily bad idea".|$|E
60|$|The campfires flamed {{all along}} the lake walk, and the talk of each group could be overheard by any one who listened. Altercations went on with clangorous fury. Almost every party was in division. Some {{enthusiastic}} individual had made a find, or had seen some one else who had. His cackle reached other groups, and out of <b>the</b> dark <b>hulking</b> figures loomed to listen or to throw in hot missiles of profanity. Phrases multiplied, mingling inextricably.|$|R
5000|$|Hooter {{manages to}} repair his {{instrument}} and sends out {{a blast of}} music, providing EO {{with the power to}} throw off the guards. He uses his power to transform <b>the</b> dark <b>hulking</b> guards into agile dancers who fall into step behind him for a dance number, which leads into the song, [...] "We are here to Change the World". As EO presses forward toward the Supreme Leader, she unleashes her Whip Warriors, two cybernetic defenders each with a whip and shield that can deflect EO's power.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If ever I {{meet him}} again,' I roared {{out with an}} oath, 'you shall see {{which is the best}} man of the two. I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is. A man indeed! I'll fight any man--every man! Didn't I stand up to Mick Brady when I was eleven years old?--Didn't I beat Tom Sullivan, <b>the</b> great <b>hulking</b> brute, who is nineteen?--Didn't I do for the Scotch usher? O Nora, it's cruel of you to sneer at me so!' ...|$|R
500|$|Up {{until late}} 1988, Route 33 {{westbound}} ran underneath US 130, then merged with 130's southbound lanes. This was because Route 33 ran parallel to Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) [...] at that point, requiring a massive concrete overpass. (Route 33 eastbound also ascended the bridge approach about halfway before branching off like an exit ramp—a sign with flashing lights read [...] "Hightstown, Shore Points" [...] at the fork.) PRR abandoned the Hightstown–Windsor segment in 1967, reducing {{the importance of}} <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> bridge. NJDOT eventually demolished the crumbling structure in 1989, with its approaches flattened to grade. Route 33 now meets US 130 {{at the north end}} of the multiplex with a traffic signal.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Chris Martins {{praised the}} album, stating that [...] "perhaps most {{impressive}} is that Tyler, The Creator takes a noticeable step {{back so that}} his friends can enjoy the spotlight. When he does show up—standouts include <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> G-funk mutation “Hcapd” and the grungy, bass-addled “P”—both his beats and raps thrill: All of the twisted jokes, tough introspection, and rabble-rousing that fans have come to expect, {{with none of the}} unfortunate rape references his detractors rightly called him on." [...] Allmusic's David Jeffries called album closer [...] "Oldie" [...] epic in nature, stating that Earl Sweatshirt's return was the highlight of the album, summarizing the album as [...] "hype warranted." [...] Beats Per Minute's Craig Jenkin compared the album extensively to prior Odd Future releases, reporting that [...] "it ditches the expansive ooze that made stretches of Tyler’s Goblin a chore, the nihilistic agitprop of MellowHype’s BlackenedWhite, and the lackadaisical drugginess of Mike G’s Ali and Domo’s Rolling Papers in favor of the kind of restless, jerky energy that skyrocketed Bastard into the dialogue months prior." [...] He described the album as something that [...] "mainly sounds like a bunch of dudes in a dank basement cooking up the wildest smack talk possible, with one-upping each other being the primary objective." ...|$|E
500|$|Sam Witwer portrays Davis Bloome, a {{paramedic}} for Metropolis General Hospital. He first {{appears in the}} season eight episode [...] "Plastique", assisting Chloe with helping an injured person after a bomb explosion. In the episode [...] "Toxic", Chloe calls on his help when Oliver is poisoned and refuses {{to be taken to}} a hospital. In [...] "Prey", Clark begins to suspect that Davis is a serial killer after he finds Davis unconscious at one of the murder scenes, and learns later that Davis is usually the first paramedic to arrive on similar scenes. Davis starts to suspect the same thing himself when he begins to lose track of large portions of time, and finds himself covered in blood, but with no wounds on his own body. Davis is informed by Faora, the wife of General Zod, that after the pair learned they could not have children that he was genetically created to adapt to any injury and to be Earth's ultimate destroyer. In [...] "Abyss", Davis confesses to Chloe that he is in love with her, and believes that she is marrying the wrong man; as a result she asks him to not see her again. On Chloe's wedding day, in the episode [...] "Bride", Davis transforms into <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> monster called Doomsday, and travels to Smallville where he injures Jimmy and kidnaps Chloe. In the episode [...] "Infamous", Davis discovers that he can keep Doomsday from emerging if he kills, and subsequently begins choosing criminals as his victims. He subsequently learns that Chloe's presence will also keep the monster at bay in the episode [...] "Turbulence", and in [...] "Beast" [...] Davis and Chloe leave town together so that Davis can keep Doomsday from coming out. In the season eight finale, Chloe uses black kryptonite to separate Davis from Doomsday, leaving him human; when Davis discovers that Chloe does not love him he stabs Jimmy with a pipe. Before Davis can attack Chloe, Jimmy pushes him into a metal rod, which results in Davis's death before Jimmy himself dies.|$|E
50|$|Mongul {{is later}} {{defeated}} on Earth by Wally West (the Flash) when Mongul tries to unearth a starship left {{from one of}} the Darkstars' enemies underneath Keystone City. The Flash easily defeats Mongul. The Flash seemingly uses Mongul to test his new upgraded powers. During the battle, Wally is only hit one time by <b>the</b> giant <b>hulking</b> Mongul. Flash uses his super speed to quickly confuse and defeat Mongul and has him imprisoned in the Slab, a prison for super villains (Flash #102, reprinted in DC Universe Special Superman #1).|$|R
60|$|She shot a side {{glance at}} the man. He was wonderful! The fire of battle had {{transformed}} him. No longer was he <b>the</b> sullen, sulky, <b>hulking</b> brute she had first known upon the Halfmoon. Instead, huge, muscular, alert, he towered above his pygmy antagonists, his gray eyes gleaming, a half-smile upon his strong lips.|$|R
2500|$|This {{innovation}} expertly {{and completely}} circumvents {{all that is}} superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. [...] Yet it ascribes to <b>the</b> Earth, that <b>hulking,</b> lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick {{as that of the}} aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.|$|R
2500|$|According to India Knight, of The Sunday Times, the {{character}} has attained {{the status of}} an unlikely British sex symbol. Knight, writing: [...] "the combination of power and, shall we say, lack of political correctness can be a potent one - which is why everyone in Britain {{fell in love with}} Gene Hunt, <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> great throwback in the BBC series Life on Mars and that men wanted to be Hunt; women wanted to be with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|DeLorean {{and other}} Pontiac {{planners}} saw {{a way to}} reverse the declining sales of the full-sized Grand Prix by creating a new niche in the burgeoning personal luxury car market. Smaller than <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> Cadillac Eldorado and Oldsmobile Toronado, but positioned to be nimbler and more performance oriented than the slightly less bulky Ford Thunderbird and Buick Riviera, the new Grand Prix [...] was designed to outshine the upscale Mercury Cougar XR-7 Pony car and B-bodied performance-oriented Dodge Charger intermediate.|$|E
2500|$|The Orks are a savage, {{brutal and}} warlike species who exist {{to seek the}} thrilling {{challenge}} of battle. While generally lacking in sophisticated technology, they are physically powerful, using brute force and crude weapons that well complement their tendency to attack in massive hordes. In large enough numbers, they gain morale immunity. The tech tree for Orks differs from the other races in that {{it depends on the}} amount of Orks currently in your army and the number of erected WAAAGH!! banners. Several clans are featured in the campaign, as is <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> [...]|$|E
50|$|Gula {{appears as}} a deputy of <b>the</b> Jikochu. A <b>hulking</b> and muscular man with very sharp teeth who likes to eat everything, able to bite through {{anything}} like Cure Rosetta's shield. In episode 31, after being defeated by the Lovely Straight Flush in their combined form, Gula is killed alongside Leva by Bel for his Janergy. His name is Latin for Gluttony.|$|R
50|$|In the Super Mario Bros. live-action film, Goombas were {{originally}} inhabitants of Dinohattan {{who opposed the}} tyrannical King Koopa's rule, and were devolved as punishment for this disloyalty. In the film, upon being de-evolved, these people became Goombas, who were large, reptilian monsters (as opposed to the usual mushroom appearance seen in <b>the</b> games) with <b>hulking</b> bodies and disproportionately small, circular heads, who wore trenchcoats.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> large, <b>hulking</b> form <b>the</b> shapeshifter Martia assumes {{while on}} the surface of Rura Penthe was dubbed [...] "The Brute" [...] by the {{production}} team. The creature's Yeti-like appearance was based on a Smithsonian cover of a marmoset. Also created for the Rura Penthe shoot was a frozen Klingon with a horrified expression. Makeup artist Ed French found a spare Klingon headpiece in Richard Snell's possession and attached it to his own head. A cast of his tortured expression was used as the foundation for the dummy used on location. The designers used striking colors and new techniques for some of the aliens; ultraviolet pigments were used to create a particularly hostile alien that fights Kirk in Rura Penthe.|$|R
2500|$|Later, they {{wrestled}} as The Freedom Fighters (Hellwig {{was known}} as Justice and Borden was called Flash) in Memphis' Continental Wrestling Association under manager Dutch Mantel. Hellwig and Steve Borden (who later had success as [...] "Sting"), formed a tag team called The Blade Runners; Hellwig was [...] "Blade Runner Rock" [...] and Borden was [...] "Blade Runner Flash". Debuting in the Memphis, Tennessee-based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) promotion, run by Jerry Jarrett, the team played baby faces at first, but fans were actually slow to take to <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> duo in a territory that had featured sympathetic [...] "good guy tag teams" [...] like the Rock 'n' Roll Express and The Fabulous Ones.|$|E
60|$|Something in her {{appearance}} troubled <b>the</b> <b>hulking,</b> blundering man. He {{could not have}} told what it was. I think it was simply this--that Grizel no longer sat erect in her chair.|$|E
60|$|To {{make the}} next town, after this delay, she had to drive for hours by night through <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> pines of the {{national}} forest. It was her first long night drive.|$|E
60|$|One day as {{the young}} gentlemen were {{assembled}} in the study at the Rev. Mr. Veal's, and the domestic chaplain to the Right Honourable the Earl of Bareacres was spouting away as usual, a smart carriage {{drove up to the}} door decorated with the statue of Athene, and two gentlemen stepped out. The young Masters Bangles rushed to the window with a vague notion that their father might have arrived from Bombay. <b>The</b> great <b>hulking</b> scholar of three-and-twenty, who was crying secretly over a passage of Eutropius, flattened his neglected nose against the panes and looked at the drag, as the laquais de place sprang from the box and let out the persons in the carriage.|$|R
6000|$|It is {{the best}} way of getting the godlike Trojan out of the scrape, don't you see? The nodus is cut; Tom is out of chancery; the Benicia Boy not a bit the worse, nay, better than if he had beaten the little man. He has not the humiliation of conquest. He is greater, and will be loved more {{hereafter}} by the gentle sex. Suppose he had overcome the godlike Trojan? Suppose he had tied Tom's corpse to his cab-wheels, and driven to Farnham, smoking the pipe of triumph? Faugh! <b>the</b> great <b>hulking</b> conqueror! Why did you not hold your hand from yonder hero? Everybody, I say, was relieved by that opportune appearance of the British gods, protectors of native valor, who interfered, and [...] "withdrew" [...] their champion.|$|R
50|$|Tycho admired {{aspects of}} Copernicus's heliocentric {{model of the}} solar system, but felt that it had {{problems}} as concerned physics, astronomical observations of stars, and religion. Regarding the Copernican system Tycho wrote,This innovation expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to <b>the</b> Earth, that <b>hulking,</b> lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick {{as that of the}} aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.|$|R
60|$|He sat tense, his wiry body taut, as the vidscreen warmed into life. Abruptly he {{was facing}} <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> image of Peter Sherikov, {{director}} of the vast network of labs under the Ural Mountains.|$|E
60|$|When Lankin and I go down {{stairs to}} breakfast, we find, {{if not the}} best, at least the most {{conspicuous}} places in occupation of Lady Kicklebury's party, and <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> London footman making a darkness in the cabin, as he stoops through it bearing cups and plates to his employers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well done!" [...] {{burst from}} <b>the</b> <b>hulking</b> {{man with the}} broken nose, and a deep sigh of relief escaped {{from many of the}} women; but there was instant silence again, for the speaker's hand was up, his eyes were glittering, and his lips compressed. Every one knew that more was coming, and they bent forward.|$|E
60|$|She was in {{the saddle}} before he could offer to help, with the clean spring of the child who mounted the pony for the Thirty-Mile Ride. The day held mercilessly, though Georgie got down thrice to look for {{imaginary}} stones in Rufus's foot. One cannot say even simple things in broad light, and this that Georgie meditated was not simple. So he spoke seldom, and Miriam was divided between relief and scorn. It annoyed her that <b>the</b> great <b>hulking</b> thing should know she had written {{the words of the}} song overnight; for though a maiden may sing her most secret fancies aloud, she does not care to have them trampled over by the male Philistine. They rode into the little red-brick street of Bassett, and Georgie made untold fuss over the disposition of that duck. It must go in just such a package, and be fastened to the saddle in just such a manner, though eight o'clock had struck and they were miles from dinner.|$|R
5000|$|After {{writing a}} few {{articles}} and essays for The Maine Campus, Steve decided {{to approach the}} editor, David Bright, about writing a weekly column. Bright gave him the go-ahead, and his first column appeared on February 20, 1969. Steve christened his column [...] "The Garbage Truck" [...] because, as he put it, [...] "You never know what you're going to find in a garbage truck." [...] From the beginning, Bright liked Steve's writing, but he wasn't overly fond of the nerve-racking style in which Steve cranked out his columns. An hour before the deadline with no column in sight, Steve would {{show up at the}} paper's office. Bright, wringing his hands, would tell Steve how many column inches he needed to fill for that issue. Steve would then sit down at one of <b>the</b> big, <b>hulking</b> green typewriters in the newspaper office and bang out his copy, letter-perfect with no cross-outs, no corrections, no crumpled-up pieces of paper, and meet his deadline with moments to spare.|$|R
50|$|In {{the town}} of Silent Hill, Murphy meets JP Sater (Andy Hendrickson), a man who feels guilt over his {{indirect}} responsibility for the derailment of a train and death of eight children; a Nun (Bethan Dixon Bate) at St. Maria's Orphanage; Howard Blackwood (William Tate), a postman who provides Murphy with cryptic information; and DJ Bobby Ricks (Antoine L. Smith), a disc jockey trapped in Silent Hill to run the radio station. The game also features two prominent creatures: <b>the</b> Bogeyman, a <b>hulking</b> figure wielding a sledgehammer; and the Wheelman, a creature in a wheelchair who frequently appears to Murphy.|$|R
