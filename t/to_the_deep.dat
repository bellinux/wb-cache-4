The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E

5|$|A closed {{low-level}} circulation nearly {{developed on}} August 14 {{to the east}} of Key Largo, Florida, but it weakened due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> convection remaining to the north over the mid-level center.

5|$|Leptostraca is {{the only}} extant order of Phyllocarida, the other two orders, Archaeostraca and Hoplostraca being extinct. Leptostracans {{are thought to be}} the most {{primitive}} of the malacostracans and date back to the Cambrian period. They range in length from , most being suspension feeders though some are carnivores or scavengers. They have a two part carapace which encloses the head, the whole thorax and part of the abdomen and are the only malcostracans with seven abdominal segments. Three families are known with several genera and about twenty species. They are found worldwide from the intertidal zone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> ocean, all but one species being benthic (living on the seabed).|$|E
5|$|Registered merchants {{were forced}} {{by law to}} wear white-colored clothes, an {{indication}} of their low status, and could be singled out for conscription into {{the armed forces and}} forced to resettle in lands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> south where malaria was known to be prevalent. In contrast, itinerant merchants were often richer due to their trade between a network of towns and cities and their ability to avoid registering as merchants. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, registered merchants were banned from wearing silk clothes, riding on horseback, or holding public office. This is in stark contrast to unregistered itinerant merchants who Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) states wore fine silks, rode in carriages pulled by fat horses, and whose wealth allowed them to associate with government officials.|$|E
5|$|Sperm whales {{increase}} {{levels of}} primary production and carbon export by depositing iron-rich faeces into surface {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean. The iron-rich faeces cause phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere. When the phytoplankton dies, it sinks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.|$|E

Previously, the Glee Club of the Miami University of Ohio serenaded residents with holiday songs.

In recent years the festival has moved from the original Dove Street to Shelter Cove Lane where the town can assist in the electrical costs.|$|E
5|$|At 1200UTC on June 5, the {{disturbance}} developed a broad, low-level circulation, and {{was classified as}} Tropical Storm Allison, the first storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. Some intensification was projected, though it {{was expected to be}} hindered by cool offshore sea surface temperatures. Due to the cold-core nature of the center, Allison initially contained subtropical characteristics. Despite this, the storm quickly strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h), with tropical storm-force winds extending up to 230miles (370km) east of the center, and a minimum central pressure of 1000 mbar. The storm initially moved very little, and the presence of several small vortices from within the deep convection caused difficulty in determining the exact center location. Later in the day, several different track forecasts arose. One scenario had the cyclone tracking westward into Mexico. Another projected the storm moving east towards southern Louisiana. At the time, it was noted that little rain or wind persisted near the center, but rather to the north and east. Under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge that extended in an east–west orientation across the southeast United States, Allison weakened while nearing the Texas coastline, and struck near Freeport, Texas with 50mph (80km/h) winds. Inland, the storm rapidly weakened, and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on June 6. Shortly after being downgraded to a tropical depression, surface observations showed an elongated circulation with a poorly defined center, which had reformed closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> convection.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bob {{originated}} from {{the remnants of}} a frontal trough to the southeast of Bermuda on August12. The system tracked towards the southwest and later west towards the Bahamas. By August15th, satellite analysis of the system found a weak low pressure area a couple hundred miles east of the Bahamas. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression until 0600UTC on August16 after a reconnaissance mission into the storm found a closed circulation and flight level winds of 37mph (60km/h). After post-storm analysis, it was determined that the low had developed into a depression around 0000UTC. Several hours after being designated, the system began to develop convective banding features. Roughly 18hours after being declared a depression, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded it to a tropical storm, giving it the name Bob. At this time, Bob was situated roughly 140mi (225km) northeast of Nassau, Bahamas. The storm tracked slowly towards the northwest in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> layer mean flow it was embedded within.|$|E

5|$|Other {{than its}} use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing the time of day and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either {{at three in the morning}} to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep,</b> loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B) was a tube railway {{company which}} had been {{purchased}} by the DR in 1898, but had remained a separate financial entity. It had permission to construct a line from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus, but had not raised the capital to do so. At South Kensington it was to connect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> level line planned by the DR. On 12 September 1901, the DR-controlled board of the B sold the company to the MDETC. In the same month, the B took over the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN), a tube railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Finsbury Park. The routes of the B and GN were subsequently linked and combined with part of the DR's tube route to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP).|$|E
5|$|The deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.|$|E
