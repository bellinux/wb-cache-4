5|$|The Calgary Flames {{have retired}} two numbers, {{and a third}} was retired league-wide. <b>The</b> <b>Flames</b> retired #9 in honour of Lanny McDonald who played right wing for <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> from 1981 to 1989, winning the Stanley Cup as <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> captain in his final year.

5|$|After {{only six}} games in Milwaukee, McGrattan was traded back to <b>the</b> <b>Flames,</b> in {{exchange}} for Joe Piskula, on February 28, 2013. McGrattan's positive influence {{in the locker room}} as a player always prepared to play was cited as a reason why Calgary re-acquired him. <b>The</b> <b>Flames</b> also expected he would add a physical presence to the team, which he did in his re-debut with <b>the</b> <b>Flames,</b> a 4–2 victory over Vancouver that included several hits and a fight with Tom Sestito – his first NHL fight in over a year. He gave the crowd a salute following the fight, sending the fans into a frenzy and earning a ten-minute misconduct. He finished the season with three goals and 49 PIM in 19 games with <b>the</b> <b>Flames,</b> and earned a two-year contract extension from the team.|$|E
5|$|By 1986 <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> landed {{forwards}} Doug Risebrough, Lanny McDonald, and Dan Quinn, defenceman Al MacInnis, and goaltender Mike Vernon. Finishing {{second in}} the Smythe with a 40–31–9 record (the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points), <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> swept the Winnipeg Jets {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, setting up a showdown with the Oilers. Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row. However, <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> upset the Oilers in seven games—the only time that <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> defeated the Oilers in a playoff series during the decade. The series-winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by Steve Smith ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and into his own net. The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history.|$|E

40|$|Non-steady {{behavior}} of a flame stabilized in a two-dimensional duct is studied in this thesis. The problem is formulated by an integral technique in which the governing equations are integrated across the duct to obtain integral relations for the mean flow variables. The flow fields {{on either side of}} <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> sheet are matched by appropriate matching conditions. Fluid flow through <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> surface causes <b>the</b> integral relations to explicitly involve the fluid velocities at <b>the</b> <b>flame.</b> An independent description of <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> shape and <b>the</b> irrotational flow field upstream of <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> is provided by a source distribution on the duct axis. The integral relations are analyzed by a perturbation technique, in which the dominant order solution represents <b>the</b> steady <b>flame</b> development. <b>The</b> steady <b>flame</b> configuration is perturbed by an acoustic wave incident on <b>the</b> compact <b>flame</b> region. <b>The</b> time dependent counterpart of the integral relations describes the ensuing non-steady flow fields. <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> perturbation exhibits a travelling wave pattern with considerable amplification along <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> zone. A simple model to describe the growth of <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> perturbation is put forth, by considering <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> surface as an unstable shear layer. Acoustic reflection and transmission coefficients of <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> region are obtained utilizing <b>the</b> time-dependent <b>flame</b> calculations. <b>The</b> response spectra exhibit active responses at certain well defined frequencies. <b>The</b> non-steady <b>flame</b> model is incorporated in a rudimentary afterburner configuration to investigate the low frequency behaviour of the afterburner. The results suggest a possible mechanism of low frequency instability in a combustion system...|$|R
40|$|When a flame passes along a {{tube that}} is open at both ends a self induced {{fluctuating}} pressure/flow field is created which <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> has to traverse. Here fuel rich (1. 1 < ϕ < 1. 4) propane-air flames have been filmed travelling along a 20 mm internal diameter quartz tube. Fluctuations in <b>the</b> <b>flame’s</b> progression were observed to increase as <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> propagated, achieving a maximum oscillation amplitude of ± 10 mm at 220 Hz that decayed as <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> progressed further {{towards the end of}} the tube. The impact of the periodic pressure gradients on <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> shape could be discerned with tongues of unburned reactants pushed into the products as well as the corresponding rapid acceleration of <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> into <b>the</b> unburned mixture. The impact of <b>the</b> fluctuations on <b>flame</b> chemistry was monitored by capturing the CH∗ and C 2 chemiluminescence using a high speed colour camera. The CH∗/C 2 ∗ ratio was observed to decrease as <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> was pulled back towards the burned mixture; and increased when <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> was pushed forwards. This was consistent throughout <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> progress even when small oscillations in <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> position were measured.

40|$|The local burning {{velocity}} and <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> displacement speed are the dominant {{properties in the}} mechanism of turbulent premixed combustion. <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> displacement speed and the local {{burning velocity}} have been investigated separately, because <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> displacement speed {{can be used for}} the discussion of flame-turbulence interactions and the local burning velocity can be used for the discussion of the inner structure of turbulent premixed flames. In this study, to establish the basis for the discussion on the effects of turbulence on the inner structure of turbulent premixed <b>flames,</b> <b>the</b> indirect relationship between <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> displacement speed and the local burning velocity was investigated by <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> stretch, <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> curvature, and <b>the</b> tangential strain rate using DNS database with different density ratios. It was found that for the local tangential strain rate and <b>the</b> local <b>flame</b> curvature, <b>the</b> local burning velocity and <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> displacement speed had the opposite correlations in each density ratio case.

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> sank in the standings, their {{attendance}} also sagged. For most {{of their}} first 16 years in Calgary, Flames tickets were among the toughest {{to get in the}} NHL. However, by 1999, attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum: buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec City in leaving for the United States. The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> in Calgary for the 1999–2000 season. <b>The</b> <b>Flames</b> issued another appeal for more season tickets in the summer of 2000. The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful.

5|$|Calgary rebounded to {{make the}} playoffs for the next four seasons, {{including}} two consecutive division titles.

In the 1995–96 season, Nieuwendyk was traded to the Dallas Stars in a deal that acquired Jarome Iginla. Iginla would make his Flames debut in the 1996 postseason during which <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> again lost in the first round, a four-game sweep by the Blackhawks. In 1997, only two years after winning their second consecutive division title, <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years.

40|$|A {{flame holder}} is a device {{placed in a}} stream of rapidly flowing {{combustible}} mixture to anchor <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> and to make burning possible. <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> holder has its most immediate application in the ram Jet fields where counter flows are impractical, and it is desirable that combustion take place at as high a stream velocity as possible.
