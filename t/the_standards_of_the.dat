5|$|A {{series of}} concerts, lectures and {{recitals}} called the Glastonbury Festivals was established with a summer {{school in the}} town of Glastonbury between 1914 and 1926 by classical composer Rutland Boughton (1878–1960), and with their location attracted a bohemian audience by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time.

5|$|Edward {{grew up to}} be {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} good looking by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period. He had a reputation as a competent public speaker and was known for his generosity to his household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed rowing, as well as hedging and ditching, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the nobility of the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, {{at the other end}} of the scale, three livres a day for each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners who were being punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from mental illnesses and took, by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} to Scott's final plea {{on behalf of}} the dependents of the dead was enormous by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. The Mansion House Scott Memorial Fund closed at £75,000 (2009 approximation £5.5million). This was not equally distributed; Scott's widow, son, mother and sisters received a total of £18,000 (£1.3 million). Wilson's widow got £8,500 (£600,000) and Bowers's mother £4,500 (£330,000). Edgar Evans's widow, children, and mother received £1,500 (£109,000) between them.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift {{in thinking about}} the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system {{without the need for}} any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, at {{the annual}} meeting of the American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality, DeLee spoke out against the use of {{midwives}} for childbirth. DeLee said that midwives stunted the progress of the obsetrical profession and said that he refused to take part in the education of a provider that lowered <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profession. If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} refuel their nuclear power plants, the {{carriers}} each undergo a Refueling and Overhaul (RCOH) once in their service lives. This {{is also the}} most substantial overhaul the ships undergo while in service and involves bringing the vessels' equipment up to <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newest ships. The ship is placed in dry dock, and essential maintenance is carried out including painting of the hull below the waterline and replacement of electrical and mechanical components such as valves. Because of the large time periods between the ships' constructions, the armament and designs of the newer ships are more modern than those of the older ships. In RCOH, the older ships are refitted to <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newer ships, which can include major upgrades to the flight deck, aircraft catapults and combat systems as well as other upgrades such as improved radar systems, although precise details can vary significantly between the ships. The improvements normally take around four years to complete. The RCOH for USS Theodore Roosevelt took four years to complete (2009–2013) and cost about US$2.6 billion. Planned Incremental Availability is a similar procedure, although it is less substantial and does not involve refueling of the nuclear power plants.|$|E

5|$|Institutions {{offering}} {{degrees in}} nursing {{had to be}} accredited by the appropriate nursing agency for universities and colleges.

5|$|Isabella {{was only}} 12 {{years old at}} the time of her wedding, young by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period, and Edward {{probably}} had sexual relations with mistresses during their first few years together. During this time Edward fathered an illegitimate son, Adam, who was born possibly as early as 1307. Edward and Isabella's first son, the future Edward III, was born in 1312 amid great celebrations, and three more children followed: John in 1316, Eleanor in 1318 and Joan in 1321.|$|E
5|$|Keen {{to follow}} up his {{interest}} in aviation, Johnson started taking flying lessons at his own expense. He applied to join the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) but encountered some of the social problems that were rife in British society at the time.

As the chances of war increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Munich Crisis, <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RAF were relaxed, however, as the service expanded and brought in men from ordinary social backgrounds. Johnson re-applied to the AAF. He was informed that sufficient pilots were already available but there were some vacancies in the balloon squadrons. Johnson rejected the offer.|$|E

5|$|Morgan's {{department}} always faced financial {{struggles in}} an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, nurses and other participants. These classes ultimately weakened the department's reputation at the university, as school officials viewed the training as vocational and considered it to be beneath <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university. Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very little space to conduct her research work. Adding {{to the difficulty of}} the situation was the fact that university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high for a home economics program.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Russell Mallory (1812 – November 9, 1873) {{served in}} the United States Senate as Senator (Democrat) from Florida from 1850 to the secession of his home state and the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War. For much of that period, he was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. This was a time of rapid naval reform, and he insisted that the ships of the United States Navy should be as capable as those of Great Britain and France, the foremost navies in the world at that time. He also wrote a bill, and guided it through Congress, that provided for compulsory retirement of officers who did not meet <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profession.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutionary War with France {{broke out}} in 1793, leading to the {{extensive}} modernisation of the castle. Repairs were carried out in 1794 {{at a cost of}} £647, followed by a review of the defences the next year by the Master-General of the Ordnance. The 16th-century castle was still strongly fortified by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, but it could not support the heavier guns or batteries of artillery required to tackle enemy warships. Instead, two new gun batteries, each armed with five 36-pounder (16.3kg) guns, were built alongside the castle in 1795, with a further eighteen 9-pounder (4kg) guns mounted in the old fort; the guns concerned had all been captured from the French.|$|E
