The 2007 budgethis last as Chancellorabolished the 10% income <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> for the lowest earners (5.1million people), increasing their rate to the next highest, 20%. Earners who fell within the 22% <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> <b>band</b> had their <b>rate</b> reduced to 20%, and tax allowances were also made for over-65s. These measures came into effect in April 2008. The [...] "10p <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> cut" [...] as it was commonly referred to, was sharply criticised by Frank Field and several other backbenchers. Field also said that Brown {{did not seem to}} be enjoying his job. Health Secretary Alan Johnson believed that Field was motivated primarily by a personal dislike of Brown, and Field later apologised, saying that he had regretted allowing his campaign to become personal. Chancellor Alistair Darling cut the <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> for 22 million people and borrowed around £2.7billion to reimburse those on lower and middle incomes who had suffered.|$|R

5000|$|Economically and bread, {{the record}} of the 1974-79 Labour governments was an arguably dismal one, in light of the ambitious promise made by Labour in a 1973 party {{programme}} to bring about “a fundamental irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth, in favour of working people and their families.” Following an expansionary fiscal policy, as characterised by boosts to public spending, more restrictive economic policies were adopted, with expenditure cuts and limits on wage increases. In 1975, for instance, an austerity budget was introduced that reduced public spending for 1977-78 by £900 million, at the expense of about 200,000 jobs. To reduce high levels of inflation, various income policies were implemented that reduced the real earnings of most workers, with a 1980 Fabian study by Paul Ormerod noting that the attainment of lower inflation doesn’t correspond with a rise in real incomes, as it would take two years (according to the economic models of the Treasury, the National Institute and the London Business School) that workers “can realise real wage increases through reductions in the rate of increase of prices following heir wage restraint.” Recognising the negative impact that wage restraint was having on the living standards of ordinary workers, the government introduced expansionary budgets in March and October 1977 and again in April 1978, which were partly designed to boost take home pay in real terms via tax reductions. The April 1978 budget introduced a reduced <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> <b>band</b> along with significant increases in child benefit. The so-called “Rooker-Wise” amendment to a 1977 budget, named after the labour backbenchers Jeff Rooker and Audrey Wise, indexed income tax allowances to cost-of-living rises as a means of safeguarding taxpayers from “fiscal creep,” a situation where inflation increases tax bills “by reducing the real value of income tax allowances.” Despite such measures, however, most people by September 1978 “were no better off in real terms than they had been in March 1975.” ...|$|R

40|$|This paper assembles a new dataset on {{corporate}} income tax regimes in 50 emerging and developing economies over 1996 - 2007 and analyzes their impact {{on corporate}} tax revenues and domestic and foreign investment.

There is evidence of a partial race to the bottom: countries have been under pressure to lower <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> in order to lure and boost investment. In the case of standard tax systems (i. e. tax rules applying under normal circumstances), the effective <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> reductions have not been larger than those witnessed in advanced economies, and revenues have held up well over the sample period. However, a race to the bottom is evident among special regimes, most notably in the case of Africa, creating effectively a parallel <b>tax</b> system where <b>rates</b> have fallen to almost zero.

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} use of <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> variables in both micro and macro-economic research, measurement of income <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> has largely been ignored. When tax returns are unavailable, income variables are used to compute <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> Measurement error in income and unobserved deductions, exemptions and credits make these inherently noisy measures of true rates. This dissertation reports new survey measures of average (ATR) and marginal (MTR) income <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> from the Cognitive Economics Study (CogEcon). Survey measures are interpreted as <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> perceptions, which are used to correct for survey noise when imputing true rates and then to characterize heterogeneity in misperceptions. Chapter 1 advances a new survey methodology for measuring income <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> Data come from a panel of respondents' reported marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates,</b> average <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> and income in two subsequent waves of CogEcon. The individual measures of tax beliefs display heterogeneity, even after accounting for income and potential survey noise. Respondents systematically overestimate average <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> and exhibit substantial heterogeneity. Perceptions of marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> are accurate at the mean, but exhibit mean reversion and substantial heterogeneity. Perceptions of marginal and average <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> (conditional on the true rates) vary depending on cognitive ability, general financial knowledge and use of professional tax assistance. Chapter 2 uses a finite mixture model to uncover heterogeneous income <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> perceptions. This paper establishes four new results. First, almost half of respondents do not distinguish between marginal and average <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> Second, roughly 30 percent of respondents know the statutory marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> schedule (and answer questions accordingly). Third, among respondents who think all income is taxed at the same rate, roughly 40 percent think all of their income is taxed at the statutory marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rate.</b> Finally, respondents with higher cognitive ability {{are more likely to}} report statutory marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates,</b> but only among respondents who prepare their own income tax returns...|$|R
