5|$|Admiral Godfrey put Fleming {{in charge}} of Operation Goldeneye between 1941 and 1942; Goldeneye was a plan <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> {{intelligence}} framework in Spain {{in the event of}} a German takeover of the territory. Fleming's plan involved maintaining communication with Gibraltar and launching sabotage operations against the Nazis. In 1941 he liaised with Donovan over American involvement in a measure intended to ensure that the Germans did not dominate the seaways.|$|E

Furthermore, it allows the radar <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> continuous lock on the preceding vehicle.|$|R
5|$|Tracheal intubation, usually simply {{referred}} to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (windpipe) <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> open airway or {{to serve as a}} conduit through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of the lungs, including mechanical ventilation, and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction.|$|E
5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1990, Chicago Bridge & Iron and Wormald International {{had both}} sold their shares in ASC. The shares were bought up by Kockums and the Australian Industry Development Corporation, with some of Kockums' shares then sold to James Hardie Industries <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> Australian {{majority}} ownership of the company. On 5 April 2000, the shares in ASC held by Kockums were bought out and the company was nationalised, despite a trend {{at the time to}} privatise government-owned companies. At the end of 2003, a contract to maintain the Collins class worth $3.5billion over 25years was awarded to ASC.|$|E

5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Chauvel was {{appointed}} Inspector General, the Army's most senior post. He was forced <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> increasingly hollow structure by politicians intent on cutting expenditure. He was concurrently Chief of the General Staff from 1923 {{until his retirement}} in 1930. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. During the Second World War, he was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the Volunteer Defence Corps.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1941, just as ASO {{units were}} finding their feet, {{a large number}} of {{personnel}} and aircraft were sent to Malta (and the Desert Air Force) to interdict Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps supplies from Italy to North Africa. Adding to the problem was a shortage of materials and testing facilities. Restocking squadrons and re-equipping them was slow. Not until 1942 did the ASO squadrons get the recognition needed, {{in the wake of the}} German Operation Cerberus. Maintenance was also poor. Each service was <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> operational ready rate of 70 to 75 percent. In Coastal Command it was 40, and not much higher in others at that point. Greater emphasis was made and serviceability increased.|$|E

5|$|Obesity is most {{commonly}} {{caused by a}} combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> increased body mass.|$|E
5|$|On offense, the Jayhawks {{recorded}} {{a total of}} 344yards, 249of which came through the air. Quarterback Todd Reesing was the key contributor to the Kansas aerial attack, completing 20of his 37passes for 227yards and just one interception. The only other Kansas player to record passing yards was running back Brandon McAnderson, who threw a 22-yard first-down pass during a fake punt. Though under pressure {{for much of the}} game—Reesing was sacked four times—Kansas continued <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> effective pass attack throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Once he {{returned}} to Nigeria, Achebe was promoted at the NBS {{to the position of}} Director of External Broadcasting. One of his first duties was to help create the Voice of Nigeria network. The station broadcast its first transmission on New Year's Day 1962, and worked <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> objective perspective during the turbulent era immediately following independence. This objectivity was put to the test when Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa {{declared a state of emergency}} in the Western Region, responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties. Achebe became saddened by the evidence of corruption and silencing of political opposition.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles, which had been in place since the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> air force. After the 1926 signing of the Kellogg–Briand Pact, police {{aircraft}} were permitted. Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the Luftwaffe was formally acknowledged, with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister.|$|E
5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled {{kitchen garden}} {{was built in}} the early 1700s to provide fruit and {{vegetables}} for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is built into the southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys built into the wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E
5|$|The East Pacific's Tropical Depression Eleven-E {{moved across}} Mexico and {{degenerated}} into a remnant low on September4. The mid-level circulation {{associated with the}} remnant storm entered the southern Bay of Campeche and formed a new tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September5. Steered north to north-northwest, the newly formed cyclone quickly strengthened as deep convection fired over its center; it intensified into Tropical Storm Hermine by 06:00UTC on September6 and attained peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) by 02:00UTC the following day as it made landfall near Matamoros, Mexico. Despite being well inland, Hermine continued <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> inner core and only slowly weakened. It fell to tropical depression status over central Texas by 00:00UTC on September8 and ultimately dissipated over southeastern Kansas by 06:00UTC on September10.|$|E

5|$|The crew took {{advantage}} of both natural and practical light at filming locations. The director sought various approaches to the lighting setups, for example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.|$|E
5|$|The long tail of {{the common}} thresher, the source of many fanciful tales through history, is used in a whip-like fashion to deliver incapacitating blows to its prey. This species feeds mainly on small {{schooling}} forage fishes such as herrings and anchovies. It is a fast, strong swimmer that {{has been known to}} leap clear of the water, and possesses physiological adaptations that allow it <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> internal body temperature warmer than that of the surrounding sea water. The common thresher has an aplacental viviparous mode of reproduction, with oophagous embryos that feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated by their mother. Females typically give birth to four pups at a time, following a gestation period of nine months.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} sought <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> {{impression of}} normality. Just before Ramadan {{was to begin}} on 26 September, the Ministry of War publicly announced that military personnel could register to take leave to perform a Umrah (pilgrimage) in Mecca. Egyptian newspapers announced that sailboat races would be held, participants of which included several high-ranking officers of the Egyptian Navy. In addition, a visit planned for October 8 (two days after the scheduled attack) by the Romanian Minister of Defense to Egypt was also publicized by the Ministry of War, and a program for his visit was announced. This coincidental visit would be promptly canceled once war broke out on 6 October, but it proved useful {{as part of the}} deception plan.|$|E
