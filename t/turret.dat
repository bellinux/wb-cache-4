5|$|Each gun rested {{within an}} armored <b>turret,</b> {{but only the}} top of the <b>turret</b> {{protruded}} above the main deck. The <b>turret</b> extended either four decks (Turrets 1 and 3) or five decks (<b>Turret</b> 2) down. The lower spaces contained the equipment required to rotate the <b>turret</b> and to elevate the guns attached to each <b>turret.</b> At the bottom of the <b>turret</b> were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them. All of the compartments within the turrets were separated by flameproof bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout the <b>turret.</b> Each <b>turret</b> required a crew of 7794 men to operate. The turrets were not actually attached to the ship, but sat on rollers, which meant that if the ship were to capsize the turrets would fall out. Each <b>turret</b> cost US $1.4 million, but this number did not include the cost of the guns themselves.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that the A-43 <b>turret</b> was very tight for two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; there was no <b>turret</b> ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; {{and it was hard to}} rotate the <b>turret</b> manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 <b>turret.</b> The <b>turret</b> was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 <b>turret.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Turret</b> One fired first, {{beginning}} at 09:33. <b>Turret</b> One's left gun misfired and its crew {{was unable to}} get the gun to discharge. Moosally ordered <b>Turret</b> Two to load and fire a three-gun salvo. According to standard procedure, the misfire in <b>Turret</b> One should have been resolved first before proceeding further with the exercise.|$|E

5|$|HMS Glatton {{was derived}} from the design of the first breastwork monitors, but sacrificed the rear <b>turret</b> for thicker armour and larger guns with which to attack enemy ports. She was given a deep draught to improve her seaworthiness, but her low {{freeboard}} meant that she had very little ability to weather head seas. HMS Hotspur was similar in layout to Glatton, but she was given more freeboard by the addition of an unarmoured structure above her waterline armour belt. Designed as a ram, Hotspur was given a fixed <b>turret</b> with four gun ports as a rotating <b>turret</b> was not thought capable of withstanding the shock of impact. HMS Rupert was an enlarged version of Hotspur, but used a Glatton-type <b>turret</b> instead of the fixed <b>turret</b> and thicker armour than the older ship. The two Conqueror-class ships were enlarged versions of Rupert with heavier guns, thicker armour and a steel hull.|$|E
5|$|In the König-class ships, each gun <b>turret</b> had {{a working}} chamber beneath it that was {{connected}} to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In {{an effort to reduce}} the possibility of a fire, everything in the <b>turret</b> was constructed of steel. This layout was also used in the preceding battleships. On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear <b>turret</b> used this configuration, although the rearmost gun <b>turret</b> had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E
50|$|The {{designs for}} the two front <b>turrets</b> used on Dunkerque-class battleships were scaled up for Richelieu. The {{resulting}} 2476 t 1936-model quadruple <b>turrets</b> built by Saint-Chamond, were nearly 1000 t more than the quadruple <b>turrets</b> of Dunkerque or the triple <b>turrets</b> of Littorio.|$|R
50|$|Romania {{purchased}} 334 Gruson Fahrpanzers, in the 53 mm caliber. These {{were initially}} deployed on the Siret Line at Focşani (15 batteries, with 6 <b>turrets</b> each), Nămoloasa (24 batteries of 3-5 <b>turrets),</b> Galati (30 batteries of 6 <b>turrets</b> and 10 bateries of 3 <b>turrets)</b> and Brateş (10 <b>turrets).</b> The bridgeheads (not {{part of that}} Line) at Cernavodă and Turtucaia were equipped with 28 <b>turrets,</b> and the one at Silistra was equipped with 17 <b>turrets.</b> These guns remained in their emplacements for about twenty years, before being transformed into infantry guns between 1914 and 1916 by mounting them on Romanian-built gun carriages. A few were transformed into anti-aircraft guns.|$|R

5|$|New Jerseys {{modernization}} {{was unique}} in that {{she was to be}} the only reactivated Iowa-class battleship to lose a gun <b>turret.</b> At the time the Navy made the announcement plans were underway to remove New Jerseys No. 3 16in gun <b>turret</b> (located aft of the superstructure). In its place the Navy planned to install one of two systems: a vertical launching missile magazine which would have enabled New Jersey to carry an additional 48 Tomahawk or Harpoon missiles, or using the space generated by a removed gun <b>turret</b> for aircraft related updates centering on VTOL or V/STOL type aircraft; however these ideas were ultimately dropped, and New Jersey retained her No. 3 Gun <b>Turret</b> during her 1980s career.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1989, off Vieques Island, Iowas <b>Turret</b> One fired {{six of the}} {{experimental}} shells using the supercharged powder bags. Skelley claimed {{that one of the}} 16inch shells traveled , setting a record for the longest conventional 16inch (406.4mm) shell ever fired. Although the shells had been fired without serious incident, Meyer and Petty Officer First Class Dale Eugene Mortensen, gun chief for <b>Turret</b> One, told Skelley that they would no longer participate in his experiments. Skelley asked <b>Turret</b> Two's gun chief, Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler, if he could use <b>Turret</b> Two for his experiments; Ziegler refused. Skelley then asked Lieutenant Phil Buch, <b>Turret</b> Two's officer in charge, and Buch acquiesced.|$|E
50|$|Only Mark II {{guns were}} {{installed}} in type E twin <b>turrets.</b> Maximum elevation was 70° {{in the five}} <b>turrets</b> installed aboard Atago, Takao, and Chōkai in 1932. Early recognition of the impracticality of using these guns for anti-aircraft fire caused reduction of maximum elevation to 55° in all subsequent installations. Maya received five 55° <b>turrets</b> as original equipment in 1932. Three new <b>turrets</b> with Mark I guns from Myōkō class cruisers re-bored to Mark II replaced the original type A mounts aboard Furutaka class cruisers in 1936 and 1937. Tone class cruisers were completed with four type E <b>turrets</b> in 1937 and 1938. Five new <b>turrets</b> replaced the original triple 6-inch <b>turrets</b> aboard Mogami class cruisers between 1939 and 1941.|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, {{the film}} The Battle of the River Plate (US title: Pursuit of the Graf Spee) {{was made of}} the battle and Admiral Graf Spees end, with Peter Finch as Langsdorff. Finch portrayed Langsdorff authentically as a gentleman. HMNZS Achilles, which had been recommissioned in 1948 as HMIS Delhi, {{flagship}} of the Royal Indian Navy, played herself in the film. HMS Ajax (twin <b>turrets)</b> was [...] "played" [...] by HMS Sheffield (triple <b>turrets),</b> HMS Exeter (twin <b>turrets)</b> by HMS Jamaica (triple <b>turrets)</b> and HMS Cumberland by herself (although de-gunned as a trials platform). Graf Spee (two <b>turrets)</b> was portrayed by the U.S. heavy cruiser USS Salem (three <b>turrets).</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 250 ZSU-57-2 SPAAGs {{based on}} the Chinese Type 59 (a copy of the Soviet T-54A) tank chassis were {{produced}} under license in North Korea. The <b>turrets</b> were bought from the USSR and delivered between 1968 and 1977. Since {{the production of the}} ZSU-57-2 <b>turrets</b> ended in 1960 the <b>turrets</b> that North Korea bought must have come from decommissioned Soviet ZSU-57-2s. The <b>turrets</b> were ordered in 1967.|$|R
5|$|T-26 model 1933: single <b>turret</b> version {{armed with}} 45mm 20K tank gun and DT tank machine gun. This version {{had a new}} {{cylindrical}} <b>turret</b> with a large rear niche. Some tanks were equipped with a 71-TK-1 radio station with a hand-rail antenna around the <b>turret</b> (so-called radio tanks). They were upgraded in 1935 with a welded hull and <b>turret,</b> and again in 1936 with a rear DT tank machine gun in the <b>turret.</b> In 1937, some tanks were equipped with an anti-aircraft machine gun and a searchlight. The model 1933 was the most numerous variant.|$|E
5|$|The fully {{restored}} No. 4 <b>turret</b> is {{on display}} {{on the grounds of}} the former Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima. This is the ship's original <b>turret,</b> removed during her refit in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The ships' main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four smoothbore, muzzle-loading 11-inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets. The fore <b>turret</b> in each ship, except , {{was designed by}} Eads while the aft <b>turret</b> was the standard Ericsson design used in most Union monitors. Unlike the latter, which rested its entire weight on a central spindle {{that had to be}} elevated in order for the <b>turret</b> to rotate, Eads' design better distributed its weight because it rested on a number of ball bearings underneath {{the outer edge of the}} <b>turret.</b> The structure of the Eads <b>turret</b> extended down to be bottom of the ship and the entire structure rotated. The guns in the Eads <b>turret</b> were mounted on a steam-powered platform that moved up and down, so that the guns could be reloaded below deck, safe from enemy interference.|$|E
5000|$|To {{maximize}} {{the thickness of}} armor available for a given weight it was desirable that the citadel be as small as possible. It was achieved by concentrating the ship's main battery in three <b>turrets</b> of triple or even two <b>turrets</b> of quadruple (quad) gun mountings, as opposed to World War I battleships which typically had four twin <b>turrets</b> for their large caliber guns (with [...] having seven twin <b>turrets).</b> In some cases, the <b>turrets</b> had an all-forward layout, such as the Royal Navy's [...] and the French navy's [...]|$|R
50|$|For the film, mock upper <b>turrets</b> were installed. To {{represent}} {{different models}} several aircraft had the <b>turrets</b> installed behind the wings representing early (B-25C/D type) aircraft. Initially, the camera ships {{also had the}} mock <b>turrets</b> installed, but problems with buffeting required their removal.|$|R

5|$|Unfortunately, the <b>turret</b> {{layout of}} the Delawares was also retained, with its {{respective}} challenges. Two turrets, Numbers 1 and 2, were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The rearmost <b>turret,</b> number 5, {{was placed on the}} main deck, facing rearward, the next <b>turret,</b> Number 4, was placed on the main deck facing forward, but could only have fired on either broadside, it could not have fired straight forward or aft. The center <b>turret,</b> Number 3, placed in a superfiring position facing rearward, could not fire astern when the <b>turret</b> directly under it had its guns trained forward. This left only the rearmost <b>turret,</b> with its pair of 12-inch guns, to cover the rear quarter of the ship. Also, since the engine room was situated between the superfiring rear <b>turret</b> and the ones behind it, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 <b>turret</b> to the engine room. These lines, it was later found, had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.|$|E
5|$|Weapon turrets were {{mounted at}} {{the nose and}} the middle of {{aircraft}} underbelly. The nose <b>turret</b> could rotate +/- 100° from the aircraft's centerline and could mount either a 40mm (1.57in) grenade launcher, or a 7.62mm (0.308in) minigun. The belly <b>turret</b> included a 30mm (1.18in) automatic cannon with 360° of rotation. Mechanical stops prevented the belly <b>turret</b> from aiming at {{any part of the}} helicopter.|$|E
5|$|While both gun turrets were rotated by steam power, the new forward {{guns were}} loaded by {{hydraulic}} power, unlike the original guns which were hand worked. Thunderer {{was the first}} ship to have hydraulic loading gear. From 1874, the forward <b>turret</b> alone was converted to hydraulic power operation for training (<b>turret</b> traverse), elevation and ramming. This allowed the <b>turret</b> crew to be reduced from 48 to 28; the aft <b>turret</b> remaining hand-worked as a comparison. Power operation was considered successful, although it was later implicated in the 1879 explosion.|$|E
500|$|When the 15-inch gun <b>turrets</b> were modernised, their {{existing}} [...] rangefinders {{were replaced by}} [...] ones in all <b>turrets</b> except for 'A' and they were fitted for RPC in azimuth only. The <b>turrets</b> were also provided with de-humidifying equipment and insulation to improve their habitability.|$|R
50|$|Ansaldo Model 1934 {{guns were}} mounted triple wing <b>turrets</b> on the Littorio, and in triple and twin superfiring <b>turrets</b> forward and aft on the Duca degli Abruzzi-class. OTO Melara Model 1936 guns were mounted in triple wing <b>turrets</b> in the Vittorio Veneto and Roma.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Turrets</b> - <b>turrets</b> {{that are}} {{built by the}} aliens. These <b>turrets</b> are huge, and moves around on an axis built at its base. When attacking, they fire large cannon shells and can cause massive damage. They can still be {{defeated}} because they are immobile.|$|R
5|$|With Tropical Storm Cristobal {{bearing down}} on the {{recovery}} team, and time and money running out, the team {{made the decision to}} raise the <b>turret</b> on 5 August 2002, after 41 days of work, and the gun <b>turret</b> broke the surface at 5:30pm to the cheers of everyone aboard Wotan and other recovery ships nearby. As archaeologists examined the contents of the <b>turret</b> after it has been landed aboard Wotan, they discovered a second skeleton, but removing it did not begin until the <b>turret</b> arrived at the Mariners' Museum for conservation. The remains of these sailors were transferred to the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, in the hope that they could be identified.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. The guns on the forward <b>turret</b> roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on the aft <b>turret</b> were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft <b>turret</b> roof.|$|E
5|$|Another rare variant was the Bergepanzer IV armored {{recovery}} vehicle. Some {{were believed}} to have been converted locally, 21 were converted from hulls returned for repair between October 1944 and January 1945. The conversion involved removing the <b>turret</b> and adding a wooden plank cover with an access hatch over the <b>turret</b> ring and the addition of a 2-ton jib crane and rigid towing bars.|$|E
500|$|Nagatos eight 45-caliber 41-centimeter {{guns were}} mounted in {{two pairs of}} twin-gun, superfiring <b>turrets</b> fore and aft. Numbered one through four from front to rear, the {{hydraulically}} powered <b>turrets</b> gave the guns an elevation range of 2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. The <b>turrets</b> aboard the Nagato-class ships were replaced in the mid-1930s with the <b>turrets</b> stored from the unfinished s. While in storage the <b>turrets</b> had been modified to increase their range of elevation to –3 to +43 degrees, which increased the gun's maximum range from [...]|$|R
50|$|When the 15-inch gun <b>turrets</b> were modernised, their {{existing}} 15 ft rangefinders {{were replaced by}} 30 ft ones in all <b>turrets</b> except for 'A' and they were fitted for RPC in azimuth only.
