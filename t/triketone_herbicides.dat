40|$|Herbicide {{application}} in seed maize requires special attention {{due to their}} larger sensitivity than hybrid maize. The aim of {{study was to examine}} and define the sensitivity/tolerance of the five maize inbred lines with different susceptibility to herbicides (belonging to different heterotic groups), based on alterations of secondary metabolites (phenolics, protein sulfhydryl groups, phytic and inorganic phosphorus). Two groups of herbicides: triketons (mesotrione and topramezone) and sulfonylureas (rimsulfuron and foramsulfuron) were tested. Lines from independent heterotic group, which were sensitive to herbicides expressed visible damages together with significant reduce in grain yield, mainly induced by sulfonylurea herbicides. Parallel with that, significant increase in phenolics, phytic and inorganic phosphorus, as well as drop in protein sulfhydryl groups were observed in their leaves. Tolerant lines (belonging to Lancaster group) had mainly insignificant grain yield reduce, also with lesser variations in sulfhydryl groups, content of phytic and inorganic phosphorus, as well as increase in phenolics content. Among examined secondary metabolites, phytate is the main factor, contributing to herbicide tolerance in maize lines. Owing to lesser yield decrease and variation in content of examined secondary metabolites, expressed in treatments with <b>triketone</b> <b>herbicides,</b> they usage could be safe in maize lines.

40|$|Agricultural use of {{pesticides}} ensures a higher crop quality and production {{but it is also}} one of the major sources of diffuse pollution in the environment. Microbial degradation is considered as an important dissipation process limiting the accumulation {{of pesticides}} in the environment. In this context, two bacterial strains able to degrade sulcotrione, a β-triketone herbicide, were isolated from an agricultural soil previously exposed to this herbicide. The two isolates were identified using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing as Pseudomonas sp. 1 OP and Bradyrhizobium sp. SR 1. Their capacity to degrade sulcotrione was estimated and 2 -Chloro- 4 -mesylbenzoic acid, one of its main metabolites, was clearly detected. Their ability to degrade other β-triketone herbicides was tested showing that only Bradyrhizobium sp. SR 1 was able to completely degrade mesotrione and producing already known metabolites. Microbial toxicity of sulcotrione and mesotrione and their related metabolites in bacterial cultures was estimated by monitoring 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) enzyme inhibition. Our results indicate that <b>triketone</b> <b>herbicides</b> toxicity linked to HPPD inhibition was due to parent molecules and not to the formed metabolites. Attempts were done to identify the genetic localization of sulcotrione degradation in Pseudomonas sp. 1 OP and Bradyrhizobium sp. SR 1. Plasmid profiles of both strains revealed the presence of large plasmids (> 12 kb and > 50 kb, respectively). Curing experiments showed that Pseudomonas sp. 1 OP lost its ability to degrade sulcotrione under non-selective conditions, therefore degradation capacity may be attributed to the presence of this plasmid. On the contrary, under the same conditions, Bradyrhizobium sp. SR 1 plasmid was not cured and the sulcotrione-degrading ability of the strain was maintained. Furthermore, a 14 000 Tn 5 mutant library was constructed using a Tn 5 mutagenesis approach conducted on Bradyrhizobium sp. SR 1. Among this library, two mutants affected in their biodegradation capacity were identified. Full sequencing of SR 1 and Tn 5 mutants is ongoing to identify possible degrading gene candidates...|$|E
40|$|Digitaria species {{infestation}} {{levels have}} recently increased in South Africa {{due to the}} prevailing misconception amongst producers and herbicide agents that acetanilide herbicides will control all Digitaria spp. equally effective, irrespective of species differences. Since 2008 a relatively unknown Digitaria spp was noticed in maize fields and was positively identified as D. nuda (naked crabgrass). Research on naked crabgrass world-wide is limited; {{it has been reported}} to be of importance in sugarcane in Brazil and is considered as a serious grass weed in West Africa. Growth chamber trials were conducted to elucidate the germination characteristics of naked crabgrass. Germination of fresh naked crabgrass seed was less than 20 %. Pre-treatment of fresh seed, by means of soaking seed for 24 h in distilled water, increased germination to 99 %. Stored seed (1 -yr old) germinated best (100 %) in a 0. 2 M KNO 3 solution. Naked crabgrass germinated best at constant temperature greater than 25 °C and at fluctuating regimens of 30 / 15 °C, with alternating light/dark conditions. Naked crabgrass emerged faster and total seedling emergence was 20 % higher on clay soil. Above-ground biomass was 5. 0 g per plant on clay soil compared to 2. 3 g on sandy soil. Seedling emergence was reduced by 27 % after burial at a depth of 1 cm and only 5 % seeds emerged at a depth of 6 cm. In a replacement series glasshouse trial naked crabgrass was more aggressive with regard to root mass (AI= 0. 3) and large crabgrass (D. sanguinalis) with regard to shoot mass (AI= 0. 04). Naked crabgrass was more competitive in a wet soil profile (CR= 1. 88) and large crabgrass in a dry soil profile (CR= 2. 02). Both grass weeds are making similar demands on the available resources (RYT= 1). The competition effect of both naked and large crabgrass was determined in glasshouse trials in two soil types at different watering regimens. A negative linear relationship was recorded between grass density and maize plant height, shoot- and kernel weight. Estimated yield loss of maize varied between 29 and 76 % and was described by the hyperbolic equation of Cousens (1985). Large crabgrass had a higher damage coefficient (4. 1 on sandy soil) compared to naked crabgrass (3. 1 on clay soil). A critical period of weed control was established in field trials for naked crabgrass. The beginning of the critical period of weed control when a 10 % yield loss is estimated varied between the two and six leaf stage of maize, ending at the twelve leaf stage or two weeks after tasseling, indicating a need for season-long control of naked crabgrass. Yield loss of maize in the field trials ranged between 28 and 82 % in the seasonlong weedy control treatments. In field and glasshouse trials the efficacy of naked crabgrass control was evaluated with different herbicides registered on maize. Naked crabgrass is more tolerant to acetochlor and s-metolachlor and started to emerge two weeks after applications. Large crabgrass is still effectively controlled by these herbicides. More than 85 % of naked crabgrass was controlled when PRE applications of acetanilide herbicides were followed by <b>triketone</b> <b>herbicides.</b> Indiscriminate identification of all crabgrass species as “large crabgrass” can cause a shift from large crabgrass to naked crabgrass since the latter is more difficult to control. Extrapolation of characteristics and factors affecting germination and growth between similar species is perilous and should be verified. Results of this study proved that both grass weeds are severe competitors of maize, causing significant yield losses, but species specific characteristics could be distinguished and will improve decision making processes significantly to control naked crabgrass effectively in maize.

40|$|International audienceThe {{behaviour}} of sulcotrione, {{a recently}} introduced <b>triketone</b> <b>herbicide,</b> in various soil types was studied under laboratory conditions. In particular, degradation and sorption processes were examined on Ghent and Perpignan soils. Kinetics {{showed that the}} degradation of sulcotrione was influenced by biotic and/or abiotic factors. Half-lives ranged between 45 and 65 days. Among the degradation compounds identified were 1, 3 -cyclohexanedione (CHD) and 2 -chloro- 4 -mesyl benzoic acid (CMBA), previously described as hydrolysis products, and, under special conditions, a derivative of phenylheptanoic acid (PHD). This new degradation product suggested that sulcotrione could follow two possible pathways in the soil, as in water. During the sorption study, a moderate retention of sulcotrione and CMBA relative to CHD and PHD, which were highly adsorbed whatever the soil type, was reported. Experiments carried out under the same conditions for sulcotrione and mesotrione, another <b>triketone</b> <b>herbicide</b> recommended in maize culture, {{made it possible to}} compare the two triketones and to conclude that they exhibited relatively similar behaviour in the soil, i. e. that their leaching potential needs to be properly addressed and risks evaluated...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePhotochemical {{behaviour}} of sulcotrione, a <b>triketone</b> <b>herbicide,</b> was {{studied in}} a variety of aqueous solutions including natural waters (sea and river) under laboratory conditions. Photodegradation experiments were carried out under two irradiation systems (UV-B and simulated solar radiation) in order to evaluate kinetics of active ingredient. The degradation kinetics, more rapid under UV-B radiation than solar simulator, followed a first-order reaction (photolysis half-lives ranged between 3 and 50 h) and appeared strongly dependent on water origin, pH value and molecular structure of the herbicide. Dissolved organic matter showed a retarding effect while low concentrations of nitrate ions had no effect on photolysis rate. Identification of photoproducts indicated that hydrolysis, a pH-dependent process (no degradation at pH > 6 but at pH= 3, k= 0. 0344 h(- 1)), could be photoassisted. These results were compared to those of mesotrione, another <b>triketone</b> <b>herbicide,</b> which appeared more stable under UV-B irradiation.

Bacteria from this soil were cultured in mineral salt solution supplemented with mesotrione as sole source of carbon for the isolation of mesotrione-degrading bacteria. The bacterial community structure of the enrichment cultures was analyzed by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). The TTGE fingerprints revealed that mesotrione {{had an impact on}} bacterial community structure only at its highest concentrations and showed mesotrione-sensitive and mesotrione-adapted strains. Two adapted strains, identified as Bacillus sp. and Arthrobacter sp., were isolated by colony hybridization methods. Biodegradation assays showed that only the Bacillus sp. strain was able to completely and rapidly biotransform mesotrione. Among several metabolites formed, 2 -amino- 4 -methylsulfonylbenzoic acid (AMBA) accumulated in the medium.

Sulcotrione, trademark Mikado, grape marc, and mixtures of sulcotrione or Mikado with grape marc induced cell death. Addition of grape marc to either sulcotrione or Mikado enhanced cell death, especially with Mikado. Addition of grape marc to herbicides, sulcotrione, or Mikado resulted in different expression of genes usually associated with cell stress. Mixtures of grape marc and herbicides enhanced transcript accumulation for ubiquitin, hsp 70, and cytosolic superoxide dismutase, but did not change ascorbate peroxidase transcript accumulation. The results thus provide evidence that sulcotrione, Mikado, and mixtures with grape marc can trigger cell death and specific gene expressions.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the dose-response effects of an herbicide on soil photosynthetic microbial communities, particularly cyanobacteria, using a microcosm approach. Pure mesotrione (active ingredient), and Callisto (a commercial formulation of this <b>triketone</b> <b>herbicide),</b> were spread at different rates on soil microcosm surfaces. Soil Chlorophyll concentrations were quantified to assess the photosynthetic biomass, and the genetic structure and diversity of the cyanobacterial community were investigated by a group-specific polymerase chain reaction followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Dose-dependent responses were evidenced for both functional and structural parameters. No effect was detected in soils treated with 1 × AR (1 -fold recommended application rate) irrespective of the herbicide formulation. At 10 × AR (10 -fold recommended application rate), only Callisto treatment induced significant decreases of photosynthetic biomass, whereas structural parameters were less affected. At the 100 × AR (100 -fold recommended application rate), both pure mesotrione and Callisto had strong negative impacts on soil chlorophyll concentrations and cyanobacterial genetic structure and diversity. At both the 10 × AR and 100 × AR treatments, Callisto induced significant stronger effects than pure mesotrione. In addition, indicators of photosynthetic biomass, compared with structural parameters of cyanobacterial communities (within 14 days), responded (within 7 days) more quickly to herbicide stress.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sulcotrione is a herbicidal agent {{belonging}} {{to the family of}} <b>triketones.</b> Sulcotrione <b>herbicides</b> are used for weed control in maize and flax crops. To date, no cases of human poisoning had been reported in the literature linked to different herbicidal agents in the triketone family. We report here on two cases of the voluntary ingestion of this substance {{in the form of the}} branded product Mikado(TM), which were recorded by the Angers Poison Centre. CASE REPORT: Both cases of voluntary ingestion constituted attempted suicide, and involved two men aged 30 and 37 years. Their symptoms linked to sulcotrione were limited to vomiting, despite elevated plasma concentrations of sulcotrione. In one case, hypertyrosinemia has been demonstrated. The outcome was favourable in both patients and at follow up, no ocular disorders were observed. In the second case, hypotension and transient renal failure could be linked to the concomitant ingestion of chlorophenoxy herbicides. DISCUSSION: In animal toxicity studies, sulcotrione inhibit 4 -hydro-phenylpyruvate dioxygenase leading to hypertyrosinemia and corneal opacities. In both cases, no ocular disorders were observed despite hypertyrosinemia in one case. These case reports were consistent with the animal toxicology findings concerning triketones, and particularly their relative safety in mammals following acute poisoning. However it seems prudent to monitor plasma tyrosine concentrations and to screen prospectively for corneal deposits if further acute intoxication events occur...|$|R

Methods: The reactivity of both herbicides toward hydroxyl radicals {{was found to}} depend on the electron-withdrawing effect of the aromatic chlorine or nitro substituents. The degradation of sulcotrione and mesotrione obeyed apparent first-order reaction kinetics, and their absolute rate constants with hydroxyl radicals at pH 3. 0 were determined by the competitive kinetics method. Results and discussion: The hydroxylation absolute rate constant (kabs) values of both TRK herbicides ranged from 8. 20 × 108 (sulcotrione) to 1. 01 × 109 (mesotrione) L mol- 1 s- 1, whereas those of the TRK main cyclic or aromatic by-products, namely cyclohexane 1, 3 -dione, (2 -chloro- 4 -methylsulphonyl) benzoic acid and 4 -(methylsulphonyl) - 2 -nitrobenzoic acid, comprised between 5. 90 × 108 and 3. 29 × 109 L mol- 1 s- 1. The efficiency of mineralization of aqueous solutions of both TRK herbicides was evaluated in terms of total organic carbon removal. Mineralization yields of about 97 - 98 % were reached in optimal conditions for a 6 -h electro-Fenton treatment time.
