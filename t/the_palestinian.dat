5|$|Unlike {{some other}} West Bank localities, {{unemployment}} {{is a minor}} issue in Jifna.

The only thing that could save Zionism in Palestine is for <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> to conclude any type of so-called comprehensive Middle East Peace treaty with Israel.

[...] Boyle has written that [...] "the Jewish Bantustan (will) collapse of its own racist and genocidal weight over the next two decades if not much sooner.

5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> National Council (PNC) {{convened in}} Cairo on 3 February 1969, Yahya Hammuda {{stepped down from}} his {{chairmanship}} of the PLO.

He became Commander-in-Chief of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Revolutionary Forces two years later, and in 1973, became {{the head of the}} PLO's political department.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. <b>The</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal {{argue that}} the revolt was a {{formative}} event for <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> sense of nationhood in that it brought together disparate groups against a common enemy. Moreover, they asserted that these groups reemerged later to constitute <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> people. The revolt represented a moment of political unity in Palestine. However, the ultimate intention of the notables and rebel leaders was to force out the Egyptian army and reinstate Ottoman rule {{as a means of}} restoring the Ottoman-era standards that defined the relationship {{between the government and the}} governed. These standards were made up of the religious laws, administrative codes and local norms and traditions that were disrupted by Egyptian reforms.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Palestinians</b> {{are in a}} {{situation}} of insanity reminiscent of the insanity of the German people in the Nazi period. <b>The</b> <b>Palestinians</b> are not <b>the</b> first people that the Jewish people has driven insane.(Subsequent clarification by Yehoshua) I ask myself a question that must be asked: What brought the Germans and what is bringing <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> to such hatred of us? ...

40|$|What {{triggered}} the new war in Lebanon was Israel's offensive on <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in Gaza. Since Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, the Hezbollah carefully refrained from confrontations with the Israeli army inside the Israeli border (restricting themselves to confrontations in the Shaba area of Lebanon, which Israel still occupies). The timing {{of its first}} attack, {{as well as its}} rhetoric afterwards, indicate that their intention was to reduce the pressure on <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> by opening a new front. Their attack can be viewed, then, as the first military act of solidarity with <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in <b>the</b> Arab world. Whatever one may think about Hezbollah's act, {{it is important to understand}} the nature of Israel's war against <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in Gaza...|$|R
