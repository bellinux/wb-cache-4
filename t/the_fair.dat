5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> catch kick.

Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. <b>The</b> <b>fair</b> catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of <b>the</b> grid-stiffened <b>fairing</b> to be flown on the Minotaur launch vehicle {{has made significant}} progress {{over the past five}} years. During November and December 2002, this qualification structure was subjected to static qualification testing at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/VS) at Kirtland Air Force Base. The 6 m (20 ft) tall fairing was constructed of a carbon fiber composite grid structure that was over-wrapped to create a laminated skin. Upon completion of curing and machining, <b>the</b> <b>fairing</b> was cut in half to create the classic “clam-shell ” fairing. Metallic joints were bonded and fastened to <b>the</b> <b>fairing</b> at all interfaces to complete the assembly process and simulate attachment of the base to a launch vehicle. Static qualification of <b>the</b> <b>fairing</b> tested <b>the</b> integrity of <b>the</b> <b>fairing,</b> thereby proving <b>the</b> design and manufacturing process. Loads were applied incrementally in a static loading scenario. The applied load envelope exceeded worst-case dynamic flight conditions with an added safety factor of 25 %. At peak load <b>the</b> <b>fairing</b> must maintain structural integrity remaining within the defined dynamic displacement envelope. Load application was accomplished through hydraulic actuators attached to <b>the</b> <b>fairing</b> by two means. Shear (lateral) loads were distributed over a large amount of surface area through the us...|$|R
