5|$|Both events, not {{connected}} publicly for several weeks, caused the curious {{to visit the}} website ilovebees.com. The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> gone wrong with her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting {{that this was a}} mystery that could be unraveled, Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring out what was going on.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3. Since the strike {{had been going on}} for a few months, with no settlement expected in the near future, union members began to lose hope. Thousands of people had already been arrested and a lot of money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending. Union members knew <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> to be done to regain the spirit of the strike and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end {{the impression that the}} Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> to be done about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid's monasteries in Mercia may {{date from}} this time, as King Wulfhere of Mercia gave him large grants {{of land in}} Mercia. Wilfrid may have persuaded King Ecgberht of Kent in 669 to build a church in an {{abandoned}} Roman fort at Reculver. When Theodore, the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, arrived in England in 669 it was clear <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> {{to be done about}} the situation in Northumbria. Ceadda's election to York was improper, and Theodore did not consider Ceadda's consecration to have been valid. Consequently, Theodore deposed Ceadda, leaving the way open for Wilfrid, who was finally installed in his see in 669, the first Saxon to occupy the see of York. Wilfrid spent the next nine years building churches, including at the monastery at Hexham, and attending to diocesan business. He continued to exercise control over his monastic houses of Ripon and Hexham while he was bishop. Oswiu's death on 15February 670 eliminated a source of friction and helped to assure Wilfrid's return.|$|E
25|$|Due to the foggy {{conditions}} and limited visibility at the airport, it took controllers nearly {{two minutes to}} determine <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> happened to North Central Flight 575. Once they did, they alerted the Chicago Fire Department, which arrived at the scene about a minute later, three minutes after the crash. Employing 11 crash and fire vehicles and two ambulances, the fire department extinguished the fire in about 16 minutes at around 6:19p.m. CST.|$|E
25|$|The two escort {{ships were}} unaware of what was {{happening}} to General Belgrano, as they were out of touch with her in the gloom and had not seen the distress rockets or lamp signals. Adding to the confusion, the crew of Bouchard felt an impact that was possibly the third torpedo striking {{at the end of its}} run (an examination of the ship later showed an impact mark consistent with a torpedo). The two ships continued on their course westward and began dropping depth charges. By the time the ships realised <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> happened to General Belgrano, it was already dark and the weather had worsened, scattering the life rafts.|$|E

25|$|Following this, though Winters {{tried to}} talk them out of it, {{a number of the}} company's non-commissioned {{officers}} (NCOs) gave the regimental commander, Colonel Sink, an ultimatum: either Sobel be replaced, or they would surrender their stripes. Sink was not impressed and several of the NCOs were subsequently demoted and/or transferred out of the company. Nevertheless, Sink realized <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> to be done and decided to transfer Sobel out of Easy Company, giving him command of a new parachute training school at Chilton-Foliat. Winters' court martial was set aside and he returned to Easy Company as leader of 1st Platoon. Winters later said he felt that at least part of Easy Company's success had been due to Sobel's strenuous training and high expectations. In February 1944, First Lieutenant Thomas Meehan was given command of Easy Company.|$|E
500|$|Among the Ordainers {{considered}} {{loyal to}} Edward II was John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond {{who was also}} by this time {{one of the older}} remaining earls. John had served Edward I, his uncle, and was Edward II's first cousin. The natural leader of the group was Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln. One of the wealthiest men in the country, he was also the oldest of the earls and had proved his loyalty and ableness through long service to Edward I. Lincoln had a moderating influence on the more extreme members of the group, but with his death in February 1311, leadership passed to his son-in-law and heir Thomas of Lancaster. Lancaster [...] the king’s cousin [...] was now in possession of five earldoms which made him by far the wealthiest man in the country, save the king. There is no evidence that Lancaster was in opposition to the king {{in the early years of}} the king's reign, but by the time of the Ordinances it is clear <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> negatively affected his opinion [...] of King Edward.|$|E
500|$|Once the use {{and danger}} of poison was realized, it became {{apparent}} <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> to be done. Mithridates VI, King of Pontus (an ancient Hellenistic state of northern Anatolia), from around 114–63 BC, lived in constant fear of being assassinated through poison. He became a hard-working pioneer {{in the search for}} a cure for poisons. In his position of power, he was able to test poisons on criminals facing execution, and then if there was a possible antidote. He was paranoid to the point that he administered daily amounts of poisons in an attempt to make himself immune to as many poisons as he could. Eventually, he discovered a formula that combined small portions of dozens of the best-known herbal remedies of the time, which he named Mithridatium. This was kept secret until his kingdom was invaded by Pompey the Great, who took it back to Rome. [...] After being defeated by Pompey, Mithridates' antidote prescriptions and notes of medicinal plants were taken by the Romans and translated into Latin.|$|E

500|$|On September 21, 1996, Clinton {{signed into}} law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines {{marriage}} for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman, allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states. Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton's signing of DOMA [...] "was a political decision that they made {{at the time of}} a re-election". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was an attempt to [...] "head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states", a possibility he described as highly likely {{in the context of a}} [...] "very reactionary Congress". Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, [...] "the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected." [...] Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something [...] "which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that". Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims [...] "historic revisionism". In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, [...] "The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments." [...] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.|$|E

2500|$|Williams {{first became}} {{a suspect in}} the Atlanta Child Murders in May 1981, when a police {{surveillance}} team, watching a bridge spanning the Chattahoochee River (a site where several victims' bodies had been discovered), heard a [...] "big loud splash", suggesting <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> been thrown from the bridge into the river below. The first automobile to exit the bridge after the splash was Williams'.

2500|$|On August 13, 2009, during Netroots Nation, {{when confronted}} by LGBT activist Lane Hudson, Clinton {{explained}} {{that he had to}} sign DOMA in order to prevent a constitutional amendment that would proscribe same-sex marriage: [...] "We were attempting at the time, in a very reactionary Congress, to head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states. [...] And {{if you look at the}} eleven referenda much later—in 2004, in the election—which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for President Bush up, I think it's obvious <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>had</b> to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In summer 1942, {{several members}} of the White Rose had to serve for three months on the Russian front {{alongside}} many other male medical students from the University of Munich. There, they observed the horrors of war, saw beatings and other mistreatment of Jews by the Germans, and heard about the persecution of the Jews from reliable sources. Some witnessed atrocities of the war on the battlefield and against civilian populations in the East. In a letter to his sister Anneliese, Willi Graf wrote: [...] "I wish I had been spared the view of all this which I had to witness."
