5|$|Rand and Robyn Miller both {{wanted to}} develop Mysts back story into novels. After {{the success of}} Myst, {{publisher}} Hyperion signed a three-book, US$1 million deal with the brothers. David Wingrove worked from the Miller brothers' story outlines. The three books, entitled Myst: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Atrus, Myst: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Ti'ana, and Myst: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> D'ni, were released in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. The books were later packaged together as The Myst Reader. A fourth novel, entitled Myst: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Marrim, is planned.|$|E
5|$|The Myst Reader is a {{collection}} of three novels based on the Myst series of adventure games. The collection was published in September 2004 and combines three works previously published separately: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Atrus (1995), <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Tiana (1996), and <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Dni (1997). The novels were each written by British science-fiction writer David Wingrove with assistance from Mysts creators, Rand and Robyn Miller.|$|E
5|$|The Satanic Bible is {{composed}} of four books: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Satan, <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Lucifer, <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Belial, and <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Leviathan. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Satan challenges the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Lucifer holds most of the philosophy in The Satanic Bible, with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Belial, LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Leviathan provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee's Enochian keys), provided in both Enochian and translated to English.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the mini-series and the ongoing series, Vertigo also produced four <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Magic annuals. <b>The</b> first, Arcana: <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Magic Annual, reintroduced Tim Hunter and launched the ongoing series. The second, actually titled <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Magic Annual #1 due to the change in name from [...] "Arcana", {{told the story of}} Tim's encounter with a minor god's daughter who was one of Tamlin's cast-off conquests. Both these annuals were later included in the collected editions <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Faerie and <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Faerie: Auberon's Tale respectively.|$|R

5|$|The spells in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead depict Egyptian {{beliefs about}} the nature of death and the afterlife. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead is a vital source of {{information}} about Egyptian beliefs in this area.|$|E
5|$|A {{panelled}} stone {{structure in}} the church, carved with processions of bearded and robed figures under arches, seems to reproduce details found in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Cerne, a work associated with Bishop Æthelwold of Lichfield (818–830). The panels, which may originally have been the outer part of a sarcophagus built to hold {{the remains of a}} high status person such as Saint Hardulph, are dated by their similarity to the illustrations in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Cerne to the first third of the ninth century. According to a medieval calendar of saints, the Benedictine monks at Breedon celebrated Hardulph's feast day on 21 August.|$|E

25|$|Some {{books that}} are set apart in the Masoretic text are grouped together. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Samuel and <b>the</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Kings are in <b>the</b> LXX one <b>book</b> in four parts called Βασιλειῶν ("Of Reigns"). In LXX, <b>the</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Chronicles {{supplement}} Reigns and it is called Paraleipoménon (Παραλειπομένων—things left out).

5|$|Another likely {{literary}} {{source is}} the plague narrative in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Exodus, in which Egypt {{is covered by}} darkness for three days. It {{has been suggested that}} the author of Matthew's gospel changed the Marcan text slightly to more closely match this source. Commentators have also drawn comparisons with the description of darkness in the Genesis creation narrative, with a prophecy regarding mid-day darkness by Jeremiah, and with an end-times prophecy in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Zechariah.|$|E
5|$|April 8 through April 10. The Feast of the Three Days of the Writing of <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Law. These {{three days}} are {{commemorative}} {{of the three}} days in the year 1904 during which Aleister Crowley wrote <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Law. One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated by reading the corresponding chapter {{on each of the}} three days, usually at noon.|$|E
5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E

Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts.

5|$|In 1835, Smith {{encouraged}} some Latter Day Saints in Kirtland {{to purchase}} rolls of ancient Egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor.

The papyri from which Smith dictated <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Abraham were thought to have been lost in the Great Chicago Fire. However, several fragments were rediscovered in the 1960s, were translated by Egyptologists, and were determined to be part of <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead with no connection to Abraham.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main Myst saga, Cyan developed , which was released on November 14, 2003. Uru allows players to customize their avatars, and renders graphics in real-time. The multiplayer component of Uru was initially cancelled, but GameTap eventually revived it as , which was in turn cancelled. The game was later resurrected as an open source title. The newest and current iteration of online Uru was made open source and various fan ages have been created. The Miller brothers collaborated with David Wingrove and wrote several novels based on the Myst universe, which were published by Hyperion. The novels, entitled Myst: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Atrus, Myst: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Ti'ana, and Myst: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> D'ni, fill in the games' backstory and were packaged together as The Myst Reader.|$|E

Editor Stuart Moore approached writer Bronwyn Carlton to script the first three issue series: Carlton wrote a series which brought {{back some of the}} ambiguity around whether Timothy Hunter was Queen Titania's son that Reiber had attempted to dispel in his early issues on the parent title. The success of the series led to Carlton writing the next limited series, <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Faerie: Auberon's Tale, and a handful of back-up strips published in <b>the</b> main <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Magic monthly. These were well received by the audience.|$|R
50|$|Whilst Gaiman used Titania as a {{recurring}} character throughout the series, Auberon never appeared again. However, {{due to his}} wife's key role in <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Magic, Auberon returned when John Ney Rieber used Gaiman's characters in an ongoing <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Magic series. From his first appearance in the ongoing series, Auberon was a major character and remained until the final issues even though his wife was phased out when Peter Gross took over as writer. Such was the importance of Auberon to <b>the</b> ongoing <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Magic series that when its spin-off miniseries <b>The</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> Faerie proved popular, a second miniseries was published featuring Auberon as a child ascending to the throne of Faerie.|$|R
