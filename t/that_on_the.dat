5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the test programme, Senior Prom was {{cancelled}} in 1982; reportedly one reason for the cancellation of the project was that the size and configuration of the Senior Prom aircraft rendered it incapable of being carried in internal weapons bays such as <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> B-1 bomber; the AGM-129 ACM, a competing design to Senior Prom for the cruise missile requirement, had a more slender airframe with retractable wings, which rendered it capable of internal carriage; it began flight testing shortly {{after the end of the}} Senior Prom programme.|$|E
