5|$|For the 1931 season, Lowerhouse, the Lancashire League club {{which had}} {{finished}} {{bottom of the}} league in 1931, signed St Hill as their professional cricketer. He {{was one of three}} West Indians playing professional league cricket in England, the others being Learie Constantine and George Francis. Early in the season, he spoke publicly to express his thanks for <b>the</b> <b>welcome</b> he had received.|$|E
5|$|Labelled as a green tour, Thirty Seconds to Mars {{developed}} {{strategies that}} minimized fuel consumption of all touring vehicles. Head Automatica and Cobra Starship {{served as the}} opening acts, with other bands joining for select dates. <b>The</b> <b>Welcome</b> to the Universe Tour received positive reviews from critics, who praised Thirty Seconds to Mars' energy onstage {{and the production of}} the show. The concert tour was recorded and broadcast on MTV2.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February 1879, Chilean forces entered Antofagasta to <b>the</b> <b>welcome</b> {{of most of}} {{the local}} population, {{beginning}} the War of the Pacific against Bolivia and Peru. Many locals enlisted in the Chilean Army, and Morales enlisted as a soldier to avenge her husband by disguising herself as a man and slipping in unnoticed amid the frenzy of patriotism.|$|E

5|$|After US President Richard Nixon {{made his}} famous 1972 visit to China, {{a wave of}} exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a {{delegation}} of the American Institute of Architects in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned <b>the</b> <b>welcome</b> with positive comments, {{and a series of}} lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} upgrades at the New York Navy Yard, {{including the}} addition of smoke ejectors, Kentucky joined the North Atlantic Squadron. The battleship participated in <b>the</b> <b>welcome</b> of the British North Atlantic Squadron at Annapolis, Maryland, in October 1905. During the 1906 Cuban Insurrection, she carried Marines to Cuba, embarking them from Provincetown on 23 September, and landing them at Havana, Cuba, on 1 October. She remained there until 9 October, {{and then returned to}} New England. Kentucky attended the Jamestown Exposition at Norfolk, Virginia, on 15 April 1907, and then participated in exercises off the New England coast.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Conan Doyle {{was active}} in the area between 1891 and 1894. Although he lived in nearby South Norwood he visited the Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood area {{regularly}} in connection with the Upper Norwood Literary and Scientific Society. The Foresters Hall on Westow Street was then known as <b>the</b> <b>Welcome</b> Hall (or just Welcome) and it was in that hall in May 1892 that Arthur Conan Doyle was elected president of the society. He was re-elected to the post in 1893 and resigned in 1894. Each occasion was in the same hall.|$|E

5|$|As {{a symbol}} of presidential authority, the banner was carried or flown to mark the {{presence}} of the head of state and, at the same time, the commander-in-chief. It was flown on the president's official residence, and used as a car flag and instead of number plates on the president's vehicle. The banner was also used on special national occasions including <b>the</b> <b>welcome</b> ceremony for Ignacy Paderewski in Poznań in 1918 and Poland's wedding to the Baltic Sea in Puck in 1920. It also draped the coffins of Henryk Sienkiewicz in 1924, the Unknown Soldier in 1925, and Marshal Józef Piłsudski in 1935.|$|E
5|$|George VI's {{coronation}} at Westminster Abbey {{took place}} on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony {{in a show of}} support for her son. There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the government of India. Rising Indian nationalism made <b>the</b> <b>welcome</b> that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best, and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1917, the Army and Navy Union {{began its}} eighteenth {{biennial}} convention at the Bohemian Hall in Baltimore, Maryland. <b>The</b> <b>welcome</b> address {{was given by}} Maryland governor Emerson Harrington to 500 delegates. General Oden Lake also spoke at this convention and {{announced that he would}} not be running again as their national commander. The next day was scheduled a banquet reception and later in the week an old-time campfire event. Overall there were about 2000 visitors to this convention.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>welcome</b> {{extended}} by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) was {{in contrast to}} that of Scotland. The morning they arrived in Belfast they were met by several IRFU officials who took them out for breakfast. The arrival in Ireland also marked a homecoming for the captain Dave Gallaher, {{who was born in}} County Donegal, but had moved to New Zealand at the age of four. Thousands awaited the All Blacks when they arrived in the Dublin train station. On the Thursday before the Test, both teams attended the theatre together; sitting alternatively so they could better mix.|$|E
5|$|When Bounty {{returned}} to Tahiti, on 22 September, <b>the</b> <b>welcome</b> {{was much less}} effusive than previously. The Tahitians had learned from the crew of a visiting British ship {{that the story of}} Cook and Bligh founding a settlement in Aitutaki was a fabrication, and that Cook had been long dead. Christian worried that their reaction might turn violent, and did not stay long. Of the 16 men who had voted to settle in Tahiti, he allowed 15 ashore; Joseph Coleman was detained on the ship, as Christian required his skills as an armourer.|$|E
5|$|Because {{pure silver}} is very soft, most silver used for these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has <b>the</b> <b>welcome</b> side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|E

5|$|In the {{economic}} austerity of post-war Britain, Larwood's business made little money. He was persuaded, largely by his erstwhile opponent Jack Fingleton, {{that he would}} find better prospects and a warm welcome in Australia, {{and he decided to}} emigrate there with his family, which by then included five daughters. On 1 April 1950 the Larwoods sailed on SS Orontes—the ship that had carried Jardine's party 18 years previously. On arrival in Australia <b>the</b> <b>welcome</b> was warm and immediate. During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel, unbeknown to them half their bills were paid by the former prime minister Ben Chifley. Despite a housing shortage, the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford, and Larwood found steady employment with a soft drinks firm. Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other, and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2010, MDOT {{announced}} plans to transfer M-108 in its entirety to the Village of Mackinaw City and Emmet County. In preparation for this transfer, MDOT repaved, widened and reconstructed the roadway. While rebuilding {{the section of the}} highway between US23 and the northern terminus, <b>the</b> <b>welcome</b> center was closed. Plans had this section to be completed, and the center to be reopened, for Memorial Day weekend, with the remainder of construction to be completed in August. Following the transfer to local control, M-108 ceased to be a state highway and the designation was decommissioned. Previous news reports stated that the roadway was too small to merit highway status under federal guidelines. The transfer was completed on December 9, 2010, when MDOT and local officials signed memoranda of understanding to finalize the transfer. The section within the Village of Mackinaw City was transferred to the village, and the remainder to Emmet County.|$|E
5|$|Veronica meets Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo), who annoys both Veronica and Mac. Veronica, Parker, Mac, Wallace, and Piz go to a concert.
