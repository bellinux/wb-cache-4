500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Mark Webber, both Mercedes drivers expressed delight at their result. Hamilton in particular described his race as [...] "great" [...] {{and added that}} he [...] "loved <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to come through from far behind." [...] Sebastian Vettel meanwhile was satisfied with his start, but lamented the red flag situation and said that Ferrari had not expected Mercedes to opt for the harder tyre compound and go {{until the end of}} the race. He later added that he was confident that Ferrari had closed the gap to Mercedes and would be able to compete for the championship throughout the season. Nico Rosberg later revealed that the team had been close to retiring his car due to persisting brake issues caused by debris caught in the brake caliper. However, he was able to manage the brake temperatures to secure victory. Rosberg also apologised to his teammate for making contact and forcing him wide at the start.|$|E
2500|$|... "We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> got {{so close to the}} Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long ago, you might think, but let me tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back and we kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Frank Fenter {{was chosen}} by Atlantic Records partner Nesuhi Ertegun to head the label in the United Kingdom. Within six months, Frank Fenter was the Managing Director in charge of Atlantic Records' {{operations}} in all of Europe. Fenter was responsible for making Atlantic Records [...] "the most important American label in promoting British music", according to the late Ahmet Ertegun, co-founder and Chairman of Atlantic Records and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, {{who went on to}} say, [...] "We wound up with quite a lot of British bands, {{due in large part to}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> put Frank Fenter in charge of all Atlantic Records activity in Europe" [...] In Frank Fenter's capacity and role as Managing Director of Atlantic Records European Operations, he played a vital role in having brought Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records and helped discover and sign such British progressive-rock groups as Yes and King Crimson.|$|E

This paper offers {{an interpretation of}} the Dantzig selector as a generalized thresholding operator.

2500|$|Basically, they [...] {{wanted us}} to re-sign and do a new {{contract}} before our old one was done and we didn't want to do that. We wanted to fulfil our original contract {{and then go on}} from there because {{there were a number of}} labels that were interested in working with us. [...] We were playing hardball back and forth with the label and that's why that record ... it was a difficult period for us. We were all pretty pissed off and angry and that shows in the music. Our budget got slashed for that record just because of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not re-signed. I think it came down to [...] "Well, re-sign now or this is your budget because that's what is says in your contract." [...] You can't argue with that. We didn't re-sign. We didn't buckle under and I think it paid off in the end because we got what we wanted [...] We got everything that we wanted in our new record deal ... everything that we've worked ten fucking years for and deserve, we got. We learned how to play the game and we played it very well.|$|E
