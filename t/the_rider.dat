5|$|The 2015 Vuelta a España {{included}} four principal classifications. The {{first of}} these was the general classification, which was calculated by adding up each rider's times on each stage and applying the relevant time bonuses. These were 10 seconds for the stage winner, 6 seconds for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> in second, and 4 seconds for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> in third, and 3, 2 and 1 seconds {{for the first three}} riders at each intermediate sprint; no bonuses were awarded on the time trial stages. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> leading the classification wore a red jersey.|$|E
5|$|When Bjarne Riis {{took over}} in winter 2000, he hired the former Danish Ranger Corps soldier B.S. Christiansen as advisor and they gave CSC a {{distinct}} philosophy and training methods. The team works with four values: communication, loyalty, commitment and respect, {{with the aim of}} improving teamwork. The team rides for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> in the best shape on the day, and separates the function of team captain (<b>the</b> <b>rider</b> making decisions) and team leader (<b>the</b> <b>rider</b> trying to win) to avoid pressure on a single rider.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> enter <b>the</b> main theater, <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> {{are seated}} in a rocket ship with Yogi as the captain. The power source is a large rubber band. The force is so strong {{everyone}} ends up going {{back in time to}} Bedrock. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> fly off a cliff and through Mr. Slate's construction site before flying into the main city. Yogi and <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> chase after Dastardly through the streets, dodging cars, residents of Bedrock (including Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble), and Yogi ends up chasing Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble (who are driving Fred's car) down a street by accident. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> fly up after Dastardly into the skies, and through a vortex. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> end up chasing Dastardly through a cemetery {{in the middle of the}} night, and <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> are on a near-collision near the Mystery Machine that Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are driving, leading them into a castle where they encounter ghosts. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> fly around <b>the</b> haunted house looking for Dastardly down hallways and corridors, dodging Scooby and Shaggy who are left hanging on a chandelier when <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> chase after Dastardly into another vortex.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the balance}} is calibrated, place the objects on {{the pan and}} adjust <b>the</b> <b>riders.</b> <b>The</b> hundred <b>rider</b> should be {{initially}} adjusted and follow by <b>the</b> tens <b>rider.</b> Adjust <b>the</b> ones <b>rider</b> until <b>the</b> scale pointer is at zero again.|$|R
5000|$|The printed card of {{the puzzle}} shows two donkeys on which {{the central part of}} them has been left blank on purpose, the third part of the card are <b>the</b> <b>riders,</b> <b>the</b> {{objective}} {{of the puzzle}} is to arrange the three pieces (the two donkeys and <b>the</b> <b>riders)</b> so <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> are mounting <b>the</b> donkeys.|$|R
5|$|After riders {{board the}} train and lower their restraint, {{attached}} to the restraint is a small screen containing the logo of the ride and five categories of songs <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> can pick from. The song that <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> picked begins as the train climbs the vertical lift hill. Depending on the song, it may not begin {{at the beginning and}} end early as the total cycle time of the roller coaster is 1 minute and 39 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The second {{competition}} is the points classification. This is calculated by awarding {{points for the}} top 10 riders at the finish of each stage (15 points to the winner down to 1 point for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> in tenth place) and to the top three at intermediate sprints (3 points, 2 points and 1 point). <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> with the highest points total {{is the leader of}} the classification and wears a green jersey.|$|E
50|$|After {{boarding}} <b>the</b> Mindbender, <b>riders</b> put {{on their}} seatbelt and lap restraints. Also, the ride operator lowers large shoulder restraints over <b>the</b> <b>riders.</b> All of <b>the</b> restraints keep <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> firmly secured in the seat.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Riders</b> {{appeared}} as musical spokesmen {{in a series}} of YellaWood commercials, which re-united <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> with Steve Arwood (once again playing Texas Bix Bender) and featured a set similar to the one seen on Tumbleweed Theater (complete with a blue Studebaker pickup truck and <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> performing on a Bunkhouse porch). <b>The</b> <b>Riders</b> also performed <b>the</b> theme song for YellaWood's The Adventures of Yella Fella and make cameos in the first episodes of seasons one and two.|$|R
5000|$|Iain Grandage {{who wrote}} the music for {{adaptation}} of <b>The</b> <b>Riders</b> as an opera described <b>The</b> <b>Riders</b> as follows [...] "At its heart, <b>The</b> <b>Riders</b> is about <b>the</b> nature of love. It deals with questions of how well we can truly know someone; how well we can truly know ourselves." ...|$|R
5|$|There {{were also}} two classifications awarded for {{positions}} at {{points in the}} middle of stages. Each stage (except the individual time trial) included individual sprint points (3, 2 and 1 points respectively for the top three riders); <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> with the highest total led the classification and wore a blue jersey. Each stage also included several categorised climbs, with more points awarded for the most difficult ("first-category") climbs. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> with the most accumulated points led the classification and wore a red and white jersey.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} two {{beautiful}} women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider stood near the wheel. Uttanka praised {{the functioning of the}} weaving process, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> and the horse, and equated <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> to Indra. Pleased with this praise, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. <b>The</b> <b>rider</b> then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E
5|$|A combativity {{award was}} also {{attributed}} for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> who had ridden the most aggressively {{in the eyes}} of the judges at the end of every stage. It could have been a rider who featured in breakaways or a cyclist who attacked often.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, Chrisman {{approached}} <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> (then {{consisting of}} just Douglas B. Green and Fred LaBour) backstage after a show and inquired about joining the group. Shortly before Chrisman approached <b>the</b> <b>Riders,</b> Williams [...] "Bill" [...] Collins {{had just left}} the group, so Green and LaBour were already looking for a replacement member, and Chrisman seem like the perfect fit. Chrisman's first show with <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> was at <b>the</b> 1978 Kentucky State Fair. As of 2017, Chrisman is still with <b>the</b> <b>Riders.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} fourth {{category}} climbs took <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> through Languedoc, before the run into Nîmes on this transitional stage before <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> move into <b>the</b> Alps.|$|R
50|$|The Haunted Swing was {{a notable}} ride during 1894 in the San Francisco Chronicle. It {{was said to}} have caused riders to pray to the biblical saint of their choosing, as most were baffled by how the ride managed to appear to make the room spin 360-degrees vertically. Although the room {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> caused <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> to feel as though they were spinning, they actually never left a stationary position. The room in which <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> sat spun on an axis, causing the illusion of displacement in the position of <b>the</b> <b>riders.</b>|$|R
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> to control, and is actually used by <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|Downhill it is {{much easier}} to topple over the front wheel because the incline moves the line of mg closer to f. To try to reduce this {{tendency}} <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> can stand back on the pedals to try to keep m as far back as possible.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5000|$|When Shuttlesworth {{prepared}} <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> {{to leave}} Birmingham and {{they reached the}} Greyhound Terminal, <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> found themselves stranded as no bus driver was willing to drive the controversial group into Mississippi. Shuttlesworth stuck with <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> and called Kennedy. [...] Prompted by Shuttlesworth, Kennedy {{tried to find a}} replacement bus driver. Unfortunately, his efforts eventually proved unsuccessful. <b>The</b> <b>Riders</b> then decided to take a plane to New Orleans (where they had planned on finishing the Rides) and were assisted by Shuttlesworth in getting to the airport and onto the plane.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>riders</b> went on strike, {{after being}} led astray by race officials. Their main {{complaint}} was poor security. <b>The</b> <b>riders</b> eventually resumed <b>the</b> race, {{and the stage}} ended in a mass sprint.|$|R
2500|$|In general, {{the route}} took <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> from <b>the</b> start in Liège south to Bastogne. With [...] convered, the route {{turned to the}} north and took <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> back to Liège. The second leg of the race was {{significantly}} longer at , taking <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> north-east to Spa before turning west to the finish. The race finished in Ans, just to the west of Liège.|$|R
5|$|Forty-nine cyclists {{completed}} {{all eight}} stages. The points each received from their stage placings were added {{up for the}} general classification, and the winner was <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> with the fewest accumulated points.|$|E

5|$|In the 2015 Paris–Nice, four jerseys were awarded. The general {{classification}} {{was calculated}} by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on road stages (stages 1–6): the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for {{the second and third}} riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints (three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> in second and one second for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> in third. The leader of the general classification received a yellow jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the 2015 Paris–Nice, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race.|$|E
50|$|White {{signed a}} free agent {{contract}} with <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> in May, 2014. White re-signed with <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> on February 16, 2016. He was released by the Roughriders during final cuts in June 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Before using triple beam balance, {{the scale}} pointer {{should be at}} zero. [...] The zero {{adjustment}} knob {{can be used to}} adjust the scale pointer. Place the objects on the pan and adjust <b>the</b> <b>riders.</b> <b>The</b> hundred <b>rider</b> should be initially adjusted and follow by <b>the</b> tens <b>rider.</b> Adjust <b>the</b> ones <b>rider</b> until <b>the</b> scale pointer is at zero again.|$|R
500|$|The fourteenth {{stage was}} the first of three {{consecutive}} summit finishes. It began in Vitoria-Gasteiz, the capital of the Basque Country, and took <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> [...] to Alto Campoo. The stage included three categorised climbs, all of which came {{in the second half of}} the stage. The first [...] of the stage took <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> west, before <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> reached <b>the</b> first categorised climb. This was the third-category Puerto Estacas de Trueba ( [...] at 2.9%). After <b>the</b> descent, <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> immediately climbed <b>the</b> first-category Puerto del Escudo ( [...] at 6.4%). There was then a flat section of around [...] that took <b>the</b> <b>riders</b> to <b>the</b> foot of the final climb. This was the Alto Campoo ( [...] at 5.5%). The climb was fairly regular and, though long, was not particularly steep and was not expected to result in large gaps between <b>the</b> general classification <b>riders.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 2016 Paris–Nice, three jerseys were awarded. The general {{classification}} {{was calculated}} by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on road stages (Stages 1–7): the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for {{the second and third}} riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints (three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> in second and one second for <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> in third).

5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> or by friction. In addition to pedaling, <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} classification, {{represented by}} a blue jersey, was calculated by summing up the points obtained by each rider in the other classifications; the leader was <b>the</b> <b>rider</b> with the lowest total of points.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Riders</b> first {{performed}} on November 11, 1977 at Herr Harry's Franks and Steins in Nashville, TN. For this first performance, <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> consisted of Deputy Doug (Douglas B. Green), Windy Bill Collins, and Fred LaBour. Happy with the crowds reaction, <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> performed for <b>the</b> second time at Herr Harry's the next evening. Between {{the second and}} third performances, the band still didn't have a name, but that changed in December 1977, when Fred LaBour found a copy of The Sons of <b>The</b> Pioneers album: <b>Riders</b> In <b>The</b> Sky. When LaBour saw the album, he immediately called Green and told him that <b>Riders</b> In <b>The</b> Sky should be the band's name. Green agreed and from their third performance on, they were officially billed as <b>Riders</b> In <b>The</b> Sky. In 1978, Bill Collins left <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> shortly after [...] "Tumbleweed Tommy" [...] Goldsmith joined. Shortly after Collins left, [...] "Woody Paul" [...] Chrisman also joined the band. In mid-1979, Tommy Goldsmith left <b>the</b> <b>Riders</b> shortly before <b>the</b> recording of their first album, which would become Three on The Trail, though Goldsmith would perform on the album, but not as a member of <b>the</b> <b>Riders.</b>|$|R
