40|$|The {{problem of}} having {{sufficient}} coverage {{is an essential}} issue in wireless sensor networks (WSN). A high coverage rate delivers a higher quality of service. The aim of coverage strategy {{is to ensure that}} there will be a minimum number of nodes (at least one node) with little redundant data to cover every point inside the interest area. This paper addresses the problems of coverage of WSN by proposing two grid-based algorithms: <b>Grid</b> <b>Square</b> Coverage version (1) and <b>Grid</b> <b>Square</b> Coverage version (2). Moreover, we have analyzed the performance of both algorithms and provided a compression between them. The results present that the <b>Grid</b> <b>Square</b> Coverage (1) algorithms has 78 % coverage efficiency while the <b>Grid</b> <b>Square</b> Coverage (2) has 73 %...|$|R

50|$|The {{complete}} {{grid reference}} includes both the <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> letters and the numerical reference giving the location within the <b>grid</b> <b>square.</b> For instance, wQ 683 825 is a location in South London. Grid references {{can also be}} given in an all numeral notation. To do this, square vV (the South-West corner of the grid out in the Atlantic) is taken as square zero and then the <b>grid</b> <b>squares</b> are counted {{from there to the}} location being referenced. For instance qY 985 613 (somewhere around Carlisle) can also be expressed as 3985 5613. This is because square qY is three 100 km squares East of square vV and five 100 km squares North of vV. However, it is frequently not necessary to explicitly give the <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> at all, this can be implied from context.|$|R

5000|$|The Milton Keynes Development Corporation {{planned the}} major road layout {{according}} to street hierarchy principles, using a grid pattern of approximately 1 km intervals, {{rather than on}} the more conventional [...] pattern found in older settlements. Major internal roads run between communities, rather than through them: these distributor roads are known locally as grid roads and the spaces between them the districts are known as <b>grid</b> <b>squares.</b> Intervals of 1 km were chosen so that people would always be within walking distance of a bus stop. Consequently, each <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> is a semi-autonomous community, making a unique collective of 100 clearly identifiable neighbourhoods within the overall urban environment. The <b>grid</b> <b>squares</b> have a variety of development styles, ranging from conventional urban development and industrial parks to original rural and modern urban and suburban developments. Most <b>grid</b> <b>squares</b> have Local Centres, intended as local retail hubs and most with community facilities as well. Originally intended under the masterplan to sit alongside the Grid Roads, the Local Centres were mostly in fact built embedded in the communities.|$|R
30|$|To {{calculate}} the present CDI nationwide, the third mesh climatic conditions (temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation) from the Japan Meteorological Agency were used [19]. The third mesh {{of the national}} standard grid system (1  km ×  1  km), which was described in “Prediction of CDI at eight sites using three RCP scenarios” section, was used to divide Japan’s area; the area is 377, 900  km 2, so we obtained 378, 030 <b>grid</b> <b>squares.</b> Based on the future climatic conditions predicted with MIROC 5, future temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation of 378, 030 <b>grid</b> <b>squares</b> were spatially interpolated {{in compliance with the}} three RCP scenarios.

30|$|Spatial {{downscaling}} {{can refer}} simply to calibrating the climate forecast in a <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> to an exact location within the square {{by considering the}} climatic difference between the location and the average over the square. A linear calibration might be all {{that is necessary to}} obtain the local forecast. A more complex version of spatial downscaling is required when the climatic difference between the location and the average over the <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> is caused by significant local features such as the terrain or land surface conditions. In this case, a simple calibration may not suffice, because the direction of the climate anomaly in the <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> may not carry over to the exact location of interest. An example would be when a <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> is located mainly over the windward part of an mountain range, but we are interested in forecasting for a town on the inland, or leeward, side of the mountain range—a location whose rainfall anomaly tendency may be in the opposite sense to that of the average over the <b>grid</b> <b>square.</b> Resolving the often opposing anomalies may be done either statistically, as tested in South Africa (Landman et al. 2009), or through use of a regional dynamical model, as was done for semi-arid northeast Brazil in an IRI project in the early 2000 s (Sun et al. 2005), or likewise in recent work focusing both there and in Chile, in the context of water management issues (Robertson et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|Introduction Corral puzzles are {{pencil and}} paper puzzles which {{originated}} in Japan [8]. Each puzzle consists of a <b>grid</b> of <b>squares,</b> some of which contain numbers. The goal {{is to find a}} closed loop containing some of the <b>grid</b> <b>squares</b> so that all the numbers are inside the loop and each number is equal to the number of <b>grid</b> <b>squares</b> visible from it. A <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> is visible from a number if it is horizontally or vertically aligned with it and all the squares between them are inside the loop. An example of a Corral puzzle and its solution are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. A Corral puzzle (left) and its solution (right) To build Corral puzzles that correspond to planar graphs we will need several gadgets that we explain in later sections. We need "wires" capable of transmitting 3 different signals (corresponding to the 3 different colors of vertices), a "fork gadget" that splits a signal (so that all edges incident to a vertex carry the same color signal), a "differ gadget" that forces two...|$|R
