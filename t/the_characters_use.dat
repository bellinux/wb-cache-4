5|$|Combat in {{the game}} is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of {{missions}} beginning after an opening tutorial. The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial combat. In ground combat, the player controls multiple characters, switching between them via the pause menu {{in order to use}} their different weapons. <b>The</b> <b>characters</b> <b>use</b> physical attacks using character weapons for short-range battle, while magical attacks are used for long-range attacks and groups of enemies. The magical attacks vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap.|$|E

500|$|Like {{almost all}} of Andrić's works, the book was {{originally}} written in Serbian Cyrillic. <b>The</b> <b>characters</b> <b>use</b> the Ijekavian dialect of Serbo-Croatian primarily spoken west of the Drina, while the narrator uses the Ekavian dialect spoken primarily in Serbia. This {{is a reflection of}} Andrić's own linguistic proclivities, as he had abandoned both written and spoken Ijekavian and reverted to Ekavian upon moving to Belgrade in the early 1920s. Both dialogue and narration passages are perfused with Turkisms (...) , words of Turkish, Arabic or Persian origin that had found their way into the South Slavic languages under Ottoman rule. Turkisms are so prevalent that even the novel's title contains one: the word ćuprija, derived from the Turkish word köprü, which means bridge. Also present are many words of German and Ladino origin, reflecting the historical and political circumstances of the time period described in the novel.|$|E

500|$|A 2003 {{interview}} in Newsweek quotes Stephenson's belief that [...] "science fiction... is fiction in which ideas {{play an important}} part." [...] Central to Quicksilver [...] {{is the importance of}} the Enlightenment. By placing the reader among a world of ideas that change the course of science, Stephenson explores the development of the scientific method. One theme Stephenson explores in Quicksilver is the advancement of mathematical sciences which in turn led to important applications: Leibniz's theory of binary mathematics became the foundation upon which to develop computers. [...] As he did in Cryptonomicon, Stephenson highlights the importance of networks and codes, which in Quicksilver [...] occur against a [...] "backdrop of staggering diversity and detail", writes Mark Sanderson in his review of the book for the Daily Telegraph. Also, returning to his cyberpunk roots, Stephenson emphasizes the manner in which information and ideas are dispersed in complex societies. Quicksilver uses the [...] "interactions of philosophy, court intrigue, economics, wars, plagues and natural disasters" [...] of the late 17th and early 18th century to create a historical backdrop. From one perspective, the characters are most useful in their roles as [...] "carriers of information". Although <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>use</b> various techniques to disseminate information, the most prominent is cryptography. Elizabeth Weisse writes in USA Today that the use of cryptography is [...] "Stephenson's literary calling card", as she compares Quicksilver to [...] Cryptonomicon.|$|E
