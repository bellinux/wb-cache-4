5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>have</b> {{cracked down on}} Barrett's {{business}} and their own corruption, but not before Barrett has set Geordie up, sending him to prison in retaliation for an affair that Geordie had with Barrett's lover. Nicky's anarchist cell is raided, and he returns to Newcastle. Eventually Geordie returns as well. By 1979, Nicky has returned to more mainstream politics and stands for the Labour Party in the general election, but is defeated by the Conservative Party candidate (Saskia Wickham) after a smear campaign. Geordie leaves shortly before the election, {{not to be seen}} in the series again until 1987.|$|E

25|$|An {{independent}} survey {{taken in}} early November showed 48% of {{people wanted to}} wait and see what evidence <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>had</b> before they made a judgment on the raids, while 36% said they were already satisfied with <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>police</b> reacted and 13% thought <b>the</b> <b>police</b> over-reacted. <b>The</b> statistics were much different among Māori, with 40% of Māori saying <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>had</b> over-reacted. <b>The</b> sample size was 750 people.|$|R

At Phil's house, Marsden knocks on his door and Phil is shocked to see her. Marsden wants to speak to Ben about Lucy's murder, but Phil slams the door in her face and then attempts to delay Marsden so Ben can flee Walford, but Ben is eventually arrested.|$|E

All three shoot; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are wounded.|$|E

Inspector Parot, an officer investigating Edna's disappearance, coerces a young woman named Paulette Mérodon (recently arrested for shoplifting) to help investigate by checking herself into Génessier's clinic. After being declared healthy, Paulette leaves for Paris and is promptly picked up by Louise, who delivers her to Dr. Génessier.

5|$|Niko and Roman are {{immediately}} {{forced to flee}} to Bohan after their apartment and taxi company are destroyed by Dimitri's men in arson attacks. However, things go poorly as well in Bohan: Dimitri's men kidnap Roman in a failed bid to lure out Niko, who rescues Roman. Furthermore, Niko's girlfriend Michelle reveals she is a government agent and entraps Niko into working for her company, known only by its cover: United Liberty Paper. Niko kills several known or suspected terrorists for the agency {{in exchange for the}} file of the numerous crimes <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>have</b> on him and the promise of assistance in finding the traitor of his unit.|$|E
5|$|The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police {{headquarters}} {{is situated in}} the Neoclassical-inspired Politigården building built in 1918–24 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices. In their efforts to deal with drugs, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>have</b> noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms {{does not lead to}} prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>have</b> {{little success}} with street-level arrests or with {{securing}} informants beyond Bubbles, a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes {{the direction of}} electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions. When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, the commanding officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation to wrap up the case. Detective Kima Greggs is seriously hurt in the operation, triggering an overzealous response {{from the rest of}} the department. This causes the detail's targets to suspect that they are under investigation.|$|E

These three men were joined in the room later by the mystery figure who was introduced as Vladislav, a man who could help Litvinenko win a lucrative contract with a Moscow-based private security firm.|$|E
5|$|Previously {{the police}} used a {{decentralized}} {{information technology system}} developed during the mid-1990s. As late as 2012 servers were still being run with Windows NT 4.0 from 1996 and log-on times were typically twenty minutes. The new IT-system D#2 was introduced in 2011 and will have been taken into use by all divisions by 2012. D#2 will be operated by ErgoGroup and will have two redundant server centers. Personnel {{have access to the}} system via thin clients. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>have</b> a system to raise a national alarm to close border crossings and call in reserve personnel. The one time it was activated the message was not received by any of the intended recipients. Since 2009 it has been possible to report criminal damage and theft of wallets, bicycles and mobile telephones without a known perpetrator(s) online.|$|E
5|$|The Police Directorate {{sees the}} use of the {{encrypted}} communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being evaluated, and that there is no alternative to implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010. In Oslo, the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>have</b> appointed press officers who will inform the press about newsworthy incidents. The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.|$|E
