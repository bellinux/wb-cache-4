5|$|The {{site of the}} Abbey was {{effectively}} {{an island in the}} marshy and frequently flooded Somerset Levels. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> to have been a religious building erected on the site as early as 693, with a charter being granted by Cynewulf in 762, although the Benedictine monks were not established there until the 10th century. Viking raids in the area damaged some of the fabric of the abbey and necessitated rebuilding. The refounders of the Abbey are not completely clear; however in a document of 1535 (drawn up following the Valor Ecclesiasticus), Centwine, Ine, Æthelstan and Æthelred are claimed as founders. Tradition suggests that Æthelstan's contribution was penance for the murder of Atheling Edwin in 933 or following victory at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937. The charter of King Ine is known to be a forgery, however it may have some basis in fact. The charters were placed in the Museum of Somerset in 1946 on permanent loan from Lady Ailesbury.|$|E
5|$|There is {{only one}} extant {{manuscript}} of Candide that was written before the work's 1759 publication; it was discovered in 1956 by Wade and since named the La Vallière Manuscript. It {{is believed to have}} been sent, chapter by chapter, by Voltaire to the Duke and Duchess La Vallière in the autumn of 1758. The manuscript was sold to the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in the late eighteenth century, where it remained undiscovered for almost two hundred years. The La Vallière Manuscript, the most original and authentic of all surviving copies of Candide, was probably dictated by Voltaire to his secretary, Jean-Louis Wagnière, then edited directly. In addition to this manuscript, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> to have been another, one copied by Wagnière for the Elector Charles-Théodore, who hosted Voltaire during the summer of 1758. The existence of this copy was first postulated by Norman L. Torrey in 1929. If it exists, it remains undiscovered.|$|E

2500|$|The rupture from Los Zetas left Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez and Antonio Ezekiel Cárdenas Guillén in {{full control}} of the Gulf Cartel. However, Ezekiel died in a {{shooting}} with the Mexican Marines in Matamoros, Tamaulipas in 2010, and Costilla Sanchez became the sole head of the cartel until his arrest in September 2012. Mario Cárdenas Guillén, brother of both Osiel and Ezekiel, {{became one of the}} top lieutenants in the organization after his release from prison in 2007. In addition, within the Gulf Cartel <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> to be two groups—the Rojos and the Metros. The modus operandi ("mode of operation") of the Gulf Cartel changes whenever the United States attempts to strengthen their domestic policy in reinforcing the borders. When drug trafficking tightens, they usually invest in more sophisticated methods to smuggle drugs, recruit new members, corrupt more officials, seek new ways to remove obstacles that impede the immediate success of the organization, along with many others.

2500|$|There are no {{permanent}} traveller sites in East or West Molesey, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> to {{be a significant}} settled traveller population in the Field Common area to the south of Molesey Heath and in adjacent Hersham, which featured in the TV series [...] "My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding". Elmbridge borough as a whole has also had the equal largest number of illegal traveller sites in Surrey in recent years and the former leader of Elmbridge Council referred to this being a particular problem in Molesey in extensive press coverage of the issue which has been ongoing and contentious in recent times. In 2013 nearly 80 people signed a petition to Elmbridge Council concerning an illegal traveller camp on land adjacent to Molesham Way and eventually the site was cleared and barriers erected. However, within a few months travellers returned to the adjacent car park and the cycle repeated leading to speculation that the group had contacts in that vicinity also. In 2015 the Traveller Movement, a traveller charity, complained about Elmbridge Council to the Equality and Human Rights Commission. As of 24th July 2017 The Surrey Advertiser's online outlet 'Get Surrey' reported there were three illegal traveller sites at that time in Elmbridge in Cobham, Esher and Weybridge with some 60 travellers estimated at the Cobham site. At the end of August 2017 another group moved onto West Molesey Recreation Ground, Walton Road, West Molesey close to the earlier incursions off Molesham Way, staying around a week.|$|E
