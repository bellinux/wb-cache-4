5|$|The {{other story}} about the balance between THSR {{construction}} and the environment is the protection plan of “300-year-old camphor <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> temple”(保護金山面老樹及伯公廟) in the Hsinchu City for more than 10 years. The <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> temple are located on the main route of the THSR, {{and both of them}} faced removal because of railway construction. The temple -“Local Land God Temple”(伯公廟) established just beside the old tree is the belief center of the people there. In 1998, THSRC adjusted the line and design to keep the tree and temple in their original place and cooperated with local government and people to protect the old <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> temple until today. Afterwards, together with the local government, the Environment and the Resources Protection Committee, and cultural and historical authorities, THSRC drafted the Hsinchu Old Camphor Tree Medical Plan, which called for the repair of decayed branches as well as measures designed to maintain the long-term growth and the health of the tree.|$|E
5|$|A {{month before}} Christmas the Main Square in Bratislava is {{illuminated}} by a Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Christmas market stalls are officially opened. The Bratislava Christmas Market produces a distinctive atmosphere and attracts {{thousands of people}} every day, who come to meet their friends and chat over some mulled wine and traditional specialties. Around 100 booths are opened every year. It is opened {{most of the day}} {{as well as in the}} evening hours.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the frequency of collisions with <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distance from the trees to the road is studied with a regression analysis. From the results is clearly shown that the frequency decreases by the increase of the distance. There is no certain distance at which the frequency decreases drastically. The {{relationship between}} the severity of collisions with <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distance of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road is studied with log linear models <b>and</b> with <b>the</b> computer program Weighted Poisson Models, which {{was developed by the}} SWOV...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to clear the {{relation}} between street <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> buildings with <b>the</b> fluctuation theory <b>and</b> disorder, regularity, <b>and</b> attraction of <b>the</b> street space. We made the experiments, using the visual simulator which enable us to observe scale models from eye level. As a result, we cleared the influence of street <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> buildings planed by the fluctuation upon disorder, regularity, and attraction. And disorder, regularity, and attraction could be estimated by the change of <b>the</b> street <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> buildings...|$|R
5|$|Like other {{nuthatch}}es, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on {{trunks and}} branches {{and is able}} to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do acorns and hickory nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in a <b>tree,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.|$|E
5|$|Link is rescued at Windfall Island by {{a talking}} boat, the King of Red Lions, who {{explains}} that the bird's master is a returned Ganon. To defeat him, Link must find the Hero of Time's power, which requires the three Pearls of the Goddesses. Link finds Din's Pearl on Dragon Roost Island, home of the avian Rito and the dragon Valoo; Farore's Pearl in Forest Haven, home of the Great Deku <b>Tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> plant-like Koroks; and Nayru's Pearl with the water spirit Jabun on Outset Island. The King of Red Lions then takes Link to the Tower of the Gods, where he faces trials before descending beneath the ocean to a castle suspended in time. Here Link finds the Hero of Time's weapon, the Master Sword.|$|E

The alien spaceship arrives and Ike jumps to safety. In the meantime, the visitors communicate with the cows in the area, having {{found them to be}} the most intelligent species on the planet. Cartman is again abducted by the aliens and returns to the bus stop the following day with pinkeye.|$|E

5|$|The club's {{original}} crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest {{topped by}} the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, {{and surrounded by}} two branches, one of a laurel <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other a palm. In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, {{who at the time}} played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.|$|E
5|$|When the Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} {{and the larger}} house sparrow occur in the same area, the house sparrow {{generally}} breeds in urban areas while the smaller Eurasian tree sparrow nests in the countryside. Where trees are in short supply, as in Mongolia, both species may utilise man-made structures as nest sites. The Eurasian tree sparrow is rural in Europe, but is an urban bird in eastern Asia; in southern and central Asia, both Passer species may be found around towns and villages. In parts of the Mediterranean, such as Italy, both the <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Italian or Spanish sparrows {{may be found in}} settlements. In Australia, the Eurasian tree sparrow is largely an urban bird, and it is the house sparrow which utilises more natural habitats.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 3, King Völsung {{is holding}} a {{marriage}} feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung's hall. At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running {{the length of the}} hall, while {{in the middle of the}} hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it into the trunk of the <b>tree,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Realizing he is {{powerless}} to defeat Julius, the Hero learns from Cibba about a powerful sword called Excalibur. Cibba helps him find the Excalibur {{only to find}} a rusty Sword instead. He explains that the rusty sword is the Excalibur and would reveal its true strength to whoever it finds worthy. The Hero then raises Dime Tower to reach the Mana Sanctuary and meets a robot known as Marcie. After reaching the top, the tower begins to collapse and Marcie sacrifices himself by throwing the Hero across. After obtaining and passing the sword's trials, the Hero confronts and defeats Julius {{at the cost of}} the Mana Tree's life. The Heroine's mother reveals she is the current Mana Tree and before dying, asks the Heroine to succeed her position. The Heroine agrees and bids farewell to the Hero as she becomes the next Mana <b>Tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hero her guardian.|$|E
5|$|The number 1 (expressed as a {{fraction}} 1/1) is {{placed at the}} root of the <b>tree,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> location of any other number a/b can be found by computing gcd(a,b) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether a/b is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number a/b. This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.|$|E
