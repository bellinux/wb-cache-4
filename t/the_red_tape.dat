His first infomercial was aired on October 6, and viewed by 16.5 million people.

40|$|This article adopts an {{organizational}} echelon approach to <b>the</b> study of <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> in public organizations {{and argues that}} {{the nature and extent}} of <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> will vary at different levels of the organizational hierarchy. These propositions are tested with a multiple-informant survey using a lagged model. The empirical results across the three organizational echelons sampled indicate modest variations in the levels of perceived <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> and major variations in its determinants. Results from the more senior managers uphold prior research findings and hypotheses on <b>the</b> determinants of <b>red</b> <b>tape.</b> This is not surprising because earlier studies typically sampled senior executives. Yet the lower down the organizational hierarchy one travels, <b>the</b> more <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> officials perceive and the more multifaceted the findings on determinants become.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{emergence}} and interaction of <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> and corruption in a principal-bureaucrat-agent hierarchy. The principal {{is to provide}} the agent with a unit of a good that involves externalities so that market mechanisms fail to achieve first best. Red tape partially solves the problem. While imposing a cost on <b>the</b> agent, <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> also produces information about the agent’s type. Therefore the socially optimal level of <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> is not trivial. It is hard, however, to implement the social optimum if the bureaucrat in charge of <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> is corrupt. We consider two types of corruption. First, the bureaucrat may extort bribes from the agent in exchange for reducing <b>the</b> amount of <b>red</b> <b>tape.</b> Second, <b>the</b> bureaucrat may take bribes to conceal the information produced through <b>red</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> former kind of corruption tends to reduce <b>red</b> <b>tape,</b> while <b>the</b> latter provides incentives for excessive <b>red</b> tape: <b>the</b> more <b>red</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>the</b> more likely the bureaucrat can get the bribes ex post.

500|$|Since {{medieval times}} the Exchequer had used tally sticks, pieces of carved, notched wood, {{normally}} willow, {{as part of}} their accounting procedures. [...] The parliamentary historian Caroline Shenton has described the tally sticks as [...] "roughly as long as the span of an index finger and thumb". These sticks were split in two so that the two sides to an agreement had a record of the situation. Once the purpose of each tally had come to an end, they were routinely destroyed. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century the usefulness of the tally system had likewise come to an end, and a 1782 Act of Parliament stated that all records should be on paper, not tallies. The Act also abolished sinecure positions in the Exchequer, but a clause in the act ensured it could only take effect once the remaining sinecure-holders had died or retired. The final sinecure-holder died in 1826 and the act came into force, although it took until 1834 for the antiquated procedures to be replaced. The novelist Charles Dickens, in a speech to the Administrative Reform Association, described the retention of the tallies for so long as an [...] "obstinate adherence to an obsolete custom"; he also mocked the bureaucratic steps needed to implement change from wood to paper. He said that [...] "all <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> in the country grew redder at the bare mention of this bold and original conception." [...] By the time the replacement process had finished there were two cart-loads of old tally sticks awaiting disposal.|$|E
500|$|The film's plot survives {{because of}} Universal's {{publication}} of the details in Moving Picture News. The official description is as follows, [...] "Charity, through excessive organization, often defeats its own purpose. William Weldon, a telegraph lineman, {{is the father of}} a large family, and finds it a hard struggle to make ends meet on his small wages. By a fall from a telegraph pole one afternoon he sustains injuries which force a lay-off for several weeks. His family is left destitute and, after a time, seek aid from various charity organizations. In each case the organization promises to make a full investigation and do what they can, but by the time all <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> and rules are complied with, the family would starve. In the meantime, Marx, a gentleman thief who has a secret retreat in the same building in which the Weldon family live, meets the invalid daughter, Alice Weldon. She tells him of the family's condition and Marx endeavors to aid her, although at the time he is out of ready cash himself. Taking desperate measures, he holds up a doctor and forces him to attend to Weldon. Then, in company with the female leader of the gang, he attends the charity ball. There he makes a haul — plucking jewelry and trinkets from every one with whom he comes in contact. He pawns the stolen articles and uses the money to help the Weldons. After the family has recovered, through Marx's aid, the charity organizations finally send a few dollars and a skimpy supply of food. Marx decides to reform — in fact, his reformation has been intended for some time, and his last [...] "job" [...] was only the outcome of his desire to do a worthy charity. He goes to the police, declares himself, and surrenders. Marx is sentenced, and while sitting in his cell a vision of Alice appeared before him, repaying him for his sacrifice and charity." ...|$|E

Laws on taxation, joint ventures, foreign investments, and related areas were promulgated to encourage foreign investment. In 1979 China created four special economic zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou (in Guangdong Province), and Xiamen (in Fujian Province).

The special economic zones essentially were export-processing zones designed to attract foreign investment, expand exports, and import technology and expertise.

I cannot but think that there has been some mismanagement as regards the food question. For example, in Petrograd many workers have allotments and often work in them for eight hours after an eight hours' day in their regular employment. But the food produced in the allotments is taken for general consumption, not left to each individual producer.
