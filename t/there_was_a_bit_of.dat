5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> {{controversy}} surrounding the cover art {{used for this}} album. Sepultura had initially planned on using another Michael Whelan cover art, Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre. Monte Conner of Roadrunner sent the original artwork to Obituary, who used it on their album, Cause of Death. For years after the incident, Igor Cavalera was upset with Monte Conner for giving away their album cover. The artwork for Arise, however, was designed by Michael Whelan exclusively for the album.|$|E
25|$|From 1990 through 1994, NBC only {{televised}} the All Star Game. NBC reportedly {{wanted to}} test the appeal of hockey, having recently lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS. Shortly thereafter however, NBC would gain the broadcast television rights to the National Basketball Association (NBA) from CBS, thus <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a notion that NBC no longer really needed hockey.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, he {{converted}} {{himself into}} an opener. While <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> {{competition for the}} Indian middle order, Pankaj Roy was coming {{to the end of}} his career as an opener. In that position, Jaisimha scored Test hundreds against England in 1961–62 and 1963–64, and 134 against Ceylon in 1964–65. In the 1963–64 series against England he made 444 runs. In 1964–65, he batted in the middle order for Hyderabad and hit 713 runs. But failures in the Test matches led to him being dropped.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{groundbreaking}} for the Glassworks, {{they were}} adding pure art to their line of functional items, {{in addition to}} C. C. van Asch van Wijck, the Glassworks had engaged Lucienne Bloch - later well known for her Murals - [...] who created her glass animals (a lioness, a duck etc.). Her work inspired by earlier Glassworks contributor 's Madonna with Child(1928). [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a buzz in the Dutch art world over creating and in glass and with industrial means.|$|E
2500|$|What has happened? Can a man {{who sets}} records for wicket-taking in his first series be reduced to bowling to a wicketkeeper unaccompanied by slips, gullies or short legs? How can Hogg get no wicket for a hundred-odd in a Test? There is no single answer. But the major factor was the pitch. It got lower, slower and deader as the match progressed... <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> bad luck... Hogg was not slacking. His {{teammates}} will confirm that he has worked harder on this tour than ever before. After the blow-up on the second day, Hogg realised what was at stake. He {{did his best to}} sort out his no-ball problem.|$|E

2500|$|On 31 August 1987 The Stems played {{what turned}} out to be their last gig. In October of that year, a {{proposed}} six-week European tour was cancelled and the group disbanded. McFarlane wrote; [...] "by that time they had developed into one of the best live bands on the Australian scene". In October 2009 Mariani told The Ages Michael Dwyer, [...] "we were on the charts, getting airplay, very popular. But within the band <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> burnout ... you have these moments where you can't stop thinking negatively and I kept picturing myself pushing a van in the snow. I thought, 'I don't want to be doing that. I'm getting out of here'". The Huffington Posts Holly Cara Price described the group as [...] "one of the most tuneful and tasty garage rock bands of the era. Avid fans of pop, R and 60's garage punk, their predilection translated to great punchy songs".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Dravid was {{a picture}} of calm and patience, as he played yet another {{important}} innings to turn around India's fortunes. His 92 however, lacked in the polish that was exhibited in his two knocks in Adelaide, as he played and missed sometimes. But he retained an excellent control over almost all bowlers, and played a lot of dot balls, and put away the bad deliveries for the boundaries, explaining his high boundary rate. Dravid was dismissed by Lee, edging a delivery to Adam Gilchrist behind the stumps. Dravid was dismissed when the score was 253, and was the fifth man out. After his dismissal for a gritty 92, the Indian innings came to an end rather rapidly, as only a further 33 runs were added for the loss of five wickets, including that of Ganguly's who was dismissed for 73. Brad Williams {{turned out to be the}} chief destroyer of the Indian innings with a haul of 4 wickets, and constantly troubled Ganguly. Williams, who was a surprise pick over Andy Bichel, expressed his joy on being able to scalp four against the Indian batting order. He also praised Dravid for his batting. Dravid himself commented that it had been an uphill struggle for most of the day, [...] "It was never comfortable. When me and Sourav were going well, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> hope. But to be honest, we needed something special to happen, an Eden Gardens or an Adelaide. And those things don't happen everyday.". India's spectacular collapse left Australia needing only 95 runs for a victory.|$|E
