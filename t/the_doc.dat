40|$|On many {{varieties}} of English spoken in the United States {{it is possible}} to say something like (1) below: (1) I sent mei a letter to the President. (1) exemplifies the so-called Southern Double Object Construction (Southern DOC), a structure that has received relatively little attention in the literature. This construction has been attested in the Southern United States vernacular varieties of English including Appalachian English. In this paper I provide an overview of the main characteristics of <b>the</b> Southern <b>DOC.</b> More specifically, this paper focuses on the socio-geographical characteristics and the grammatical features of <b>the</b> Southern <b>DOC</b> {{as well as on the}} similarities and differences it has with respect to other constructions found crosslinguistically. First, the analysis shows that <b>the</b> Southern <b>DOC</b> is an optional construction which has some syntactic constraints operating on it and which conveys completive meaning which highlights the involvement of the agent. Secondly, the paper reveals that there are some syntactic and semantic differences between <b>the</b> Southern <b>DOC</b> and some English constructions, such as for-datives, self-reflexives and to-datives. Moreover, a brief comparison is provided between the construction under study and ethical datives of Spanish. Thirdly, I present grammatical representations of both the construction under study and <b>the</b> All American <b>DOC.</b> A comparison of both constructions has allowed me to draw two main conclusions: (i) the All American one is more restrained than <b>the</b> Southern <b>DOC</b> as regards <b>the</b> verb types that it allows, and (ii) <b>the</b> Southern <b>DOC</b> highlights <b>the</b> agent‟s role whereas <b>the</b> All American <b>DOC</b> does not convey emphasis. The paper concludes by arguing that <b>the</b> Southern <b>DOC</b> creates some problems as far as the Binding Theory is concerned. Then, two solutions are proposed. The first suggestion is that the personal dative in <b>the</b> Southern <b>DOC</b> is not a pronoun but an anaphor, thus it does not cause any problem as regards the Binding theory. The second is that <b>the</b> Southern <b>DOC</b> may be working as an idiomatic expression and, therefore, does not cause any problem to the Binding Theory...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Docs</b> is a 200-page graphic novel {{created and}} {{published}} by the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in 2010 and follows four corpsmen and their experiences during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The materials and content for <b>The</b> <b>Docs</b> comic is founded upon the experiences of former lieutenant commander Kraft, a Navy psychologist in Fallujah and her interactions with her patients, when she was deployed in 2004. <b>The</b> <b>Docs</b> was conceived to assist Navy Corpsmen in their deployment and the graphic violence they will witness, “A communication tool to help Navy Corpsmen with the stresses of combat deployments.” [...] The reasoning for targeting Navy corpsmen {{is because of the}} dual role that they deal with in being medics but also at times being combatants.
