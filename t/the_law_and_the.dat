5|$|Durkheim saw the {{population}} density and growth as key {{factors in the}} evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As the number of people in a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to this and the report of a committee investigating {{the slow pace of}} the Court of Chancery, the Judicature Commission was formed in 1867, and given a wide remit to investigate reform of the courts, <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> legal profession. Five reports were issued, from 25 March 1869 to 10 July 1874, with the first (dealing with the formation of a single Supreme Court of Judicature) considered the most influential. The report disposed of the previous idea of merging the common law and equity, and instead suggested a single Supreme Court capable of using both. In 1870 the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherly, attempted to bring the recommendations into law through an Act of Parliament, but did not go to the trouble of consulting the judiciary or the leader of the Conservatives, who controlled the House of Lords. The bill ran into strong opposition from lawyers and judges, particularly Alexander Cockburn. After Hatherly was replaced by Lord Selborne in September 1872, a second bill was introduced after consultation with the judiciary; although along the same lines, it was far more detailed.|$|E

5|$|On 4 January 2011, at Kohsar Market of Islamabad, the {{governor}} of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, was assassinated by Malik Mumtaz Hussein Qadri, a 26-year-old member of his security team, because of his defence of Noreen and opposition to the blasphemy law. (Mumtaz Qadri {{was sentenced to death}} for the assassination and hanged on 29 February 2016.) Taseer was outspoken in his criticism of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> verdict in Noreen's case. The next day, thousands turned up for {{the governor}}'s funeral in Lahore in spite of warnings by the Taliban and some clerics, while a portion of the Pakistani population also praised Qadri as a hero; thousands of Sunni Muslims rallied in support of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan after the murder, and 500 Barelvi clerics prohibited their followers from sending condolences to the family of Taseer. This resulted in concerns that the public was becoming tolerant of extremists.|$|E

5|$|On March 3, 1873, President Grant {{signed a}} law that {{authorized}} the President's salary to be increased from $25,000 a year to $50,000 a year and Congressmen's salaries to be increased by $2,500. Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill. Reforming newspapers quickly exposed <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bonus was repealed in January 1874. Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill {{and to make a}} strong statement for good government.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the homage {{of his or her}} subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as queen consort. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, before attending a banquet there.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E

5|$|While in government, Disraeli {{presided over}} a series of social reforms which {{supported}} his one-nation politics and aimed to create a benevolent hierarchy. He appointed a Royal Commission to assess the state of law between employers and employees, the result of which prompted Richard Cross to pass the Employers and Workmen Act of 1875. This act made both sides of industry equal before <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> breach of contract a civil offence, rather than criminal. Cross also passed the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act {{in the same year}} which enshrined the right to strike of workers by ensuring that acts carried out by a workers' group could not be indicted as conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the law}} on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E
5|$|Balthier is Archadian {{by birth}} (as {{evidenced}} by his English accent, {{which is used}} by Archadian characters in the game), and eventually reveals he is , the son of Imperial magicite researcher Dr. Cid (Cidolfus Demen Bunansa). Balthier received many privileges as Cid's son, including being made an Imperial Judge, but eventually cut ties with his father when Cid became consumed by his experimentation with nethicite. He left {{the service of the}} empire, stole an Archadian airship, and took a new name. Balthier is now a renowned career criminal with a sizable bounty on his head, and must be careful to avoid the attention of both <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bounty hunters seeking the reward for his capture. He originally joins the resistance in the hope of reacquiring the Dusk Shard, but when he learns it is actually a piece of nethicite, he sees too much of his father's obsession in his own quest and decides to abandon the search. After the party defeats Dr. Cid at the Pharos, Balthier makes peace with his father and helps the group to destroy the Sky Fortress Bahamut as penance for Cid's deeds.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} period {{the kings of}} the Scots {{depended}} on the great lords of the mormaers (later earls) and Toísechs (later thanes), but from the reign of David I sheriffdoms were introduced, which allowed more direct control and gradually limited {{the power of the}} major lordships. While knowledge of early systems of law is limited, justice can be seen as developing from the twelfth century onwards with local sheriff, burgh, manorial and ecclesiastical courts and offices of the justicar to oversee administration. The Scots common law began to develop in this period and there were attempts to systematise and codify <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beginnings of an educated professional body of lawyers. In the Late Middle Ages major institutions of government, including the privy council and parliament developed. The council emerged as a full-time body in the fifteenth century, increasingly dominated by laymen and critical to the administration of justice. Parliament also emerged as a major legal institution, gaining an oversight of taxation and policy. By the end of the era it was sitting almost every year, partly because of the frequent minorities and regencies of the period, which may have prevented it from being sidelined by the monarchy.|$|E
