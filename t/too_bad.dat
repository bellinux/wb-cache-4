5|$|The Pigsty, a small gardeners shed {{located on}} The Orchard, has been {{preserved}} {{as the first}} campsite at Gilwell Park. The first group of Rover Scouts who arrived to prepare the site when it was purchased in 1919 slept here when the weather proved <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> to pitch their tents.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Oslo Sporveier {{decided to}} {{transfer}} all the remaining trams to Bærumsbanen. Their high speed made them well suited on the light rail, but the centre door reduced their capacity. The order of the SM53-series from Høka gave Oslo Sporveier sufficient stock to operate the street lines, and from 1952 to 1957, the company transferred the 19 trams to Bærumsbanen. Here, they were given the designation Class E. No. 163 was in <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> condition to be used on the line, and was retired. In October 1949, no. 184 caught fire and was taken out of service. On 2 August 1958, five people perished and 17 were injured in the Strømsveien tram fire, the worst disaster in the tramway's history.|$|E
60|$|My {{official}} {{friend was}} beginning 'the {{best of all}} possible--' when an inconvenient medical forefinger pointed out another passage in the evidence, from which {{it appeared that the}} lime-juice had been <b>bad</b> <b>too.</b> Not to mention that the vinegar had been <b>bad</b> <b>too,</b> the vegetables <b>bad</b> <b>too,</b> the cooking accommodation insufficient (if there had been anything worth mentioning to cook), the water supply exceedingly inadequate, and the beer sour.|$|R

5|$|Shaw {{was knocked}} {{unconscious}} and swept downstream. A third {{member of the}} group raised the alarm by mobile telephone by 14:05 (GMT), less than five minutes after Shaw had been swept away, and Devon and Cornwall Police, a Royal Navy helicopter and the Dartmoor Rescue Group were mobilised to search for Shaw. Believing that the weather conditions may be <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> for the helicopter to fly, members of the Dartmoor Rescue Group—a volunteer organisation which co-ordinates the four separate charities who undertake search and rescue operations on Dartmoor—set out on foot in an attempt to reach the scene of the accident.|$|E
25|$|It's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> {{that they}} are trying to buy America. And it's time that the American people spoke out against this terrible {{dishonesty}} of these two brothers, who are about as un-American as anyone that I can imagine.|$|E
25|$|Once Elephant Point was secured, minesweepers {{cleared a}} passage up the river, and landing craft began coming ashore {{in the early}} hours of the morning of 2 May, almost the last day on which beach {{landings}} were possible before the heavy swell caused by the monsoon became <b>too</b> <b>bad.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bisping was {{expected}} to face Mark Muñoz on 26 October 2013 at UFC Fight Night 30. However, after symptoms of his detached retina became <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> he decided to undergo surgery, which included full removal of the eyeball. He {{pulled out of the}} bout on 27 September and was replaced by Lyoto Machida.|$|E
25|$|Coast Aero Center {{was awarded}} the {{concession}} on 20 June 1986 for flying from Stavanger to Geilo Airport, Dagali until 1991. It was flown using a Beechcraft Super King 200. The ridership from Geilo {{turned out to be}} <b>too</b> <b>bad,</b> and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. Widerøe and Norsk Air said there was not enough ridership for them to be interested. The airline had a revenue of NOK 14 million and had 24 employees in 1986. That year, they chose to connect to the PNR/Smart booking system. The company bid for operating parts of the Norwegian Air Ambulance in 1987, but failed.|$|E

25|$|Watson {{then spent}} {{a very brief}} period selling sewing {{machines}} for Wheeler and Wilcox. According to Tom Watson, Jr., in his autobiography: One day my dad went into a roadside saloon to celebrate a sale and {{had too much to}} drink. When the bar closed, he found that his entire rig—horse, buggy, and samples—had been stolen. Wheeler and Wilcox fired him and dunned him for the lost property. Word got around, of course, and it took Dad more than a year to find another steady job. Watson would later enforce strict rules at IBM against alcohol consumption, even off the job. According to Tom Jr.: This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is <b>too</b> <b>bad,</b> because it would have helped explain Father to {{the tens of thousands of}} people who had to follow his rules.|$|E
25|$|He {{believed}} that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether {{within the same}} corporation or in others. Ford also {{believed that}} union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis {{as a way to}} maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.|$|E
25|$|Few {{industrialists}} {{were prepared}} for the Wall Street Crash of October 1929. Though Studebaker's production and sales had been booming, the market collapsed and plans were laid for a new, small, low-cost car—the Rockne. However, times were <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> to sell even inexpensive cars. Within a year, the firm was cutting wages and laying off workers. Erskine maintained faith in the Rockne and rashly had the directors declare huge dividends in 1930 and 1931. He also acquired 95% of the White Motor Company's stock at an inflated price and in cash. By 1933, the banks were owed $6 million, though current assets exceeded that figure. On March 18, 1933, Studebaker entered receivership. Erskine was pushed out of the presidency {{in favor of more}} cost-conscious managers. Albert R. Erskine committed suicide on July 1, 1933, leaving it to successors Harold Vance and Paul Hoffman to deal with the problems.|$|E

500|$|In Guide for the Film Fanatic, Danny Peary {{wrote that}} Goldfinger is [...] "the {{best of the}} James Bond films {{starring}} Sean Connery...There's lots of humor, gimmicks, excitement, an amusing yet tense golf contest between Bond and Goldfinger, thrilling fights to the death between Bond and Oddjob and Bond and Goldfinger, and a fascinating central crime... Most enjoyable, but <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> Eaton's part isn't longer and that Fröbe's Goldfinger, a heavy but nimble intellectual in the Sydney Greenstreet tradition, never appeared in another Bond film." ...|$|E

500|$|Economics is {{no longer}} a fit {{conversation}} piece for ladies and gentlemen. It has become a technical subject. Like any technical subject it attracts some people who are more interested in the technique than the subject. That is <b>too</b> <b>bad,</b> but it may be inevitable. In any case, do not kid yourself: the technical core of economics is indispensable infrastructure for the political economy. That is why, if you consult [...] looking for enlightenment about the world today, you will be led to technical economics, or history, or nothing at all.|$|E
500|$|Orbison later {{claimed that}} the origin for [...] "In Dreams" [...] came to {{him while he was}} sleeping, as many of his songs did. He often heard music while asleep with a radio disc jockey announcing that it was Elvis Presley's new song. For this song, however, he was half awake when he {{imagined}} it, and thought, [...] "Boy that's good. I need to finish that. <b>Too</b> <b>bad</b> things don't happen in my dreams." [...] When he woke up the next morning, the entire composition was written in 20 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Upon retirement, Barkley {{was later}} quoted as stating, {{in regard to}} his career, [...] "I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing—the {{spitting}} incident.
