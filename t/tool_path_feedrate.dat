The process is optimized by varying the feed as the tool-workpiece engagements. The linear and angular feedrates are optimized by sequential quadratic programming. Sharp feedrate changes may result in undesired feed-marks on the finished surface. The adopted step is to update the the original CL file with optimized and filtered feedrate commands. The five-axis milling process is simulated in a virtual enviroment, and the resulting feedrate outputs are stored at each position along the <b>tool</b> <b>path.</b> The new <b>feedrate</b> profiles are shown to considerably reduce the machining time while avoiding process faults...|$|R
40|$|As {{high-speed}} machining and unmanned machining become common, {{the demand for}} cutting-load regularization increases, so NC machining can be more ef®cient. To be presented is a simple cutting-load regularization method for pocket machining. As the conventional off-line approaches where cutting-load is predicted and cutting parameters are adjusted before actual cutting, the proposed method requires a cutting force model, which is quite simpli®ed with the function of two independent variables. One is the geometric measure so called 2 D chip-load (cutter-engagement angle or effective cutting depth), {{and the other is}} the feedrate. Based on the 2 D chip-load analysis for the concave line±line segment of the NC <b>tool</b> <b>path,</b> the adjusted <b>feedrate</b> is calculated by using the simpli®ed-cutting force model (SCFM) obtained by the cutting experiment with a tool dynamometer. The concept of the automatic feedrate adjustment (AFA) method to be proposed is very simple, and the implementation requires little effort. Furthermore, the proposed method does not need much calculation time because there are no complex calculations or cutting simulation...|$|R
40|$|Equipment {{industry}} {{is the most}} fundamental industry of any modern society. Modern equipment is characterized by its high automation, efficiency, reliability, flexibility, high precision, energy conservation and environmental protection. This research is motivated by plethora of industry demand of high performance machines. The performance of a machine is determined by its mechanics and the motion control system. There are three types of motion in general. One is synchronization motion where the reference motion command is determined by feedback measurements. The second type of motion is point-to-point motion where the reference motion command contains only a sequence of target positions. The third type of motion is called path following motion where the <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> is composed of geometric curves. Although the types of reference command are different, all motion control systems consist of two main building blocks: reference motion command generation and servo control system. This dissertation focus on the first building block. The traditional path following motion control system only accepts lines, circular arcs and other conic <b>tool</b> <b>paths.</b> The <b>feedrate</b> and system accuracy is low because of nonsmoothness of the <b>tool</b> <b>path.</b> If the system can handle free form paths, especially parametric curves, then the accuracy and {{the speed of the}} motion control system can be improved. Although path interpolation is a classical problem in computer numerical controlled system (CNC), a clear formula in the literature is still missing. Given the geometric <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> and the <b>feedrate</b> along the <b>tool</b> <b>paths,</b> the task of path interpolation is to generate reference motion command satisfying all geometric, kinematic and dynamic requirements. In this dissertation, path interpolation problem for generic parametric <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> is formulated clearly in a mathematical way. By examining various parametrization, the problem becomes an initial value problem for the ordinary differential equation system. From this formula, traditional interpolation algorithms, like digital differential analyzer (DDA) and digital increment algorithm, can be easily derived. Numerical algorithms such as the truncated Taylor expansion algorithm, the Runge-Kutta algorithm and the predictor-corrector algorithm can be utilized. By using criteria such as reliability, accuracy and complexity, all those algorithms are analyzed. The comparison comes from three perspectives - theoretical analysis on numerical computation, simulation and experiments. The relations between interpolation accuracy, interpolation cycling time, feedrate and the curvature of <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> are also investigated. Although the truncated Taylor expansion algorithms and the predictor-corrector algorithms are widely discussed in the literature, the Runge-Kutta algorithms are recommended by theoretical analysis and experiments. The Runge-Kutta algorithm of order 4 is highly recommended if the computation resource is available. To generate the reference motion command, the feedrate must be designed properly. For example, the integration of the feedrate should be equal to the total arc length of the <b>tool</b> <b>path,</b> and the <b>feedrate</b> should be continuous. The accuracy requirements impose some constraints on the upper bound of the feedrate. For example, the chord error tolerance in the path following motion control system limits the <b>feedrate</b> in <b>path</b> interpolation algorithm. Besides geometric errors, the kinematic limitations of mechatronic system also need to be considered. For example, the velocity and acceleration of each servo axis are bound from above, which gives an upper bound on the feedrate. The dynamic performance of the mechatronic system also has limitations. For example, there are interpolation and integral conditions on closed loop system. To guarantee the tracking accuracy, the reference motion command should contain no signals with harmonic components at high frequencies. Considering all those constraints, feedrate scheduling problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained feasibility or an optimization problem. From signal processing theory, the feedrate can be reshaped by using FIR lowpass filters. FIR lowpass window filters, such as the rectangular window filter, cascaded window filter, Gaussian window filter and squared sine window filter, are analyzed and compared from both theoretical analysis and experimental results. The results coincide with the industrial practice, but frequency domain requirements should be taken care of. In the path following motion control system, the geometric error, which measures the quality of machining product, is contouring error. However, the dynamic mismatch of the coordinated servo axes will degrade the contouring accuracy. For the mechatronic system, the main objectives are to robustly stabilize the dynamic system, to reject the disturbances (noises) and to minimize the tracking error. The internal stability requirement imposes interpolation and integral conditions on tracking error dynamics. The trade-off has to be made which gives an upper bound on tracking accuracy. However, the tracking error is the upper bound of the contouring error. Based on the principle of uncertainty, more preference can be given to contouring error dynamics for an optimized tracking error dynamics. But the contouring error is hard to be computed in real time for generic toll paths. In this dissertation, a projection operator is defined to approximate the contouring error, and a novel contouring error compensation structure is proposed. Based on the small gain theorem and the properties of the projection operator, a sufficient condition for internally stabilizing the feedback system is obtained. In this structure, more preference is given to contouring error dynamics by using multiple loop structure. Fixed order contouring error compensators are designed, and the feasibility of the contouring error compensators are verified by experiments. The experiments show that the contouring error can be reduced by more than 20 %...|$|R

This results in the requirement of tool stoppage or slowdown during a micro-end-milling operation, a deterrent to productivity and to part acceptability. A circular <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> geometry can avoid discontinuities in the tool movements leading to a more consistent and smooth material removal.

In this paper, a high-efficiency 2. 5 -dimensional rough milling strategy for mould core machining is presented. The strategy consists of three different <b>tool</b> <b>paths.</b> The first <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> is generated {{on the basis of the}} convex hull boundary of a machining region. Owing to the absence of concave <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> segments, the convex hull based <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> can eliminate the chip load fluctuation problem encountered in corner cutting. The second <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> is an enhanced unidirectional straight-line <b>tool</b> <b>path,</b> which has the virtue of maintaining a steady cutting resistance throughout.

This high dimensional geometrical optimizing problem requires technical knowledge and user experience. In this paper, first approaches using evolutionary algorithms for automating <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation and optimizing given <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> are shown. The proposed method combines evolutionary algorithms and a newly developed efficient multi-axis milling simulation. The evolutionary algorithm uses multiple criteria for the optimization of a <b>tool</b> <b>path.</b> The approach uses multiobjective algorithms because minimal or no movement of a machine axis can lead to high cutting forces or collisions.

40|$|Although &# 64258;at-end {{multi-axis}} milling {{has been}} proven to be more efficient than ball-end machining {{for more than twenty}} years, dedicated <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation and planning algorithms have been seriously suffering from insufficient intelligence because they originate from ball-end algorithms and do not consider issues attributed to the &# 64258;at-end shape of tools. This research work describes {{the development and implementation of}} new algorithms designed for <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> planning and generation aiming taking machine kinematics into account. The developed components are founded on prototype software that can handle STL geometry for robust computation of <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> tracks and interference-free tool postures. This STL kernel was also extended with support of facet machining status to enable machining simulation. In addition to the kernel, three different components were developed to facilitate optimization of tool inclination, material removal simulation, and <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> planning. First, two <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> optimization methods were elaborated to perform minimization of machine tool rotations in reasonable computation time. Second, a novel material removal simulation based on accurate estimation of swept sections has been introduced. Third, <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> planning algorithms integrating the developed material removal simulation allow efficient <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation with reduced machining strip overlaps and dynamic step-over between adjacent <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> tracks. This integration has also given an opportunity to introduce two strategies. First strategy implements the cutting plane approach to slice STL surfaces and generate zig-zag-like <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> with intelligent selection of <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> tracks directions. Second strategy generates contour-like <b>tool</b> <b>paths,</b> going inwards from a workpiece outside, resulting in machined surfaces with predictable scallop height. This research highlighted and resolved several &# 64258;aws in existing algorithms. First, estimations of machining strip widths derived from a single posture are almost surely incorrect in a case of &# 64257;ve-axis machining. Therefore, a new approach taking several postures into account has been developed and implemented. Second, regardless of the dramatic in&# 64258;uence of machine tool kinematics and CNC behavior onto the actual shape of a machined surface, machine tool characteristics are not considered by the existing material removal simulation algorithms. Thus, in this research, tool motion has been interpolated in machine coordinates. The developed methods can be smoothly integrated with themselves and other CAM software. Eventually, these methods are believed to assist CAM programmers in generating efficient <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> in an automated manner. nrpages: 158 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} efficiency has been significantly improved {{over the years}} due to the rapid advancement in CAD and CAM. Very often, however, the production cycle is still unacceptably long. This has been frequently caused by the bottleneck link between CAD and CAM. The CAD design model cannot be directly machined by a CNC machine without an NC program, an NC program cannot be coded without a clearly defined <b>tool</b> <b>path,</b> and the CAD data are not readily useable for preparing <b>tool</b> <b>path.</b> A large amount of time is often spent on data exchange, NC <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation, and NC program preparation. To further reduce the production cycle, the CAD model has to be documented in a neutral format such {{that it can be}} readily used in CAM and the <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> should be automatically generated from the CAD model in a neutral format. The recently developed STEP data exchange standard provides such a neutral format that is independent of any software and hardware. However, none of the existing <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation systems is based on STEP. In view of the above facts, a STEP based <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation system is developed for rough machining of planar surfaces. This system comprises four modules. The first one is the data extraction module used to obtain geometric data from STEP. The second module is the slicing module which is designed to convert the three dimensional <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation problem into a series of two dimensional problems. The <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> will be generated by the third module. The <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> is then translated into NC program by an NC code generator [...] the last module. The proposed system has been implemented in a UNIGRAPHICS CAD/CAM environment. The application of the system is illustrated using an example part...|$|R
50|$|Freeform {{surface or}} complex {{surfaces}} are widely manufactured nowadays. The industries which most often manufactures free-form surfaces are basically aerospace, automotive, die mold industries, bio medical and power sector for turbine blades manufacturing. Generally 3 or 5 axis CNC milling machine {{is used for}} this purpose. The manufacturing process of free form surface {{is not an easy}} job as the <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation in present CAM technology is generally based on geometric computation so <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> are not optimum. The geometry can also be not described explicitly so errors and discontinuities occurrence in the solid structure cannot be avoided. Free-form surfaces are machined with the help of different <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation method like adaptive iso-planar <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation, constant scallop <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation, adaptive iso-parametric method, iso-curvature, isophote and by other methods. The different methods are chosen based on the parameters which is needed to be optimized.|$|R
