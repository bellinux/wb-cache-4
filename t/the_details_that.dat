25|$|Dumas Malone {{documented}} Jefferson's {{activities and}} residencies through the years. His documentation in his multi-volume biography (published 1948–1981) provided <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>that</b> Pearl Graham analyzed to show Jefferson was at Monticello for {{the conception of}} each of Hemings' children. She never conceived {{when he was not}} there. Martha Randolph, Jefferson's daughter with Martha Wayles Jefferson, had made a deathbed claim that Jefferson was away for a 15-month period during which one of the Hemings children was conceived. Gordon-Reed shows this claim is not supported by Malone's documentation; Jefferson was at Monticello at the time of conception of each child.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March, Queensland Police {{contacted}} the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) {{and gave it}} <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>that</b> Rau had provided. DIMIA said {{that it had no}} records of the arrival of any person called Anna Brotmeyer. The police returned to the Exchange Hotel, but Rau had left, and they later found her about fifteen kilometres north of the town, where they ordered her back to the Coen police station. There she gave several different stories about how and when she entered the country, none of them consistent. The police again contacted DIMIA, which advised them to detain Rau as a suspected unlawful non-citizen under the provisions of the Migration Act 1958. Rau was searched, and had a Norwegian passport, a book with two names (both different from Anna and Cornelia) on it, and A$2,413 in her possession. Later that day she was driven from Coen to Cairns.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, Sergei Khrushchev {{wrote about}} the {{experience}} of his father, Nikita Khrushchev, in the incident. He described how Mentyukov attempted to intercept the U-2, but failed to gain visual contact. Major Mikhail Voronov, in control of a battery of anti-aircraft missiles, fired three SA-2s at the radar contact but only one ignited. It quickly rose toward the target and exploded in the air behind the U-2 but near enough to violently shake the aircraft, tearing off its long wings. At a lower altitude, Powers {{climbed out of the}} falling fuselage and parachuted to the ground. Uncertainty about the initial shootdown success resulted in 13 further anti-aircraft missiles being fired by neighboring batteries, but the later missiles only hit a pursuing MiG-19 piloted by Sr. Lt. Sergei Safronov, mortally wounding him. This account of the events that occurred during the mission match <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>that</b> were given to the CIA by Gary Powers. According to Powers, a missile exploded behind him and after this occurred his U-2 began to nosedive. It is at this point that Powers began to make all of the preparations to eject. Powers landed safely and tried to hide himself in the Russian countryside until he could get help. His attempts to do this failed and he was captured. Sergei Safronov was posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Banner.|$|E

[...] Amongst <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>that</b> set these works apart from Sharaku's earlier and later ones, five of these prints feature clearly visible ears, which are drawn with six lines, whereas those of Sharaku's other works are drawn with five lines. [...] Given that Enkyō's works appeared sixteen months after Sharaku's, differences in approach such as Enkyō's thicker line and rounder eyes {{can be attributed to}} evolution of the artist's style.|$|E

500|$|In 1880, while Brown {{was still}} alive, the lay missionary Christina Smith wrote a book, The Booandik Tribe of South Australian Aborigines, which was {{published}} in Adelaide. It included a number of memoirs from her time in the Rivoli Bay district, some [...] southeast of Guichen Bay. One of these was about an Aboriginal boy called Wergon, whom she had adopted in the 1840s. Wergon had converted to Christianity and went on several journeys to try to convert the local Aboriginal people. One of these evangelical visits was to the country of the Wattatonga tribe, a group whose traditional lands included the newly established Avenue Range Station. He returned from this trip to tell Smith that eleven of the tribe had been massacred by two white men. Wergon had persuaded a witness, whose parents had apparently been killed in the massacre, to return with him. According to Wergon, [...] "the white men had shown no mercy to the grey-headed old man or to the helpless infant on its mother's breast", and the apparent motive for the massacre was the killing of sheep belonging to a settler in the Guichen Bay district. Smith's account did not include how the massacre was carried out, but did include <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>that</b> it was investigated, the bodies of the victims were burnt, and the murderer was discharged for lack of evidence. Smith did not name the settlers, which the authors Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck consider unsurprising given that Brown was alive and living nearby at the time the book was published. While circumspect about naming Brown, Smith essentially recounted important details of the massacre in her book published over thirty years after it occurred.|$|E

In 1864, the Army Uniform Board [...] "enhanced" [...] the frock coat by adding black [...] "herringbone braid" [...] in across the chest at the buttons and buttonholes, with buttons still covered in black. This coat {{was used by}} army chaplains until 1880, when shoulder boards were authorized for chaplains for the first time, and the first official insignia was introduced.|$|E

2500|$|While the Mason novels {{were largely}} {{a form of}} pulp fiction {{of the sort that}} began Gardner's writing career, they are unusual in that the whodunit mysteries usually {{involved}} two solutions: one in which the authorities believed (wherein Mason's client was guilty) and an alternative explanation (wherein Mason's client was innocent). Almost always, the second half of each novel is devoted to a courtroom scene, during which Mason arrives at the alternative explanation and proves it to the satisfaction of the court.

2500|$|The {{accounts}} of this battle mainly {{are derived from}} Egyptian literary accounts known as the Bulletin (also known as the Record) and the Poem as well as pictorial Reliefs. Unfortunately for scholars and individuals interested in the Battle of Kadesh, <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>that</b> these sources provide are heavily biased interpretation of the events. Since Ramesses II had complete control over the building projects, the resources were used for propagandist purposes by the pharaoh, who used them to brag about his victory at Kadesh. It is still known that Ramesses marched through Syria with four divisions of troops {{in the hopes of}} destroying the Hittite presence there and restoring Egypt to the [...] "preeminent position it had enjoyed under Tuthmosis III". The Hittite king, Muwatalli II, gathered together an army of his allies to prevent the invasion of his territory. At the site of Kadesh, Ramesses foolishly outdistanced the remainder of his forces and, after hearing unreliable intelligence regarding the Hittite position from a pair of captured prisoners, the pharaoh pitched camp across from the town. The Hittite armies, hidden behind the town, launched a surprise attack against the Amun division and quickly sent the division scattering. Although Ramesses tried to rally his troops against the onslaught of the Hittite chariots, it was only after the arrival of relief forces from Amurru that the Hittite attack was thrown back.|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigation}} into the murder of Patricia Docker in 1968 went cold as police had little information, owing {{to a lack of}} witnesses. Eighteen months later, after the discovery of Jemima McDonald's body, the police soon became aware of [...] "similarities" [...] to the first murder. They realised {{they were looking for a}} double murderer; and for the first time in a Scottish murder hunt, using eyewitness accounts, the press were given an Identikit picture of the man Jemima had left with. Two months later following the murder of Helen Puttock, police interviewed Puttock's sister Jean, who became the key witness of the investigation. Jean remembered many of <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>that</b> have become part of the legend of Bible John: such as him calling the women [...] "adulterous," [...] a hole in one at golf that he claimed his cousin had scored, and even overlapping teeth. However more importantly it was the man's references to the bible that led to Evening Times journalist John Quinn coining the phrase [...] "Bible John". Furthermore, an additional Identikit of a red-haired man was painted using the testimony of Jean that became one of the most famous portraits in Scotland. Detective Joe Beattie asked the public to study the Identikit closely in case it resembled anyone they knew. As a result, more than 1000 suspects had been quizzed and cleared.|$|E

2500|$|His own {{letters and}} diary entries, at times written under {{emotional}} duress as he relived events that would as always disturb him greatly, support the conventional historical {{account of the}} assassination. His frankness, his tone, and <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>that</b> he provides all speak to his credibility on this topic. His final break with Yusupov in London in 1920 is well documented in letters exchanged between the two men, none of which has ever been published. The originals {{are all part of}} the Ilyinsky family collection, along with Dmitri's diaries, and have been woefully, almost incredibly, neglected by scholars. Dmitri, [...] who, as an adolescent, had envisioned Nicholas II as a 'man of action' and admired him greatly, was devastatingly disillusioned by the Tsar's attitude and behavior during the war years. Like many other grand dukes, he unsuccessfully tried to warn Nicholas of Russia's imminent peril. The assassination was, in his conception, a patriotic act and one of desperation, but he almost immediately regretted it and would later describe on several occasions in his letters and diaries the disgust and remorse that he felt about his own involvement in the affair. Yusupov was, in 1920, offered a chance to speak about the assassination in a US lecture tour, the profits from which would go to the Red Cross, and it was his interest in pursuing the tour that proved to be the last straw in his relationship with Dmitri.|$|E
