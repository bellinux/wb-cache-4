5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius torminosus contain {{a number of}} sterols, of which {{ergosterol}} (a component of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all sterols, followed by its derivatives and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 volatile compounds that contribute to <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> of the mushroom. Many of these are alcohols and carbonyl compounds with eight carbon atoms; the predominant volatile compound (about 90%) is 1-octen-3-one, an odorant common in mushrooms.|$|E

40|$|Social {{information}} can be acquired {{either directly or indirectly}} from cues inadvertently produced by individuals with similar interests and requirements (“inadvertent social information,” ISI). These inadvertent cues provide “public information” that other individuals can use to guide their behavior. We show here that female mice use olfactory ISI to determine their choice of, and responses to, males and that the use of this ISI involves the gene for oxytocin (OT). Female mice (OT wild type and CF- 1 strain) displayed a significant interest in, and choice of, <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> of uninfected males of varying sexual status that were associated with <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> of an another estrous female. This recognition of, and choices for, specific, individual male odors was evident 24 h later. Female mice also distinguished between males subclinically infected with the gastrointestinal nematode parasite, Heligimosomoides polygyrus, and nonparasitized males, displaying aversive responses (analgesia, increased corticosterone) to, and avoidance of, <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> of infected males. The presence of <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> of another estrous female with that of the infected male, which are indicative of potential mate interests, attenuated these aversive responses and resulted in a choice for <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> of infected male. OT gene-deficient (knockout) females were impaired in their use of this ISI to modulate their responses to either uninfected males of differing sexual states or infected males. These findings suggest that OT genes are necessary for the processing of inadvertent social information and likely the integration of both direct and indirect social information...|$|R

5|$|Two days later, the Coast Guard cutter Chase took over, escorting the KD II to San Diego. Along {{the way the}} {{investigation}} continued.

25|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} ORS is excessive thoughts of having offensive body odor(s) which are detectable to others. The individual may report that <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> comes from: the nose and/or mouth, i.e. halitosis (bad breath), the anus, the genitals, the skin generally, or specifically the groin, armpits or feet. The source(s) of the supposed odor may also change over time. There {{are also some}} who are unsure of the exact origin of <b>the</b> <b>odor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>odor</b> is typically reported to be continuously present. The character of <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> may be reported as similar to bodily substances, e.g. feces, flatus, urine, sweat, vomitus, semen, vaginal secretions; or alternatively {{it may be an}} unnatural, non-human or chemical odor, e.g. ammonia, detergent, rotten onions, burnt rags, candles, garbage, burning fish, medicines, old cheese. Again, the reported character of <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> complaint may change over time. Halitosis appears to be the most common manifestation of ORS, with 75% complaining of bad breath, alone or in combination with other odors. The next most common complaint was sweat (60%).|$|E
40|$|Responses of {{individual}} females of the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris to <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> of four different complexes of host larvae feeding on leaves {{were observed in}} a four-arm olfactometer. The plant-host complexes were composed of fall armyworm (FAW) larvae or cabbage looper (CL) larvae feeding on either corn or cotton seedlings. Prior to testing, each female was given a brief foraging experience on a plant-host complex and was then exposed to <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> of <b>the</b> same complex in the olfactometer. The experienced females responded to familiar odors in a dose-related manner, and these responses were virtually identical to all four complexes. Preferences for <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> of one of two plant-host complexes were tested in dual choice situations. Generally, FAW odors were preferred over CL odors and corn odors over cotton odors. A short foraging experience significantly affected <b>the</b> females' <b>odor</b> preferences in favor of <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> released by <b>the</b> experienced complex. Additional experiments revealed that neither longer bouts of experience nor bouts that included ovipositions resulted in a stronger change in preference. Experience affected preference in combinations where only the host species was varied {{as well as in}} combinations where only the plant species was varied. The results, therefore, strongly indicate that both the plants and the hosts somehow are involved in the production and/or release of the semiochemicals that attract C. marginiventris...|$|R

25|$|Some {{distinguish}} delusional and non-delusional {{forms of}} ORS. In the delusional type, there is complete conviction that <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> is real.

Others argue that reported cases of ORS present a spectrum of different levels of insight. Since sometimes the core belief of ORS is not of delusional intensity, it is argued that considering the condition as a form of delusional disorder, as seems to occur in the DSM, is inappropriate. In one review, in 57% of cases the beliefs were fixed, held with complete conviction, and the individual could not be reassured that <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> was non existent. In 43% of cases the individual held the beliefs with less than complete conviction, and was able to varying degrees to consider the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> was not existent.|$|E
40|$|Olfaction {{may play}} an {{important}} role in regulating bird behavior, and has been suggested to be involved in feather-pecking.

All mice were clearly able to discriminate between all individual red junglefowl odors, showing that each bird has an individual body odor. We analyzed whether it was more difficult to discriminate between <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> of two feather-pecked, or two non-pecked birds, than it was to discriminate between <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> of two randomly selected birds.

40|$|Pairing an odor {{and taste}} can change ratings of <b>the</b> <b>odor’s</b> perceptual and hedonic characteristics.

In sweet likers, both sniff duration and peak amplitude increased for <b>the</b> sweet-paired <b>odor.</b> Sniff magnitude decreased for sweet- and quinine-paired odors in sweet-dislikers, and sweet likers smelling <b>the</b> quinine-paired <b>odor.</b> In sweet-likers, liking for <b>the</b> sweet-paired <b>odor</b> increased with both TFEQ-D score and hunger, and sniff magnitude with TFEQ-D only.

40|$|Abstract. The {{physiological}} response to seven odors (birch tar, galbanum, heliotropine, jasmine, lavender, lemon and peppermint) {{was assessed by}} EEG recordings from 19 scalp loci from 16 young adult females. Topographic maps were constructed from the amplitude spectra in four frequency bands: delta (1 - 4 Hz), theta (4 - 8 Hz), alpha (8 - 13 Hz) and beta (13 - 30 Hz). Eight seconds of representative and artifact-free EEG were selected for FFT analysis before onset of odor delivery, and at three times after stimulus onset. EEG was also quantified at 30 s after stimulus termination. Subjects differed in their subjective responses to <b>the</b> <b>odors,</b> with <b>the</b> most consistently arousing and strong odors being galbanum, lavender, lemon and peppermint. Heliotropine was notably weak. <b>The</b> most pleasant <b>odors</b> were lemon and peppermint, while birch tar, galbanum and lavender were consistently unpleasant. EEG map changes occurred {{in one or more}} frequency bands in each subject in response to one or more of <b>the</b> <b>odors.</b> EEG map changes sometimes occurred even with weak odors and even when the subject seemed unaware of <b>the</b> <b>odor's</b> presence.

25|$|Although all {{individuals}} with ORS {{believe they have}} an odor, {{in some cases the}} individual reports they cannot perceive <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> themselves. In the latter cases, the belief arises via misinterpretation of the behavior of others or with the rationale that a disorder of smell which prevents self detection of <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> (i.e. anosmia) exists. In the cases where the non-existent odor can be detected, this is usually considered as phantosmia (olfactory hallucination). Olfactory hallucination can be considered the result of the belief in an odor delusion, or the belief a result of the olfactory hallucination. In one review, the individual with ORS was unreservedly convinced that he or she could detect <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> themselves in 22% of cases, whilst in 19% there was occasional or intermittent detection and in 59% lack of self-detection was present.|$|E

40|$|Visual {{experience}} is information rich, {{but only a}} small proportion is available for later access. We tested for this distinction in olfaction. In two experiments (E 1 & 2), participants undertook trials rating an odor's features (e. g., how banana-like?), the during-smelling-profile, followed by an after-smelling-profile, upon <b>the</b> <b>odor's</b> removal. On some trials during and after-smelling-profiles were identical and on others they were different. Each trial with a particular odor was repeated.
