5|$|During a {{break in}} {{fighting}} at Okinawa, Kizirian was photographed {{by a member of}} the press. The picture that later appeared on the cover of the June 24, 1945 issue of The New York Times Sunday Magazine. <b>The</b> <b>photograph</b> became the face of the battle for thousands of Americans.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> Earth's {{apparent}} size is {{less than}} a pixel; the planet appears as a tiny dot against the vastness of space, among bands of sunlight scattered by the camera's optics.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{theories}} have been expounded by the University of Liverpool's Paul Knox, who stated {{that what the}} brain interprets as colour may {{be affected by the}} device <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> is viewed on, or the viewer's own expectations.|$|E

60|$|There is no {{waste of}} time about <b>the</b> business, <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> are {{developed}} as rapidly as possible. Within {{an hour and a}} half after <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> were taken <b>the</b> first prints are going back into the bureau for the examination of <b>the</b> <b>photographs.</b> Both British and French air photographs are thoroughly scrutinised and marked.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>photographs</b> {{were printed}} on {{photographic}} paper {{to create a}} photo album. <b>The</b> <b>photographs</b> in each set were coded from 1 to 6. Photograph number 7 was identical to one randomly selected image in the set to assess reliability. The sets of photos were arranged according to set number; however, <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> displaying <b>the</b> incremental changes were randomly arranged.|$|R
5|$|Some shots {{required}} {{exposing the}} film again to record previously filmed live action {{shots of the}} people appearing in the windows the spacecraft or structures, achieved by mounting projection devices inside the model or, when two dimensional photographs were used, projecting from the backside through a hole cut in <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b>|$|E
5|$|About a {{week before}} the wedding of couple Grace and Keir Johnston of Colonsay, Scotland, the bride's mother, Cecilia Bleasdale, took a {{photograph}} of a dress she planned to wear to the wedding and sent it to her daughter. After disagreements over the perceived colour of the dress in <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> the bride posted the image on Facebook, and her friends also disagreed over the colour; some saw it as white with gold lace, while others saw it as blue with black lace. For a week, the debate became well known in Colonsay, a small island community.|$|E
5|$|Although many in NASA's Voyager {{program were}} {{supportive}} of the idea, there were concerns that taking a picture of Earth {{so close to the}} Sun risked damaging the spacecraft's imaging system irreparably. It was not until 1989 that Sagan's idea was put into practice, but then instrument calibrations delayed the operation further, and the personnel who devised and transmitted the radio commands to Voyager 1 were also being laid off or transferred to other projects. Finally, NASA Administrator Richard Truly interceded to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> was taken.|$|E

50|$|In October 2011 Geenstijl {{received}} {{a message from}} an anonymous source about photographs of Britt Dekker on the Australian website FileFactory, which were {{to be published in}} the December 2011 Dutch edition of Playboy Magazine, published by Sanoma. Before Geenstijl published the link to <b>the</b> <b>photographs,</b> Sanoma requested Geenstijl not to do so.Geenstijl however published an post about <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> including a hyperlink to the FileFactory from where <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> could be found.

5|$|As the United Press International {{news agency}} noted, Church of Scientology biographies of Hubbard's life do not mention either {{of his first}} two wives. In one {{publication}} the Church has airbrushed Northrup out of {{a photograph of the}} couple that appeared in the Miami Daily News issue of June 30, 1946. The news story which <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> accompanied has been republished by the Church with all mention of Northrup edited out from the text.|$|E
5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E
5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, it {{is clear}} from Fig.  5 that the perceptual {{evaluations}} of <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> behave similarly to both virtual variations. Looking specifically at the static case, while the LMM results show significant differences from the real space, they differ from <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> in only 19 out of 150 comparisons. Hence, despite having differences with the real space, the static visualizations are nearly equivalent to <b>the</b> <b>photographs.</b>|$|R
25|$|After the reports, Corby's mother, Rosleigh Rose, flew to Adelaide, entered police {{headquarters}} and demanded (unsuccessfully) to see <b>the</b> <b>photographs.</b> She alleged that <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> were taken with Corby {{in prison in}} Bali.|$|R
500|$|There are 140 {{black and}} white figures, mainly {{photographs}} with a few diagrams and drawings. Half <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> are of birds. <b>The</b> <b>photographs</b> are from various sources, [...] "gleaned from periodicals, or secured by special advertising." ...|$|R
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{assigned}} to the case. Discussing <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> Mulder tells Scully about Ted Serios, who was famous for making photos which showed what was in his mind. He takes pictures of his gloved hand using a camera found in Lefante's apartment, and they all appear {{the same as the}} one from the pharmacy. Mulder deduces that the kidnapper has been stalking his victims.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{a working}} {{replica of the}} SSEM, now {{on display at the}} Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, was built to {{celebrate}} the 50th anniversary of the running of its first program. Demonstrations of the machine in operation are held regularly at the museum. In 2008, an original panoramic photograph of the entire machine was discovered at the University of Manchester. <b>The</b> <b>photograph,</b> taken on 15 December 1948 by a research student, Alec Robinson, had been reproduced in The Illustrated London News in June 1949.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} season, Tittle was photographed bloodied and {{kneeling}} {{down in the}} end zone after a tackle by a defender left him helmetless. <b>The</b> <b>photograph</b> {{is considered one of the}} most iconic images in North American sports history. He retired as the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns, attempts, completions, and games played. Tittle was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, and his jersey number 14 is retired by the Giants.|$|E
50|$|In 1882, Houghton {{published}} Chronicles of <b>the</b> <b>Photographs</b> of Spiritual Beings and Phenomena Invisible to the Material Eye. The book included alleged spirit {{photographs from}} Hudson and other photographers featuring mediums such as Agnes Guppy-Volckman, Stainton Moses and spiritualists Alfred Russel Wallace and William Howitt. <b>The</b> <b>photographs</b> in <b>the</b> book were criticized by magic historian Albert A. Hopkins. He noted how <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> looked dubious and {{could easily be}} produced by fraudulent methods.|$|R

5|$|Of the 640,000 {{individual}} pixels that compose each frame, Earth {{takes up}} less than one (0.12 pixels, according to NASA). The light bands across <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> are an artifact, the result of sunlight scattering off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth. Voyager's point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.|$|E
5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} was {{produced}} during a photo shoot which remains the most expensive one to be ever developed in Romania, with the total costs amounting to €15,000. It was shot by Edward Aninaru at the Media Pro Pictures studios in Buftea. Over 50 male and female models were featured in the shooting, which consisted of two different images — an uncensored one leaked onto the internet and <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> used to commercialize the album. The artwork portrays Inna standing {{in the center of}} a background with semi-nude models wearing a red-black suit, long boots and a French-like bun.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{appears in}} a late 19th century photo, when the part on St. John Street was used to house the gas office, and the shops {{of the time in}} Merchant's Street. The photo forms part of the Richard Ellis collection, a set of images named for the photographer. The building {{appears in a}}n early 20th century photo, with <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> named as Castellania (Old Court-House), and appears on a British period postcard. By the late 19th century, calesse drivers were required to register their vehicles at the Castellania and obtain number plates.|$|E
50|$|In January 2017, Seesequasis {{signed a}} deal with the Canadian {{division}} of Penguin Random House to publish <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> in book form. The book, tentatively titled Blanket Toss Under Midnight Sun and slated for publication in 2018, will include a written component documenting the context of <b>the</b> <b>photographs,</b> <b>the</b> subjects and the photographers.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>photograph</b> {{used for}} {{the cover of the}} album depicts a man rowing a boat made out of strung-together washbasins. The image was {{captured}} by Margaret Bourke-White as part of a series taken to document the Ohio River flood of 1937. The cover, which was designed by band member John Flansburgh with Elizabeth van Itallie, originally featured only the photo; however, an emblem including the band's name, inked by Flansburgh's former coworker Barbara Lipp, was later added. The emblem resembles the logo of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.|$|E
5|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw {{increasingly}} rapid {{advances in the}} scientific study of stars. <b>The</b> <b>photograph</b> became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{her career}} as a Bass Strait ferry, Nairana had {{displayed}} a commemorative plaque and a photograph from her days as a carrier, presented by the British Admiralty in recognition of her service in the First World War, and especially her part in the fall of Arkhangelsk. After she was retired, the plaque went on display at the Museum of Wellington City & Sea, New Zealand, and <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> at the Launceston Maritime Museum, Tasmania.|$|E
50|$|The House of Lords {{agreed in}} a 3-2 {{judgment}} that <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> of <b>the</b> wedding were confidential, {{that there were}} circumstances of confidence and that publication of <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> {{had been to the}} detriment of OK magazine.
