5|$|By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams {{were seen}} by the public as a blot on the city's image. With a {{population}} of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low <b>traffic</b> <b>capacity,</b> made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded. Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced {{that the government had}} purchased all of the city tramways for £280,000. Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) with the authority to build new and purchase existing tramways.|$|E

25|$|Between New Haven and New York City, I-95 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{congested}} highways in the United States. Although I-95 has been widened in several spots, some areas are only 3 lanes and this strains <b>traffic</b> <b>capacity,</b> resulting in frequent and lengthy rush hour delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway and even US 1. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and ride-sharing.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 the LMS {{system was}} {{replaced}} by a more standard system controlled from a new signal box, Willesden Suburban, and the remaining local boxes were abolished. The new system had solid state interlocking, but far fewer signals; as a consequence the maximum <b>traffic</b> <b>capacity</b> of the line was severely reduced. In the early 1960s there were headways of less than 2 minutes between Harrow & Wealdstone and Willesden Junction stations, the section of line used by nearly all services.|$|E

The two larger tunnels are each two lanes wide {{and are used}} for motorised traffic. The two smaller tunnels were originally reserved for pedestrians and bicycles; to increase <b>traffic</b> <b>capacity</b> the cycle lanes have been modified to each take a single lane of cars, although bicycles still have priority over cars. Pedestrian access to the smaller tunnels has been discontinued, with the free bus services being used instead.|$|E

The £86 million plan will reduce the journey time to Belfast by 30 minutes and allow commuter trains to arrive before 9 a.m. for the first time. Many still do not use the train, because, at over two hours, it is slower centre-to-centre than the 100-minute Ulsterbus Goldline Express service.|$|E

The bridge is 5.5km long and the expected <b>traffic</b> <b>capacity</b> is 80,000 car per day. It will benefit residents in Yuen Long because going to mainland China will only take 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Full {{automation}} commonly {{defined as}} requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished {{through a combination}} of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway. Fully automated driving would, in theory, allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds, which could enhance <b>traffic</b> <b>capacity</b> in places where additional road building is physically impossible, politically unacceptable, or prohibitively expensive. Automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error, which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes. Other potential benefits include improved air quality (as a result of more-efficient traffic flows), increased fuel economy, and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems.|$|E

We now show that DC-SIGN, a DC-specific C-type lectin, supports tethering and rolling of DC-SIGN-positive cells on the vascular ligand ICAM- 2 under shear flow, a prerequisite for emigration from blood. The DC-SIGN-ICAM- 2 interaction regulates chemokine-induced transmigration of DCs across both resting and activated endothelium. Thus, DC-SIGN {{is central to the}} unusual <b>trafficking</b> <b>capacity</b> of DCs, further supported by the expression of DC-SIGN on precursors in blood and on immature and mature DCs in both peripheral and lymphoid tissue...|$|R

25|$|With {{only two}} runways, {{operating}} at over 98% of their capacity, Heathrow has {{little room for}} more flights, although {{the increasing use of}} larger aircraft such as the Airbus A380 will allow some increase in passenger numbers. It is difficult for existing airlines to obtain landing slots to enable them to increase their services from the airport, or for new airlines to start operations. To increase the number of flights, Heathrow Airport Holdings has proposed using the existing two runways in 'mixed mode' whereby aircraft would be allowed to take off and land on the same runway. This would increase the airport's capacity from its current 480,000 movements per year to as many as 550,000 according to British Airways CEO Willie Walsh. Heathrow Airport Holdings has also proposed building a third runway {{to the north of the}} airport, which would significantly increase <b>traffic</b> <b>capacity</b> (see Future expansion below).|$|E
25|$|City {{management}} {{has committed to}} a $6 billion capital investment plan to increase the airport's capacity by 60% and decrease delays by an estimated 79 percent. This plan {{was approved by the}} FAA in October 2005 and will involve a reconfiguration of the airfield and addition of terminal space. The plan includes the addition of four runways, the lengthening of two existing runways, and the decommissioning of two existing runways in order to give the airfield six parallel runways in a configuration similar to that used at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and other large modern hub airports. This plan was very controversial as the added improvements, at the time they were proposed, were expected to increase the airport's air <b>traffic</b> <b>capacity</b> only slightly, given existing FAA rules. Additionally, the southernmost new runway would require the city acquiring additional land, which was extremely controversial as residents did not want to move.|$|E

In contrast to the standard vesicular mechanism of lipid transfer, evidence indicates that the physical proximity of the ER and mitochondrial membranes at the MAM allows for lipid flipping between opposed bilayers. Despite this unusual and seemingly energetically unfavorable mechanism, such transport does not require ATP. Instead, in yeast, it {{has been shown to be}} dependent on a multiprotein tethering structure termed the ER-mitochondria encounter structure, or ERMES, although it remains unclear whether this structure directly mediates lipid transfer or is required to keep the membranes in sufficiently close proximity to lower the energy barrier for lipid flipping.|$|R
