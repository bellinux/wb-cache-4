In 1997, <b>the</b> <b>BSA</b> developed Service to America with a commitment to provide 200million hours of service by youth members {{by the end of}} the year 2000. As part of Service to America, <b>the</b> <b>BSA</b> provided service projects in conjunction with the National Park Service (NPS).

40|$|The {{role of the}} albumin-carried {{fatty acids}} in the {{induction}} of tubulointerstitial injury was studied in protein-overload proteinuria. Rats were injected with fatty acid-carrying BSA [FA(+) BSA], fatty acid-depleted BSA [FA(-) BSA], or saline. Macrophage infiltration was measured by immunohistochemical staining, apoptotic cells were detected by in situ end labeling, and proliferating cells were identified by in situ hybridization for histone mRNA. Macrophage infiltration was significantly greater in <b>the</b> FA(+) <b>BSA</b> group than in <b>the</b> FA(-) <b>BSA</b> and saline groups. The infiltrate was largely restricted to the outer cortex. Apoptosis was greater in <b>the</b> FA(+) <b>BSA</b> group than in <b>the</b> FA(-) <b>BSA</b> and saline groups. Compared with the saline group, apoptosis was significantly increased in <b>the</b> FA(+) <b>BSA</b> group but not in <b>the</b> FA(-) <b>BSA</b> group. Cortical cells proliferated significantly more in <b>the</b> FA(+) <b>BSA</b> and FA(-) BSA groups than in the saline group. FA(+) BSA is therefore a more potent inducer of macrophage infiltration and cell death than FA(-) <b>BSA.</b> <b>The</b> fatty acids carried on albumin may be the chief instigators of tubulointerstitial injury in protein-overload proteinuria. 1487...|$|R

5|$|The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} Scouting {{organizations}} in the United States of America and one of the largest youth organizations in the United States, with more than 2.4 million youth participants and nearly one million adult volunteers. <b>The</b> <b>BSA</b> was founded in 1910, and since then, more than 110million Americans have been participants in BSA programs at some time. <b>The</b> <b>BSA</b> is part of the international Scout Movement and became a founding member organization of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922.|$|E

5|$|The {{fortunes}} of the LSA had begun to decline by 1920 when Boyce hired the first professional editor for Lone Scout, George N. Madison. Madison discovered that the LSA's membership roster was wildly inaccurate: {{it was full of}} duplications and inactive members. The reported 490,000 Lone Scouts in 1922 was a vastly inflated number. Boyce finally accepted West's annual offer to merge with <b>the</b> <b>BSA</b> in April 1924, with the merger formalized on June 16, 1924. Some Lone Scouts did not transfer to <b>the</b> <b>BSA,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>BSA</b> continued Lone Scouting as a separate division for another decade, gradually losing its unique programs. Present day Lone Scouts use the standard Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting programs and activities, but are not part of a pack or troop on a regular basis because of factors such as distance, weather, time, disability or other difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The {{objectives}} of <b>the</b> <b>BSA</b> {{are referred to}} as Aims of Scouting: moral character development; citizenship training; and development of physical, mental, and emotional fitness. <b>The</b> <b>BSA</b> pursues these aims through an informal education system called the Scout method, with variations that are designed to be appropriate for the age and maturity of each membership division. Each unit is sponsored by a community organization as part of their youth program and is involved in the neighborhood and community.|$|E
5|$|Boyce was {{recognized}} with the Silver Buffalo Award in 1926, {{the first year}} it was awarded, for his efforts in starting <b>the</b> <b>BSA.</b> He was the third recipient, after Baden-Powell and the Unknown Scout. During the BSA's 50th anniversary in 1960, 15,000 Scouts and several of Boyce's descendants gathered in Ottawa for a Boyce Memorial weekend. Illinois governor William Stratton delivered the key address and Bridge Street was renamed Boyce Memorial Drive. In 1985, about 2,500 Scouts attended a 75th anniversary pilgrimage in Ottawa, attended by his last surviving child, Virginia, and the Union League of Chicago named Boyce its first Hall of Fame member. Boyce {{had been a member}} from 1891 until he died. On December 6, 1997, a Scouting museum opened in Ottawa. The W. D. Boyce Council of <b>the</b> <b>BSA</b> is named in his honor. A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker located on Boyce Campus of Community College of Allegheny County in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, recognizes his achievements to Scouting. Not far from the marker is a county park, Boyce Park, that was named for him. A medallion of Boyce is near the White House as part of The Extra Mile– Points of Light Volunteer Pathway. In 2005, <b>the</b> <b>BSA</b> introduced the William D. Boyce New Unit Organization Award, presented to the organizer of any new Scouting unit.|$|E

5|$|Hillcourt was tasked {{to write}} a new manual for Scoutmasters in 1934 and worked with his good friend and {{colleague}} E.

In order to do so, he founded Troop 1 of Mendham in 1935 as a unit directly chartered to the National Council of <b>the</b> <b>BSA.</b> As the Scoutmaster, he used Troop 1 to test and validate his work for 16years.|$|E
5|$|Hillcourt {{worked at}} a BSA camp at Bear Mountain in Harriman State Park, New York, in 1926 where he became an {{instructor}} in American Indian dance. He then worked for <b>the</b> <b>BSA</b> Supply Division where he broke his leg when a crate fell on him. He met James West while working at the national office. West solicited Hillcourt's thoughts on Scouting in the U.S. Hillcourt later sent West an 18-page memo detailing issues {{with the lack of}} patrol structure and leadership. He recommended that <b>the</b> <b>BSA</b> write a handbook for patrol leaders, and that it needed to be written by someone who had been both a patrol leader and a Scoutmaster. West hired Hillcourt as a writer and editor and was later persuaded to commission Hillcourt to write the first Handbook for Patrol Leaders which was published in 1929.|$|E
