He took 1/31 in the hosts' first innings of 119, before making an unbeaten 16 in partnering McCool in an unbroken stand of 39 as Australia declared at 8/352. In the second innings, he took {{four of the}} last five wickets and ended with 4/31 as Northamptonshire collapsed from 5/142 to be all out for 169. This was followed by a drawn match against Yorkshire, in which Ring scored three runs and was not asked to bowl in the first innings. Yorkshire were bowled out for 206 from 90.1overs; Bradman called on Ernie Toshack and Johnston to bowl 81.1overs and did not entrust the other bowlers with substantial work. Ring then took 1/22 in the second innings as the match petered out into a draw.|$|E

Ring scored 17 not out as Australia made 321; he then dismissed Test players Ken Cranston (who was captaining Lancashire) and Dick Pollard, to end with 2/25 in the first innings. In the county's second innings Ring bowled 22 of the 57 overs during which Australia reduced Lancashire to 7/199 before time ran out. He took 2/88, including the wicket of Cranston {{for the second time}}. In a non-first-class match against Durham, the last fixture before the Fifth <b>Test,</b> <b>Ring</b> made an unbeaten single as Australia scored 282.

40|$|Abstract: This work {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of surface roughness of cam contours on friction torque in a hydraulic balanced vane pump and it is verified that smoothing {{the surface of the}} cam contour can reduce friction torque. In the vane pump, the friction torque arising from the friction between a cam contour and vane tips is significant. In this article, first, the values of the coefficient of friction between the vane tip and its sliding surfaces were measured by using cylindrical <b>test</b> <b>rings</b> with various kinds of surface roughness. Then the torque characteristics of vane pumps having cam ring contours with various values of surface roughness were measured and their results compared with the results of an analysis of the coefficient of friction investigated using <b>test</b> <b>rings.</b> As a result, the friction torque caused by the friction between the cam contour and the vane tip was reduced by lessening the surface roughness of the cam contour, resulting in an improvement of the mechanical efficiency. The coefficient of friction measured by using the <b>test</b> <b>rings</b> could be applied to the actual vane pumps...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} of rolled {{rings of}} Incoloy 909 nickel-iron-cobalt superalloy {{subjected to a}} standard customer solution and aging treatment exhibited unacceptably large grains. Samples cut from a failed ring were mounted and polished for analysis. The samples were etched with a modified Kalling’s waterless reagent and metallographic analysis was done to identify characteristic large grain structures distributed among the desired smaller grain structures. The large grains were identified and noted for comparison to later samples. Two <b>test</b> <b>rings</b> were forged out of Incoloy 909 using revised forging procedures involving reduced soak temperatures before each forging step. Metallographic samples were cut from micro-samples of each ring and mounted. The samples from the <b>test</b> <b>rings</b> were subjected to the same grinding, polishing, and etching procedure as the samples from the failed ring. Metallographic analysis was done on samples cut from the two <b>test</b> <b>rings,</b> which confirmed that the revised forging procedures had eliminated the large grain structures present in the failed ring, exhibiting instead a relatively uniform smaller grain structure. Tensile testing was done on samples from the <b>test</b> <b>rings,</b> reporting an average yield strength of 139. 5 ksi for process A and 144. 8 ksi for process B, an average ultimate tensile strength of 171. 8 ksi for process A and 179. 3 ksi for process B, and an elongation of 9. 55 % for process A and 10. 5 % for process B. These values were under the required minimum tensile properties of Incoloy 909 at room temperature, and the forging cycles were concluded to be unsuccessful...|$|R
