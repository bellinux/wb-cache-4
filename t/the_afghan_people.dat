5|$|Karmal was {{promoted}} to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers on 27 December 1979. He remained in office until 1981, when he was succeeded by Sultan Ali Keshtmand. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during Nur Mohammad Taraki's and Amin's rule. He also replaced the Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Afghan</b> <b>people</b> revolted {{against the}} PDPA {{government}} {{when the government}} introduced several socialist reforms, including land reforms. By early 1979, twenty-five out of Afghanistan's twenty-eight provinces were unsafe because of armed resistance against the government. On 29 March 1979, the Herat uprising began; the uprising turned the revolt into an open war between the Mujahideen and the Afghan government. It was during this period that Amin became Kabul's strongman. Shortly after the Herat uprising had been crushed, the Revolutionary Council convened to ratify the new Five-Year Plan, the Afghan–Soviet Friendship Treaty, and to vote {{on whether or not}} to reorganise the cabinet and to enhance the power of the executive (the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council). While the official version of events said that all issues were voted on democratically at the meeting, the Revolutionary Council held another meeting the following day to ratify the new Five-Year Plan and to discuss the reorganisation of the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|When Karmal took power, {{he began}} {{expanding}} the support {{base of the}} PDPA. Karmal tried to persuade certain groups, which had been referred to class enemies of the revolution during Taraki and Amin's rule, to support the PDPA. Karmal appointed several non-communists to top positions. Between March and May 1980, 78 out of the 191 people appointed to government posts were not members of the PDPA. Karmal reintroduced the old Afghan custom of having an Islamic invocation every time the government issued a proclamation. In his first live speech to <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> <b>people,</b> Karmal called {{for the establishment of}} the National Fatherland Front (NFF); the NFF's founding congress was held in June 1981. Unfortunately for Karmal, his policies did not lead to a notable increase in support for his regime, and it did not help Karmal that most Afghans saw the Soviet intervention as an invasion.|$|E
50|$|In his documentaries, Dr. Hoodbhoy has heavily criticised Pakistan and India's {{nuclear weapons}} program. He {{also pointed out}} the {{seriousness}} of the Talibanization in Pakistan and its immediate effects on South Asia. His documentaries also point out that American and NATO forces in Afghanistan didn't help <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> <b>people's</b> life and there was no reform in Afghanistan's social and public sector and, instead, the insurgency and corruption grew, which also destabilised Pakistan's western front.|$|R
50|$|The 1995 {{attack on}} the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul {{occurred}} on 6 September 1995 when up to 5,000 protestors attacked and sacked the embassy of Pakistan in Kabul, Afghanistan, after the Taliban militia had captured Herat from the internationally recognised Islamic State of Afghanistan. One person was killed and twenty six others, including the Pakistani ambassador, were injured. The attack occurred due to <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> <b>peoples</b> belief that Pakistan had helped the Taliban to take the city.|$|R

5|$|Attempting {{to pacify}} the population, Amin {{released}} {{a list of}} 18,000 {{people who had been}} executed, and blamed the executions on Taraki. The total number of arrested during Taraki's and Amin's combined reign number between 17,000 and 45,000. Amin was not liked by <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> <b>people.</b> During his rule, opposition to the communist regime increased, and the government lost control of the countryside. The state of the Afghan military deteriorated; due to desertions the number of military personnel in the Afghan army decreased from 100,000 {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem Amin faced was the KGB's penetration of the PDPA, the military and the government bureaucracy. While Amin's position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc were agitating for his removal. Babrak Karmal, the Parchamite leader, met several leading Eastern Bloc figures during this period, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Assadullah Sarwari wanted to exact revenge upon Amin.|$|E
25|$|Abdullah {{also said}} <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> <b>people</b> should not accept {{results of an}} {{election}} from the current election commission, and stated that Karzai's government had not been legitimate since its mandate expired in May 2009.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet war had a {{damaging}} {{impact on}} Afghanistan.

Charlie returns home to lead an effort to substantially increase funding to the mujahideen.|$|E
50|$|According to the US government, {{the common}} policy {{objective}} was to disrupt, dismantle, and prevent Al Qaeda and its affiliates from having a safe haven from which it can continue to operate and plot attacks against the U.S and its allies.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to understand the core components of <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> Taliban information strategy, which they treat as their main effort in their struggle to regain power. The Taliban use cultural metaphors from multiple sources such as Islam, pushtunwali, and Afghanistan's history to frame their right of religious and political authority. Taliban information strategy interweaves these metaphors with threats to sow fear {{in the minds of}} <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> population. Such methods employed by the Taliban to send their messages consist of leaving shabnamehs (night letters) to demonstrate that the Taliban can appear at anytime. More modern methods such as creating DVDs have recently been incorporated into their toolbox for the purpose of sustaining their fighter's moral and recruiting new followers inspired by their battle victories. This thesis determines that the Taliban are focusing their information strategy on short-term goals and thus, is relatively ineffective. This is derived from polling data that demonstrates <b>the</b> majority of <b>Afghan</b> <b>people</b> do not support the Taliban or desire to see their return to power. The Taliban are viewed as the reason for poor security despite their efforts to convince the population that the government cannot provide security. The Taliban information strategy has relied primarily on fear and coercion rather than persuasion. The Taliban's problematic IO strategy affords multiple opportunities for the United States and its allies to reach out to those parts of <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> population for whom the Taliban provide a disproportionate amount of all their information. This thesis makes specific recommendations on how best to achieve this goal...|$|R
25|$|On {{a two-day}} visit in Afghanistan in early January 2007, MacKay {{mentioned}} {{that there was}} an optimistic future in the country despite the Taliban resistance and violence.

He also announced funding for both aid worker groups and for developing security in Afghanistan, including developing the police force. He added another $200 million in aid on February 26, 2007, for the reconstruction. In October 2007, Maxime Bernier and Bev Oda, who were named respectively the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation during the summer of 2007, pledged an additional $25 million in food aid for <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> <b>people</b> in the areas affected by the Taliban militant presence.|$|E
25|$|More {{and more}} Afghan tribal {{leaders have been}} {{requesting}} additional ADTs, which illustrates how important {{the use of public}} diplomacy has been in the efforts to win the trust of <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> <b>people.</b> The case study from Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan serves as an excellent example. This province {{is one of the most}} stable and secure provinces in Afghanistan. For example, over 100,000 Afghans have returned to province; the province has also been declared poppy-free in 2007 by the UN. Additionally, most districts within the province have all-weather paved roads and it is also one of the most productive agricultural regions in Afghanistan. ADT should further its progress within the provinces of Afghanistan in agricultural education, technical support, and logistics. To defeat the insurgency in Afghanistan public diplomacy is an essential force, ADTs help the US educate the population of Afghanistan with the hope of strengthening Afghan trust in the American mission in Afghanistan.|$|E
