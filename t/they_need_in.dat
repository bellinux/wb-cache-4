5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{living in}} rural areas, {{especially}} poor rural areas, {{have access to}} fewer health care resources. Although 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, only 9 percent of physicians practice in rural settings. Individuals in rural areas typically must travel longer distances for care, experience long waiting times at clinics, or are unable to obtain the necessary health care <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> a timely manner. Rural areas characterized by a largely Hispanic population average 5.3 physicians per 10,000 residents compared with 8.7 physicians per 10,000 residents in nonrural areas. Financial barriers to access, including lack of health insurance, are also common among the urban poor.|$|E

25|$|Male-to-male {{competition}} {{for access to}} females and for resources that the females require {{for themselves and their}} offspring is common and can explain the morphological phenotypic traits and behaviors, such as large body size, weapons, territoriality, and early sexual maturation that increase their possibilities of gaining access to the females. In many social insects, larger males are more competitive and tend to monopolize females or the resources that <b>they</b> <b>need.</b> <b>In</b> bees, females may choose males who are faster, more agile, or more persistent fliers. Sequestering of females and forced copulation may also favor large male size. Males with longer horns and mandibles can use them to fight, or for take over attempts when rivals are copulating. In beetle species, the male horns can be as long as the male’s body. Early sexually mature males can start their reproductive life before the rest of the male population. Under scramble competition to inseminate females, the early matured males are smaller but can be favored in some cases where courtship occurs on the ground and attain the highest reproductive success. Thus, in the fly Drosophila suboscura, smaller males are better than large males at tracking females during the courtship dance.|$|E
500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E

[...] The {{men do not}} respect him as an officer, and he is obliged to go aloft to reef and furl the [...] topsails, and to put his hands into the tar and slush, with the rest. [...] The crew call him the [...] "sailor's waiter," [...] as he has to furnish them with spun-yarn, marline, and all other stuffs that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> their work, and has charge of the boatswain's locker, which {{includes}} serving-boards, marline-spikes, etc. [...] He is expected by the captain to maintain his dignity and to enforce obedience, and still is kept at a great distance from the mate, and obliged {{to work with the}} crew. [...] He is one to whom little is given and of whom much is required. [...] His wages are usually double those of a common sailor, and he eats and sleeps in the cabin; but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all the time, and eats at the second table, that is, makes a meal out of what the captain and chief mate leave.|$|E

2500|$|On 19 November of {{the same}} year, the KGB had a meeting on which they {{discussed}} Operation Cascade, which was launched earlier that year. The operation carried out bombings {{with the help of}} GRU and FCD. On 27 December, the center received news of the Darul Aman Palace, that KGB Special Forces Alpha and Zenith Group, supported by the 154th OSN GRU, also known as Muslim battalion and paratroopers from the 345th guards airborne regiment [...] stormed the Tajbeg Palace in Afghanistan and killed Afghan President Hafizullah Amin and his 100–150 personal guards. His 11-year-old son died due to shrapnel wounds. The Soviets installed Babrak Karmal as Amin's successor. Several other government buildings were seized during the operation, including the Ministry of Interior building, the Internal Security (KHAD) building, and the General Staff building (Darul Aman Palace). Out of the 54 KGB operators that assaulted the palace, 5 were killed in action, including Colonel Grigori Boyarinov, and 32 were wounded. Alpha Group veterans call this operation {{one of the most successful}} in the group's history. In June 1981, there were 370 members in the Afghan-controlled KGB intelligence service throughout the nation which were under the command of Ahmad Shah Paiya and had received all the training <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> the Soviet Union. By May 1982 the Ministry of Internal Affairs was set up in Afghanistan under the command of KHAD. In 1983 Boris Voskoboynikov became the next head of the KGB while Leonid Kostromin became his Deputy Minister.|$|E

60|$|It is futile {{to blame}} the Bolsheviks for an {{unpleasant}} and difficult situation which it has been {{impossible for them to}} avoid. Their problem is only soluble in one of two ways: by the cessation of the war and the blockade, which would enable them to supply the peasants with the goods <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> exchange for food; or by the gradual development of an independent Russian industry. This latter method would be slow, and would involve terrible hardships, but some of the ablest men in the Government believe it to be possible if peace cannot be achieved. If we force this method upon Russia by the refusal of peace and trade, we shall forfeit the only inducement we can hold out for friendly relations; we shall render the Soviet State unassailable and completely free to pursue the policy of promoting revolution everywhere. But the industrial problem is a large subject, which has been already discussed in Chapter VI.|$|E
60|$|But {{to use a}} {{more modest}} {{illustration}} and nearer home, I observe that in our political elections, where this element, if it appears at all, can only occur in its coarsest form, we sufficiently understand its incomparable rate. The people know that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> their representative much more than talent, namely {{the power to make}} his talent trusted. They cannot come at their ends by sending to Congress a learned, acute, and fluent speaker, if he be not one who, before he was appointed by the people to represent them, was appointed by Almighty God to stand for a fact,--invincibly persuaded of that fact in himself,--so that the most confident and the most violent persons learn that here is resistance on which both impudence and terror are wasted, namely faith in a fact. The men who carry their points do not need to inquire of their constituents what they should say, but are themselves the country which they represent; nowhere are its emotions or opinions so instant and true as in them; nowhere so pure from a selfish infusion. The constituency at home hearkens to their words, watches the color of their cheek, and therein, as in a glass, dresses its own. Our public assemblies are pretty good tests of manly force. Our frank countrymen of the west and south have a taste for character, and like to know whether the New Englander is a substantial man, or whether the hand can pass through him.|$|E
