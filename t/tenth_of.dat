5|$|Vega is {{only about}} a <b>tenth</b> <b>of</b> {{the age of the}} Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its {{expected}} lifetime is also one <b>tenth</b> <b>of</b> that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a variable star that varies slightly in brightness. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274km/s at the equator. This causes the equator to bulge outward due to centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is observed from the direction of one of these poles.|$|E
