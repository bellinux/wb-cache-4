40|$|ObjectivesOur {{objective}} {{in this study}} was to evaluate Tpeak-Tend interval (<b>Tp-e)</b> <b>and</b> other electrocardiographic parameters as risk factors for recurrence of life-threatening cardiac events in patients with the Brugada syndrome (BS). BackgroundThe Tp-e interval in the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been reported to predict life-threatening arrhythmias in the long QT syndrome. MethodsTwenty-nine patients with the ECG pattern of BS and 29 healthy age- and gender-matched controls were studied. The follow-up period was 42. 65 ± 24. 42 months (range 11 to 108 months). ResultsUpon presentation, five patients had suffered aborted sudden death, five syncope, and two presyncope. Eleven patients with the ECG pattern of BS had a prolonged (> 460 ms) QTc in V 2 but usually not in inferior or left leads. No patient had abnormally prolonged QT dispersion. Programmed electrical stimulation induced ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in 5 out of 26 patients. Inducibility did not predict recurrence of events. Cardioverter-defibrillators were implanted in 14 patients (all symptomatic and two asymptomatic). During follow-up, nine symptomatic patients experienced recurrences. Previous cardiac events and a QTc > 460 ms in V 2 were significant risk factors (p = 0. 00002 and p = 0. 03, respectively). <b>Tp-e</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tp-e</b> dispersion were significantly prolonged in patients with recurrences versus patients without events (104. 4 and 35. 6 ms vs. 87. 4 and 23. 2 ms; p = 0. 006 and p = 0. 03, respectively) or controls (90. 7 and 17. 9 ms; p = 0. 02 and p = 0. 001, respectively). ConclusionsOur study demonstrates significant correlation between previous events, QTc > 460 ms in V 2, <b>Tp-e,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tp-e</b> dispersion <b>and</b> occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmic events, suggesting that these parameters may be useful in risk stratification of patients with the Brugada syndrome...|$|R

Our study aims to investigate this alleged pro-arrhythmic effect of CRT using surface electrocardiogram (ECG) markers of pro-arrhythmia. MethodsSeventy five patients, who received CRT were included in this study. Manual measurement of corrected QT interval (QTc), Tpeak-end (<b>Tp-e)</b> interval, <b>QT</b> dispersion (<b>QTd)</b> <b>and</b> Tpeak-end dispersion during baseline 12 lead surface ECG and after applying atrial-biventricular pacing were done. Arrhythmias post CRT was recorded from ECG, 24 h holter monitoring or pacemaker programmer event recorder. ResultsQTc interval showed significant prolongation after CRT (498. 9 ± 50. 8 vs. 476. 2 ± 41. 6 msec, P= 0. 0001). Comparing patients with major arrhythmogenic events (MAE) and increased frequency of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) post CRT pacing to those patients without arrhythmias, there was a significant prolongation of the QTc interval (527 ± 63. 29 vs. 496. 95 ± 45. 2 msec, P= 0. 043) <b>and</b> <b>Tp-e</b> interval (94. 16 ± 9 vs. 87. 41 ± 16. 37 msec, P= 0. 049).

In the presence of AAP 10, the incidence rates of EAD and TdP were reduced and the Tp-e/QT ratio decreased, with a parallel reduction in the level of non-phosphorylated Cx 43. The results indicate that AAP 10 suppressed ibutilide-induced TdP under conditions of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia by decreasing TDR.

METHODSWe recorded 87 -lead body-surface ECGs before and after epinephrine infusion (0. 1 μg/kg/min) in 13 LQT 1, 6 LQT 2, and 7 control patients. The Q-Tend (QT-e), Q-Tpeak (QT-p), <b>and</b> <b>Tp-e</b> were measured automatically from 87 -lead ECGs, corrected by Bazett’s method (QTc-e, QTc-p, Tcp-e), and averaged among all 87 -leads and among 24 -leads, which reflect the potential from the left ventricular free wall. As an index of spatial dispersion of repolarization, the dispersion of QTc-e (QTc-eD) and QTc-p (QTc-pD) were obtained among 87 -leads and among 24 -leads, and were defined as the interval between the maximum and the minimum of the QTc-e and the QTc-p, respectively. RESULTSEpinephrine significantly increased the mean QTc-e but not the mean QTc-p, resulting in {{a significant increase in the}} mean Tcp-e in both LQT 1 and LQT 2, but not in control patients. The epinephrine-induced increases in the mean QTc-e and Tcp-e were larger in LQT 1 than in LQT 2, and were more pronounced when the averaged data were obtained from 24 -leads than from 87 -leads. Epinephrine increased the maximum QTc-e but not the minimum QTc-e, producing a significant increase in the QTc-eD in both LQT 1 and LQT 2 patients, but not in control patients. The increase in the QTc-eD was larger in LQT 1 than in LQT 2 patients. CONCLUSIONSOur data suggest that sympathetic stimulation produces a greater increase in both transmural and spatial dispersion of repolarization in LQT 1 than in LQT 2 syndrome, and this may explain why LQT 1 patients are more sensitive to sympathetic stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{relationship}} between metabolic syndrome X (MSX) and atrial arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation (AF) {{has been shown}} in previous studies. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate ventricular repolarization by using <b>Tp-e</b> interval <b>and</b> Tp-e/QT ratio in patients with cardiac syndrome X (CSX). Material and Method: A total of 65 consecutive subjects were included in the present study. Diagnostic coronary angiography was performed on patients who had a positive stress test and suspected myocardial scintigraphy or coronary artery disease (CAD). 35 patients who were diagnosed as having CSX (Group I) and 30 patients with normal coronary angiograms (Group II) were included in this study. <b>QT</b> parameters, <b>Tp-e</b> intervals, <b>and</b> Tp-e/QT ratio were measured from the 12 -lead electrocardiogram.

30|$|Sevoflurane {{inhibits}} HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) currents (IKr), LQT 1 /minK currents (IKs), and Kv 4.3 currents (Ito) [3, 4], and induces significant QT interval prolongation. However, as the prolongation {{is modest}} and sevoflurane {{does not affect}} the Tp-e interval in healthy people [5, 6], sevoflurane is generally considered as a safe general anesthetic in terms of TdP and/or lethal arrhythmias, even in those with LQTS [16]. This is probably the first report which clearly demonstrates the Tp-e interval prolongation by sevoflurane not only in healthy people but also in patients with LQTS. We think of two reasons why the Tp-e interval is prolonged by sevoflurane: The case is a patient with LQTS 3, which is considered to be more dangerous than patients with LQT 1 and LQT 2, or the patient is poorly controlled preoperatively in terms of the QTc <b>and</b> <b>Tp-e</b> intervals. Because LQTS is relatively uncommon (1 in 2500), {{there is a lack of}} a robust evidence based on appropriate perioperative management, and there are few reports which systemically investigate the effect of sevoflurane on the QTc <b>and</b> the <b>Tp-e</b> intervals in LQTS patients. Whyte et al. reported that general anesthesia for LQTS patients was performed 128 of 158 (81 %) with volatile anesthetics including sevoflurane without any serious arrhythmias, such as TdP [17]. However, TdP has been reported to be induced by sevoflurane in some patients, including in a patient with LQT 2 [18], a patient with LQTS who received fluconazole infusion [19], and a patient with poorly controled diabetes [20], because both fluconazole and hyperglycemia inhibit potassium channels (Ikr channels) and induce QT interval prolongation [21, 22]. Furthermore, Kang et al. demonstrated that sevoflurane and DPI 201 - 106, which reduces Na+ channel inactivation and mimicks LQT 3, prolong action potential duration, and the combination of the two drugs has been shown to have an effect on guinea-pig hearts greater than an additive effect of their activities, indicating the potential risk for ventricular arrhythmias when sevoflurane is used for LQT 3 patients [23]. On the other hand, because propofol at clinically relevant concentrations neither affects Ikr [3] nor prolongs QTc interval [5, 6], propofol might have been used in the present patient, rather than sevoflurane.|$|R
40|$|Aim: Chronic {{renal failure}} (CRF) {{is a major}} factor for {{ventricular}} arrhythmia. Chronic inflammation and other factors contribute to formation of arrhythmogenic substrate. The aim of our study was to assess ventricular repolarization in CRF patients receiving hemodialysis, by using QT dispersion, T wave peak to T wave end interval (<b>Tp-e</b> interval), Tp-e/QT ratio, <b>and</b> Tp-e/QTc ratio. Material and Method: Electrocardiogram of 35 CRF patients receiving hemodialysis were studied. T wave peak to end interval, QT and corrected QT intervals and some other ECG intervals were measured. Electrocardiograms of age and sex matched 30 healthy individuals were also analyzed for comparison. Results: CRF group and control group were significantly different from each other for calculated Tp-e (92. 9 ± 24. 7 vs 77. 0 ± 9. 6, p= 0. 002), Tp-e/QTc (0. 20 ± 0. 0 vs 0. 18 ± 0. 0, p= 0. 007), QTd (58. 9 ± 45. 6 vs 27. 3 ± 7. 6, p= 0. 001), and Tp-e/QT (0. 24 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 21 ± 0. 0, p= 0. 034) values. QTc (457. 9 ± 50. 8 e karsi 436. 4 ± 43. 1, p= 0. 077) values were similar in both groups. Discussion: <b>QTd,</b> <b>Tp-e,</b> Tp-e/QT <b>and</b> Tp-e/QTc are relatively new markers which also indicate repolarization defects. Our findings indicate that these new markers may be useful in determination of ventricular electrical instability in CRF patients receiving hemodialysis...|$|R
40|$|QTc {{interval}} prolongation is {{a serious}} diabetic complication and increases mortality rate. Hyperglycemia inhibits the rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium channel currents (Ikr) and prolongs the QTc interval on electrocardiograms. Sevoflurane also inhibits the Ikr and causes QTc interval prolongation. In fact, torsade de pointes occurred in a patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus during sevoflurane anesthesia. We enrolled 74 patients, including 37 normoglycemic patients (glycated hemoglobin [HbA 1 c]: < 6. 5 %) (NG group) and 37 chronically hyperglycemic patients (HbA 1 c: ≥ 6. 5 %) (HG group). Anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/kg propofol and 0. 3 μg/kg/min remifentanil, and maintained with 2 % sevoflurane in 40 % O 2 and 0. 2 - 0. 3 μg/kg/min remifentanil. The <b>QT</b> interval <b>and</b> <b>Tp-e</b> interval (from the peak {{to the end of}} the T wave) were measured before and at 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the administration of sevoflurane and adjusted for the patient's heart rate (QTc and Tp-ec, respectively). P-values of < 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. The QTc and the Tp-ec intervals of the two groups did not differ significantly before the administration of sevoflurane. The QTc interval gradually increased with time in both groups and was significantly longer than the baseline value at 10 min after the administration of sevoflurane in both groups. The QTc interval of the HG group was significantly longer than that of the NG group at 90 min and 120 min after the administration of sevoflurane. The Tp-ec interval was not affected by sevoflurane in either group. We have demonstrated that sevoflurane significantly prolongs the QTc interval, and that the extent of the prolongation is significantly greater in chronically hyperglycemic patients than in normoglycemic patients. Although Tp-ec is not affected by sevoflurane, it should be noted that the simultaneous blockade of potassium channels would increase the risk of arrhythmias...|$|R
40|$|Background: The prostate, the key {{secondary}} male reproductive organ, serves {{an important}} function of alkalizing seminal fluid and protecting genetic {{information in the}} acidity of the vaginal tract. As males age, the most common urologic condition manifests as an enlargement of the prostate known as benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the relationship between hormonal regulation and enzymatic activity of the proton-pump, H-K-ATPase (HKA), on the effects of morphological changes in BPH. Methods: The experiments were designed to test the effects of the primary male androgen, testosterone propionate (TP), as well as the primary male estrogen, estradiol (E 2). Sprague-Dawley outbred rats were divided into three groups; control group, TP group, <b>and</b> <b>TP-E</b> 2 group. Both the TP and the E 2 were diluted in vegetable oil and covered to eliminate light exposure. Subcutaneous injections of TP at 3 mg/mL were administered to induce BPH in rats. After 6 weeks, differing dosages (60 µg and 120 µg) of E 2 were administered subcutaneously. The prostate specimens were then dissected after euthanasia of the rats under anesthesia and the organ quotient measured. Some specimens were fixed and embedded in paraffin using histopathological methods, in order to measure the size of the glandular cavity and prostate epithelia. Other specimens were used to run SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for HKA activity using anti-HKA alpha antibody. Results: The data indicate significant hypertrophy of the luminal cells in rats with 3 mg TP (11 / 15 / 14) compared to the control (P-value 3 ̆c 0. 005). Furthermore, the experimental group with 3 mg TP (11 / 13 / 14) and 60 µg E 2 (1 / 13 / 15) showed inhibitory effects compared to TP-induced BPH (P-value 3 ̆c 0. 005). Lastly, the experimental group with 3 mg TP (11 / 13 / 14) and 120 µg E 2 (1 / 13 / 15) showed significant inhibitory effect compared to TP-induced BPH (P-value 3 ̆c 0. 005). However, the inhibitory effects of the 60 µg E 2 group were more significant than the inhibitory effects of the 120 µg E 2 group, suggesting the importance of maintaining a proper E 2 :TP ratio. Western blot analysis shows down-regulation of specific bands for HKA alpha subunit at 97 kDa for TP-induced BPH. Conclusions: Both the induction and inhibition of hypertrophic cells suggests that the prostate is under hormonal regulation. Furthermore, the proper E 2 :TP ratio plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of BPH. If the optimal ratio is not maintained, BPH may occur. Decreased HKA alpha expression in TP-induced BPH suggests that such enzymatic activity is androgen dependent. Such knowledge of E 2 :TP ratio in humans may help to prevent or cure BPH in the future...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} morning hypertension (MH) and T-peak to T-end interval (Tp-e interval) in patients with suspected coronary heart disease. Methods: Patients with typical symptoms of coronary heart disease were examined by ambulatory blood monitoring, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and coronary angiography, and were assigned to two groups {{on the basis of}} blood pressure: an MH group and a morning normotension (MN) group. The following data were collected <b>and</b> compared: basic characteristic, <b>Tp-e</b> interval, corrected <b>QT</b> (QTc) interval, echocardiography parameters, and Gensini score of the two groups. Results: Three hundred fifty-eight patients, {{with a mean age of}} 64 years (54. 1 % men), were divided into the MH group (n= 170) and the MN group (n= 188). Tp-e interval (84. 52 ± 14. 77 ms vs. 65. 19 ± 19. 03 ms, P< 0. 001), QTc interval (416. 21 ± 29. 59 ms vs. 401. 70 ± 36. 10 ms, P< 0. 001), left ventricular mass index (121. 42 ± 10. 97 g/m 2 vs. 105. 63 ± 17. 10 g/m 2, P< 0. 001), and Gensini score (72. 12 ± 32. 90 vs. 39. 47 ± 29. 32, P< 0. 001) were significantly increased in the MH group compared with the MN group. Morning systolic blood pressure (r= 0. 678, P< 0. 001), morning diastolic blood pressure (r= 0. 404, P< 0. 001), Gensini score (r= 0. 513, P< 0. 001), and left ventricular mass index (r= 0. 646, P< 0. 001) were correlated with Tp-e interval. Conclusion: Tp-e interval is correlated with morning systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in patients with coronary heart disease.

40|$|BackgroundType 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) {{is associated with}} increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac electrical inhomogeneity may be {{the leading cause of}} the increased arrhythmic risk in patients with T 2 DM. The peak {{and the end of the}} T wave (<b>Tp-e)</b> interval <b>and</b> associated Tp-e/QT ratio are promising measures of ventricular repolarization indicating transmural dispersion of repolarization. The aim of this study was to assess ventricular repolarization in patients with T 2 DM by using <b>Tp-e</b> interval, Tp-e/QT ratio <b>and</b> Tp-e/corrected QT interval (QTc) ratio. MethodsForty-three patients with T 2 DM and 43 healthy control subjects, matched by gender and age, were studied. All participants underwent electrocardiography (ECG) recording. PR, RR and QT intervals represents the ECG intervals. These are not abbreviations. In all literature these ECG intervals are written like in this text. Tp-e intervals were measured from 12 -lead ECG. Rate QTc was calculated by using the Bazett's formula. Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio were also calculated. ResultsMean Tp-e interval was significantly prolonged in patients with T 2 DM compared to controls (79. 4 ± 10. 3, 66. 4 ± 8. 1 ms, respectively; P< 0. 001). We also found significantly higher values of Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio in patients with diabetes than controls (0. 21 ± 0. 03, 0. 17 ± 0. 02 and 0. 19 ± 0. 02, 0. 16 ± 0. 02, respectively; P< 0. 001). There was no difference in terms of the other ECG parameters between the groups. ConclusionTp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio were prolonged in patients with T 2 DM.

40|$|Aim: Myocardial bridge (MB) is {{generally}} {{known as an}} asymptomatic and benign anomaly, however, it can cause serious clinical conditions such as exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia <b>and</b> sudden death. <b>Tp-e</b> interval is {{the distance between the}} peak {{and the end of the}} T wave in electrocardiography.

We have studied the effect of coronary angiographic features (the degree of stenosis and length of MB) of MB on myocardial repolarization parameters. Methods: The study group consisted of 53 patients with isolated MB and 58 patients with normal coronary arteries. Results: The QT interval and QTc were similar between the groups, however, Tp-e interval (92. 72 ± 14. 72 and 79. 59 ± 12. 12, respectively; p< 0. 001) and Tp-e/QT (0. 24 ± 0. 041 and 0. 21 ± 0. 025, respectively; p< 0. 001) and Tp-e/QTc (0. 22 ± 0. 037 and 0. 19 ± 0. 025, respectively; p< 0. 001) ratios were found to be significantly increased in MB group compared to the control group. In the comparison of the MB patients with critical and those with noncritical stenosis, Tp-e interval (100. 69 ± 10. 79, 80. 57 ± 11. 25, respectively; p< 0. 001) and Tp-e/QT (0. 266 ± 0. 033, 0. 219 ± 0. 037, respectively; p< 0. 001) and Tp-e/QTc (0. 244 ± 0. 029, 0. 196 ± 0. 027, respectively; p< 0. 001) ratios were higher in the MB with critical stenosis group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{concept that}} the {{interval}} between the peak (T(peak)) and the end (T(end)) of the T wave (T(p-e)) {{is a measure of}} transmural dispersion of repolarization time is widely accepted but has not been tested rigorously by transmural mapping of the intact heart. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the relationship of T(p-e) to transmural dispersion of repolarization by correlating local repolarization times at endocardial, midmural, and epicardial sites in the left and right ventricles with the T wave of the ECG. METHODS: Local activation times, activation-recovery intervals, and repolarization times were measured at 98 epicardial sites and up to 120 midmural and endocardial sites in eight open-chest dogs. In four of the dogs, long-term cardiac memory was induced by 3 weeks of ventricular pacing at 130 bpm because previous data suggest that, in this setting, delayed epicardial repolarization increases transmural dispersion. The other four dogs were sham operated. RESULTS: In sham dogs, T(p-e) was 41 +/- 2. 2 ms (X +/- SEM), whereas the transmural dispersion of repolarization time was 2. 7 +/- 4. 2 ms (not significant between endocardium and epicardium). Cardiac memory was associated with evolution of a transmural gradient of 14. 5 +/- 1. 9 ms (P <. 02), with epicardium repolarizing later than endocardium. The corresponding T(p-e) was 43 +/- 2. 3 ms (not different from sham). In combined sham <b>and</b> memory dogs, <b>T(p-e)</b> intervals did not correlate with transmural dispersion of repolarization times. In contrast, dispersion of repolarization of the whole heart (measured as the difference between the earliest and the latest moment of repolarization from all left and right ventricular, endocardial, intramural, and epicardial recording sites) did correlate with T(p-e) (P <. 0005, r = 0. 98), although the latter underestimated total repolarization time by approximately 35 %. The explanation for this finding is that parts of the heart fully repolarize before the moment of T(peak). CONCLUSION: T(p-e) does not correlate with transmural dispersion of repolarization but is an index of total dispersion of repolarizatio...|$|R
