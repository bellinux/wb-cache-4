50|$|Segregation {{to grain}} boundaries, for example, {{can lead to}} grain {{boundary}} fracture {{as a result of}} <b>temper</b> <b>brittleness,</b> creep embrittlement, stress relief cracking of weldments, hydrogen embrittlement, environmentally assisted fatigue, grain boundary corrosion, and some kinds of intergranular stress corrosion cracking. A very interesting and important field of study of impurity segregation processes involves AES of grain boundaries of materials. This technique includes tensile fracturing of special specimens directly inside the UHV chamber of the Auger Electron Spectrometer that was developed by Ilyin.Segregation to grain boundaries can also affect their respective migration rates, and so affects sinterability, as well as the grain boundary diffusivity (although sometimes these effects can be used advantageously).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Selecting and {{correctly}} {{heat treating}} an appropriate tool steel for {{production of a}} die {{is not a simple}} task. This paper points out defects which are encountered most frequently in dies when a poor-quality material or an inadequate heat treating schedule was selected or when the prescribed heat treating schedule was not followed. The most common deficiencies in semi-finished products from tool steels for die making include carbide banding and non-uniform microstructure with substantial variance in grain size. Incorrect tempering parameters are often used and the materials are thus treated in the region of <b>temper</b> <b>brittleness.</b> Cases of the above kind have been investigated by the laboratory at COMTES FHT in recent years and their summary is given in the text below...|$|E
40|$|Here is {{analyzed}} {{selection of}} the optimal technology for heat treatment during the reparation of the damaged forging dies. Those tools are manufactured from alloyed tool steels for operation at elevated temperatures. Those steels are prone to self-hardening, so in reparatory hard-facing they must be preheated, additionally heated and tempered. During the tempering, in temperature interval 500 - 600 °C, a secondary increase of hardness and decrease of impact toughness occurs, the so-called reversible <b>tempering</b> <b>brittleness.</b> Here is shown {{that it can be}} avoided by application of metallurgical and technological measures. Metallurgical measures assume adequate selection of steels. Since the considered steels are per se prone to <b>tempering</b> <b>brittleness,</b> we conducted experimental investigations to define the technological measures to avoid it. Tests on models were conducted: tempering from different temperatures, slow heating and cooling in still air. Hardness measurements showed that at 520 °C, the secondary increase of hardness occurs, with drop of the impact toughness. Additional hard-facing tests included samples tempered at various regimes. Samples were prepared for mechanical and metallographic investigations. Results presented illustrate influence of additional heat treatment on structure, hardness and mechanical properties of the hard-faced layers. This enabled establishing the possibility of avoiding the <b>tempering</b> <b>brittleness</b> through technological measures.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{paper is}} an attempt of {{reviewing}} the outlooks about the favourable influence of retained austeniteon fracture toughness of tool steels according to results of investigation concerning relations between temperingtemperature, hardness, fraction of retained austenite and fracture toughness. Design/methodology/approach: The tests were performed on the samples made of the 70 MnCrMoV 9 - 2 - 4 - 2 steel in which the fraction of retained austenite was changed by cold treatment and by changing the temperingtemperature. On the ground of analysis of dependencies between fraction of retained austenite, hardness, fracturetoughness and tempering temperature of hardened 70 MnCrMoV 9 - 2 - 4 - 2 steel the influence of retained austenite onfracture toughness of tested steel was investigated. Findings: was found that retained austenite remaining {{in the structure of}} tested steel after quenching increased itsfracture toughness on directly proportional way to its volume fraction. Advantageous influence of this phase wasalso found after tempering tested steel.

50|$|Eventually smiths {{learned that}} by adding {{an amount of}} carbon (added during {{smelting}} {{in the form of}} charcoal) to the iron, they could produce an improved alloy (now known as steel). By quenching (making the steel hard and brittle) and <b>tempering</b> (removing the <b>brittleness),</b> swords could be made that would suffer much less damage, and would spring back into shape if bent. It took a long time, however, before this was done consistently, and even {{until the end of the}} early medieval period, many swords were still unhardened iron. Several different methods of swordmaking existed in ancient times, including, most famously, pattern welding. Over time, different methods developed all over the world.|$|R
40|$|Unsteady {{temperature}} field was analyzed numerically {{on the large}} turbine rotor which was in tempering operation without introducing temper brittleness． Several combinations of values of the heat transfer coefficients were examined to observe those effect on the entire cooling rate and to obtain the most appropriate combination． Heat transfer from the outer surface of the rotor was dominant and almost controlled the entire cooling rate， even on the bore surface． The temperature of the bore surface remained still high in the <b>temper</b> <b>brittleness</b> region after {{the temperature of the}} outer surface cooled down far below that region． Hence，it was concluded that the test specimens which are cut out near the outer surface might mislead the stre㎎th evaluation unless the special care is made...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanism}} of brittleness due to slow cooling during quenching was experimentally investigated in 12 % Cr martensitic heat resistant steel. The mechanical property tests and {{microstructural characterization by}} SEM、?TEM and XRD were conducted. The results showed the impact toughness would decrease with the slowing of cooling rate during quenching, and the low cooling rate within the temperature range from 820 to 660 °C played {{a significant effect on}} the impact toughness. Different from the {{mechanism of}} <b>temper</b> <b>brittleness,</b> the main causes of embrittlement due to the slow cooling upon quenching were both the continuous precipitation of M 23 C 6 along prior austenite grain boundaries during the process of slow cooling and that of M 2 C along prior residual austenite film during tempering, and this kind of quench brittleness was nonreversal. 1...|$|E
40|$|<b>Temper</b> <b>brittleness</b> was induced in a 3140 steel {{specimen}} {{by means}} of an isothermal heat treatment in a salt bath, Changes in internal structure of ductile and embrittled specimens were studied using a highprecision X-ray dif fractometer. The resulting peak shapes showed (1) a slightly better resolution of the alpha doublet by the brittle specimen, (2) a relative peak displacement between similar lines in the ductile and brittle specimens, and (3) an asymmetry in some of the peak shapes. Based on the observed asymmetry of some of the diffraction peak shapes and published results of other workers using the electron microscope, it is suggested that the embritt lement is related to stacking faults in the crystal structure.

In {{the steel}} {{industry}} Sn is always regarded as harmful impurity element, one of "Five harmful elements", which affects the welding property and equality of steel product especially the equality of continuously cast bloom and causes hot brittleness, <b>temper</b> <b>brittleness,</b> crack and fracture. While Sn element also has a vital influence on free-cutting steel, electrical sheet, cast iron and stainless steel. NSSC developed ferritic stainless steel containing low Sn and Ni content improving the corrosion resistance performance and the workability significantly. So the Sn element, as cheap alternative adding element, can substitute for Cr and Ni. It's helpful to study the effect of tin in the iron and steel and develop new stainless steel products of high equality conserving chromium resources. In this way it will promote the variety and technique of stainless steel, ensure the independence on resources and conserve resources remarkably...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{increase}} comprehensive {{properties of}} cylinder steel, high-pressure cylinder steel 30 CrMo-M was developed {{on the basis}} of steel 30 CrMo. Tests and researches were made on factors which influence heat treatment properties, such as chemical composition, quenching temperature, and tempering temperature. The results indicated that the 30 CrMo-M steel has stable chemical composition, its strength rises with increase of carbon equivalent, and thus it has better relativity. When concentration of quenching liquid is 5 %, yield ratio of the steel can be guaranteed to be low, thus safety of cylinder is improved. Tempered between 570 ℃~ 622 ℃, the strength of the steel is increased and plasticity rises with increase of temperature. When tempered at 570 ℃, inner wall structure of cylinder contains tempering martensite, the strength is high but the plasticity is low. When tempered between 610 ℃~ 615 ℃, <b>temper</b> <b>brittleness</b> happens very easily and toughness is on the low side. The best heat treatment technology is: quenched at 930 ℃ with temperature holding for 40 minutes and quenching liquid concentration as 5 %, tempered at 580 ℃ with temperature kept for 90 minutes. The microstructure treated by this technology is tempered sorbite with higher strength, plasticity and toughness...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was a review of {{opinions}} molded within last 35 years on a part of steel cracking process played by retained austenite. Design/methodology/approach: Dependencies between volume fraction of retained austenite, its stability, hardness, fracture toughness, and tempering temperature of hardened 70 MnCrMoV 9 - 2 - 4 - 2 steel were determined. On the ground of analysis of those dependencies the influence of retained austenite on fracture toughness of tested steel was investigated. Findings: It was found that retained austenite remaining in the structure of tested steel after quenching increased its fracture toughness on directly proportional way to its volume fraction. Advantageous influence of this phase was also found after tempering tested steel at temperatures within the range of 120 - 400 °C. Research limitations/implications: The results of investigation presented in this paper may enrich and complement the knowledge about the part played by this phase in steel cracking process. It was pointed out that most beneficial influence of retained austenite exists when tested steel after hardening is low-tempered. At that moment the highest stabilization of the phase occurs. While at tempering temperatures above 220 °C it was indicated {{that it is possible to}} combine retained austenite transition and irreversible tempering brittleness. Practical implications: Research results presented in this paper let hope that know-how of such heat treatment, which would make possible to stabilize this phase in the structure of hardened steels, would contribute not only to restrain <b>temper</b> <b>brittleness</b> in these steels but even to complete elimination of this adverse phenomenon.
