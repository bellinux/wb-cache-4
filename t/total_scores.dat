500|$|After ten {{questions}} are completed, {{the final round}} of the game is the [...] "Jack Attack" [...] where all players compete against each other. Prior to the round, a brief clue is shown to the players to describe a relationship that they must match, for example [...] "BFF" [...] (Best friends forever). The game then shows one word or phrase, and then cycles through other phrases which the players must match. If players respond to the wrong phrase, they lose money; only the first player to buzz in at the correct time wins and earns money. [...] After seven such phrases, the <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> are added and the winner is determined.|$|E

Each question in this round is worth 500 points, with no penalty assessed for an incorrect answer. Only the two contestants standing at the podium may confer and answer the question. Two questions are asked to each team in this round. In the [...] "Chosen Three" [...] round, the contestants who were set aside from the previous round stand alone at their podiums, with their teammates standing in the area behind them. The host asks each contestant, in turn, a question with six possible answers, three of which are correct. The contestants then make three selections without conferring with the rest of their respective teams. Each individual correct answer is worth 1,000 points, thus, a total of 3,000 points are available to each team in this round. The two teams with the highest <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> advance to the final round, while the third-place team is eliminated and leaves with $2,500 for their charity.|$|E

2500|$|In paper 1, {{the format}} in {{previous}} years was that two passages were supplied, one in Vernacular Chinese and one in Classical Chinese, and candidates were required to answer questions mainly in words. In 2008, however, the second passage was a Chinese poem instead. Also, half of the <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> were from multiple choice questions, and in some questions, choices {{were said to be}} difficult to distinguish. For example, in question 5, the four choices were [...] "believable" [...] (可以相信), [...] "affirmative" [...] (肯定的是), [...] "proved by facts" [...] (事實證明) and [...] "undeniable" [...] (無可否認). Some teachers said that they could not even make the relevant decisions {{in a short period of}} time or said that the paper required deduction skills and common sense rather than Chinese knowledge, and some candidates said the paper was more like gambling than an examination. Some also commented that the passages were too difficult for CE level. Even a university professor admitted that he could not finish the exam in a reasonable amount of time. The first Vernacular Chinese passage was said to be of the difficulty of Form 7 Advanced Level Examination Chinese Language and Culture, and the second poem, Moonlight of Spring River (春江花月夜) in Tang Dynasty, was said to be of the difficulty of university Chinese. the HKESA replied that papers can be set in any format and style.|$|E
2500|$|The SAT {{has four}} sections: Reading, Writing and Language, Math (no calculator), and Math (calculator allowed). The test taker may {{optionally}} {{write an essay}} which, in that case, is the fifth test section. The total time for the scored portion of the SAT is three hours (or three hours and fifty minutes if the optional essay section is taken). Some test takers who are not taking the essay may also have a fifth section which is used, at least in part, for the pretesting of questions that may appear on future administrations of the SAT. (These questions {{are not included in}} the computation of the SAT score.) Two section scores result from taking the SAT: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, and Math. Section scores are reported on a scale of 200 to 800, and each section score is a multiple of ten. A total score for the SAT is calculated by adding the two section scores, resulting in <b>total</b> <b>scores</b> that range from 400 to 1600. There is no penalty for guessing on the SAT: scores are {{based on the number of}} questions answered correctly. In addition to the two section scores, three [...] "test" [...] scores on a scale of 10 to 40 are reported, one for each of Reading, Writing and Language, and Math. The essay, if taken, is scored separately from the two section scores.|$|E

2500|$|The girls move {{to their}} new groups after the re-evaluations. They start rehearsing for their [...] "Pick Me" [...] stage where Fantagio's Choi Yoo-jung, who was moved from group D to A, {{was chosen as the}} center. After the performance, Jang Keun-suk {{announced}} the departure of 3 trainees from the show and also announced that the last 37 contestants on the rankings will be eliminated in the next episode. The trainees start their second mission, which is group performances with live audience. They are given the debut songs of ten girl groups: Wonder Girls; [...] "Irony", KARA's [...] "Break It", Girls' Generation's [...] "Into the New World", After School's [...] "AH", 2NE1's [...] "Fire", 4Minute's [...] "Hot Issue", f(x)'s [...] "LA chA TA", SISTAR's [...] "Push Push", miss A's [...] "Bad Girl Good Girl", and Apink's [...] "I Don't Know".

This episode shows the groups rehearsing and assigning roles such as 'center', 'main vocal', 'second vocal', etc. Groups contain 4-5 members each.

5000|$|In {{technical}} terms, {{the pattern}} of scores by individual students to individual items is used to infer so-called scale locations of students, the [...] "measurements".
