40|$|International audienceThe {{energy and}} {{environmental}} performance is compared for buildings with and without <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls.</b> The indicator for environmental performance is a sum of primary operating energy for heating during winter and the annualized embodied energy consumed by using the <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls.</b> Two <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> are used at {{the south side of}} a "Mozart" house located in Lyon, France. The house satisfies the French thermal regulation. The performances of several constructions of <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> are studied. The annualized life cycle energy use by houses with <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> may be lower when the core material has lower density and lower embodied energy. For heating by electricity there are much higher values of the optimum thickness of the core layer and that of the primary energy consumption than that for heating by using natural gas. When the building with <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> is used, the annual final energy saving during heating is around 20 %. For the electrical heating and optimum core thickness, the energy ratio is around 6 and the energy payback time is around 8 years. For the natural gas heating these values are around 3, and around 18 years, respectively...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{misconception}} that <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> must be full height, completely blocking light and {{direct solar gain}} into the adjacent living space rather converting it into absorbed radiant heat that is then re-emitted as the room cools. In reality <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> can be built to whatever height suits {{the needs of the}} home owner, their reduced height simply reducing the solar absorption area and increasing direct light and heat gain area. Half-height <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> are a relatively simple solution that can greatly enhance the solar storage capacity of a passive solar home, whilst still allowing for views to the sun's winter direction.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the <b>Trombe</b> <b>wall</b> system. An unvented thermal storage wall (technically not a <b>Trombe</b> <b>wall)</b> captures solar energy on the exterior surface, heats up, and conducts heat to the interior surface, where it radiates from the interior wall surface to the indoor space later in the day. A water wall uses a type of thermal mass that consists of tanks or tubes of water used as thermal mass.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a new façade system that uses passive {{solutions}} {{in the search for}} energy efficiency. The differentials are the versatility and flexibility of the modules, which are important advantages of the system. The thermal performance of <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> and glazings and the daylighting performance of glazing were the key aspects analyzed in the results. Computational simulations were accomplished for the thermal performance of different arrangements of the modules with DesignBuilder software. The glazing daylighting performance was studied by means of Ecotect and Desktop Radiance programs and compared with the transmittance curves of glazings. Occupancy profile and internal gains were fixed according to the Portuguese reality for both studies. The main characteristics considered in this research were the use of two double glazings, four different climates in Portugal and one and two <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> in the façade. The results show an important reduction in the energy consumption with the use of <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> and double self-cleaning glazing in the façade, which also presented better daylighting performance.

40|$|Abstract — Thermal effects {{impact the}} flow around and within structures. This {{computational}} study assesses features {{that affect the}} heating and buoyancy, and thus, the resulting flow {{both internal and external}} to a building. Considerations include the importance of time of day, building materials, sky cover, etc. on the local thermal heating of a passive solar building. Such impacts are assessed using full thermal coupling between a building energy simulation model and a computational fluid dynamics model, including the effects of thermal radiation, conduction, and convection to analyze the impact of all natural heating, cooling, and flow mechanisms for both the interior and exterior. Unique features such as <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls</b> add to heat transfer mechanisms. Analysis is made for three separate seasonal conditions...|$|R
50|$|This {{collector}} is very responsive - {{in the sun}} it {{heats up}} rapidly and the air inside starts to convect. If the collector were to be directly connected to the building using a hole near the floor and a hole near the ceiling an indirect solar gain system would be created. One problem with this that, like <b>Trombe</b> <b>walls,</b> the heat would radiate back out at night, and a convection current would chill the room during the night. Instead, the air movement can be stopped using automatic dampers, {{similar to those used}} for ventilating foundation spaces in cold climates, or plastic film dampers, which work by blocking air flow in one direction with a very lightweight flap of plastic. The addition of the damper makes the design an efficient isolated solar gain system.|$|R
