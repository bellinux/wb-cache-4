5|$|Enterprise {{arrives at}} the Valakian homeworld, where they are met by Esaak, the Valakian {{director}} of a clinic, and Larr, a Menk orderly. T'Pol, Phlox, Archer, and Ensign Sato make {{a tour of the}} medical facility. Sato discovers that there is a second lesser-evolved yet unaffected race, the Menk, who live alongside the Valakians. Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to a cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} by Scholastic with Rick Riordan for The Lost Hero, Riordan was questioned about {{the whereabouts of}} Percy Jackson. The author hinted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> would be revealed as Jason's quest progressed. By {{the end of the}} book, he said that readers would have a good idea where the second book is going. On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would {{play a role in the}} book.|$|E
5|$|While {{going to}} meet Doggett and Scully, Wells gets shoved into a dominos game and while picking them up gets slashed on his right cheek from a man with the spider web tattoo on his hand. Wells tells Doggett and Scully that he is moving {{backwards}} in time and cannot recall the past few days. Doggett is skeptical, but Scully hears him out. Wells says {{there must be a}} reason for it and Scully suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> may already be within him. Studying the evidence of the case, Wells has a flash of the murder that reveals the knife in a hand with a spider web tattoo.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court {{noted that}} the Fifth Circuit agreed with Abramski's claim that falsifying the answer to Question 11.a is not {{considered}} material, if the true-buyer can legally buy and possess the gun. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split between the circuit courts, even though Abramski's defense had changed, and he now claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to Question 11.a is never material. Various parties filed amicus briefs supporting either side. Parties supporting Abramski included the National Rifle Association Civil Rights Defense Fund, and West Virginia and 25 other states, while others, like the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hawaii and 8 other states (plus the District of Columbia), filed amicus briefs supporting Abramski's conviction.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Kyle, Stan and Kenny watch America's Stupidest Home Videos; {{they hear}} there's a $10,000 grand prize for the stupidest home video. They decide {{to enter the}} {{competition}} with the video they made of Cartman. Cartman approaches Kyle and Stan (Kenny was dragged to a train track by Stan's go-cart and killed by an oncoming train) with the depressing news about his lack of funds to find out his real father. Stan and Kyle agree that if they win the video contest they will give Cartman the $3,000 needed for the DNA testing. Cartman is overjoyed, but quickly becomes extremely angry after seeing the aired video. Though they do not win the competition, as Stan's grandfather wins with a videotape he made of Kenny's death, they receive a $3,000 runner-up prize instead, which is still enough for the DNA test. Dr. Mephesto calls together Cartman, his mother and all potential fathers (including the 1989 Denver Broncos), when he gets the test results which is where Kenny comes back to life. When {{he is about to}} reveal the identity of Cartman's father, a narrator states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> will be revealed in the new South Park episode four weeks later, much to Cartman's annoyance and anger.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} {{pregnancy}} in adolescents is delicate {{and difficult to}} assess using sex education.

25|$|Ahmadiyya claims its {{objective}} to be {{the peaceful}} propagation of Islam with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the pen.

25|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{demonstration}} of Pythagoras' theorem, the dialogue takes an epistemological turn when the interlocutors begin to discuss the fundamental nature of knowledge. The general question asked is how one can claim to know something when one does not even know what knowledge is. Via the Socratic method, it is shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to the question posed is innateness – one possesses a priori knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The only {{difference}} between this case and the original trolley problem is that an extra piece of track has been added, which seems a trivial difference (especially since the trolley won't travel down it anyway). So, if we originally decided that it is permissible or necessary to flip the switch, intuition may suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> should not have changed. However, in this case, {{the death of the}} one actually is part of the plan to save the five.|$|E
25|$|In the {{discussion}} of special relativity, forces played {{no more than a}} background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run {{at the same rate as}} the clock at the origin. Is this really possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a global inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, local inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of ITER {{emphasize}} {{that the only way}} to test ideas for withstanding the intense neutron flux is to experimentally subject materials to that flux, which is one of the primary missions of ITER and the IFMIF, and both facilities will be vitally important to that effort. The purpose of ITER is to explore the scientific and engineering questions that surround potential fusion power stations. It is nearly impossible to acquire satisfactory data for the properties of materials expected to be subject to an intense neutron flux, and burning plasmas are expected to have quite different properties from externally heated plasmas. Supporters contend <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to these questions requires the ITER experiment, especially in the light of the monumental potential benefits.|$|E
25|$|According to Ahmadi Muslim belief, Jihad can {{be divided}} into three categories: Jihad al-Akbar (Greater Jihad) is that against the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; Jihad al-Kabīr (Great Jihad) refers to the {{peaceful}} propagation of Islam, with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the pen; Jihad al-Asghar (Smaller Jihad) is an armed struggle only to be resorted to in self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the Caliph. Ahmadi Muslims point out that as per Islamic prophecy, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad rendered Jihad in its military form as inapplicable in the present age as Islam, as a religion, is not being attacked militarily but through literature and other media, and therefore the response should be likewise. They believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> of hate should be given by love.|$|E
25|$|He {{studied a}} {{question}} analogous {{to that of}} the surface movement in a cup of coffee. What can we say, in general, about the trajectories on a surface animated by a constant flow? Poincaré discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> can be found in what we now call the topological properties in the area containing the trajectory. If this area is compact, i.e. both closed and bounded, then the trajectory either becomes stationary, or it approaches a limit cycle. Poincaré went further; if the area is of the same kind as a disk, as is the case for the cup of coffee, there must necessarily be a fixed point. This fixed point is invariant under all functions which associate to each point of the original surface its position after a short time intervalt. If the area is a circular band, or if it is not closed, has no fixed point. then this is not necessarily the case.|$|E
