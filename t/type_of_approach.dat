5|$|Metagenomic {{analysis}} pipelines use {{two approaches}} in the annotation of coding {{regions in the}} assembled contigs. The first approach is to identify genes based upon homology with genes that are already publicly available in sequence databases, usually by simple BLAST searches. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> is implemented in the program MEGAN4.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> is tissue engineering, using {{biomaterials}} to help scaffold {{and rebuild}} damaged tissues. Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or agarose and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose. They {{fall into two}} categories: hydrogels and nanofibers. These materials {{can also be used}} as a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues.|$|E

The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach,</b> but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E

2500|$|Many games fuse {{platform}} game fundamentals {{with elements}} of action-adventure games, such as The Legend of Zelda, or with elements of RPGs. Typically these elements include {{the ability to}} explore an area freely, with access to new areas granted by either gaining new abilities or using inventory items. Many 2D games in the Metroid and Castlevania franchises {{are among the most}} popular games of this sort, and so games that take this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> are often labeled as [...] "Metroidvania" [...] games.

2500|$|In this {{modified}} version of balanced scorecard design, managers select a few strategic objectives {{within each of the}} perspectives, and then define the cause-effect chain among these objectives by drawing links between them to create a [...] "strategic linkage model". [...] A balanced scorecard of strategic performance measures is then derived directly by selecting one or two measures for each strategic objective. [...] This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> provides greater contextual justification for the measures chosen, and is generally easier for managers to work through. [...] This style of balanced scorecard has been commonly used since 1996 or so: it is significantly different in approach to the methods originally proposed, and so {{can be thought of as}} representing the [...] "2nd generation" [...] of design approach adopted for balanced scorecard since its introduction.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of categorizing every {{individual}} into a specific subtype, cognitive neuropsychological approaches aim {{to identify the}} key language skills or [...] "modules" [...] that are not functioning properly in each individual. A person could potentially have difficulty with just one module, or {{with a number of}} modules. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> requires a framework or theory as to what skills/modules are needed to perform different kinds of language tasks. For example, the model of Max Coltheart identifies a module that recognizes phonemes as they are spoken, which is essential for any task involving recognition of words. Similarly, there is a module that stores phonemes that the person is planning to produce in speech, and this module is critical for any task involving the production of long words or long strings of speech. Once a theoretical framework has been established, the functioning of each module can then be assessed using a specific test or set of tests. In the clinical setting, use of this model usually involves conducting a battery of assessments, each of which tests one or a number of these modules. Once a diagnosis is reached as to the skills/modules where the most significant impairment lies, therapy can proceed to treat these skills.|$|E

2500|$|On 2 November 2002, a Euroceltic Fokker F-27 (registered G-ECAT) {{was coming}} into land on Runway 11, after a routine flight from Dublin, when it overran the runway. After landing {{nosewheel}} first almost {{halfway down the}} runway, the aircraft eventually came to rest with {{the nose of the}} aircraft in the sea, and the main landing gear on an embankment. Passengers were evacuated and there were no reported casualties. However the plane was declared a write-off by the company two weeks later, due to the saltwater damage to the cockpit. The cause of the accident was a [...] "fast, low approach, leading to the aircraft landing late, beyond the normal touch down point, thereby making it impossible to stop the aircraft on the remaining runway available". The pilot at the time had been placed under restrictions following a CAA audit of Euroceltic, as noted in paragraph 1.18.2 of the AAIU report. The chief pilot of Euroceltic [...] "was using an instructor tone and coaching" [...] the pilot during landing, as noted in paragraph 2.1 of the report. The AAIU report also notes in paragraph 2.1 that [...] "Whilst the meteorological conditions were difficult they were well within the limits for the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> and there was very little crosswind component" [...] and in paragraph 2.2 that [...] "there was no significant standing water on the runway during the landing".|$|E
2500|$|Class {{discovery}} analysis: This analytic approach, {{sometimes called}} unsupervised classification or knowledge discovery, tries to identify whether microarrays (objects, patients, mice, etc.) or genes cluster together in groups. Identifying naturally existing groups of objects (microarrays or genes) which cluster together can enable {{the discovery of}} new groups that otherwise were not previously known to exist. During knowledge discovery analysis, various unsupervised classification techniques can be employed with DNA microarray data to identify novel clusters (classes) of arrays. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> is not hypothesis-driven, but rather is based on iterative pattern recognition or statistical learning methods to find an [...] "optimal" [...] number of clusters in the data. Examples of unsupervised analyses methods include self-organizing maps, neural gas, k-means cluster analyses, hierarchical cluster analysis, Genomic Signal Processing based clustering and model-based cluster analysis. For some of these methods the user also has to define a distance measure between pairs of objects. Although the Pearson correlation coefficient is usually employed, several other measures have been proposed and evaluated in the literature. The input data used in class discovery analyses are commonly based on lists of genes having high informativeness (low noise) based on low values of the coefficient of variation or high values of Shannon entropy, etc. The determination of the most likely or optimal number of clusters obtained from an unsupervised analysis is called cluster validity. Some commonly used metrics for cluster validity are the silhouette index, Davies-Bouldin index, Dunn's index, or Hubert's [...] statistic.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, using the {{kinematic}} approach, we can construct models that incorporate the present velocity and geometry of specific subduction zones {{to compare the}} models with observations.

Thus, we believe that these two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>approaches</b> are complementary to each other and that an understanding <b>of</b> both <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approaches</b> will lead to further understanding of subduction zones.|$|R
