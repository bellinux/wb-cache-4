50|$|One {{advantage}} of ultrasonic flow meters {{is that they}} can effectively measure the flow rates {{for a wide variety of}} fluids, as long as the speed of sound through that fluid is known. For example, ultrasonic flow meters are used for the measurement of such diverse fluids as liquid natural gas (LNG) and blood. One can also calculate the expected speed of sound for a given fluid; this can be compared to the speed of sound empirically measured by an ultrasonic flow meter for the purposes of monitoring the quality of the flow meter's measurements.

Speeding in built-up areas invariably carries higher fines than outside city limits. While fines for minor offenses tend to be moderate, speeds in excess of 20 km/h above the limit in built-up areas result in distinctly higher fines and points on the driver's license, and depending on the speed at which the offender was clocked, may lead to a driving ban of at least one month.|$|E

Any deviations, such as changes in grade, drag, wind speed or even using a different grade of fuel (for example an ethanol blend) are corrected by the controller making a compensating adjustment to the fuel valve open position, which is the manipulated variable.

40|$|The {{speed of}} gravity is an {{important}} universal constant. But, {{it has not been}} directly known with experiment or observation. The explanations for it are contradicted with each other. Here, it is presented that the interaction and propagation of the gravitational field could be tested and understood by comparing <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> <b>speed</b> of gravitational force with <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> <b>speed</b> of Coulomb force. A design to measure the speeds of gravitational and Coulomb force is presented. From satellite motions, it is observed that the speed of gravitational force is larger than the speed of light in a vacuum.

30|$|Another {{source of}} {{information}} to assist with the classification is the speed profile itself: the maximum speeds within a given profile can be compared against a database of maximum line speeds for routes within a network to help determine location.

30|$|Some {{things may}} be noted from these results. Firstly, {{in this case}} the speed is mainly governed by the speed limits. Next, there are six {{instances}} where the curvature affects the speed greatly: four in first part (0.32, 0.43, 2.2 and 2.7 km) and two in final part (14.9 and 15.6 km). In all cases, <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> <b>speed</b> is lower than the simulated one, perhaps because the acceleration limit needs better tailoring (ay 0 = 0.2 g was used) or because the curvature estimate is inaccurate. Another reflection is that <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> <b>speed</b> is at its lowest right before the curve, not in it. This likely reflects a property of the give-way sign in intersections: to avoid stopping completely, the driver controls his or her speed appropriately. This mechanism has not been modelled, but could be since the OC-format provides information about give-way sign locations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} five {{techniques for}} estimating vehicle speeds using the digital output {{produced by a}} 2 m by 1. 5 m single inductive loop detector sampled every 250 ms. The accuracy of each technique was then assessed on two further 2 m by 1. 5 m loops fitted in single carriageways and two 2 m by 6. 5 m loops spread over two carriageways. One-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests showed that there were highly {{significant differences between the}} estimation techniques in the mean deviations from <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> <b>speeds</b> over all four detectors during the peak period (08 : 00 - 08 : 50).

Settling on one technique, power regression of average loop-occupancy time per vehicle (ALOTPV) data reduced this to 22. 7 % based on three estimates. The poor results obtained from detector 3214 KI (MAPD of 38. 9 %), situated immediately downstream from a signalised pedestrian crossing, indicate that estimation accuracy depends crucially on the match between the characteristics of the detector used for training and those used for testing. Despite the inaccuracies returned by some of the techniques, it was still possible to distinguish free-flow conditions and periods of queuing. The importance of estimation accuracy was not addressed...|$|R
