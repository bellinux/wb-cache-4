ABSTRACT: The {{rock salt}} {{production}} in Romania {{has a long}} tradition since Roman Empire times. Today the salt is produced in underground mines and as salt in brine. The total production is around 2. 6 mln Mg per year. Contemporary salt mining combines the rock salt exploitation with tradition by creating <b>touristic</b> <b>routes,</b> museums and sanatories in old mining openings. Three of several mines producing rock salt and brine are presented: Salina Praid, Salina Targu Ocna i Salina Cacica. The mines were visited by Polish Salt Mining Association (PSGS) during geological and mining seminar which took place in Romania from 10 th to 14 th July 2009.

This methodology has been tested in the research project “Cilento Labscape: An integrated model for the activation of a Living Lab in the National Park of Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni”, which was conducted in the Cilento National Park (Southern Italy). The aim of the methodology is to find alternative <b>touristic</b> <b>routes</b> {{for the promotion of}} the Park. The different steps in the process will be described, as will the employment of multiple tools/techniques (interviews, GIS tools, Semantic Analysis, and Geo-Statistical Analysis) to improve the reliability of the decision-making process. The most relevant results of the methodology will also be outlined in terms of the transition from the identification of the perceived landscape’s values to the acknowledgement of the shared values, and their consequent employment for the outlining of new thematic itineraries for the Park. To realise sustainable territorial strategies and preserve the landscape through bottom-up decision-making processes, the different local communities need to gain a new awareness of their identity shared values and make an active contribution towards promoting and managing their site-specific resources...|$|R

All these indicators were extracted from the database of the National Institute of Statistics. Generally, an increase in time of the number of tourists is found, but also a certain decrease during the last two-three years, except for some groups of destinations which show a rather peculiar and interesting dynamics. Thus, the tourism in the resorts of the seaside area have registered an accentuated decrease during the last four years, especially for the foreign tourists, that reflects a change in their options. On the other hand, the tourism for the category of destination “other localities and <b>touristic</b> <b>routes</b> (which excludes the resorts of the spa, seaside, and mountain areas, as well as the city of Bucharest and all the county capital cities) has shown a remarkable growth during the whole considered time interval, indicating an increase of the interest of the tourists (both Romanians and foreigners) for the cultural and rural tourism. </span...|$|R

The Arieşului Basin {{is characterized by a}} substantial touristic potential that is capitalized in four areas of distinctive, yet complementary touristic heritage. The first area is extended around the city of Turda, an area that has benefited from significant investments (like the rearrangement of the Turda Salt Mine) which led to {{a significant increase in the}} number of tourists. The second area, the Trascău Depression, is characterized by the specific touristic offer attracting a loyal and constant clientele. The area overlapping the Arieşului Middle Basin displays a great potential for religious and cultural tourism. Its assets can be included in thematic routes, connecting them to the similar sites in Ţara Moţilor, the fourth identified area which is characterized by the great number of accommodation units, and the most consistent touristic flows. The Roşia Montană-Abrud micro-area stands out due to the specific cultural and touristic assets and to the specific touristic phenomenon developed by the efforts of the local community and NGOs involved in the revival of the location and inspite of the extremely controversial mining project and the obstacles raised by the local authorities.

The sacred objects and the routes to them formed sacred topography of Alania. They can be used as the centerpieces of the museum and tourist routes. The alani settlements situated along the roads can be the main elements of expositions. Revealing and preserving spacial structure and historic connections between the objects of the main exposition should be the basis of our conception of musefication of the historic and cultural landscape of Medieval Alania.

40|$|For many years, the Salt Mine in Bochnia has {{conducted}} the extraction and restructuring of underground working to obtain new <b>touristic</b> <b>routes.</b> The works generate {{a large amount}} of rock salt material, colloquially called “salt debris”, containing a large part of silty minerals. Due to the large concentration of NaCl which constitutes a threat to the environment, the salt debris may only be stored at hazardous material dumps. This is why the mine works towards the industrial use of the material. Currently, the debris is used to produce a stabilizing backfill mixture that is used for filling the liquidated “Moszczenica” shaft. The liquidation shall be completed in the beginning of 2018 and to continue the management of the salt debris, the mine plans to leach it in a newly constructed system and the saturated brine obtained in the process shall be introduced to underground workings. The paper presents the results of semi-industrial tests of leaching intensity of salt debris, depending on the graining and the time taken by the process. The tests were conducted for three grain classes of the salt debris (0 - 6, 0 - 10 and 0 - 20 mm), at a temperature of 15 °C. The kinetic models of the process has been presented for the obtained results. The obtained results shall be used for the optimization of the operation of the future industrial system and shall be treated as input data for the automation control system...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, museums have {{transformed}} their role from restricted high-class mausoleums to popular attractions {{along with other}} leisure activities for both local and <b>touristic</b> <b>routes.</b> Hence, they have to relate with the socio-economic environment in similar ways as for-profit organizations, concerning the sustainability of their operations, and to innovate to achieve excellence in their mission of serving the society with socio-cultural and educational purposes. While museums have many ways to innovate, the dissemination of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) in this field has recently received some attention for their influence and the possibilities those tools offer to enhance innovative strategies. ICTs are found in most museums operations, both inside and outside its walls, being used by the work team, users/visitors, the market, and the environment in general. Those tools can help from internal procedures, to exhibition design, and customer relationship management. Despite recent researches, however, our understanding of the different functions played by ICTs for the innovative activities and economic performance of museum organizations is still limited. The aim of this thesis is to investigate further how museums make use of ICTs in order to execute and achieve success in their innovative projects and goals. Based on the existing literature, the thesis presents a new typology of ICTs’ use in museums dividing technologies according to their characteristics, objective, and place of use. This typology is later confronted with empirical results to investigate the impression visitors have about the relevance of ICTs in promoting innovation...|$|R
40|$|O Turismo é um fenômeno capaz de construir e reorganizar o espaço geográfico. Ao inserir-se no espaço o Turismo resgata valores culturais e sociais, fortalece noções ambientais e cria mecanismos que dinamizam a economia de um lugar. Entretanto, para desencadear essa rede de relações, o Turismo necessita da articulação entre as políticas públicas, o setor privado e a comunidade local e depende da inter-relação com diversas ciências. O presente trabalho tem como objetivo {{principal}} realizar uma análise da construção do espaço para o Turismo. Os municípios de Santa Maria e Silveira Martins estão localizados na Borda da Bacia do Paraná entre a Depressão Central o Rebordo e o Planalto da Serra Geral, no Estado do Rio Grande do Sul. Para o desenvolvimento deste trabalho, foram consultados diversos autores que abordam e discutem a temática da Geografia do Turismo, categorias espaço e território, e o papel do poder público no desenvolvimento regional/local para dar suporte teórico nas discussões dos resultados. A metodologia utilizada foi a pesquisa teórica, a consulta a uma ampla bibliografia que norteiam os temas propostos e a coleta de dados. Esses dados foram obtidos por meio de pesquisas de campo na Rota Turística Gastronômica de Santa Maria e Silveira Martins, de visitas pré-estabelecidas, de leitura em jornais locais, de registro de imagens em máquina digital, mapeamento de alguns atrativos com o uso do Global Position System Leica GS 20 e de anotações em caderneta de campo. Na discussão dos resultados, foi possível verificar que a Rota Turística Gastronômica se enquadra na modalidade de turismo rural e apresenta nas rugosidades que se misturam no espaço para representar a importância da rota como um forte produto turístico da região Central do Rio Grande do Sul. Porém, é necessária a ação integrada da comunidade local permeada por um planejamento integrado do município de Santa Maria com o de Silveira Martins, de forma que se fortaleçam os laços na Rota Turística Gastronômica e que dessa forma contribua para aumentar a economia e melhorar qualidade de vida da população local. Tourism is {{a phenomenon}} conveyed in the feasibility of transforming and reorganizing geographic space. Tourism reassures cultures and social values, strengthens environmental notions and creates mechanisms to make the economy of a specific place more dynamic. In order to unleash this net of relationships, Tourism needs the articulation among public policies, private sector, and local community; depending on the interrelation with many sciences. The following work aimed mainly to conduct an analysis on {{the transformation of the}} space of the municipalities Santa Maria and Silveira Martins for the Tourism at the Gastronomic <b>Touristic</b> <b>Route</b> of Santa Maria and Silveira Martins. This area was situaded at the Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil at the borther of the Paraná Basin. Many authors approaching and discussing the subject of Tourism Geography, categories space and territory, as well as the role of the public power in the regional/local development have been consulted to develop the work and support it. The methodology used was the theoretical research, the study of a wide bibliography guiding the proposed topics and the collection of data. These data were obtained through field researches in the Gastronomic <b>Touristic</b> <b>Route</b> of Santa Maria and Silveira Martins, with pre set visits, reading of local newspapers, and photography storage, mapping of some attractive {{with the use of a}} Leica Global Position System and notes in a field record. In the empirical analysis of the Gastronomic <b>Touristic</b> <b>Route,</b> it was perceived that most of the offer of leisure and Tourism already existed before the establishment of the route, even though it was not organized as a touristic product. With the signing of a protocol of intentions between the two City Halls of Santa Maria and Silveira Martins, the route was established in 2005. In 2008 the Association of the Gastronomic <b>Touristic</b> <b>Route</b> was established to act in the planning and management of the route. In the discussion of the results, it was possible to notice that the Gastronomic <b>Touristic</b> <b>Route</b> presents distinct territorialities that set though many uses: local community, private sector, and public sector. The harsh and transformations of the space were important throughout the years to consolidate the route as a strong touristic product of the Central portion of the RS.

Geoparks, mining parks, ecomuseums, geosites, geotrails or mining trails are located in diverse areas and based on locally developed different projects. The main challenge {{of this paper is to}} provide a tool for connecting these resources on a transnational basis, through the revaluation of their history, establishment of new routes equipped with multimedia content and the promotion of an integrated network of websites. The history of geology, mineralogy and mining will provide a link between geosites and mines across the Alps for example explored by the same scientist in the 19 th century, facilitate transfer of the geological and mineralogical knowledge as well as create new thematic trails and 'historical geosites' for improving the impact on transnational cultural tourism related to the Earth sciences. The project will undertake a new interdisciplinary approach in order to increase the valorization of the geological cultural heritage through the history of geosciences and mining. The aim is to define, create, coordinate and promote a network of routes based on a new concept of integrated cultural tourism, which will enhance traditional sectors of cultural heritage and scientific education, as well as the existing networks of alpine hiking trails. Within this context the history of geological travels, explorations and observations in the Alps from the 16 th until the 20 th century, which significantly contributed to the development of the Earth sciences, will be the basis of the innovative definition of "historical geosite" in order to identify new cultural <b>touristic</b> <b>routes</b> in the Alpine area...|$|R
