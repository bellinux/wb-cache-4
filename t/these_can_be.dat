5|$|Consonants and vowel {{segments}} {{combine to}} form syllables, {{which in turn}} combine to form utterances; <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically, these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, that are visible in a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulance}} – The {{most common}} type of ambulance, which provide care to patients with an acute illness or injury. <b>These</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> road-going vans, boats, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft (known as air ambulances) or even converted vehicles such as golf carts.|$|E
5|$|Fixed-wing {{aircraft}} – <b>These</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{used for}} either acute emergency care {{in remote areas}} (such as in Australia, with the 'Flying Doctors'), for patient transport over long distances (e.g. a re-patriation following an illness or injury in a foreign country), or transportation between distant hospitals. Helicopter and fixed-wing ambulances are discussed in greater detail at air ambulance.|$|E

5|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of gross anatomy, the cerebellar cortex {{appears to be a}} homogeneous sheet of tissue, and, from {{the viewpoint}} of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet appear to have the same internal structure. There are, however, a number of respects in which the structure of the cerebellum is compartmentalized. There are large compartments that are generally known as zones; <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> divided into smaller compartments known as microzones.|$|E
5|$|In addition, larger organs may use unison off couplers, {{which prevent}} the stops pulled in a {{particular}} division from sounding at their normal pitch. <b>These</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used in combination with octave couplers to create innovative aural effects, and {{can also be used}} to rearrange the order of the manuals to make specific pieces easier to play.|$|E
5|$|Patient {{transport}} ambulance – A vehicle, {{which has}} the job of transporting patients to, from or between places of medical treatment, such as hospital or dialysis center, for non-urgent care. <b>These</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> vans, buses or other vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Propagation is by seed, though <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{difficult}} to extract from the follicles. Seeds {{do not require}} any treatment before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate. Cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true. Cuttings are slow to strike. Attempts to graft B.coccinea have met with little success.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction is {{generally}} by allogamy (cross-pollination) and Hippeastrum may be propagated by seed or offset bulbils (bulblets), although commercial ventures use in vitro techniques, or splitting of the bulb into sections. The genus has been intensely bred and cultivated {{since the early}} nineteenth century to produce large colourful showy flowers. In temperate climes <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> placed outside in the summer, and after a dormancy period, be induced to rebloom inside in the winter.|$|E

There are also Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from active galactic nuclei, those can be detected by ground-based detectors via their particle showers.|$|E

5|$|The parlous {{state of}} the children's health is {{apparent}} when at one point, 400 were suffering from dysentery, 300 had measles, 200 had typhoid, 200 had diphtheria and another 100 had mumps. Many children were also suffering from scurvy due to the poor diet. Monthly mortality figures were: July– 153; August– 216; September– 67; and October– 8. To <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> added five children who died in hospital in Zagreb, {{for a total of}} 449.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} the {{taxonomy}} of the genus, {{as the number of}} accepted species varies from 13 to 30. The five domesticated species are Cucurbita argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.maxima, C.moschata, and C.pepo. All of <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> treated as winter squash because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months; however, C.pepo includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash.|$|E

Snoopy and Woodstock are characters from the Peanuts Gang comic strips written by Charles M. Schulz. Snoopy <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen playing baseball, having a cookout, lifting weights, surfing, walking the beach, riding a bike, jumping hurdles, and listening to music. <b>These</b> <b>cans</b> <b>were</b> very popular among buyers. <b>These</b> images <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen on regular A&W cream soda as well as Diet A&W cream soda cans.|$|R
5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). <b>These</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E
5|$|Additionally {{there are}} often {{transient}} phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses. In the case of solar eclipses <b>these</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and arching. At the same time there were increasing influences from English and continental European designs. <b>These</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in the Romanesque chevron pattern on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral. St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons that had worked at Durham. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, Jedburgh and St Andrews.|$|E
