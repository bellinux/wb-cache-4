500|$|The U.S. Wonderbra rollout {{included}} {{events with}} Eva Herzigová in New York's Times Square. The advertisements were toned down {{in comparison to}} the earlier UK campaign. The U.S. print and billboard advertising showed models wearing only the Wonderbra. Underneath read slogans such as [...] "who cares if it's a bad hair day" [...] and [...] "look me in the eyes and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love me." [...] The $25 Million campaign worked in conjunction to the ongoing media interest in the bra. Although Playtex promoted the authenticity of their [...] "One and Only Wonderbra", the rapid introduction of competitive products meant that the overall U.S. market benefited from a 43% increase in push-up bra sales by the end of 1994.|$|E
500|$|When Athens was liberated in October 1944, Harold Macmillan visited Princess Andrew and {{described}} her as [...] "living in humble, {{not to say}} somewhat squalid conditions". In a letter to her son, she admitted {{that in the last}} week before liberation she had had no food except bread and butter, and no meat for several months. By early December the situation in Athens had far from improved; Communist guerillas (ELAS) were fighting the British for control of the capital. As the fighting continued, Princess Andrew was informed that her husband had died, just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising. They had not seen each other since 1939. During the fighting, to the dismay of the British, she insisted on walking the streets distributing rations to policemen and children in contravention of the curfew order. When told that she might have been shot by a stray bullet, she replied [...] "they <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't hear the shot that kills you and in any case I am deaf.

If one day they <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> say mass, I shall believe it just the same." [...] That same year André Breton wrote about Picasso's poetry for the French artistic and literary journal Cahiers d'Art, wherein Breton exclaimed that: [...] "Whole pages appear in bright variegated hues like a parrots' feathers." [...] Penrose describes how [...] "..words have been applied as a painter uses colour from his brush." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July, Richardson sent Hill a {{complete}} [...] "design" [...] of the story, and asked Hill to try again, but Hill responded, [...] "It is impossible, after the wonders you have shown in Pamela, to question your infallible {{success in this}} new, natural, attempt" [...] and that [...] "you must give me leave to be astonished, when you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have finished it already". However, the novel was not complete to Richardson's satisfaction until October 1746. Between 1744 and 1746, Richardson tried to find readers who could help him shorten the work, but his readers {{wanted to keep the}} work in its entirety.

2500|$|Chesterton's {{fence is}} the {{principle}} that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton’s 1929 book The Thing: Why I am a Catholic, in the chapter, [...] "The Drift from Domesticity": [...] "In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists {{in such a case}} a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away." [...] To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: [...] "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it." ...|$|E
