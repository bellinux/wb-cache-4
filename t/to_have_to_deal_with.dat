25|$|This {{was just}} as well, because Northcote was the first Australian Governor-General <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> {{political}} instability. In doing this, he sought {{the advice of the}} Chief Justice of the newly created High Court of Australia, Sir Samuel Griffith. In April 1904 the Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin, resigned, and was succeeded in quick succession by the Labor leader Chris Watson, the Free Trade leader George Reid and then Deakin again. Both Watson and Reid asked Northcote to dissolve Parliament before their resignations, and in both cases he refused. At this time no-one doubted that the Governor-General had a discretion in these cases. It is a measure of Northcote's standing that all these leaders respected his decisions.|$|E

A more mixed review came from Ryan E.C.

Both Christopher R.

Breihan, however, praised the singer's falsetto vocals as [...] "a thing to behold". Melissa Locker of Time magazine stated that the singer sang [...] "slightly obnoxiously" [...] in [...] "No Angel".

30|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> {{with highly}} nonlinear dynamics that spans a large range in plasma parameters, the numerical simulations {{also need to}} follow phenomena that occur across multiple physical scales. For example, in the MHD paradigm, jet acceleration is an intrinsically inefficient process that requires a few thousand gravitational radii to reach equipartition of the energy fluxes (Komissarov et al. 2007; Barkov and Komissarov 2008) (purely hydrodynamical mechanisms can however be far more efficient (Aloy and Rezzolla 2006)). Jet-environment interactions like the prominent HST- 1 feature of the radio-galaxy M 87 (Biretta et al. 1989; Stawarz et al. 2006; Asada and Nakamura 2012) occur on scales of ∼ 5 × 10 ^ 5 gravitational radii. Hence, for a self-consistent picture of accretion and ejection, jet formation and recollimation due to interaction with the environment [see, e.g., Mizuno et al. (2015)], numerical simulations must capture horizon-scale processes, as well as parsec-scale interactions with an overall spatial dynamic range of ∼ 105. The computational cost of such large-scale grid-based simulations quickly becomes prohibitive. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques promise an effective solution for problems where {{it is necessary to}} resolve small and large scale dynamics simultaneously.|$|R
