25|$|The band {{is not in}} {{competition}} with other Christian bands. We feel we are competing with Journey, Styx and REO Speedwagon. We {{need to be aware}} of them, because <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> to see Petra go to see those bands as well. We are being very naïve if we don't keep that in mind. We need to have a light system, sound system and presentation that will be competitive with those groups.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{being on}} The Biggest Loser Hickerson has been {{traveling}} around {{the country as a}} motivational speaker. He has been speaking mostly at churches because he says [...] "I want to talk to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> from where I come from, the people who are down there fighting the battle every single day of life, that are trying to focus on the things they want." ...|$|E

2500|$|All <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come,</b> as {{in times}} past, to {{the feast of}} Toci, come on the pretext of Saint Ann, but since the word [...] is ambiguous, and they respect the olden ways, it is {{believable}} that they come more for the ancient than the modern. And thus, also in this place, idolatry appears to be cloaked {{because so many people}} come from such distant lands without Saint Ann's ever having performed any miracles there. It is more apparent that it is the ancient Toci rather than Saint Ann [...]|$|E
2500|$|Keane caused {{controversy}} in November 2000, when he criticised sections of United supporters after the Champions League victory over Dynamo Kyiv at Old Trafford. He {{complained about the}} lack of vocal support given by some fans when Dynamo were dominating the game, stating, [...] "Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans. But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch. I don't think some of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> to Old Trafford can spell 'football', never mind understand it." [...] Keane's comments started a debate in England about the changing atmosphere in football grounds, and the term [...] "prawn sandwich brigade" [...] is now part of the English football vocabulary, referring to people who attend football games or claim to be fans of football because it is fashionable rather than due to any genuine interest in the game.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the ensuing}} years, Texans both {{encouraged}} and developed the institution with remarkable vigor, turning Texas from a society with slaves into a [...] "Slave Society".

He thinks there's no harm in doing magic things for his own family, and he made me out of glass because the meat cats drink too much milk.

6000|$|He {{asked me}} to do one other thing for him--which it cost me a hard {{struggle}} to comply with. He said, [...] "Let my grave be forgotten.

[...] When I tried to plead with him to alter his resolution, he became for the first, and only time, violently agitated. I could not bear to see it; and I gave way. Nothing but a little grass mound marks the place of his rest. In time, the tombstones will rise round it.

I should advise you when you get there to hire a house in Wellington, where you can leave your wife and daughter while you examine the various districts and see which offer the greatest advantages. If you do not feel equal to it yourself, let your son go in your place. He is, I think, a sharp young fellow, and not likely to be easily taken in. At any rate, when he has made his report as to the places that seem most suitable, you can go and see their relative advantages before purchasing.|$|E

It has been tried again and again, and failed. You have borrowed money for the Church's present needs. When that is gone I predict that you will find it difficult to get more." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{arrived at}} length at the pond. There {{was a little}} village there, upon {{the shore of the}} pond. The reason why there {{happened}} to be a village there, was this: A stream of water, which came down from among the mountains, emptied into the pond here, and, very near where it emptied, it fell over a ledge of rocks, making a waterfall, where the people had built some mills. Now, where there are mills, there must generally be a blacksmith's shop, to mend the iron work when it gets broken, and to repair tools. There is often a tavern, also, for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> to the mills; and then there is generally a store or two; for wherever people have to come together, for any business, there {{is a good place to}} open a store, to sell them what they want to buy.
