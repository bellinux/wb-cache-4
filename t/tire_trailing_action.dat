40|$|Tire {{properties}} play {{an important}} role in two-wheeled vehicle dynamics. Hence, tire properties have to be measured both to compare objectively the performances of different tires and to develop tire models that are necessary for multi-body simulation. The measurement of motorcycle tires requires particular testing facilities because the camber angle (which is the angle between the symmetry plane of the tire and the plane perpendicular to the road surface) reaches large values (> 50 °) and has a large influence on the forces and torques exerted by the road on the tire. In particular in many actual conditions the lateral force due to camber (camber force) may be larger than the sideslip force. The component of the yaw moment due to camber (twisting torque) does not tend to align and in many conditions may be larger than the self-aligning moment due to <b>tire</b> <b>trail...</b>|$|R

40|$|Secreted protein acidic {{and rich}} in {{cysteine}} (SPARC) is a multi-functional protein which modulates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. In cancer cells, SPARC behaves as a tumor promoter {{in a number}} of tumors, but it can also act as a tumor suppressor factor. Our previous results showed that the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55, 212 - 2 (WIN), a potent cannabinoid receptor agonist, is able to sensitize osteosarcoma MG 63 cells to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) -induced apoptosis which is accompanied with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -stress induction and the increase in autophagic markers. In the present investigation, we studied the role of SPARC in WIN/TRAIL-induced apoptosis demonstrating that WIN increased the level of SPARC protein and mRNA in a time-dependent manner. This event was functional to WIN/TRAIL-dependent apoptosis as demonstrated by RNA interfering analysis which indicated that SPARC-silenced cells were less sensitive to cytotoxic effects induced by the combined treatment. Our experiments also demonstrate that SPARC interacts with caspase- 8 thus probably favoring its translocation to plasma membrane and the activation of extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In conclusion, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, our results are the first to show that WIN-dependent increase in the level of SPARC plays a critical role in sensitizing osteosarcoma cells to <b>TRAIL</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Dysregulation of many {{apoptotic}} related {{genes and}} androgens are {{critical in the}} development, progression, and treatment of prostate cancer. The differential sensitivity of tumour cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis can be mediated by the modulation of surface TRAIL receptor expression related to androgen concentration. Our previous results led to the hypothesis that downregulation of TRAIL-decoy receptor DcR 2 expression following androgen deprivation would leave hormone sensitive normal prostate cells vulnerable to the cell death signal generated by TRAIL via its pro-apoptotic receptors. We tested this hypothesis under pathological conditions by exploring the regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis related to their death and decoy receptor expression, as also to hormonal concentrations in androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer, LNCaP, cells. Results In contrast to androgen-insensitive PC 3 cells, decoy (DcR 2) and death (DR 5) receptor protein expression was correlated with hormone concentrations and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. Silencing of androgen-sensitive DcR 2 protein expression by siRNA led to {{a significant increase in}} TRAIL-mediated apoptosis related to androgen concentration in LNCaP cells. Conclusions The data support the hypothesis that hormone modulation of DcR 2 expression regulates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, giving insight into cell death induction in apoptosis-resistant hormone-sensitive tumour cells from prostate cancer. <b>TRAIL</b> <b>action</b> and DcR 2 expression modulation are potentially of clinical value in advanced tumour treatment. </p...|$|R
40|$|TNF-related {{apoptosis}}-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a tumor-selective apoptosis inducer and {{has been}} shown to be promising for treating various types of cancers. However, the application of TRAIL is greatly impeded by the resistance of cancer cells to its action. Studies show that overexpression of some critical pro-survival proteins, such as survivin, is responsible for TRAIL resistance. In this study, we found that Aplysin, a brominated compound from marine organisms, was able to restore the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL both in vitro and in vivo. Aplysin was found to enhance the tumor-suppressing capacity of TRAIL on several TRAIL-resistant cancer cell lines. TRAIL-induced apoptosis was also potentiated in A 549 and MCF 7 cells treated with Aplysin. Survivin downregulation was identified as a mechanism by which Aplysin-mediated TRAIL sensitization of cancer cells. Furthermore, the activation of p 38 MAPK was revealed in Aplysin-treated cancer cells, and its inhibitor SB 203580 was able to abrogate the promoting effect of Aplysin on the response of cancer cells to <b>TRAIL</b> <b>action,</b> as evidenced by restored survivin expression, elevated cell survival and reduced apoptotic rates. In conclusion, we provided evidence that Aplysin acts as a sensitizer for TRAIL and its effect on p 38 MAPK/survivin pathway may partially account for this activity. Considering its low cytotoxicity to normal cells, Aplysin may be a promising agent for cancer treatment in combination with TRAIL...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAs {{a single}} signal, retinoids induce {{terminal}} differentiation. This implies that they activate differentiation and apoptosis in a temporally defined {{order to allow}} expression of the differentiated phenotype well before death. We report that two apparently contradictory retinoid-induced programs {{have the capacity to}} define cellular life span. Anti-apoptotic factors are activated concomitantly with differentiation, while retinoids induce at the same time also pro-apoptotic signaling. We have assessed the roles of two key factors, Bcl 2 A 1 and TRAIL, in the temporal programming of cell death and differentiation. We demonstrate that PLB 985 are type II cells in which TRAIL induces apoptosis through the extrinsic and [...] via Bid activation [...] also the intrinsic death pathways. Bcl 2 A 1, ectopically over-expressed, or endogenously induced by retinoic acid receptor agonists, protected cells from apoptosis triggered by TRAIL, whose induction required the activation of both the retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors. Bcl 2 A 1 prevented loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase- 9, but not caspase- 8, activation. The expression of anti-sense Bcl 2 A 1 sensitized PLB 985 cells to TRAIL. Co-culture experiments revealed protection from fraternicide if sister cells were pre-exposed to retinoic acid. Collectively, our data support a model in which retinoids orchestrate a life span-regulatory program comprising Bcl 2 A 1 induction to temporally protect against concomitantly induced TRAIL death signaling. Termination of this life span in presence of Bcl 2 A 1 is most likely a consequence of the Bid-independent <b>TRAIL</b> <b>action.</b> Thus, depending on the retinoic acid and retinoid X receptor activation potential of a ligand and the relative efficacies of the intrinsic and extrinsic death pathways in a given cell, a single retinoid triggers the life span of a differentiated phenotype...|$|R

Two forms of exploration emerge, which are similar to Berlyne's (1971) classification. Diversive exploration is are suggestion- and stimuli-driven, and increase the diversity of options. Specific explorations reduce or resolve uncertainty through product information. The study provides a more integrated view of the two forms of exploration than considered so far in the literature.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve TRAIL's (tumor {{necrosis}} factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) tumor selective activity a variant was designed, in which the three TRAIL protomers are expressed as a single polypeptide chain (scTRAIL). By genetic fusion with a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) recognizing the extracellular domain of ErbB 2, we further equipped scTRAIL with tumor-targeting properties. We studied tumor targeting and apoptosis induction of scFv-scTRAIL in comparison with non-targeted scTRAIL. Importantly, the tumor antigen-targeted scTRAIL fusion protein showed higher apoptotic activity in vitro, with a predominant action by TRAIL-R 2 signaling. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed increased plasma half-life of the targeted scTRAIL fusion protein compared with scTRAIL. In vivo studies in a mouse tumor model with xenotransplanted Colo 205 cells confirmed greater response to the ErbB 2 -specific scTRAIL fusion protein compared with non-targeted scTRAIL both under local and systemic application regimen. Together, in vitro and in vivo data give proof of concept of higher therapeutic activity of tumor-targeted scFv-scTRAIL molecules. Further, we envisage that through targeting of scTRAIL, potential side effects should be minimized. We propose that scFv-mediated tumor targeting of single-chain TRAIL represents a promising strategy to improve <b>TRAIL's</b> antitumoral <b>action</b> and to minimize potential unwanted actions on normal tissues...|$|R
