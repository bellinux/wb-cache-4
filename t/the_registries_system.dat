40|$|As the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) {{has grown}} in size and value, {{it has become an}} {{increasingly}} attractive playground for fraudsters. The past two years have seen value-added-tax (VAT) fraud and emissions allowance thefts emerge as major threats to the EU ETS market. This study explores the effects that these forms of fraud have had on parts of the EU carbon market; uncovers vulnerabilities in the regulation of the registries (the ``banks'' of accounts in which emissions allowances are kept and from which they are traded) and the oversight of the EU ETS market; and analyses the adequacy and wider implications of the regulatory reforms recently proposed by the European Commission. A series of semi-structured interviews conducted for this study exposes a significant amount of discomfort amongst stakeholders regarding the proposed reforms to the regulation of <b>the</b> <b>registries</b> <b>system,</b> which is felt could still leave the system vulnerable to fraud and its effects. The potential extension of the EU financial markets oversight regulations has also led to fear that the future regulatory framework may be disproportionately burdensome for some market participants, potentially compromising the cost-efficiency of this emissions abatement tool. Moreover, the paper highlights the difficulties involved in the investigation and prosecution of fraud in the carbon markets and assesses the extent to which recent developments in EU criminal law, in particular since the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, hold the potential to overcome some of the existing barriers to the effective criminal law cooperation between the Member States...|$|E

Our system enables developers and repository systems to register learning resources to <b>the</b> <b>registry</b> <b>system</b> and provides a discovery mechanism to find required learning resources. We argue that it can realize the integration of different learning resource repository or management systems in a loose-coupled manner by utilizing web service technology and build a distributed virtual learning resource marketplace. 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Currently, {{there are}} three {{different}} kind of clusters (computer resources) : ffl AFS clusters - UNIX computers which use AFS home directories and passwords from the AFS Authentication database. All of them belong to the desy. afs NIS domain. ffl Non-AFS clusters - UNIX computers which may use home directories on local disks (or NFS mounted) or on AFS. The passwords are taken from the "passwd" NIS map. All of these computers belong to the desy. nis NIS domain. ffl OTHERS clusters - others computer clusters: ORACLE, NOVELL, MODEM, IFH, VMS. <b>The</b> User <b>Registry</b> <b>system</b> provides mechanism for managing user account information for the AFS and Non-AFS clusters.

40|$|The study {{designed}} {{an information}} system model for Disease Management (DisMan) that met the specifications {{and needs of}} a consumer electronics manufacturer. The diseases monitored by this study were diabetes, hypertension and tuberculosis. Data were collected through interviews with the companyâs human resources department and occupational health provider. As for the model, literature and online research were conducted to collect health standards and information system standards on existing DisMan systems. These standards were then compared to the consumer electronics manufacturerâs DisMan. The model was designed by utilizing class, use-case, as well as sequence diagrams. The result was an information system model with a <b>registry</b> <b>system</b> that can specifically support DisMan in a consumer electronics manufacturer. <b>The</b> <b>registry</b> <b>system</b> included a medical alert management system and a self-monitoring system.
