5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Jake begins {{performing}} acrobatic moves. Finn attempts to follow, and eventually the two get trapped in a massive spider web. The owners of the web, two large spiders named Ed (voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait) and Barb (voiced by Susie Essman) return, bickering amongst themselves. The argument turns towards Barb's difficulty spinning webs, and she runs away. While Ed wraps Jake in a cocoon, Finn tries to offer relationship advice to Ed; Finn tells the spider to get a gift for his wife, and Ed runs {{off into the woods}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something.</b>|$|E
5|$|Located in St John's Lodge in the Inner Circle of Regent's Park, the IOA {{was founded}} in 1937, largely by {{archaeologist}} Mortimer Wheeler, but until 1946 relied primarily upon volunteer lecturers. Childe's relationship with the conservative Wheeler was strained, the latter being intolerant of the shortcomings of others, something Childe made an effort never to be. He was popular among students, who saw him as a kindly eccentric; they commissioned a bust of Childe from Marjorie Maitland Howard. His lecturing was nevertheless considered poor, as he often mumbled and walked into an adjacent room <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> while continuing to talk. He consistently referred to the socialist states of eastern Europe by their full official titles, and called towns by their Slavonic rather than Germanic names, further confusing his students. He was deemed better at giving tutorials and seminars, where he devoted more time to interacting with his students. As Director, Childe was not obliged to excavate, though he did undertake projects at the Orkney Neolithic burial tombs of Quoyness (1951) and Maes Howe (1954–55).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Claire is {{reunited with}} Sherry and discovers that the mutated Birkin has {{implanted}} his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by Birkin leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> {{to treat her}} wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant – which falls into a pit of molten metal – seemingly {{at the cost of}} her own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow, implying Ada's survival and escape with the G-virus in the pendant. Birkin– now mutated into a large agglomeration of flesh and teeth– follows the protagonists, but is destroyed when a self-destruct system causes the train to explode. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for her brother. Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, is able to successfully complete his G-virus retrieval mission.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} is also host to various student pranks. For example, {{on at least}} two different occasions the university has awoken <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> odd atop the 173-foot (52.7m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery. The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day. The clock tower also plays music.|$|E
25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
25|$|Following the Claymore raid {{there was}} a period of lull in the Commando operations, and while No. 3 Commando was based at Largs, in an effort <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> for his men to do, Durnford-Slater and a number of his {{officers}} began planning an unofficial raid on the German embassy in Dublin as they believed that the embassy was transmitting information on the location of Allied convoy movements in the Atlantic. Before this raid could be carried out, however, Durnford-Slater was called to London for a meeting with Admiral Louis Mountbatten who had taken over command of Combined Operations to begin planning for another raid in Norway.|$|E

25|$|Neal {{wakes up}} in the same place where Aurora woke from her {{sleeping}} curse, being tended to by her, Prince Phillip, and Mulan. When Neal reveals that he knows Emma, Aurora tries to communicate with Henry through the Netherworld via the sleeping curse. When she is unsuccessful, Neal and Mulan set out for Rumpelstiltskin's castle, hoping <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> to lead them to Emma and Henry. When they arrive there, they meet Robin Hood, who has taken up residence in the castle, but allows them to search for what they seek to repay the life debt he owes Rumpelstiltskin. Finding his father's old staff, Neal manages to uncover a concealed cabinet full of magical objects, including a crystal ball that tells him that Emma is in Neverland.|$|E
25|$|The MRE {{has been}} in continual {{development}} since its introduction. In 1990, a Flameless Ration Heater (FRH), a water-activated exothermic reaction product that emits heat, allowed a service member {{in the field to}} enjoy a hot meal. In an array of field tests and surveys, service members requested more entrée options and larger serving sizes. By 1994, commercial-like graphics (images) were added to make the packets more user-friendly and appealing, while biodegradable materials were introduced for inedible components, such as spoons and napkins. The number of entrées expanded to 16 by 1996 (including vegetarian options), 20 entrées by 1997 and 24 entrées by 1998. Today, service members can choose from up to 24 entrées, and more than 150 additional items. The variety allowed service members from various cultures and geographical regions <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> palatable.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, J.T. and Colleen {{become friends}} again and she stands by him while his {{pregnant}} fiance, Victoria, is in a coma. When Colleen's father goes missing in 2009, {{she goes to}} J.T. for help finding him. They discover his dead body frozen in the ice of the river. He comforts her while she deals with her loss. Colleen blames Brad's longtime enemy and J.T.'s father-in-law, Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), for her father's death and attempts {{to get back at}} him by claiming Brad's seat on the Newman board. Victor orders J.T. <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> damaging on Colleen that will force her to give up the seat. J.T. does not follow Victor's orders, but Victor gets what he wants by paying Gloria and Jeffry Bardwell to catch Colleen in a compromising position. They pay a bartender to get her drunk. Under the influence of alcohol, she flashes her breasts in public, which Jeffrey catches on camera. Once the footage of her is made public, Colleen is asked to resign from the Newman board. This only brings J.T. and Colleen closer. They begin bringing up suppressed feelings and on August 17, 2009 they kiss and are spotted by a spy of Victor's. This soon is heard by the Newmans that J.T. was seen coming out of Colleen's home the next morning. Colleen is confronted by J.T.'s wife, Victoria. Colleen is kidnapped by her Uncles Jack's unstable ex-wife, Patty Williams. She escapes by canoe on the lake but falls into the water and nearly drowns. She is found by Jack and brought to the hospital. On September 22, it is confirmed that Colleen is brain dead because of her accident on the lake. On September 28, the doctors announce that Colleen is an organ donor, and Traci decides to give Colleen's heart to Victor Newman. On her death bed, a heartbroken J.T tells Colleen that he loves her and always will.|$|E

Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Pictures) expects a miracle – and we're going to make it happen." [...] Sargent got a call from Sheinberg in late September 1986, asking him to direct the fourth Jaws movie with no script yet written. Said Sargent, [...] "I didn't have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. When he told me, 'It's your baby, you produce and direct,' I accepted." [...] According to Sargent, Sheinberg [...] "cut through all the slow lanes and got Jaws: The Revenge off and running." [...] In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born [...] "out of a little bit of desperation <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> fresh to do with the shark.
