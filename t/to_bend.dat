5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|Copper is used {{to create}} stills for distilling spirits, for example to make whisky. It's {{malleability}} makes it easy <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> into the various shapes required and allows considerable flexibility in the shaping of the still and associated pipework; the metal also reacts with undesirable sulfur-containing components in the vapor and distillate making for a cleaner product.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E

5|$|It is {{the nature}} of man to build the most {{complicated}} cage of rules and regulations in which to trap himself, and then, with equal ingenuity and zest, <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> his brain to the problem of wriggling triumphantly out again. Lent was a challenge; the game was to ferret out the loopholes.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} {{manufacture}} {{varied between the}} various cultures that used them. Initially {{the tips of the}} limbs were made <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> when the bow was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, known as siyahs, which are made {{as an integral part of}} the wooden core of the bow.|$|E
5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> the actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days <b>to</b> <b>bend.</b> When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional mucilage to mire down the prey, which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
30|$|In {{response}} to these results, the new strength grade named “mixed specific symmetric grade (ME grade)” {{was established in the}} JAS guidelines for GLT, and processing of composite glulam became easier than before. However, since the effects of high-strength laminae are limited <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> strength, the application of ME-grade glulam was limited <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> members such as beams and girders.|$|R

5|$|With the {{exception}} of A.laevigatum, all species have a thin separating layer, the cortex, between the hymenium and the tomentum. A cortex is also present on many Stereum fungi (on a broader front) and serves <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> up the fruit body. As this cortex is missing on A.laevigatum, its fruit body lies flat on the bark.|$|E
5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E

Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, Amon and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar. It is only after she loses her ability <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> that Korra allows herself {{to listen to her}} past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.|$|E
5|$|Other supernatural {{abilities}} commonly {{attributed to}} the kitsune include possession, mouths or tails that generate fire or lightning (known as kitsunebi), willful manifestation in the dreams of others, flight, invisibility, {{and the creation of}} illusions so elaborate as to be almost indistinguishable from reality. Some tales speak of kitsune with even greater powers, able <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> time and space, drive people mad, or take fantastic shapes such as a tree of incredible height or a second moon in the sky. Other kitsune have characteristics reminiscent of vampires or succubi and feed on the life or spirit of human beings, generally through sexual contact.|$|E
5|$|Razer was {{designed}} and built by Ian Lewis and Simon Scott who, after watching the first series of Robot Wars, agreed that combat robots had potential to be considerably more destructive than the pioneering machines on display. Their choice of weapon was a piercing arm attached to a hydraulic ram and powered by a pump, itself powered by a motorcycle starter motor. This {{was based on the}} principle of the brake press, a piece of industrial machinery used <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> metal through progressive force.|$|E

5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The {{tips of his}} fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.|$|E
5|$|Velites {{were the}} {{youngest}} and usually the poorest (being 5th class citizens, with property worth 4002,500 denarii) soldiers in the legion, and could rarely afford much equipment. They were armed with veretum, light javelins, each with a 90 cm (3 ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c. 10 in (25 cm) narrow metal point, and tips designed <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> on impact to prevent them being thrown back, similar to the heavier pila of other legionaries. Livy says that they each carried seven javelins, however Roman satirist Lucilius says that they carried five, suggesting that the amount may have changed.They also carried darts, 30 in long, which also had a tip that was designed <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> on impact. The hastati and principes carried gladii, relatively short thrusting swords 74 centimetres (29 inches) in length, as their main weapons, and the velites carried them as backup weapons. They fought in a very loose, staggered formation like most irregular troops, and carried small round shields called parma, 90cm (3feet) in diameter.|$|E

5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{gets into}} a fight with Nelson Muntz, the school bully, while {{defending}} Lisa and the cupcakes that she baked for Miss. Hoover's birthday party. Nelson beats up Bart after school and warns him to expect the same treatment the following day. At home, Marge consoles and encourages Bart to reason with Nelson. Homer urges Bart <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> the rules and fight dirty. Taking Homer's advice, Bart does so, but is beaten up again. Bart turns to the toughest member of the Simpson family, Grampa Simpson, who introduces Bart to Herman, the crazed one-armed proprietor of an army surplus store. He instructs Bart on military tactics, then Bart declares war on Nelson and his sidekicks.|$|E
5|$|Infuriated by {{what was}} {{perceived}} as yet another affront to British prestige after the recent landings at Pontian and Labis by Indonesian volunteers in southwestern Malaysia, members of the British Cabinet, particularly Peter Thorneycroft and Louis Mountbatten, favoured sending the carrier back through the Strait in spite of the Indonesian ban. Though British naval commanders in the Far East had grave concerns that the Victorious would be indefensible while in passage, the prevailing opinion was that not to send the ship would result in an immense political defeat on both a domestic and international scale as well as the loss of rights to an important waterway. Tension mounted as the British and Indonesians each refused <b>to</b> <b>bend,</b> and as the carrier's time to sail came, war became increasingly likely.|$|E
