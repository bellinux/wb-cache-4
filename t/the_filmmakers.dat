5|$|Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton. Kevin Spacey met Byrne at a {{party and}} asked him to do the film. He read the {{screenplay}} and turned it down, thinking that <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> could not pull it off. Byrne met screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie and Singer and was impressed by the latter's vision for the film. However, Byrne was also dealing with some personal problems at the time and backed out for 24 hours until <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> agreed to shoot the film in Los Angeles, where the actor lived, and make it in five weeks.|$|E

50|$|The {{voice-over}} in a documentary is a commentary by <b>the</b> <b>filmmaker,</b> spoken while <b>the</b> camera is filming, or {{added to the}} soundtrack during the production.

5|$|Knowing {{ahead of}} time their {{inability}} to alter the film's script once animating had begun, an effort was made by <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> to finalize the script {{as much as possible}} before the start of production, which is not a common practice for studio-produced animated films.|$|E
5|$|Several of <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> {{also contributed}} some voice acting, {{including}} director Pete Docter as Father's Anger, and co-writer Ronnie del Carmen {{as one of}} the abstract thought mind workers.|$|E

50|$|The film {{begins with}} a series of outdoor shots narrated by <b>the</b> <b>filmmaker.</b> <b>The</b> viewer follows her fuzzy form as she {{approaches}} the camera and tells a story of people remarking on the features they hope her unborn child will be born with.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>filmmakers</b> {{sent out}} letters to many politicians, both Democrat and Republican, {{asking them to}} make cameo {{appearances}} in the film.

50|$|If {{the ideological}} {{approach}} {{is concerned with}} broad movements {{and the effects of}} the world around <b>the</b> <b>filmmaker,</b> then <b>the</b> auteur theory is diametrical to it, celebrating the individual, usually in the person of <b>the</b> <b>filmmaker,</b> and how his/her personal decisions, thoughts, and style manifest themselves in the material.|$|R
5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. <b>The</b> <b>filmmakers</b> {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and {{meet the needs of}} the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able to jump out of the train at full speed. The scene took precise execution. <b>The</b> <b>filmmakers</b> chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E

According to Rand Miller, none of the various proposals met Cyan's approval, or were too formulaic or silly.

In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> sent a DVD proposal to Cyan. The developers gave <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> permission to begin production.
