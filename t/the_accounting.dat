These collapses {{have resulted in a}} widespread disregard for the reputation of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> profession.

5|$|From the 1940s to the 1960s, <b>The</b> <b>Accounting</b> Review {{published}} articles of greater diversity, and leading authors {{during this period}} tended to have less practical accounting experience and more formal education. During this period, the three individuals that accounted {{for most of the}} editorial duties of the journal were A. C. Littleton (1944-1947), Frank Smith (1950-1959) and Robert Mautz (1960-1962), all of whom either had practical accounting experience, or were leading authors prior to 1945, when the journal was oriented towards <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> practice.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Accounting</b> Review was {{established}} in 1926. In its early decades, the journal tended to publish articles that would {{be of interest to}} accounting practitioners, but over time it shifted towards a preference for quantitative model building and mathematical rigor. In the 1980s the AAA began to publish two other journals, Issues in Accounting Education and Accounting Horizons, that were more relevant to accounting educators and accounting practitioners respectively, to allow <b>The</b> <b>Accounting</b> Review to focus more heavily on quantitative articles.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Accounting</b> Review, {{launched}} in 1926 by William Andrew Paton, {{is one of}} the oldest academic journals in accounting. The American Association of University Instructors of Accounting, which later became the American Accounting Association, originally proposed that the association publish a Quarterly Journal of Accountics, but the proposal did not see fruition, and <b>The</b> <b>Accounting</b> Review was subsequently born. Paton served as editor and production manager in the journal's first three years.|$|E
50|$|A {{practical}} example of decay theory {{is seen in}} the financial sector. If you open a bank account and not deposit or withdraw money from <b>the</b> <b>account,</b> after a period of time the bank will render <b>the</b> <b>account</b> dormant. <b>The</b> owner of <b>the</b> <b>account</b> then has to reopen <b>the</b> <b>account</b> for it to remain active. <b>The</b> bank <b>account</b> (<b>the</b> memory) is rendered dormant (the memory weakened) over time if there is not activity on <b>the</b> <b>account</b> (if <b>the</b> memory is not retrieved after a period of time).|$|R
50|$|In this situation, the Convention {{provides}} that the relevant intermediary is <b>the</b> <b>account</b> holder's own intermediary, and <b>the</b> <b>account</b> agreement between <b>the</b> <b>account</b> holder and its intermediary is <b>the</b> relevant <b>account</b> agreement {{to determine the}} law governing either perfection or completion.|$|R

Its function was to abstract the identity of <b>the</b> <b>account</b> owner from <b>the</b> <b>accounts.</b> That is, <b>the</b> <b>account</b> holders transfer money into the DMT network, which becomes the legal owner of the money. Then, <b>the</b> <b>account</b> holder can make a private DMT transfer to another <b>account</b> in <b>the</b> system. The system is based on trust between the [...] "bank" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>account</b> holders, hence <b>the</b> name.|$|R
5|$|Courses on {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} {{in the last couple}} of decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums. Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E
5|$|Enron {{capitalized}} the Raptors, and, in {{a manner}} similar to <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> employed when a company issues stock at a public offering, then booked the notes payable issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount. This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades {{following}} the journal's establishment, leading authors in <b>The</b> <b>Accounting</b> Review tended to write articles that would {{be of interest to}} accounting practitioners. The journal published articles that focused on accounting education and issues related to particular industries and trade groups, with many articles using anecdotal evidence and hypothetical illustrations. The longest-serving editor during this period was Eric Kohler, an accounting practitioner; Kohler served as editor from 1928 to 1942.|$|E

5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{started as}} a printer of {{standardized}} business forms on carbon paper. By the 1940s, Reynolds' business was divided into four main areas: automotive, medical, custom forms and Post-Rite Peg Boards. Reynolds' first electronic accounting service was introduced in 1963. Its parts inventory software product, called Electronic Parts Inventory Control (EPIC), was released in beta in 1966. It was renamed upon full release the following year as RAPIC. This was followed by <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> and management software called LEASe and an accounts receivable product.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the major}} {{accounting}} scandals, new reforms, regulations, {{and calls for}} increased higher education have been introduced to combat the dangers of unethical behavior. By educating accountants on ethics before entering the workforce, such as through higher education or initial training at companies, it is believed it will help to improve the credibility of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> profession. Companies and accounting organizations have expanded their assistance with educators by providing education materials to assist professors in educating students.|$|E

50|$|For example, if an {{investor}} puts $1,000 in a 1-year {{certificate of deposit}} (CD) that pays an annual interest rate of 4%, paid quarterly, the CD would earn 1% interest per quarter on <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance. <b>The</b> <b>account</b> uses compound interest, meaning <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance is cumulative, including interest previously reinvested and credited to <b>the</b> <b>account.</b> Unless <b>the</b> interest is withdrawn {{at the end of}} each quarter, it will earn more interest in the next quarter.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Dr. B. Johnson put $14,000 {{in stocks}} in an Oppenheimer account. Strictly under Oppenheimer management, nearly 20 {{years later in}} 2017, <b>the</b> <b>account</b> was worthless.
