5|$|Israeli Arab {{historian}} Mustafa Kabha {{wrote that}} Egyptian and other Arab historians did not attribute as much {{importance to the}} battle as Israeli ones. They ask what the Egyptian objective was, {{and whether or not}} it was wise to advance without securing their lines of communication. Abdullah el Tell, commander of the Jordanian Legion in Jerusalem, thought that the Egyptians did not consider the Legion's needs. Aware of their weaknesses, they did not let anything distract them from reaching Tel Aviv. The Egyptian war log, from 19:00 on May 28, 1948, showed concern over the lines of communication. Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari wrote that while the Egyptians publicly declared that the target was Tel Aviv, they never actually meant to advance farther than their Isdud fortifications. As evidence, he cited the Egyptian refusal to take the undefended Yibna despite the villagers' repeated cries for help. Bahjat Abu-Gharbiyeh, one of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni's deputies and commander of the Beit Jibrin area, wrote that the Egyptians never had a clear plan, because their leadership were not really interested in a war. Therefore, their efforts were improvised. Kabha concludes <b>that</b> <b>Arab</b> historiography considers the battle the successful realization of a tactical move, designed to serve the actions of the badly coordinated Arab armies.|$|E
25|$|Based on Jewish Agency {{statistics}} from 1947, Deborah Bernstein estimated that 77% of Arab {{population growth in}} Palestine between 1914 and 1945, during which the Arab population doubled, was due to natural increase, while 23% was due to immigration. Bernstein wrote <b>that</b> <b>Arab</b> immigration was primarily from Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan, and Egypt.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} Israeli {{point of}} view arguing <b>that</b> <b>Arab</b> leaders encouraged Palestinian Arabs to flee has also been disputed by the New Historians, which instead have shown evidence indicating Arab leaders' will for the Palestinian Arab population to stay put. Historians such as Benny Morris, Erskine Childers, and Walid Khalidi state that no evidence of widespread evacuation orders exists, and <b>that</b> <b>Arab</b> leaders in fact instructed the Palestinian Arabs to stay put. According to Morris, whatever the reasons driving many into flight, temporary evacuation under local orders, contagious panic, fear of Jewish arms, or direct expulsion manu militari, the 700,000 odd Palestinians who did become refugees acquired that status {{as a result of}} compulsory displacement or expulsion, since they were not permitted by Israel to return. In any case, even if the 1948 exodus had not been caused by Israel, the claimed right of return is not contingent on Israeli responsibility for the displacement of refugees.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} <b>that</b> <b>Arab</b> immigration somehow {{made up a}} {{large part}} of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable.

25|$|However, {{according}} to Wesleyan University professor Abdelmajid Hannoum, the view <b>that</b> <b>Arab</b> scholars and geographers {{from this time}} period held racist attitudes {{are the result of}} mistranslations, stating that such attitudes were not prevalent until the 18th and 19th centuries.

Lindsay also argues that the concept of an Arab identity itself did not exist until modern times.|$|E
25|$|In Israel at the Polls 2003, it {{is noted}} <b>that</b> <b>Arab</b> voting {{participation}} dropped to 62% in the 2003 elections, a drop partially attributed to calls by Abnaa el-Balad {{to boycott the}} elections. A May 2003 study by Mada al-Carmel, a Palestinian-Israeli research institute, exploring why Arab voters abstained in the 2003 Israeli elections determined that 43.4% of non-voters abstained from voting for political reasons, and that this group represented some 14% of registered voters.

25|$|In the book, Manji {{says that}} Arabs {{have made a}} mistake by denying that Jews have a {{historical}} bond with Palestine.

She further argues that the allegation of apartheid in Israel is deeply misleading, noting that there are in Israel several Arab political parties, that Arab-Muslim legislators have veto powers, and <b>that</b> <b>Arab</b> parties have overturned disqualifications. She also writes that Israel has a free Arab press, that road signs bear Arabic translations, and that Arabs live and study alongside Jews.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the amount}} of land owned by Jews is easier to {{calculate}} than that owned by Arabs.

These data cannot be fully understood without comparing them to those of neighbouring countries: in Iraq, for instance, still in 1951 only 0.3 per cent of registered land (or 50 per cent of the total amount) was categorised as ‘private property’.|$|E

Nevertheless, the Bedouin population, with its high birth rates, continues to be perceived as a threat to a Jewish demographic majority in the south, and a number of development plans, such as the Blueprint Negev, address this concern.|$|R
