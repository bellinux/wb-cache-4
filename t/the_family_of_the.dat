5|$|Although {{they were}} pagan, the Hungarians {{demonstrated}} a tolerant attitude towards Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The Byzantine Church {{was the first}} to successfully proselytize among their leaders: in 948 the horka, and around 952 the gyula, were baptized in Constantinople. In contrast, the grand prince Géza (c.970–997) received baptism according to the Latin rite. He erected fortresses and invited foreign warriors to develop a new army based on heavy cavalry.

5|$|His selflessness and {{strength}} were exemplified {{during this period}} by the assistance that he gave to a fellow worker who had become ill.

The first Airbus A320 joined the airline's fleet in March 1993 and by December, there was a total of six A320 aircraft.

Gorrostieta Salazar pleaded with her abductors to let her daughter go unharmed, and then agreed to go with the kidnappers. <b>The</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former mayor initially thought it was a ransom kidnapping. After not hearing from Gorrostieta Salazar or her abductors for two days, they notified the police.

5|$|The Maratha {{gains in}} the north were undone because of the {{contradictory}} policies of Holkar and Shinde and the internal disputes in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peshwa, which culminated {{in the murder of}} Narayanrao Peshwa in 1773. Due to this, the Marathas virtually disappeared from north India. Raghunathrao was ousted from the seat of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries. He sought help from the British, and they signed the Treaty of Surat with him in March 1775. This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of Salsette Island and Bassein Fort.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Palladian country house {{in the seventeenth century}} separated <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> householder from the servants. Previously sharing the hall, and bedding down at a master's feet, or door, servants were now given separate small chambers. Sometimes these were placed on a mezzanine floor, as at Kinross. Servants were less visible, using backstairs that kept them away from members of the family and guests and they fulfilled necessary and sometimes unpleasant tasks. They were also fewer in number, of lower social status and predominately female. A country house could have 10 to 20 servants and large houses had more. A hierarchy of positions developed from the butler and housekeeper to footmen and maids. The sexes were increasingly segregated into their own quarters.|$|E

5|$|Veratalpa lugdunensiana is {{a fossil}} mammal from the Miocene of France.

He placed it in Talpidae, <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moles, but in 1974, John Howard Hutchison argued that the astragalus was not talpid and more likely came from a rodent. The astragalus is about 4.5mm long, broad for a talpid, and has the head oriented farther from the axis of the foot than in talpids.|$|E
