This can be done using a test-per-clock built-in self-test (BIST) architecture in which a test pattern is applied to the circuit under test (CUT) every clock cycle [2, 4, 10] and the tes [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel {{built-in}} self-test (BIST) architecture for high-performance circuits. The proposed approach is especially suitable for embedding precomputed test sets for core-based systems since {{it does not}} require a structural model of the circuit, either for fault simulation or for test generation. It utilizes a <b>twisted-ring</b> <b>counter</b> (TRC) for test-per-clock BIST and is appropriate for high-performance designs because it does not add any mapping logic to critical functional paths. Test patterns are generated on-chip by carefully reseeding the TRC. We show that a small number of seeds is adequate for generating test sequences that embed complete test sets for the ISCAS benchmark circuits. Instead of being stored on-chip, the seed patterns can also be scanned in using a low-cost, slower tester. The seeds can be viewed as an encoded version of the test set that is stored in tester memory. This requires almost 10 X less memory than compacted test sets obtained from ATPG programs. This allows us to effectively combine highquality BIST with external testing using slow testers. As the cost of high-speed testers increases, methodologies that facilitate testing using slow testers become especially important. The proposed approach is a step in that direction...|$|E

40|$|We present novel {{test set}} {{encoding}} and pattern decompression methods for core-based systems. These {{are based on}} the use of <b>twisted-ring</b> <b>counters</b> and offer a number of important advantagesâ€“significant test compression (over 10 X in many cases), less tester memory and reduced testing time, the ability to use a slow tester without compromising test quality or testing time, and no performance degradation for the core under test. Surprisingly, the encoded test sets obtained from partially-specified test sets (test cubes) are often smaller than the compacted test sets generated by automatic test pattern generation programs. Moreover, a large number of patterns are applied test-per-clock to cores, thereby increasing the likelihood of detecting non-modeled faults. Experimental results for the ISCAS benchmark circuits demonstrate that the proposed test architecture offers an attractive {{solution to the problem of}} achieving high test quality and low testing time with relatively slower, less expensive testers...|$|R
