5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Scooter</b> {{is another}} storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This {{nickname}} first arose {{during the months}} leading up to the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by Voyager 2). The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as Voyager 2 approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.|$|E

25|$|Neptune has {{extremely}} dynamic weather systems, {{including the}} highest wind speeds in the Solar System, {{thought to be}} powered by the flow of internal heat. Typical winds in the banded equatorial region can possess speeds of around 350m/s, while storm systems can have winds reaching up to around 900m/s, nearly {{the speed of sound}} in Neptune's atmosphere. Several large storm systems have been identified, including the Great Dark Spot, a cyclonic storm system the size of Eurasia, <b>the</b> <b>Scooter,</b> a white cloud group further south than the Great Dark Spot, and the Wizard's eye/Dark Spot 2, a southern cyclonic storm.|$|E

500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. <b>The</b> <b>scooter</b> type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, but I bet you that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the seaside}} resort brawls, the media began to {{associate}} Italian scooters with violent mods.

2500|$|Though {{the design}} {{criteria}} of a scooter have grown increasingly fluid, historically a scooter featured small wheels [...] especially in post-war Italy. The configuration, {{along with a}} compact engine, allowed <b>the</b> <b>scooter</b> its trademark step-through design. With the 1950 introduction of the Galletto 160, Moto Guzzi developed a large-wheel scooter. The larger and heavier wheels afforded greater gyroscopic force and thereby greater balance. Large-wheeled scooters also reduced vulnerability to pot-holes. The Galletto not only offered larger wheels, it carried its own spare.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a small-scale electric scooter trial in Oxford, United Kingdom. <b>The</b> trial <b>scooters</b> were instrumented with global positioning satellite data loggers and energy meters to record their time of day usage and charging regimes. <b>The</b> <b>scooters</b> were most likely driving at 09 : 00, 12 : 45 and 17 : 15 and charging at 10 : 15 - 10 : 40. <b>The</b> electric <b>scooter</b> normalized mains-to-wheel energy use was 0. 10 kWh km- 1. <b>The</b> electric <b>scooter</b> total operating costs (electricity and battery replacement) of £ 0. 045 km- 1 is 24 % greater than the best selling equivalent petrol motorcycle and 1. 7 times lower than the best selling car. <b>The</b> electric <b>scooter</b> uses 0. 45 MJ km- 1, or 2. 9 times and 6. 1 times less than the petrol motorcycle and car, respectively. Further, <b>the</b> electric <b>scooter</b> can achieve zero carbon dioxide equivalent (greenhouse gas, GHG) emissions when electricity from renewable energy sources is used. In 2008, there were 247 000 motorcycles in the UK vehicle fleet of equivalent size to <b>the</b> trial <b>scooter.</b> Scaling up <b>the</b> electric vehicle fleet size accordingly would avoid 0. 60 billion car or motorcycle kilometres and 54 - 110 kt associated GHG. The fleet would require 59 GWh, or 0. 015 % of total annual generation with a time-shifted, peak demand of 250 MW, or 0. 44 % of the 58 GW maximum national demand. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

2500|$|In recent years, {{many urban}} commuters have {{purchased}} new or restored Vespas. [...] A shortage of available parking for automobiles in large urban {{areas and the}} Vespa's low running costs are two reasons for the increase in Vespa (and other scooter) popularity. The cultural use of <b>the</b> <b>scooter</b> as a recreational vehicle with a sub-cultural following in the US/Canada and parts of Europe & Japan has {{also contributed to the}} rise in Vespa ownership.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>scooter</b> had rigid rear {{suspension}} and small [...] wheels that allowed a compact design {{and plenty of}} room for the rider's legs. The Vespa's enclosed, horizontally mounted 98cc two-stroke engine acted directly on the rear drive wheel through a three-speed transmission. The twistgrip-controlled gear change involved a system of rods. The early engine had no forced-air cooling, but fan blades were soon attached to the magneto-flywheel (which houses the points and generates electricity for accessories and for the engine's spark) to push air over the cylinder's cooling fins. [...] The modern Vespa engine is still cooled this way.|$|E
