5|$|Burst <b>time</b> <b>offset</b> (BTO) – {{the time}} {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the response is received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the addition of}} so-called <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> to task sets dispatched according to fixed priorities. The motivation for this work is two-fold: firstly, direct expression of <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> is a useful structuring approach for designing complex hard real-time systems. Secondly, analysis directly addressing <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> can be very much less pessimistic than extant analysis. In this report we extend our current fixed priority schedulability analysis, and then present two major worked examples, illustrating the approach. 1. INTRODUCTION Previous work has addressed the problem of determining the worst-case timing behaviour of tasks dispatched according to fixed priority scheduling [11, 10]. Much of this work has been aimed at determining the worst-case case response time of a given task; of course, the worst-case response time is, by definition, the response time of the task in the worst-case scheduling scenario. So far, in all these previous pieces of work, tasks have been ass [...] ...|$|R

We apply the concept of Data Driven Time Syn-chronization through a seismic deployment consisting of 100 seismic sensors to repair data that was not time synchronized correctly. This deployment used GPS for time synchronization but due to system faults common to environmental sensing systems, data was collected with large <b>time</b> <b>offsets.</b> In seismic deployments, offset data is often never used but we show that Data Driven Time Synchronization can recover the synchronization and make the data usable.

2500|$|In addition, {{to sharpen}} {{resolution}} {{from the standard}} GPS 100nanoseconds to the 1nanosecond range metrology labs achieve, OPERA researchers used [...] Septentrio’s precise PolaRx2eTR GPS timing receiver, along with consistency checks across clocks (time calibration procedures) which allowed for common-view time transfer. The PolaRx2eTR allowed measurement of the <b>time</b> <b>offset</b> between an atomic clock {{and each of the}} Global Navigation Satellite System satellite clocks. For calibration, the equipment was taken to the Swiss Metrology Institute (METAS). In addition, highly stable cesium clocks were installed both at LNGS and CERN to cross-check GPS timing and to increase its precision. After OPERA found the superluminal result, the time calibration was rechecked both by a CERN engineer and the German Institute of Metrology (PTB). Time-of-flight was eventually measured to an accuracy of 10nanoseconds. The final error bound was derived by combining the variance of the error for the individual parts.|$|E
