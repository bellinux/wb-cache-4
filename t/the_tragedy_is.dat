25|$|The plot {{is based}} on Thomas North's {{translation}} of Plutarch's Lives and follows the relationship between Cleopatra and Mark Antony {{from the time of}} the Sicilian revolt to Cleopatra's suicide during the Final War of the Roman Republic. The major antagonist is Octavius Caesar, one of Antony's fellow triumvirs of the Second Triumvirate and the first emperor of the Roman Empire. <b>The</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>is</b> mainly set in Rome and Egypt and is characterized by swift shifts in geographical location and linguistic register as it alternates between sensual, imaginative Alexandria and a more pragmatic, austere Rome.|$|E
25|$|Both of the lovers' fates are {{interwoven}} {{yet they}} deceive {{the other in}} a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely {{what is going on in}} the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. <b>The</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>is</b> Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was a small price to pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Defeated Sanity {{signed with}} UK label Grindethic Records to release their {{full-length}} debut. The album was recorded at Soundforge Studios in Rhauderfehn, Germany. The band produced {{the record and}} Andreas Hilbert handled the engineering and mastering. Prelude to the Tragedy was released in November that same year. The album received mixed reviews. Diabolical Conquest said, [...] "Prelude to <b>the</b> <b>Tragedy</b> <b>is</b> a gleaming chrome harpoon of immaculate technical death metal, deftly interweaving cryptic riff-tangles with convolutional percussive violence to surprisingly comprehensible and utterly enjoyable results. Drumwork, relentless in its complexity, enhances both the progressive and barbaric elements of the tracks, nailing ambitious patterns to them with satisfying snare punch, lucid cymbals and expert fills." [...] Negative criticism of the album was mostly about the higher technical style of their music. Lords of Metal said, [...] "This is only interesting for the real die hard trash (not thrash!) lovers, and mathematicians, of course." [...] To promote the album, the band toured during 2005, appearing at Rotterdam Deathfest (an extreme metal festival in The Netherlands), along with bands such as Suffocation, Visceral Bleeding, and Vomit Remnants.|$|E

2500|$|Prometheus Bound ( [...] , Promētheus Desmōtēs) is an Ancient Greek tragedy. In antiquity, it was {{attributed}} to Aeschylus, but now is considered by some scholars to {{be the work of}} another hand, and perhaps one as late as c. 430 BC. Despite these doubts of authorship, the play's designation as Aeschylean has remained conventional. <b>The</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>is</b> based on the myth of Prometheus, a Titan who defies the gods and gives fire to mankind, acts for which he is subjected to perpetual punishment.|$|E

The National Council for Building a Better Fiji (NCBBF) can continue to develop the principles for a charter for good government. But {{there has to be}} another means for finding common ground. The onus is upon the regime, as the party holding the reins of power, to engage. Without this, the country will continue to drift, as divided and fractured as ever, with a charter and a new electoral system being imposed, and the constitution abrogated to allow the implementation of both. The implications, both internally and internationally, hardly bear thinking about. <b>The</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>is</b> that many beneficial features in both the proposed charter and the electoral system would be discounted because of the manner of their implementation.|$|E
