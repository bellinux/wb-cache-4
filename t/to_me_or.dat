Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists – Camille Pissarro had {{recommended}} him. Van Gogh's first impression was that Gachet was [...] "iller than I am, it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>or</b> let's say just as much." ...|$|E
500|$|By late June, senior {{counter-terrorism}} official Richard Clarke and CIA director George Tenet were [...] "convinced {{that a major}} {{series of}} attacks was about to come", although the CIA believed that the attacks would likely occur in Saudi Arabia or Israel. In early July, Clarke put domestic agencies on [...] "full alert", telling them that [...] "Something really spectacular {{is going to happen}} here... soon." [...] He asked the FBI and the State Department to alert the embassies and police departments, and the Defense Department to go to [...] "Threat Condition Delta." [...] Clarke would later write that [...] "Somewhere in CIA there was information that two known al Qaeda terrorists had come into the United States... in [...] FBI there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the United States... They had specific information about individual terrorists... None of that information got <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>or</b> the White House." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gertrude's Matisse and Picasso {{descriptive}} essays {{appeared in}} Alfred Stieglitz's August, 1912 edition of Camera Work, {{a special edition}} devoted to Picasso and Matisse, and represented her very first publication. Of this publication, Gertrude said, [...] "e {{was the first one}} that ever printed anything that I had done. And you can imagine what that meant <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>or</b> to any one." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{also the}} {{controversy}} over what is appropriate dress for players. Many players wear BDU, tactical vests, and camouflage clothing of myriad patterns and designs. In response to players wearing military garb, Temkin said, [...] "The players I know of that were wearing these fatigues were players {{who are in the}} military, and as far as I'm concerned, they've earned the right to wear that uniform however and wherever they please, and it's not up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>or</b> anyone else to tell them not to wear it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coupland {{received}} an honorary {{degree from the}} University of British Columbia on May 27, 2010. with The University of British Columbia having announced that it has acquired Coupland's personal archives on May 20, {{the culmination of a}} project that began in 2002. The archives, which Coupland plans to continue to add to in the future, currently consist of 122 boxes and features about 30 metres of textual materials, including manuscripts, photos, visual art, fan mail, correspondence, press clippings, audio/visual material and more. One of the most notable inclusions in the collection includes the first hand-written manuscript of ‘Generation X,' scrawled on loose-leaf notebook paper and strewn with margin notes. In a statement issued on the UBC website Coupland said, “I am honoured that UBC has accepted my papers. I hope that within them, people in the future will find patterns and constellations that can’t be apparent <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>or</b> to anyone simply because they are there, and we are here...The donation process makes me feel old and yet young at the same time. I’m deeply grateful for UBC’s support and enthusiasm.” A new consignment of materials including [...] " [...] everything from doodles and fan mail to a bejeweled hornet’s nest to a Styrofoam le for the archive arrived in July 2012" [...] arrived for sorting in July 2012. The sorting and categorisation of the new material was documented through the UBC School of Archival and Information Studies blog.|$|E
2500|$|I am very {{sensible}} {{that you}} are let into {{the knowledge of the}} intrigues of the compter, particularly with relation to the securing of pocket books. But your experience is inferior to mine... I can put you in a far better method than you are acquainted with... But I must first tell you that you'll spoil the trade of thief-taking in advancing greater rewards than are necessary. I give but half a crown a book... And when the thieves and pickpockets see us confederate they'll submit to our terms.Thus their partnership started taking Hitchen and his assistant first to Temple Bar, westernmost limit of his area of Jurisdiction. There marshal was revered with different [...] "fine" [...] drinks at different taverns, to which he only gave a brief sign asking for information on stolen goods. He was verbose, though, in his [...] "promises of protection" [...] to female visitors of those establishments:"I'll give you my word...you shall be detected, unless you deliver all the pocket books you from time to time meet with to me...If you at any time for the future, refuse to yield... either <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>or</b> my servant, you may be assured of being all sent to Bridewell... Wild gives an example of marshal's treatment of well-dressed women too. Once he seized a baillif's wife in the street in Ludgate Hill for talking to a man and accused her of being [...] "lewd". He took her to Cheapside and made her wait till he dined and pay for his meal. Pickpockets, or [...] "mathematicians" [...] as Hitchen called them affectionately", appear with a noteworthy incident in this period. On their regular night walks near St.Paul's, Hitchen and Wild saw the boys running away. Hitchen, having information on a stolen book, saw the reason of their hiding. He caught and arrested one, whose name was James Jones, the same juvenile who stole Lord Barnard's bills. The boy gave the address of his friends next morning before the justice and Hitchen took Wild to Barbican to attack their house during the night. The uninvited guests were welcomed with unfriendly 'damn ye', upon which the assistant Wild was left inside with the company while the marshal fled for bringing more constables. The gang of around 12 year-olds was taken and tried at Kingston assizes as their robbery was committed in Surrey. To the great disappointment and fury of marshal, court acquitted the boys upon their parents' complaint on marshal forcing their children to commit crime. He could not claim usual 40 pounds for their dead or alive heads. Moreover, was reprimanded by the court for the base interest. Wild gives very interesting account of the other side of Hitchen's relation to pickpockets we will mention below.|$|E
