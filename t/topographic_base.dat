50|$|The {{operational}} doctrine {{was that the}} combat force deployed into the area of operations with topographic products adequate for planning, force insertion and initial conduct of tactical operations, that new products and broad area updates of the <b>topographic</b> <b>base</b> would be provided by the support area and communication zone survey forces, and that the combat support survey force {{in the area of}} operations would update the <b>topographic</b> <b>base,</b> add tactical operational and intelligence information and provide the value-added products required by the combat force.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{generalization}} of <b>topographic</b> <b>base</b> maps {{is driven by}} the existing supply of topographic data. To provide an optimal topographic setting for thematic information layers, the topographic information displayed on the base map should satisfy the user’s information needs. Therefore, we propose an approach towards a method on automated {{generalization of}} <b>topographic</b> <b>base</b> maps for thematic mapping at various scales that {{is driven by the}} tasks that various user groups carry out to satisfy a specific information need. This method is based on principles of user-centred design and task analysis. This paper describes how these principles are applied on the way to automated task-driven generalization of base maps for Dutch physical plans...|$|E

40|$|When {{ordering}} LiDAR data, LiDAR {{point density}} per surface unit is important information with decisive {{influence on the}} price of the LiDAR survey. The paper first deals with the theoretical calculation of the minimum LiDAR point density, necessary for the acquisition of topographic data of the largest scales. For this purpose the sampling theorem is used. However, since topographic objects (roads, water bodies, etc.) and phenomena represented on topographic maps and in <b>topographic</b> <b>bases</b> are in many cases located under vegetation, also the rate of laser beam penetration through vegetation for the area where the topographic data are to be gathered has to be known. In a research on a test case conducted {{in the area of the}} town Nova Gorica we calculated the rate of laser beam penetration for four different vegetation types: scarce Mediterranean vegetation, thick thermophilic deciduous forest, mixed vegetation (meadows, orchards and forest) and built-up area. By connecting the theoretic minimum LiDAR point density with the rate of penetration, we defined the minimum LiDAR point density for the needs of data acquisition on topographic maps of the largest scales or in <b>topographic</b> <b>bases</b> of comparable detail (from 1 : 1000 to 1 : 10, 000) ...|$|R
40|$|LiDAR data {{acquisition}} {{is recognized as}} one of the fastest solutions to provide basis data for large-scale topographical base maps worldwide. Automatic LiDAR processing is believed one possible scheme to accelerate the large-scale <b>topographic</b> <b>base</b> map provision by the Geospatial Information Agency in Indonesia. As a progressive advanced technology, Geographic Information System (GIS) open possibilities to deal with geospatial data automatic processing and analyses. Considering further needs of spatial data sharing and integration, the one stop processing of LiDAR data in a GIS environment is considered a powerful and efficient approach for the base map provision. The quality of the automated <b>topographic</b> <b>base</b> map is assessed and analysed based on its completeness, correctness, quality, and the confusion matrix. </p...|$|E

40|$|Dimension-reducing feature {{extraction}} neural network techniques which also preserve neighbourhood relationships in data {{have traditionally been}} the exclusive domain of Kohonen self organising maps. Recently, we introduced a novel dimension-reducing {{feature extraction}} process, which is also <b>topographic,</b> <b>based</b> upon a Radial Basis Function architecture. It has been observed that the generalisation performance {{of the system is}} broadly insensitive to model order complexity and other smoothing factors such as the kernel widths, contrary to intuition derived from supervised neural network models. In this paper we provide an effective demonstration of this property and give a theoretical justification for the apparent `self-regularising' behaviour of the `NeuroScale' architecture...|$|R
40|$|For {{maintenance}} needs, {{conservation and}} restoration, {{it has been}} requested by the Board of the SagradaFamilia, {{the study of the}} methodology and development to carry out the full three-dimensional model of the original part of the temple (the façade of the Birth, and the adjacent towers and chapels) and metric documents, including those who have to emphasize the architectonics planes, the digital orthomosaic of the different planes, and a full high-resolution surface model. The uniqueness of this façade is that it is an about 12 meters thick irregular element with spaces inside, which can be walked across most its outside spaces and inside the towers at different levels. High accuracy surveying methods are used for this project, which must be used as a basis to generate the necessary support network, considering that the <b>topographic</b> <b>bases</b> must be placed throughout all the façade, inside the temple, at different levels and in positions with good visibility. In the methodology they are considered combined methods of laser scanning and high resolution photogrammetry, which can generate equivalent and complementary point clouds. The areas that the laser scanner can’t reach, photogrammetry is used, and vice versa. Job success is due to a good coordination and planning of the various phases to execute (photographic shots, Terrestrial Laser Scanning, <b>topographic</b> <b>bases</b> distribution and support points, etc). This project is currently being carried out and the first results have been obtainedwholly satisfactory and above the highest expectations.

40|$|The {{topographic}} {{information provided}} by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter has been used in combination with Viking and Mars Observer Camera imagery to estimate the three-dimensional structure of the Nirgal Vallis drainage system in order to constrain the formation process. Based on precisely correlated Viking, Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) cartographic data, we have measured morphometric and topologic parameters of the valley network. Although there is no single parameter, which unambiguously distinguishes between run-off and sapping, the combination of parameters such as surface dip angle, longitudinal profile, width to depth ratio, drainage density, structural control, valley terminations and bifurcation ratio will constrain the formation process. All <b>topographic</b> <b>based</b> valley network parameters indicate an origin by groundwater sapping processes and headward erosion for Nirgal Vallis and confirms former geomorphologic analyses. The extremely low drainage density of Nirgal Vallis may either be caused by very slow erosion, due to low groundwater supply or arid conditions, or by sequential interruptions of the erosion process due to probable climate changes...|$|R

40|$|Since the Gravimetric Map on a {{scale of}} 1 / 500 000 was {{published}} in 1987, the Geological Survey of Catalonia (SGC) published in 1989 the Geological and the Aeromagnetic maps {{on a scale}} of 1 / 250 000. The publications of the Hydrogeological map {{on a scale of}} 1 / 250 000 (1992) and a crustal-scale cross-section on a scale of 1 / 200 000 (1993) followed the first maps.

40|$|Because of {{the limited}} space in densely {{populated}} the Netherlands, careful land use planning, incorporating the views of all stakeholders, is of utmost importance. Dutch law recognizes two types of physical plan: structure plans and land use plans. A land use plan has a legal status and indicates what is (not) allowed on a parcel of land, whereas a structure plan is only indicative for possible future land use development. Map displays {{play an important role}} in the communication of physical planning information and since only recently the Dutch law prescribes that physical planning maps should be digital (instead of printed on paper). Therefore, physical planning maps will increasingly become available in digital, interactive, dynamic and exchangeable format for consultation by various user groups in a national web portal. Physical planning maps cannot do without a <b>topographic</b> <b>base.</b> As in many other thematic mapping applications use is often made of already existing base map layers, but, ideally, the <b>topographic</b> <b>base</b> should be better adjusted to purpose and use, scale of representation and the planning information layer that is projected on it. This can be obtained by good map design, but particularly also by an appropriate systematic cartographic generalization, based on the intended use of the map. This paper describes two user research projects (focus group and on-line survey) that were executed in the framework of a larger investigation of the automatic generalization of base maps for physical planning maps. The results of the user research can be used for steering a possible automatic generalization process, starting from an existing topographic database. Examples are a priority listing for the selection of elements of the <b>topographic</b> <b>base</b> of different physical planning maps at different resolutions and directions for mutual harmonization with the cartographic elements of the planning information layer. 1...|$|E
