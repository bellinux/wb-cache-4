500|$|While {{visiting a}} family member in Louisiana around 1870, Washington {{attended}} a Catholic mission organized by the Paulists at a neighboring parish. After [...] "careful study", Washington was received into the Roman Catholic Church. Prior to her conversion, Washington consulted with a clergyman at her Episcopal church, {{and in response to}} his concern, she replied: [...] "Oh no, I must act up to my convictions and I shall pray hard <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> given the same grace." [...] Washington became a prominent lecturer of the Catholic faith and attended the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C.|$|E
500|$|The {{events of}} the Defile {{increased}} the Khurasani disaffection with the Umayyad regime and its representatives, as exemplified by {{the words of the}} Azdi standard-bearer to Junayd. Al-Tabari also reports the words—albeit possibly a later addition—of another Khurasani to Junayd before the battle: [...] "It used to be said that certain of the troops of Khurasan would perish {{at the hands of a}} luxury-loving man from the Qays. We now fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> he". According to Blankinship, these passages, as well as poems disparaging Junayd's leadership, are an eloquent testimony to the Khurasanis' frustration at being [...] "forced to fight continuous, unrewarding campaigns for the benefit of vainglorious generals on one of the caliphate's worst fronts, by a central government whose special Syrian army had not hitherto, in the Khurasanis' opinion, faced similar hardships". Blankinship observes that [...] "after the Day of the Defile, many Khurasani tribal surnames never again appear as part of the army in Khurasan, leading one to suppose they had been annihilated or their men had given up fighting. Some Khurasani troops remain, of course, but their divisions are now paralleled by Syrian ones. Thus it appears, particularly from Tabari's emphasis, that the Day of the Defile was practically a turning point in the war with the Turks, at least as far as the Khurasanis were concerned [...]" [...] The subsequent period in Khurasan was turbulent, with revolts and anti-Umayyad agitation among the local Khurasani Arabs, which necessitated the introduction of 20,000 loyal Syrian troops into the province in addition to the 20,000 Iraqis sent in after the Defile. Only in 739–741, after the Turgesh Khaganate collapsed following the murder of its leader Suluk, was the new governor of Khurasan, Nasr ibn Sayyar, able to largely restore the Caliphate's position in Transoxiana, extending Muslim control again up to Samarkand.|$|E

[...] Admitting sins to a layman {{in case of}} necessity was a High Middle Ages practice which never received the sanction of the Catholic Church. While theological opinions during the High Middle Ages about the practice differed, the general opinion was that those confessions must be repeated to a priest. Theological opinion developed during the Late Middle Ages against the practice and the practice was condemned in 1418 by Pope Martin V in , in 1520 by Pope Leo X in , and in 1551 by the Council of Trent.|$|E
2500|$|Easter {{is linked}} to Passover and the Exodus from Egypt {{recorded}} in the Old Testament through the Last Supper, sufferings, and crucifixion of Jesus that preceded the resurrection. According to the New Testament, Jesus gave the Passover meal a new meaning, as in the upper room during the Last Supper he prepared himself and his disciples for his death. He identified the matzah and cup of wine as his body soon to be sacrificed and his blood soon to be shed. Paul states, [...] "Get rid of the old yeast <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a new batch without yeast—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed"; this refers to the Passover requirement to have no yeast {{in the house and}} to the allegory of Jesus as the Paschal lamb.|$|E
