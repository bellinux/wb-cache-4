5|$|During a {{geological}} survey on Surata IV, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) {{is struck by}} a thorn growing on a motile vine plant. The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise, where Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker's body. Within a matter of hours, the virus will reach Riker's brain, killing him. To try to save Riker's life, Pulaski puts him into a machine that will artificially stimulate his brain neurons, keeping them active and resisting the virus. This causes Riker to dream of his past adventures aboard the Enterprise. Riker's first dreams are of reasonably neutral occasions, such as {{his first meeting with}} Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner). He soon moves on to more passionate and even erotic dreams, such as meeting <b>the</b> <b>cheerful</b> young Edo women on Rubicon III, the matriarch Beata (Karen Montgomery) on Angel One, or the computer-generated holodeck woman Minuet (Carolyn McCormick).|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple {{arrived in}} California on 15 October 1968 and their first public {{appearance}} on American soil was at The Dating Game TV show on ABC on 17 October. They {{were the first}} rock band to perform on the show, where Jon Lord {{was one of the}} contestants. The next two days the band played live in the US {{for the first time as}} supporting act of Cream in their Goodbye tour. The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people every night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood – Live in California. The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate <b>the</b> <b>cheerful</b> reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them. After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast. This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road. This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations.|$|E

5|$|With the drama's setting being a hospital, {{numerous}} {{medical personnel}} appear regularly on the show, {{as well as}} several other recurring characters. Joe (Steven W. Bailey), is first shown as the owner of the Emerald City Bar and Grill, {{across the street from the}} hospital, which is a common relaxation area for the physicians. Also introduced in the pilot, is the legendary former surgeon, Dr. Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), Meredith's Alzheimer's-stricken mother, who appeared on the show until her death in season three. In the first season, Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), a nurse who appeared on the show occasionally until getting laid off in the merger with Mercy West, engages in sexual activity with O'Malley, giving him syphilis. Serving as an assistant and secretary to the Chief of Surgery, former nurse Patricia (Robin Pearson Rose), has appeared on the show since its debut. Tyler Christian (Moe Irvin), a hospital nurse, makes occasional appearances throughout the series. Within the second season, Bailey becomes pregnant by her husband, Tucker Jones (Cress Williams), who makes frequent appearances on Grey's Anatomy, until their divorce in season five. While Bailey takes a sabbatical, due to her pregnancy, <b>the</b> <b>cheerful</b> Dr. Sydney Heron (Kali Rocha), fills her position as the resident supervising Grey, Yang, Karev, O'Malley, and Stevens, and makes occasional appearances until the fifth season.|$|E

25|$|A Charlie Brown Christmas is a 1965 {{animated}} television special {{based on}} the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz.

In the special, lead character Charlie Brown finds himself depressed despite the onset of <b>the</b> <b>cheerful</b> holiday season. Lucy suggests he direct a neighborhood Christmas play, but his best efforts are ignored and mocked by his peers. After Linus tells Charlie Brown about {{the true meaning of}} Christmas, Charlie Brown cheers up, and the Peanuts gang unites to celebrate the Christmas season.|$|E

Until the last, Gavril recalled, Dmitry was <b>the</b> <b>cheerful</b> favorite uncle of his childhood, telling him jokes, attempting to raise the spirits, and bribing prison Guards to carry hopeful messages to his nephew’s cell. Some of their relatives made frantic efforts in their behalf to obtain their release through Maxim Gorky who was sympathetic and asked Lenin to set them free. Near the end of 1918, Prince Gavril, who was sick, was eventually permitted to leave and found his way out of Russia.|$|E

They need to be immensely strong to do a job which consists of carrying over a short distance anything up to an entire yak's load several times a day. Many of them are quite pretty (and well aware of the fact); they look very gay and rather brazen as, giggling and chattering among themselves, they move along with their heavy burdens, which are held in place by a woolen girdle around the chest.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the film}} was quite {{faithful}} to the novel, even in script, {{there were a few}} changes. The Death of Rats is reduced to a one-scene cameo in the film where it reaps the soul of a mouse caught in a trap on Hogswatchnight, and then watches Death deliver presents, whereas in the novel it appears much more often with Quoth the Raven. The invasion of the tooth castle is covered in more detail in the movie, as is the gathering and controlling of the teeth. The annihilation of two of Teatime's associates were removed; thus, instead of Sideney being caught in the playground of his old elementary school (with curls), he was killed by the Scissor Man. <b>The</b> <b>Cheerful</b> Fairy and the Towel Wasp are both removed, along with any mention of the Money Bag Goblin by the Dean. Mention of Bibulous, the opposite brother of Bilious, is removed, and so is the Hangover Imp that is pounding Bilious' head in the scene where Susan meets him. Medium Dave and Banjo's surname in the novel is 'Lilywhite', not 'Cropper'.|$|E

500|$|The {{musical styles}} and their {{particular}} inspirations for {{the songs on}} this album were extremely diverse. For example, there is <b>the</b> <b>cheerful,</b> fast, keyboard-augmented [...] "I'd Like To Know", the guitar-driven punk narrative [...] "Caught by the Fuzz", the mainly piano-based rhythm of the teen anthem [...] "Alright", and the country music-influenced acoustic guitar in [...] "Time to Go". Even in the varied genre of Britpop, I Should Coco was seen as eclectic. Overall, the album {{has been described as}} Britpop, influenced in equal parts by Buzzcocks and The Kinks, with strong hints of Supertramp in [...] "She's So Loose", [...] "Lose It" [...] and the intro of [...] "Strange Ones".|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein's method entailed [...] "strengthening of {{the formal}} aspects of the composition, a stylization of motif, and a 'freezing' of both emotion and actions". Although comic-book panels depict a moment in time, Drowning Girl is {{borrowed}} from {{an example of a}} comic-book panel depiction of a moment relatively more [...] "pregnant" [...] with past- and future-dependent drama than most moments. This work also marks a phase in Lichtenstein's career when many of his works were given present-participial titles such as Sleeping Girl, Crying Girl and Blonde Waiting, which accentuates the works' [...] "relation to process and action." [...] According to The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, during this phase of Lichtenstein's career [...] "a constant if restrained and a gentle sense of humor contribute just as much to <b>the</b> <b>cheerful</b> lightness of Lichtenstein's work as the balanced, completely harmonious composition." ...|$|E
500|$|The Navy had {{nominated}} Goble as First Air Member (later Chief of the Air Staff), but Williams {{took the}} post and Goble became Second Air Member and Director of Personnel and Training. Williams and Goble {{would serve as}} Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) three times each between 1922 and 1940. One motive suggested for the rotation was a ploy by Army and Navy interests to limit Williams' autonomy. Instead, according to RAAF historian Alan Stephens, the arrangement [...] "almost inevitably fostered an unproductive rivalry" [...] between the two officers, which was [...] "exacerbated by the personality differences between the pedantic, autocratic Williams and <b>the</b> <b>cheerful,</b> easy-going Goble". Although in a legal sense the Air Board led the RAAF rather than the CAS alone, Williams dominated the board {{to such an extent}} that Goble would later complain that his colleague appeared to consider the Air Force his personal command.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> <b>cheerful,</b> brightly lit atmosphere of Vauxhall, the garden Tyers developed at Denbies {{was of a}} more Gothic nature. Its theme was [...] "memento mori (or 'reminders of death')", and the development was given the name of [...] "The Valley of the Shadow of Death". Tyers continued to live in his house in the grounds of Vauxhall after purchasing Denbies, visiting the latter only on Sundays, which has been suggested may go some way towards explaining the garden's gloomy nature. David Coke and Alan Borg, authors of Vauxhall Gardens: A History (2012), have alternatively suggested that {{the mood of the}} garden may have been symptomatic of [...] "some sort of psychological imbalance" [...] within Tyers, perhaps even [...] "a form of bipolar disorder". The garden's main feature was a wooded area of about , Il Penseroso, which was criss-crossed by a labyrinthine network of paths leading down to a small tributary of the River Mole.|$|E
500|$|Malathi Rangarajan's review [...] (The Hindu) [...] was fair, {{labelling}} {{the film}} an [...] "alluring canvas", praising the opulent sets, [...] locations, rich costumes and imposing cast, yet {{noted that it}} was [...] "too short to negate the many loopholes". Divya Parameshwaran was appreciated in her debut role, while Pooja Chopra was credited as being [...] "attractive too, but [...] expressions needed some honing". Though Prashanth's stunt acts were appreciated, Rangarajan pointed out his character flaws, such as minimal expressions which were [...] "barely a smirk" [...] in the initial scenes, and the distinct lack of distinguishable traits between the twin characters he depicted. He also highlighted the lack of logic in Periyamalai Gounder's (Vijayakumar) animosity towards his daughter Thamarai (Kushboo) and <b>the</b> <b>cheerful</b> appearance of Thamarai when {{she must have been}} sad and heartbroken in the wedding scene with Prakashraj. Vikatan stated that the only good aspects of the movie were its expensive sets and its avoidance of boring archaic Tamil dialogues, common in other period films in Tamil, giving it a rating of 41 points out of 100.|$|E
500|$|With {{the passing}} of the 18th and 19th {{amendments}} to the U.S. Constitution, in 1919 and 1920, respectively, the traditional men-only, beer-soaked format of the beefsteak began to change. Politicians began including newly enfranchised women voters in their beefsteak banquets after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, and with the attendance of women came corresponding social niceties. Cocktails, popularized by illicit drinkers during Prohibition, replaced pitchers of beer, and [...] "fruit cups and fancy salads" [...] were soon added to beefsteak menus. Orchestras were hired in place of old-fashioned brass bands and storytellers, and the long-forbidden knives and forks began to appear on beefsteak tables. By the 1930s, according to Joseph Mitchell, beefsteaks were no longer the manly, messy affairs they had once been; they were now closer to formal meals in which beef and bread happened to feature heavily. <b>The</b> <b>cheerful</b> gluttony of the past was tempered by female sensibilities; [...] "women," [...] Mitchell reported, [...] "do not esteem a glutton, and at a contemporary beefsteak it is unusual for a man to do away with more than six pounds of meat and thirty glasses of beer." ...|$|E

500|$|His lessened {{involvement}} with the plot compared to protagonists from preceding Final Fantasy titles was met with mixed reception. Destructoid editor Aaron Linde described him as [...] "arguably the most uninspiring character in the game". Play.tm editor Andrew Macarthy described Vaan as an [...] "undescribing figure". Eurogamer editor Rob Fahey stated that while [...] "players may initially be somewhat dismayed to find themselves largely following around <b>the</b> <b>cheerful</b> prettyboy Vaan", the game introduces new characters who [...] "fill out the cast superbly". PSX Extreme editor Cavin Smith commented that due to the game not focusing on just one character, Vaan [...] "spends the entire game as an observer of the events unfolding in front of him", adding {{that it is a}} [...] "far different take on the protagonist compared to Nomura's egocentric tendencies". PALGN editor Phil Larsen called him a [...] "rogue-ish bad boy with a heart of gold", adding that [...] "while this may seem clichéd at first, Vaan is always presented as extremely young and never tries to control every situation", citing Tidus as an example of someone who does. Worthplaying editor Agustin described the set-up as being [...] "Dragon Quest-like", and that while he acts as a vehicle for players to view the plot through, he compared him to critically acclaimed characters Crono and Link from the Chrono Trigger and The Legend of Zelda series respectively.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} leading up to Kim Possibles premiere, {{television}} critics speculated whether or not the show will attract a prominent male audience large enough to be successful despite its female lead, attributing failure to achieve this with the cancellation of the female-led animated series Madeline. Ultimately, Kim Possible premiered to both widespread acclaim and strong viewership. The series continued to garner critical acclaim throughout its run, earning significant praise for its dialogue, animation and characters. Describing the show as [...] "infectious", Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote, [...] "Blessed with a modern sense of humor and hip -- but not too hip -- vocabulary, Kim Possible should appeal to the tweens (ages 9-13) it clearly targets", while dubbing Rufus the series' breakout star. Writing for The New York Times, Julie Salamon also enjoyed Rufus, penning, [...] "I probably would have liked Kim Impossible even if one of its lead characters hadn't been a naked mole rat. But <b>the</b> <b>cheerful</b> presence of Rufus (the mole rat) in this new animated series from Disney signals that the show's executive producer and director, Chris Bailey, doesn't mind getting cute in obvious ways." [...] The Herald-News Dave Mason wrote that Kim Possible [...] "combines drama with humor at a fast, fun pace." [...] In his book The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present, television historian Tim Brooks appreciated the series for having [...] "a marvelous sense of humor about itself." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Los Gatos {{released}} {{their first}} single, [...] "La balsa", backed with [...] "Ayer nomás". The song catapulted the burgeoning [...] "rock nacional" [...] scene in Buenos Aires, establishing the commercial viability of rock music sung in Spanish, and turning what originally was an underground scene into a widespread youth culture phenomenon. [...] "La balsa" [...] sold over 250,000 copies, an impressive number for that time, {{especially for a}} song with Spanish lyrics that differed from <b>the</b> <b>cheerful</b> and shallow efforts of the contemporary nueva ola movement. Spinetta stated: [...] "We were with Emilio [...] {{in front of the}} television, a Saturday afternoon, when we heard [...] "La balsa". Then we said, [...] "but these kids are awesome... let's be hippies from tomorrow!" [...] After a Los Gatos concert, Spinetta met producer Ricardo Kleiman and invited him to the band's rehearsals. When Kleiman heard the band play he signed them to RCA Records, and in November 1968 Almendra released their first single: [...] "Tema de Pototo", backed with [...] "El mundo entre las manos". Almendra began playing live, with performances during the summer of 1969 in Mar del Plata and an appearance at the Ancón Festival in Peru. Their Buenos Aires debut was at the Di Tella Institute as part of Three Beat Shows, where they introduced [...] "Fermín", [...] "Ana no duerme" [...] and [...] "Que el viento borró tus manos", songs which would appear on their first studio album. Almendra released a second single, [...] "Hoy todo el hielo en la ciudad" [...] backed with [...] "Campos verdes"; it was also released in Peru, where it was more successful than it was in Argentina. Between April and September 1969, the band recorded their first LP at TNT Studios, Buenos Aires, while a third single ("Tema de Pototo", backed with [...] "Final") was released. At the time of Almendras release, the influence of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had overshadowed the success of the nueva ola, exemplified by the popular teen pop music TV show, El Club del Clan.|$|E
