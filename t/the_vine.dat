5|$|The Ben Franklin Bridge {{was opened}} on July 1, 1926 and was {{designated}} to carry US 30 across the Delaware River. A parkway called the Camden-Atlantic City Parkway was planned in 1932 {{to connect the}} Ben Franklin Bridge southeast to Atlantic City; this was never built. After World War II, freeway connections were planned {{on both sides of}} the Ben Franklin Bridge. In Philadelphia, <b>the</b> <b>Vine</b> Street Expressway was planned to run along <b>the</b> <b>Vine</b> Street corridor to the present-day Schuylkill Expressway in 1945. The North-South Freeway was proposed in New Jersey as a connection from the bridge south along the Route 42 corridor. In 1950, the city of Philadelphia began planning the construction of <b>the</b> <b>Vine</b> Street Expressway, which would run along a depressed alignment through the city.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, freeway {{approaches}} {{were planned}} {{for both sides}} of the Ben Franklin Bridge, which was completed in 1926 and served as a part of US 30. In Pennsylvania, <b>the</b> <b>Vine</b> Street Expressway was planned to run along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia to the Schuylkill River, while in New Jersey, the North-South Freeway was to head south along the Route 42 corridor. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, this stretch of highway was a part of I-80S, with Interstate 680 continuing on the Schuylkill Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge. In 1964, the designations became I-76 and I-676, respectively, and in 1972 the two routes were switched onto their current alignments. I-676 in New Jersey was completed between I-76 and Morgan Boulevard by 1960 and north of there to downtown Camden by the 1980s. <b>The</b> <b>Vine</b> Street Expressway was opened from the Schuylkill Expressway to 18th Street by 1960 and east of there to I-95 on January 10, 1991 after several obstacles to construction. However, there are grade-level intersections in the connections between <b>the</b> <b>Vine</b> Street Expressway and the Ben Franklin Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Carménère {{favors a}} long growing season in {{moderate}} to warm climates. During harvest {{time and the}} winter period <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> fares poorly if it is introduced {{to high levels of}} rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter grape. The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping.|$|E

5|$|The Sauvignon blanc grape traces {{its origins}} to western France in the Loire Valley and Bordeaux Regions. As noted above, {{it is not}} clear that <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> {{originated}} in western France. Ongoing research suggests it may have descended from Savagnin. It has also been associated with the Carmenere family. At some point in the 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> paired with Cabernet Franc to parent the Cabernet Sauvignon vine in Bordeaux. In the 19th century, plantings in Bordeaux were often interspersed with Sauvignon vert (In Chile, known as Sauvignonasse) as well as the Sauvignon blanc pink mutation Sauvignon gris. Prior to the phylloxera epidemic, the insect plague which devastated French vineyards in the 19th century, these interspersed cuttings were transported to Chile where the field blends are still common today. Despite the similarity in names, Sauvignon blanc has no known relation to the Sauvignon rosé mutation found in the Loire Valley of France.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} in 2002 - 2004 near by Tokaj town in the vineyard of the Tokaj HØtsz l Ltd, examining Furmint and HÆrslevel cultivars. <b>The</b> <b>vines</b> were narrow spaced and trained to royat cordon. Cluster thinning were obtained at cluster closer phenological stage at two levels of severity: leaving one cluster/shoot (max. 12 clusters/vine) and leaving one cluster/bearing unit (max. 6 clusters/vine). Untreated, control vines were also separated. <b>The</b> <b>vines</b> of <b>the</b> HÆrslevel cultivar presented a satisfactory vegetative growth, even in case of high crop load. The Y/P ratio remained under 10, indicating that the ratio of the vegetative and the reproductive organs of <b>the</b> <b>vines</b> did not reach the critical value. Meanwhile moderate effect of the thinning was recorded on numerous indices. The Furmint cultivar {{turned out to be more}} sensitive to crop load than the HÆrslevel, the vegetative growth of <b>the</b> <b>vines</b> was considerably depressed on high fruit load. The Y/P ratio of <b>the</b> control <b>vines</b> was an average of 15, 6, which presents that <b>the</b> <b>vines</b> were highly overcropped...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Corvina <b>vine</b> ripens {{late and}} {{is prone to}} {{producing}} high yields which can negatively impact wine quality.

5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on <b>the</b> <b>vine.</b> This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E

50|$|Like other heliconiids, females {{seek the}} new growth of passion flower vines on that to lay their small yellow eggs, in {{clusters}} of 10 - 50. <b>The</b> <b>vines</b> contain toxic compounds that the caterpillars are immune to; as they feed upon <b>the</b> <b>vines,</b> <b>the</b> caterpillars concentrate the toxins within their tissues. After pupating (with the chrysalis also found on <b>the</b> host <b>vine</b> and camouflaged like a leaf), the adult retains the toxins {{and is thus}} protected from predation.|$|R

5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier {{than they have in}} the past.|$|E
5|$|The site {{on which}} the SIS {{building}} stands had been {{the location of the}} Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in the 19th century. Several industrial buildings were subsequently built on the site after the demolition of the pleasure gardens in the 1850s, including a glass factory, a vinegar works and a gin distillery. Archeological excavation of the site during building found the remains of seventeenth century glass kilns, as well as barge houses and an inn called <b>The</b> <b>Vine.</b> Evidence was also found for a river wall on the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{street is}} named after <b>The</b> <b>Vine,</b> an 18th-century public house, which in turn may have been named after a {{vineyard}} that existed at this location in Roman times.

5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. <b>The</b> <b>vine</b> {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E
