5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the <b>terminology</b> <b>used</b> {{to describe the}} type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This {{is in line with}} the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The <b>terminology</b> <b>used</b> describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints. Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized terms are necessary for describing {{the uniqueness of the}} movements such as those of the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mathematics}} {{performance of}} students enrolling in the engineering technology subjects such as robotics, image processing, control systems {{and others have been}} degraded at an alarming rate during the recent years. One of the reasons for this scenario is their inability to relate the mathematical knowledge with the technical applications including image processing. The inconsistency of <b>terminologies</b> <b>used</b> in mathematics and technical subjects has been identified as one of the main sources that contribute to this problem. In this paper, the mapping of the <b>terminologies</b> <b>used</b> in mathematics and image processing was done. It is found that there are different <b>terminologies</b> <b>used</b> in both subjects carry the same meaning and also some same <b>terminologies</b> <b>used</b> in both subjects represent different meanings. Thus it is recommended that lecturers teaching both subjects to introduce the variety of terminologies in defining a newly taught concept for teaching and learning of mathematics and image processing subjects...|$|R

5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated <b>terminology</b> <b>used</b> by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E
