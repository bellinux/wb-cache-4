5|$|A dejected Mayil confesses this to Guruvammal, {{who quickly}} plans to betroth her <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> else. The village ruffian Parattai—who lusts for Mayil—spreads rumours about her {{relationship}} with Sathyajith. Because of this, Mayil's engagement plans are halted and the village becomes hostile to her. Unable to bear the shame, Guruvammal dies and leaves Chappani {{to take care of}} Mayil.|$|E

5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E

5|$|Gorgias, in Plato's homonymous dialogue, uses Pericles as {{an example}} of {{powerful}} oratory. In Menexenus, however, Socrates (through Plato) casts aspersions on Pericles' rhetorical fame, claiming ironically that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would be superior in rhetoric <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> educated by Antiphon. He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries' veneration of Pericles.|$|E
5|$|In the {{forensics}} laboratory, Arun {{discovers that}} the body is not Susanna's; however, he declares Susanna dead in his reports. He looks for her; when he finds Susanna, she tells him she is finally getting married the next day <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> who accepts her, knowing all her sins. In an epiphany she imagines Jesus Christ as her seventh husband, full of love and never hurtful; she becomes a nun and finding the love she sought all her life. Arun and Nandini return home after he tells her that Susanna is dead.|$|E

5|$|The Catechism {{explains}} that this commandment regulates worldly goods, and forbids unjustly taking, using or damaging those that belong <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> else. It places requirements upon those who possess worldly goods {{to use them}} responsibly, taking into consideration the good of society. The Catechism addresses the concept of human stewardship of God's creation in its explanation of the seventh commandment and forbids abuse of animals and the environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus a treasure buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> who understands the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E
5|$|Vachss had {{previously}} worked with Dark Horse Comics {{to produce a}} ten-issue series (1992–1993) titled Hard Looks. Steve Korte of DC Comics's book division approached Vacchs {{with the possibility of}} a partnership. Vachss was hesitant about using creative property that belonged <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> else but recognized the opportunity to reach a new audience. He started writing the novel, on speculation, and DC Comics eventually agreed to the project, allowing Vachss to take some creative liberties.|$|E

5|$|A 1788 {{letter in}} the Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought election to the Virginia General Assembly, although {{the year of the}} contest is not given. The letter continued that the defeat convinced Marshall that he could not win elected office in Fayette County and that he subsequently lobbied for the creation of Bourbon County, hoping that he might gain an office in that new county. When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office had apparently already been promised <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment.|$|E
5|$|After {{only one}} {{professional}} fight, Woodhouse returned to football in November 2006, signing for Rushden & Diamonds, who were {{playing in the}} Conference National, the highest-tier of non-league football. His boxing licence was suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control, following a conviction for assaulting a police officer whilst drunk and of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in April 2006, {{when he was still}} playing for Grimsby Town, and not under the BBBofC's jurisdiction {{at the time of the}} incident. He was ordered to pay £100 compensation to PC Andrew Whitehead and £350 in costs. Woodhouse chose to play for Rushden & Diamonds to fulfil a promise he made <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> who was part of the consortium that took over the Irthlingborough based club. He made his debut against Aldershot Town on 25 November 2006, in a 1–0 defeat. He made five appearances in the Conference National for Rushden, before deciding to leave to concentrate on his boxing career.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He {{saw no reason to}} hand it over <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> who had not been involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
