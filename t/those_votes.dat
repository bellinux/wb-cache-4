Nine cabinet ministers, including Howe, Marler, Garson, Campney and Harris were defeated. Though the Liberals outpolled the Tories by over 100,000votes, most of <b>those</b> <b>votes</b> were wasted running up huge margins in Quebec. St. Laurent could have constitutionally hung onto power until defeated in the House, but he chose not to, and John Diefenbaker took office as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21, 1957.|$|E

25|$|Many Italian monarchists {{expressed}} {{doubts about}} {{the legitimacy of the}} referendum, claiming that millions of voters, many of them pro-monarchist, were unable to vote because they had not yet been able to return to their own local areas to register. Nor had the issue of Italy's borders been settled definitively, so the voting rights of those in disputed areas had not been satisfactorily clarified. Other allegations were made about voter manipulation, and even the issue of how to interpret the votes became controversial, as it appeared that not just a majority of those validly voting but of <b>those</b> <b>votes</b> cast (including spoiled votes), was needed to reach an outcome in the event the monarchy lost by a tight margin.|$|E

25|$|By 1957 St. Laurent was 75 {{years old}} and tired. His party had been in power for 22 years, and by this time had {{accumulated}} too many factions and alienated too many groups. He was ready to retire, but was persuaded to fight one last campaign. In the 1957 election, the Liberals won 200,000 more votes nationwide than the Progressive Conservatives (40.75% Liberals to 38.81% PC). However, most of <b>those</b> <b>votes</b> were wasted with huge majorities in Quebec. Largely due to dominating {{the rest of the}} country, the Progressive Conservatives took the greatest number of seats with 112 seats (42% of the House) to the Liberals' 104 (39.2%). Some ministers wanted St. Laurent to stay on and offer to form a minority government, arguing that the popular vote had supported them and the party's long years of experience would make them a more effective minority.|$|E
25|$|There {{were eight}} polling booths, {{and this was}} an {{increase}} by five since the last election held. The new booths were located at three school houses, in Waihola, Lawrence, and Inch Clutha, at the station of Captain Francis Wallace Mackenzie in Pomahaka, and at the courthouse in Dunedin. The latter booth was located outside of the electorate, {{but many of the}} electors resided in Dunedin. The following table shows detailed results. The polling booths that remained the same as at the 1862 by-election were the Court House at Tokomairiro (the place where the nomination meeting was held), and at the schoolhouses in Warepa and East Taieri. At the polling booth of East Taieri, four people voted whose names were not included on the electoral roll. <b>Those</b> <b>votes</b> {{were not included in the}} official count. Despite there being 280 electors enrolled in Tokomairiro, only 65 (23.2%) of them cast a vote in the by-election, a statistic that could have changed the election.|$|E

Helen Zille expressed her concerns over the incident to reporters at the IEC national operations centre, saying, [...] "This is certainly not conducive to public confidence in a free and fair election." [...] However, DA party agents from the voting station confirmed that the votes had already been counted.

500|$|On November 6, 1872, the {{day after}} the general {{election}}, the Gazette reported: [...] "The election {{was one of the most}} quiet in Little Rock we ever witnessed. [...] The returns on that day were too small to report with any certainty who had won, and the newspaper reported fraud. Rumors flew about claiming that registration had been cut short or extended in many counties to suit the needs of whoever controlled the polling places. The following Monday, the Gazette published incomplete tallies from the various counties, showing a small majority for Baxter. They also reported more forms of attempted fraud. Some unofficial polling places had apparently been set up, but only <b>those</b> <b>votes</b> cast at the regular polls had been certified.|$|E
500|$|His {{campaign}} was conducted {{as an independent}} write-in candidate, because he waited to declare his candidacy until September, after the ballots had already been printed. Three days before the election, the Kansas attorney general (who had prosecuted Brinkley before the medical board) announced that the rules surrounding write-in candidates had changed, and that the doctor's name could only be written in one specific way for the vote to count (as J. R. Brinkley). As a write-in candidate, he received more than 180,000 votes (29.5 percent of the vote) and lost to Harry Hines Woodring, later Franklin Delano Roosevelt's secretary of war. An article published {{at the time in}} The Des Moines Register estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 ballots were disqualified in this manner. [...] Woodring later admitted that had <b>those</b> <b>votes</b> counted, Brinkley would have won.|$|E

In the June Primary Bustamante received 1,606,913 Democratic votes, Kraft 674,309 Democratic votes, and Poizner 1,472,729 Republican votes. [...] Many political analysts believed that Kraft, who ran a low-key campaign where he took no campaign contributions, received <b>those</b> <b>votes</b> as a protest for Bustamante's behavior during the 2003 recall election.

2500|$|Big Spring v. Jore, 109 P.3d 219 (Mont. 2005). [...] The {{court ruled}} 6–1 that seven double-punched ballots in an {{extremely}} close election for {{a seat in the}} Montana House of Representatives should not have been counted, because ballots were only valid under state law if the voter's intent could be clearly determined. [...] The invalidation of those seven votes gave the election to Democrat Jeanne Windham, whose win gave the Democrats the one seat they needed to have a majority in the Montana House.

2500|$|In 1980, Rafael Hernández Colón ran {{again as}} the PPD gubernatorial candidate. Controversy arose when PPD {{followers}} alleged that there were irregularities during the vote count.

2500|$|Ahead of the 2005 general election, {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{that a single}} unionist candidate could retake the seat. The UUP and DUP, however, ran opposing candidates and in the event Gildernew held her seat. She kept the seat at the 2010 general election by four votes over the Unionist candidate, Rodney Connor. Following the election, Connor lodged an election petition challenging the result, based on a dispute about differences {{in the number of}} ballot papers recorded at polling stations and those subsequently recorded at the count centre. The petition was rejected after it was found that only three extra votes remained unnaccounted for. The judge ruled that [...] "even if <b>those</b> <b>votes</b> were introduced in breach of the rules and if they had all been counted in favour of the first respondent their exclusion would still have given the first respondent (Ms Gildernew) a majority of one vote and the result would not have been affected." ...|$|E

2500|$|The single {{transferable}} vote (STV), {{also called}} choice voting, is a ranked system: voters rank candidates in order of preference. [...] Voting districts usually elect three to seven representatives. [...] The count is cyclic, electing or eliminating candidates and transferring votes until all seats are filled. [...] A candidate is elected whose tally reaches a quota, the minimum vote that guarantees election. [...] The candidate's surplus votes (those {{in excess of the}} quota) are transferred to other candidates at a fraction of their value proportionate to the surplus, according to the votes' preferences. [...] If no candidates reach the quota, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, <b>those</b> <b>votes</b> being transferred to their next preference at full value, and the count continues. [...] There are many methods for transferring votes. [...] Some early, manual, methods transferred surplus votes according to a randomly selected sample, or transferred only a [...] "batch" [...] of the surplus, other more recent methods transfer all votes at a fraction of their value (the surplus divided by the candidate's tally) but may need the use of a computer. Some methods may not produce exactly the same result when the count is repeated. There are also different ways of treating transfers to already elected or eliminated candidates, and these, too, can require a computer.|$|E
2500|$|The first Scrutiny {{took place}} on March 10 after a {{ceremonial}} reading of Julius II's bull against simony. [...] The reading was done at the special request of the 'Elder Cardinals'; there was, of course, no precedent. The voting itself {{took place in the}} chapel of S. Niccolo da Bari, which was replaced by the Cappella Paolina in the reign of Pope Paul III. As the ranking cardinal-deacon, prior Diaconum, Medici himself was charged with the counting of the ballots. Seventeen votes were required for a canonical election. Cardinal Serra received thirteen votes on the first ballot, Grosso della Rovere 8, Accolti 7, Antonio del Monte 7, Bacosz 8, Fieschi 7, Finale 5, Soderini 4, Robert Guibé 3, Adriano de Castello 3, Achille de Grassis 3, Farnese 3, Grimani 2, Bainbridge 2, Vigerio 1, Remolino 1,and Medici 1. Medici himself—who voted for Soderini, Antonio del Monte, and Pietro Accolti—received the vote of Matthäus Schiner. Riario received not a single vote—so much for the designation papabile. Although Pirie subscribes this outcome to chance (see below), Roscoe argues that Alborense had the support of the older cardinals, while the younger, and particularly the royal and noble cardinals supported Medici. The alternative view, however, points out that the Older Cardinals and the papabili were astonished at the votes for Serra. It cannot be, therefore, that all <b>those</b> <b>votes</b> were their own. [...] Rather, some of the thirteen votes for Cardinal Serra (Alborese) came from the supporters of Medici, that is, the 'Younger Cardinals', {{who did not want to}} reveal their support for Medici ahead of the appropriate moment.|$|E
