40|$|While tobacco {{production}} and exports {{prove to be}} one of the major activities by most developing countries, making tobacco a strategic crop in enhancing their economies, there has been mounting pressure worldwide through international bodies such as the World Health Organization and World Bank to reduce consumption of this crop as it is considered to have drastic health implications. Increased, integrated and harmonized action to reduce the tobacco burden is therefore key priority to improving public health and alleviating poverty. As a way to reduce tobacco imports, internal trade and consumption, a number of countries worldwide especially developed, enacted trade taxes through which tobacco is covered by high import and retailing taxes. This thesis therefore explored the impact of tobacco trade taxation, on developing countries as one of the key evidence-based tobacco control and demand reduction measures. The thesis makes use of current tobacco trade policies and stipulated tobacco import and retailing taxes; through the Global simulation Model developed by Francois & Hall (2003) to analyze the impact of such taxes on developing economies’ <b>tobacco</b> <b>sectors.</b> The simulated GSIM scenarios indicate that tobacco trade restriction changes in China have a greater impact on developing countries <b>tobacco</b> <b>sectors</b> than in other markets, with world prices in developing countries going up an average 3. 8 % while output goes up 1. 3 %, when import tariff in China is scratched off. The extended GSIM results show a negative impact of tax on developing countries while contributing positively to reducing tobacco demand and consumption. A 10 % point increase in cigarette tax will reduce global tobacco output by average 0. 39 %.

As such, fluecured tobacco production in southern Ontario is both typical {{in terms of its}} restructuring in response to capital intensification, but atypical in that restructuring has also occurred as a result of official pressures to reduce domestic cigarette consumption. This paper first describes rapid initial growth of the Ontario flue-cured <b>tobacco</b> <b>sector</b> from 1920 to its adoption of supply management in 1957. It then examines the two subsequent periods of restructuring: the first from 1957 to 1981 characterized by mechanization, intensification and inelastic market conditions; the second period from 1981 to the present, marked by the additional pressures of anti-smoking campaigns and legislation. While restructuring has affected all the areas of tobacco production, evidence suggests that peripheral and outlying regions have experienced the greatest reductions in farm numbers and tobacco acreage. A particular aspect of the restructuring has been how the state and individuals respond to the forces of restructuring.

40|$|This study quantitatively {{analyzes}} the general equilibrium effects of declines in world demand for tobacco products. The study finds that tobacco exports and {{production in the}} three developing countries, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Turkey, would be badly hit if world tobacco prices fall due to the decline in tobacco demand. Moreover, for a given decrease in the world tobacco price, the more important the <b>tobacco</b> <b>sector</b> is in an economy, the worse the <b>tobacco</b> <b>sector</b> is hit. Tobacco is quite important to the Malawian and Zimbabwean economies as tobacco production and trade accounted for, respectively, 17 % and 43 % of agricultural GDP and tobacco exports accounted for 50 % and 35 % of national exports in these two countries. The negative effects of a decline in world tobacco prices on the Malawian and Zimbabwean economies are much larger than that on the Turkish economy.

This research aims to analyze the change of excise in cigarette consumption and its impact to Central Java’s output and household income. The first step is to analyze the impact of change in cigarette excise in cigarette consumption using panel data econometrics Fixed Effect Model (FEM) method during the period of 2009 - 2013 between 35 regencies/cities in Central Java. The second step is to analyze the impact of cigarette consumption in Central Java’s output and sectoral household income.

Besides the impact analysis, this research also analyzes prime sectors with high linkages with cigarette industries and other sectors in Central Java’s economy.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the nature of}} governance in the Zimbabwean tobacco value chain and what upgrading implications this has for participants {{at the lower end}} of the value chain, with a particular focus on smallholder tobacco growers. The nature of governance and upgrading opportunities will provide further implications for broader economic development in Zimbabwe. Value chain analysis was the over-arching method, adopting a mixed methods approach of both quantitative and qualitative data analysis. Data attained from the Tobacco and Industry Marketing Board (TIMB) was used to construct a Zimbabwean tobacco profile. This information was used to construct a simple Global Value Chain (GVC) framework in order to obtain an understanding of the Zimbabwean tobacco value chain. Information was gathered at the top end of the value chain via documents and data from British American Tobacco (BAT) and information was gathered at the middle and lower end of the value chain through interviews. It was found that the Zimbabwean tobacco value chain is characterised by two types of governance: modular and hierarchy. Modular governance existed where the value chain was disjointed by the leaf merchant and hierarchy governance existed where cigarette manufacturers have vertically integrated themselves backwards into the tobacco growing segment. It was found that contract lines offer smallholder tobacco growers’ financial and technical support that would otherwise be difficult to attain. This increased the likelihood for smallholder tobacco growers to produce a high quality crop that met Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and other compliancy requirements; therefore achieving product and process upgrading. However, the environmental impact of tobacco growing through deforestation and the possibility of lead cigarette manufacturers relocating their operations to a different geographical location (as is the nature of GVCs) threatens the sustainability of Zimbabwe’s tobacco industry. Despite these issues it was argued that the tobacco value chain could assist Zimbabwe’s economy in diversifying away from simple tobacco production towards valueadding <b>tobacco</b> <b>sectors,</b> such as processing, by-product processing and cigarette manufacturing...|$|R

Assuming that innovation contributes for competitiveness, the current work intends to focus on the relation between innovation and international competitiveness of two European small economies, namely Portugal and Latvia. There is evidence that small economies are characterized by higher trade liberalization and higher international competitiveness. To better understand the relation amongst innovation and international competitiveness, within the scope of the two small economies under study, it’s performed a comparative analysis between both countries and employed a statistical and sectorial analysis, with a shift-share analysis. Even under harsh economic conditions, innovation occurred in both countries. The results show that the international competitiveness of Portugal is related with its expenditures on R&D and patent applications while the Latvian international competitiveness is evidenced only with expenditures on R&D. The most internationally competitive sector of is the other manufactured goods and in Latvia is the food, drinks and <b>tobacco</b> <b>sectors.</b> Both countries show evidence of international competitiveness’ potential in the sector of transport and machinery equipment. A estratégia Europeia 2020 contempla a inovação nos seus principais objetivos para catalisar o progresso no sentido de construir uma economia Europeia mais competitiva e sustentável.
