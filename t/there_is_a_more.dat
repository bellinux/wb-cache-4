5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and the answer is a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E

25|$|The West German {{government}} in made a rough estimate in 1956 of 20,000 civilians {{killed during the}} 1945 military campaign in current post war German borders, not including the former German territories in Poland. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> recent estimate of 22,000 civilians killed during the fighting in Berlin only.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> open {{police force}} within Poland, many {{organizations}} still hold issues with police brutality within Poland. The 2013 United States Department of State report on Poland raised several issues of police brutality. The report cited {{a case of}} police officers using violence to gain a confession for armed robbery in 2012. However, it also noted that these police officers were eventually indicted for police brutality.|$|E
50|$|After Prince bowed {{out of the}} election, and Chappelle's {{original}} count had him leading Prince, adding Prince's {{votes to}} his own would have definitely further solidified the victory.

2500|$|Throughout East Texas, {{black family}} growth and {{dissolution}} came {{more rapidly than}} in peacetime; blacks <b>were</b> <b>more</b> mobile as <b>an</b> adjustment to employment opportunities. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> rapid shift to factory labor, higher economic returns, and a willingness of whites to tolerate the change in black economic status {{so long as the}} traditional [...] "Jim Crow" [...] social relations were maintained.|$|R
25|$|The {{operation}} and maintenance of state run irrigation systems is paid for with fees based on surface area irrigated and not by how much water is used. Generally, the collected fees do not cover the real costs of energy needed to irrigate the land. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> recent fee aimed at covering this difference that includes an annual payment {{for a period of}} 40 years whereby the state will recuperate about 60% of the money invested on projects.|$|E
25|$|While {{there has}} been a {{tendency}} to focus on the bystander effect in disease due to the possibility of therapeutic avenues there is evidence that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> central role in normal development of tissues. Death of some cells and their surrounding matrix may be required for a tissue to reach its final configuration and gap junctions also appear essential to this process. There are also more complex studies that try and combine our understanding of the simultaneous roles of gap junctions in both wound healing and tissue development.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a major}} {{rebuilding}} programme in {{the decades}} following the war, in some parts (such as at the Barbican) dramatically altering the urban landscape. But {{the destruction of the}} older historic fabric allowed the construction of modern and larger-scale developments, whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage the City retains its older character of smaller buildings. The street pattern, which is still largely medieval, was altered slightly in places, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> recent trend of reversing some of the post-war modernist changes made, such as at Paternoster Square.|$|E
50|$|After {{the second}} world war, modern {{materials}} and techniques such as concrete and metal panels were introduced in Norwegian church construction. Bodø Cathedral for instance was built in reinforced concrete allowing a wide basilica to be built. During the 1960s <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pronounced break from tradition as in the Arctic Cathedral built in lightweight concrete and covered in aluminum sidings.|$|R
50|$|But as the Twentieth Century moved nearer and nearer its close, {{the world}} had shrunk {{to the point that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little room for living in secret and the power of {{humankind}} had grown to doomsday proportions. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pressing need than ever to emerge, to make themselves felt; to influence, to control the destiny of the planet they shared with us.|$|R

25|$|If {{the laser}} use {{is for a}} show or display in the U.S., <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{stringent}} regulatory process. In the U.S., any use of lasers in a show or display requires pre-approval from the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health. This is required both for the laser equipment, and separately for the show itself (site, audience configuration, beam effects, etc.). As part of the CDRH's show approval ("variance") process, the CDRH will require a letter of non-objection from the FAA. Without this, the laser show cannot legally proceed.|$|E
25|$|In Harry's {{sixth year}} at Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters are {{increasing}} their terror upon the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore persuades {{his old friend}} Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as a professor {{as there is a}} vacancy to fill. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> important reason, however, for Slughorn's return. While in a Potions lesson, Harry takes possession of a strangely annotated school textbook, inscribed 'This is the property of the Half-Blood Prince'. Draco Malfoy struggles to carry out a deed presented to him by Voldemort. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Harry secretly work together to discover the method on how to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{above ground}} {{structure}} is the bus station, with its entrance {{on the east}} side of Spadina Road just north of Bloor Street, which currently serves as the terminus of the 127 Davenport bus route. Originally, it was built to serve as a looping facility for the former 77 Spadina bus which operated until the underground streetcar loop was added and the buses were replaced by 510 Spadina streetcars. This rather subdued building, with its pseudo mansard roof and brick arches and no obvious bold signage like most other station entrances, is located at the easterly end of the Bloor line platforms. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> typical secondary entrance building, directly opposite, on the west side of Spadina Road.|$|E

5|$|Social {{divisions}} {{did appear}} both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland. The economy and {{society of the}} north had modernized more slowly {{than those of the}} south, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pronounced conflict between Christianity and socialism in the north, and farmland had a major social status; ownership of even a small parcel of land created a motivation to fight against the Reds.|$|R
40|$|A frequency-dependent {{selection}} model {{proposed by}} Huang, Singh and Kojima (1971) {{was found to}} be more effective at maintaining genetic variation in a finite population than the overdominant model. The fourth moment parameter of the distribution of unfixed states showed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> platykurtic distribution for the frequency-dependent model. This agreed well with the expected gene frequency change found for an infinite population...|$|R
500|$|Based on {{the surface}} appearance, three lobes can be {{distinguished}} within the cerebellum: the anterior lobe (above the primary fissure), the posterior lobe (below the primary fissure), and the flocculonodular lobe (below the posterior fissure). These lobes divide the cerebellum from rostral to caudal (in humans, top to bottom). In terms of function, however, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> important distinction along the medial-to-lateral dimension. Leaving out the flocculonodular lobe, which has distinct connections and functions, the cerebellum can be parsed functionally into a medial sector called the spinocerebellum and a larger lateral sector called the cerebrocerebellum. A narrow strip of protruding tissue along the midline is called the cerebellar vermis. (Vermis is Latin for [...] "worm".) ...|$|E
500|$|On January 22, 2008, a {{test program}} was begun by ADOT which {{involved}} {{the placement of}} travel times to popular commuter destinations on variable message signs along inbound freeway routes during the morning peak hours and outbound routes in the evening. Initially, these signs were only activated on weekdays during peak travel hours (6am to 9am and 3pm to 7pm) and did not appear if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> urgent message to display; such as an Amber Alert or other emergency. [...] In late July 2015, the hours when travel times were displayed were extended. [...] Travel times are now displayed from 5am to 11pm on weekdays, and 7am to 9pm on weekends.|$|E

30|$|In {{the object}} {{positioning}} exercise, besides reduction in task time and overall score, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> also <b>a</b> reduction in path length. A reduction in path length {{may suggest that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> fluent and successful first time transfer of objects between {{one hand and the}} other and less accidental drop of the objects. This is further supported by the fact that task time was also reduced. These demonstrate an overall improvement on laparoscopic dexterity.|$|R

500|$|The {{differences}} between the two breeds include bone structure, body length, and size. Cardigans are the larger of the two breeds, with large rounded ears and a [...] fox-like, flowing tail set in line with the body. Though the Cardigan is allowed more colours than the Pembroke, white should not predominate in its coat. The Cardigan is a double-coated dog where the outer coat is dense, slightly harsh in texture, and of medium length. The dog's undercoat is short, soft, and thick. According to the breed standard, the breed stands between [...] at the withers, and should weigh between [...] The skeletal structure of the Cardigan differs from the Pembroke, in that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> exaggerated bend in the front two legs, which fits around the ribcage of the animal.

500|$|The Softwire is {{actually}} a story that Haarsma began imagining in his childhood. As a teenager, he worked at his parents' ceramic factory during the summers, hauling fifty pound molds around in the extreme heat of a kiln room. To Haarsma, it felt similar to what the children of his books might feel as slaves. In addition to these experiences, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> prominent influence on the premise of The Softwire—that is, there is a mystery of a journey to a new, unknown place {{to start a new}} life. Growing up, Haarsma dreamed of moving to the United States; and in his twenties, he actually did. While there, living in New York, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles, Haarsma [...] witnessed immigrants struggling to get by. He tried to imagine what caused them to risk everything, and to move to another country, and to have a chance at something better. It is this journey (and struggle) that is prevalent in The Softwire.|$|E
