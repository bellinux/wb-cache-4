40|$|In a cyclone {{the centre}} of the {{swirling}} flow, denoted as the vortex core, is precessing about the geometrical centre of the cyclone. In this research project, the aim was to get more insight in the influence of this precessing vortex core (PVC) on the velocity field of the cyclone. Therefore, at several horizontal stations Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) measurements were carried out to determine the axial and tangential velocity components along the cyclone radius. A <b>trigger</b> <b>procedure</b> has been developed to estimate the velocity profiles corresponding to the extreme positions of the PVC with respect to the LDA-probe. This <b>trigger</b> <b>procedure</b> makes use of the periodical component in the measured tangential LDA signal itself to estimate the trigger time intervals. To estimate the periodical interference from the tangential velocity signal, an adaptive noise canceling configuration (ANCC) has been implemented. This algorithm is capable of tracking the quasi periodic circular movement of the PVC. By combining the <b>trigger</b> <b>procedure</b> and the ANCC it is possible to estimate the triggered profiles of both the axial and the tangential velocity components. The resulting standard deviation of the triggered velocity does not show the expected decrease. By subtracting the estimation of the periodical component and the tangential velocity signal, the standard deviation in {{the centre of}} the cyclone was reduced by 40 %. A remarkable observation was the disappearance of the periodical interference in the LDA signal at r ? 0. 6 Rc for all measured profiles. It was assumed that the extreme velocity profiles intersect at this position. Further research is necessary to confirm this. Kramers Laboratorium voor Fysische TechnologieApplied Science...|$|E

Given its extraordinary reactivity and biological importance, it is surprising how few applications within organic synthesis exist.

About a decade ago, we discovered a mild anionic <b>triggering</b> <b>procedure</b> to generate transitory o-QMs at low temperature from readily available salicylaldehydes, particularly OBoc derivatives. This novel reaction cascade included both the o-QM formation and the subsequent consumption reaction.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} MWIS, a distributed algorithm for {{the efficient}} determination of a maximal weighted independent {{set in the}} topology graph G of a wireless network. Motivated by the observation {{that the problem of}} partitioning wireless nodes into clusters easily reduces to the problem of finding a maximal weighted independent set of nodes, the proposed algorithm is described by taking into account two main characteristics of wireless networks, namely, the broadcast nature of the wireless medium and the possibility to support nodes mobility. MWIS is executed at each node by means of fast message <b>triggered</b> <b>procedures</b> that require the sole knowledge of the topology local to the node. Moreover, its time complexity is proven to be bounded by a topology dependent parameter of the network (the stability number α(G) of the network topology graph G), rather than by the invariant number n of the network nodes. Based on this result, and by using a well known result about α(G) in the theory of random graphs the paper concludes with a brief discussion on the average time complexity of MWIS...|$|R
40|$|Ground {{failure in}} Adapazari, Turkey during the 1999 Kocaeli {{earthquake}} was severe. Hundreds of structures settled, slid, tilted, and collapsed {{due in part}} to liquefaction and ground softening. Ground failure was more severe adjacent to and under buildings. The soils that led to severe building damage were generally low plasticity silts. In this paper, the results of a comprehensive investigation of the soils of Adapazari, which included cone penetration test (CPT) profiles followed by borings with standard penetration tests (SPTs) and soil index tests, are presented. The effects of subsurface conditions on the occurrence of ground failure and its resulting effect on building performance are explored through representative case histories. CPT- and SPT-based liquefaction <b>triggering</b> <b>procedures</b> adequately identified soils that liquefied if the clay-size criterion of the Chinese criteria was disregarded.

40|$|It {{is often}} stated that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have typical {{energies}} of several hundreds keV, where the typical energy may {{be characterized by}} the hardness H, the photon energy corresponding to the peak of νFν. Among the 54 BATSE bursts analyzed by Band et al. (1993), and 136 analyzed by us, more then 60 % have 50 keV < H < 300 keV. Is the narrow range of H a real feature of GRBs or is it due to an observational difficulty to detect harder bursts? We consider a population of standard candle bursts with a hardness distribution: ρ(H) d logH ∝ H γ d log H and no luminosity- hardness correlation. We model the detection algorithm of BATSE {{as a function of}} H, including cosmological effects, detector characteristics and <b>triggering</b> <b>procedure,</b> and we calculate the expected distribution of H in the observed sample for various values of γ. Both samples shows a paucity of soft (X-ray) bursts, which may be real. However, we find that the observed samples are consistent with a distribution above H = 120 keV with γ ∼ − 0. 5 (a slowly decreasing numbers of GRBs per decade of hardness). Thus, we suggest that a large population of unobserved hard gamma-ray bursts may exist. Subject headings: gamma rays: bursts – 2 – 1...|$|R

40|$|The period September–November 2007 was {{characterized}} at Mount Etna by explosive activity and intense degassing. During this time interval, infrasonic signals were recorded by an infrasonic network. By a <b>triggering</b> <b>procedure,</b> about 1000 infrasonic events were found, characterized by very high signal-to-noise ratio and grouped into nine families. Successively, the spectral analysis allowed subdividing these nine families into three clusters {{based on the}} peak frequency and the quality factor of the events. Finally, by the location analysis a cluster (cluster 1) {{was related to the}} degassing activity of the northeast crater (NEC), while the other two (clusters 2 and 3) to the explosive activity of the southeast crater (SEC). The comparison between the stacked infrasonic waveforms, interpreted as generated by the vibration of large gas bubbles, and the synthetic ones, permitted to calculate radius, length of the bubble, and initial overpressure, by a genetic algorithm method. The higher overpressure values of cluster 3 compared to the cluster 2 values were in good agreement with the stronger intensity of the explosions accompanying the infrasonic events of cluster 3. The variation of both intensities and waveforms is tentatively attributed to the occasional accumulation of lithic clasts (due to moderate landslides?) on the explosive vent. Indeed, events belonging to cluster 3 were no longer observed once the landslides had ended. Finally, the daily emitted gas volume, related to the active degassing, was estimated for NEC and SEC by using the infrasonic data during the studied period...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{probabilistic}} sediment cascade model to simulate sediment transfer {{in a mountain}} basin (Illgraben, Switzerland) where sediment is produced by hillslope landslides and rockfalls and exported out of the basin by debris flows and floods. The model conceptualizes the fluvial system as a spatially lumped cascade of connected reservoirs representing hillslope and channel storages where sediment goes through cycles of storage and remobilization by surface runoff. The model includes all relevant hydrological processes that lead to runoff formation in an Alpine basin, such as precipitation, snow accumulation, snowmelt, evapotranspiration, and soil water storage. Although the processes of sediment transfer and debris flow generation are described in a simplified manner, the model produces complex sediment discharge behavior which {{is driven by the}} availability of sediment and antecedent wetness conditions (system memory) as well as the triggering potential (climatic forcing). The observed probability distribution of debris flow volumes and their seasonality in 2000 – 2009 are reproduced. The stochasticity of hillslope sediment input is important for reproducing realistic sediment storage variability, although many details of the hillslope landslide <b>triggering</b> <b>procedures</b> are filtered out by the sediment transfer system. The model allows us to explicitly quantify the division into transport and supply-limited sediment discharge events. We show that debris flows may be generated {{for a wide range of}} rainfall intensities because of variable antecedent basin wetness and snowmelt contribution to runoff, which helps to understand the limitations of methods based on a single rainfall threshold for debris flow initiation in Alpine basins...|$|R
