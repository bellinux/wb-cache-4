5|$|During {{a mission}} which {{occurred}} on a disputed date, either 23 January or 25 January, Overton and his squadron commander, ace Edwin L. Heller flew {{north of the}} Yalu River in search of MiG formations. Heller and Overton both shot down aircraft, some sources say {{this was one of}} Overton's first five victories, while others say <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>his</b> sixth and seventh, for which he never received credit, but Heller was struck by a MiG and crashed. He was either 60 or 150 miles north of the Yalu River line, so a rescue attempt was not made. This was later seen as one of the reasons Overton was singled out for reprimand for crossing the Yalu River. Most sources attribute Overton with only five victories.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, {{following}} {{his release from}} prison, {{it was announced that}} Evans would resume training with Sheffield United after the Professional Footballers' Association had requested that Sheffield United let Evans train at the club as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>his</b> last club before his conviction. The decision was controversial, and caused television presenter Charlie Webster, businesswoman Lindsay Graham and musicians Dave Berry and Paul Heaton to resign as patrons of the club. Athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill stated that she would want her name removed from a stand at Bramall Lane if Evans were signed by the club.|$|E

Kira is the Ultimate Coordinator; his fetus was artificially developed outside his mother's womb and his genetic enhancements {{were intended to}} be superior to all other Coordinators. Kira was the only fetus to survive the process. He was born as the twin brother of his comrade Cagalli Yula Athha but does not learn about this relationship until {{the latter half of}} the series. Kira was adopted by his aunt Caridad and uncle Haruma Yamato and was led to believe <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>his</b> biological parents. Despite being shocked by his origins as the Ultimate Coordinator, Kira continues to fight alongside the Archangel until their opponents, including Rau, have been defeated and the war comes to end.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of Sabaean {{influence}} {{is found in}} northern Ethiopia, where the South Arabian alphabet, religion and pantheon, and the South Arabian style of art and architecture were introduced.

Two of these songs, The Sneezing Song and Three Little Pigs were sung by Scott-Gatty {{himself in a}} concert at Doncaster Grammar School on 21 June 1870, long before they were published. He sang Three Little Pigs again in 1871 along with Camomile Tea, Tittle Tattle and The Yawning Song.|$|E
25|$|Balance {{sheets and}} Profit and Loss {{statements}} served one major purpose, {{if not the}} only one, for Ivar and that was {{they had to be}} helpful in his fund raising efforts. Often they were just pure fantasy to be revised at will to please investors. He also frequently treated the assets of corporations he controlled as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>his</b> own. However, things should be seen {{in the context of the}} time. IBM, for example, consolidated all its accounts in one named Plant, Property, Equipment, Machines, Patents and Goodwill. American Can doubled its reported net earnings in 1913 by claiming only $1 million of depreciation after having claimed $2.5 million the previous year. Many companies set up arbitrary reserves in good times to be used in bad years and few holding companies published consolidated financial statements.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Norman {{opened the}} 1996 Masters Tournament with a course record-tying 63 which {{put him at}} the top of the leaderboard. He held the lead through three days of play. Norman took a six-stroke lead into the final round and lost the tournament to Nick Faldo by five strokes, shooting a Sunday 78 to Faldo's 67. In January 1997, Norman won his largest winner's check to date, one million dollars, when he won the Andersen Consulting World Championship of Golf. Norman then won two tournaments in 1997, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>his</b> final victories on the PGA Tour. In 1998, Norman missed part of the season after suffering hip and shoulder injuries. He contended in the 1999 Masters tournament, tying for the lead with five holes remaining before finishing third, three strokes behind, and again in the 1999 Open Championship, eventually finishing 6th, three strokes behind.|$|E

25|$|The {{two were}} the result of an {{experiment}} in genetic recombination in which two parent cells were separated into complementary haploid gametes, and recombined into two embryos. The resulting zygotes were implanted in a woman and gestated by her, with the result that although both have the same mother and genetic parents, they are no more closely related genetically than any two people taken at random. They have been prevented from sexual relations by a chastity belt; but having confirmed that there is no risk of genetic disease in their offspring (described as the only valid reason against incest), Lazarus solemnizes their marriage and later establishes them as the owners and operators of a thriving business. At the end of the story, he reveals a belief that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>his</b> own descendants, from an earlier period when he had been a slave on the same planet.|$|E
25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>his</b> own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which {{made its first}} appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets {{for a piece of}} evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E
25|$|Waugh and Mark Taylor {{opened on}} debut against Tasmania at Hobart's TCA Ground. New South Wales were sent into bat and Waugh was {{dismissed}} for 13 and New South Wales fell to 3/60 {{in the first}} innings. He scored 28 in the second innings, but the drawn match was more notable for an incident on the third morning, when the new opening pair overslept on Taylor's 21st birthday. They were punished by coach Bob Simpson with fielding driils, forcing the pair to take hundreds of catches. His took his first catch, that of Roger Woolley on debut. Waugh fell on tough times, being dismissed for a duck and four by Test bowler Merv Hughes in the next match against Victoria and then 17 and a run out for another duck against the touring New Zealand. With a first-class average of 10.33, Waugh was dropped {{for the next five}} matches. However, for the final four matches of the season, Waugh was recalled to the team as a front-line fast bowler and middle order batsman. He took 4/130 in the first innings against Queensland in his first match in the role. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>his</b> first-class wickets. His bowling was characterised by his liberal use of short-pitched bowling. In the next match against Tasmania, Waugh opened the bowling with Mike Whitney, due to injuries to other bowlers, taking 2/31 in the first innings. Waugh then took 3/49 in the final round robin match against Queensland, before the teams met again for the Sheffield Shielf final at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Whitney and Waugh were New South Wales' only pacemen, and Waugh bowled 27 overs to take 1/71. Batting at No. 7, Waugh was involved in a century stand with Greg Dyer to help avoid the follow on with 41. Waugh made only 24 in the second innings as the home team hung on for a draw to secure the Shield. Waugh had scored 167 runs at 15.18 and took 11 wickets at 32.00 for the season. He played in one limited-overs match, scoring 13 and taking 1/28 against Victoria.|$|E
