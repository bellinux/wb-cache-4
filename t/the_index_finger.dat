5|$|Garcia married Gerda Martin on January 13, 1951; {{they had}} three children. He served as a sponsor for Camel {{cigarettes}} during his playing days. Garcia raced midget cars during and after his baseball career. Garcia injured <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of his throwing hand while working on a midget car in late 1959, but the wound was repaired without lasting effects.|$|E
5|$|Many {{examples}} of rock art by the Muisca {{have been discovered}} on the Altiplano. The first rock art has been discovered by conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada during the Spanish conquest of the Muisca. The rock art consists of petroglyphs (carvings) and petrographs (drawings). The petrographs were made using <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> Pioneer {{in the study of}} the rock art has been Miguel Triana. Later contributions have been done by Diego Martínez, Eliécer Silva Celis and others. It is theorised that the rock art has been made under the influence of ayahuasca (yahé).|$|E
5|$|The gesture {{dates back}} to Ancient Greece {{and it was also}} used in Ancient Rome. Historically, it {{represented}} the phallus. In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists (notably more common among hardcore punk bands and rappers), actors, celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Most still view the gesture as obscene. <b>The</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> and ring finger besides the middle finger in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testicles.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 52 -year-old woman with micronychia of <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers.</b> Radiographic {{examination}} revealed a Y-shaped bifurcation of the distal phalanx of both <b>index</b> <b>fingers.</b> She {{was diagnosed with}} congenital onychodysplasia of <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> (COIF) or Iso-Kikuchi syndrome. COIF is a rare condition characterized {{by a variety of}} nail dysplasia of <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers.</b> Five criteria characterize COIF: congenital occurrence, unilateral or bilateral <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> involvement, variability in nail appearance, hereditary involvement and frequently associated bone abnormalities. Micronychia, polyonychia, anonychia, hemionychrogryphosis and malalignment are <b>the</b> observed <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> defects. Most cases have been described in Japan, and to our knowledge, this is the first case of COIF reported in South America...|$|R
5000|$|Japanese Opening: The Japanese Opening {{is similar}} to Opening A, however the strings are picked up with the middle <b>fingers</b> instead of <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Congenital onychodysplasia of <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> {{is defined}} by the {{presence}} of the condition at birth, either unilateral or bilateral <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> involvement, variable distortion of the nail or lunula, and polyonychia, micronychia, anonychia, hemionychogryphosis, or malalignment.|$|R
5|$|Wilson {{became a}} Christian {{at the age}} of 23. He has adopted a gesture of {{crossing}} his arms, with his left hand in his glove and his right hand underneath pointing with <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> while looking at the sky, which both honors The Holy Trinity as well as his late father who died of cancer when Wilson was 17. He performs it when he records a save or closes out a game.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow tremor {{of the hand}} at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the tendency of <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E
25|$|When {{actively}} fishing, the angler {{may want}} to keep the fly line lightly pressed against the rod handle with <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of the casting arm. The free arm is used to pull line from the reel or to retrieve line from the water. If a fish strikes, the angler can pinch the line with <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> against the rod handle and lift the rod tip, setting the hook.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} and intermanual transfer of curvature aftereffects was studied for static and dynamic touch, whereby only <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> were used. A curvature aftereffect is the phenomenon that {{a flat surface}} is judged concave if the preceding touched stimulus was convex and vice versa. Substantial aftereffects were demonstrated when the subsequently presented adaptation and test stimulus were touched by <b>the</b> same <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> When one <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> was used to touch the adaptation stimulus and <b>the</b> opposite <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> was employed to touch the test stimulus, only a partial transfer of the aftereffect was found for static touch, but a complete transfer was obtained in the dynamic case. These {{findings suggest that the}} representation of curvature information depends on the exploration mode...|$|R
5000|$|Opening A: Following from Position 1, <b>the</b> right <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> {{picks up}} <b>the</b> string {{on the left}} hand going between the thumb and the little <b>finger.</b> <b>The</b> left <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> then goes between both strings of right <b>index</b> <b>finger,</b> {{and picks up the}} string going from the right thumb to little finger.|$|R

25|$|The Workman layout {{employs a}} {{hypothesis}} about the preferential movement of each finger rather than categorically considering the lowest letter row to be least accessible. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> prefers to curl inwards rather than stretch outwards. So for <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger,</b> {{the position of}} second preference goes to the bottom row rather than the top row. Contrarily, the middle and ring fingers are relatively long and prefer to stretch out rather than curl in. Based on this, weighting is allotted to each key specifically rather than each row generically.|$|E

25|$|How {{the brush}} is held {{depends on the}} {{calligrapher}} and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. <b>The</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> lightly touches {{the upper part of}} the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger,</b> very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or her grip depending on the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for cursive and lower for regular script.|$|E

25|$|The pad-to-pad pinch {{between the}} {{thumb and index}} finger is made {{possible}} because of the human ability to passively hyperextend the distal phalanx of <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> Most non-human primates have to flex their long fingers in order for the small thumb to reach them.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, {{the growth}} rate of nails is related to the length of the {{terminal}} phalanges (outermost finger bones). Thus, in humans, the nail of <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> grows faster than that of the little finger; and fingernails grow up to four times faster than toenails.|$|E
25|$|The key pinch is {{a simple}} grasp in which the thumb applies force to an object to hold it against the lateral side of <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> Restoring this {{function}} allows a patient to hold objects such as a fork or pen that are necessary for {{activities of daily living}} such as eating, self-grooming and self-catheterization.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} part of balalaika technique {{is the use of}} the left thumb to fret notes on the lower string, particularly on the prima, where it is used to form chords. Traditionally, the side of <b>the</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of the right hand is used to sound notes on the prima, while a plectrum is used on the larger sizes.|$|E
