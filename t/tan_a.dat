5|$|The {{highway to}} Xuyen Moc {{in the east}} had been reopened by the Australians in March and April, and with the Viet Cong 275th Regiment {{believed}} to have been severely weakened following Long <b>Tan,</b> <b>a</b> series of operations aimed at destroying the Viet Cong 274th Regiment were subsequently launched by 1 ATF. Australian assessments of the Viet Cong 275th Regiment were seemingly reinforced by its unsuccessful attempt to ambush a convoy from US 11th Armoured Cavalry Regiment (11 ACR) on 2 December 1966. Meanwhile, after Westmoreland had again pressed Vincent on what he saw as the limited results achieved by Australian tactics, a large joint US-Australian operation was mounted against the May Tao mountains in Phuoc Tuy, moving against the communist bases in the area. The largest search and destroy operation mounted by the Australians to that point, Operation Paddington (9–15 July) was carried out in co-operation with American and South Vietnamese units based in Bien Hoa province, and targeted the Viet Cong 5th Division.|$|E

25|$|On 17August 1969, A and D Companies of 6 RAR landed by {{helicopter}} near the former battle site and secured the area. The next morning, infantrymen and assault pioneers cleared {{the area around}} the location where 11 Platoon of D Company had conducted a last stand during the Battle of Long <b>Tan.</b> <b>A</b> Royal Australian Air Force helicopter then delivered the cross to the site. The remainder of the battalion arrived during the morning, and 6 RAR's chaplain led a ceremony to dedicate the memorial. Ten men from the battalion who had fought in the battle stood {{at the side of the}} cross throughout the proceedings. The ceremony concluded before noon, and 6 RAR returned to the nearby major Australian base at Nui Dat; D Company was the last element of the battalion to leave the site.|$|E
25|$|Although D Company {{ultimately}} prevailed {{they would}} have been defeated {{were it not for the}} timely arrival of the cavalry and the availability of significant artillery support. The Australians had come close to disaster and the battle brought home the dangers of a dismounted platoon or company being overwhelmed, while several deficiencies had been evident in 1 ATF's preparation and response. As the fighting began there was no ready reaction force available at Nui Dat, resulting in a lengthy delay reinforcing D Company. After Long <b>Tan</b> <b>a</b> rifle company with armoured support was dedicated to this role, on standby to respond to an attack or exploit any opportunity. Meanwhile, the Viet Cong had been armed with weapons at least equal to those used by the Australians. Most had carried modern Soviet assault rifles, as well as a large quantity of ammunition, which allowed them to sustain a high rate of fire. In contrast, the amount of ammunition carried by the Australians had been insufficient, and following the battle the minimum load was increased to 140 rounds per rifle and 500 for each machine-gun. Equally the aerial resupply of D Company had been delayed because there were no prepacked ammunition available. This also changed, while rounds would also be supplied loaded in magazines for quick use. The Viet Cong had also used 60mm mortars, but they were no longer standard equipment for Australian rifle companies, and although battalions were issued 81mm mortars they were controlled by Support Company. Such weapons would afford integral fire support in situations where their opponents had closed within the safety distance of the artillery, and consideration was given to their re-issue. Yet the added weight would limit the ability of sub-units to patrol and M-79 grenade launchers were issued instead, while a number of APCs were modified as mortar carriers.|$|E

An early second half goal by Pontius was enough for a 1-0 home win over Columbus, but United next dropped a road match in Kansas City, despite a first-half goal by DeLeon. With two home games next, United was able to secure a draw against the Union, despite an early goal by former D.C. United regular Brian Carroll. United scored the tying goal on an own goal that came on a free kick taken by Branko Bošković, but Bošković was ejected 20 minutes later because of a scrum after De Rosario had {{seemingly}} earned the win for United with penalty kick goal in the 87th minute.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} impact of a skin cancer {{prevention}} intervention that promoted sunless <b>tanning</b> as <b>a</b> substitute for sunbathing. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Public beaches in Massachusetts. Participants: Women (N = 250) were recruited {{to participate in the study}} during their visit to a public beach. Intervention: The intervention included motivational messages to use sunless <b>tanning</b> as <b>an</b> alternative to UV tanning, instructions for proper use of sunless tanning products, attractive images of women with sunless <b>tans,</b> <b>a</b> free trial of <b>a</b> sunless <b>tanning</b> product, skin cancer education, and UV imaging. The control participants completed surveys. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was sunbathing 2 months and 1 year after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included sunburns, sun protection use, and sunless tanning. Results: At 2 months, intervention participants reduced their sunbathing significantly more than did controls and reported significantly fewer sunburns and greater use of protective clothing. At 1 year, intervention participants reported significant decreases in sunbathing and increases in sunless tanning relative to control participants but no differences in the other outcomes. Conclusion: This intervention, which promoted sunless <b>tanning</b> as <b>an</b> alternative to UV <b>tanning,</b> had <b>a</b> short-term effect on sunbathing, sunburns, and use of protective clothing and a longer-term effect on sunbathing and sunless tanning.
