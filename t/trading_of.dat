5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} differences between proto-globalization and archaic globalization was the switch from inter-nation <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> rarities to the <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> commodities. During the 12th and 13th centuries it was common to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures. A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as porcelain, silk and spices. Traders of the pre-modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar cane and other crops.|$|E

On account of the unavailability of some of the relevant data, this study cannot cover all the concepts of the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> Hence, this study will concentrate only on the analysis which can be measured. The concepts of the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in this study are the net barter terms <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> the gross barter terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> and the income terms <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> This study will investigate the trend of Thailand 2 ̆ 7 s terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in the period between 1975 and 1981, terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Thailand and Japan, terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Thailand and the United States, terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Thailand and ASEAN, and terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Thailand and EEC.

40|$|My {{empirical}} analysis a {{reveals a}} strong {{link between the}} terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> industrial and developing countries. I show that the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> developing countries are essentially the relative prices of commodity exports and manufactured imports. Similarly, I find that terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> fluctuations <b>of</b> industrial countries are heavily influenced by movements in the relative price of manufactured exports and commodity imports. This means that improvements in the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> developing countries imply a worsening in the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> developing industrial countries, and vice versa. One {{example of this is}} the explosion of oil prices in the early 1970 s.

With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination, Harding sought nomination as lieutenant governor, and both Herrick and Harding were nominated by acclamation.

Fisher already had a home in Nashville with new wife Carrie Underwood. The <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> Fisher, a fan favorite in Ottawa, lead to a small anti-Underwood backlash in the city with the banning of her songs from the play lists of some local radio stations. Murray next traded Chris Kelly, another veteran, to the Boston Bruins for a second-round pick in the 2011 draft. A few days later, pending unrestricted free agent Jarkko Ruutu was sent to the Anaheim Ducks {{in exchange for a}} sixth-round pick in 2011. A swap of goaltenders was made with the Colorado Avalanche which brought Craig Anderson to Ottawa in exchange for Brian Elliott. Both goalies were having sub-par seasons prior to the trade. Under-achieving forward Alex Kovalev was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a seventh-round draft pick. On trade deadline day, Ottawa picked up goaltender Curtis McElhinney on waivers, and traded Chris Campoli with a seventh-round pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for a second-round pick and Ryan Potulny. Goaltender Anderson played very well down the stretch for Ottawa, and the team quickly signed the soon-to-be unrestricted free agent to a four-year contract. After media speculation on the future of Murray within the organization, Murray was re-signed as general manager on April 8, to a three-year extension. On April 9, Head Coach Cory Clouston and assistants Greg Carvel and Brad Lauer were dismissed from their positions. Murray said that the decision was made {{based on the fact that}} the team entered the season believing it was a contender, but finished with a 32–40–10 record.
