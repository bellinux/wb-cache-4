The soundtrack to The Bouncer, of which Eguchi and Matsueda co-composed a lot of the pieces, featured among other genres rock, electronica, and jazz fusion. A professional pianist, Eguchi often utilizes the piano in his compositions.

5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E

40|$|<b>Three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>hour</b> polygraphic sleep {{studies were}} carried out in 10 infants, five with upper {{respiratory}} infection and five with metabolic alkalosis secondary to vomiting during and after recovery from illness. During upper respiratory infection, the main abnormality detected was brief (greater than 3 less than 6 seconds) or prolonged (greater than 6 seconds) attacks of obstructive apnoea. Other indices of apnoea were similar to recovery data. Gross body movements were also increased. In infants with metabolic alkalosis indices of central apnoea were significantly increased when compared with recovery or case control data. Prolonged (greater than 15 seconds) attacks of central apnoea and obstructive apnoea (greater than 6 seconds) were only observed during illness. Gross body movements and periodic breathing were also increased. These findings suggest that the functional consequences of apparently 'mild' illnesses in young infants may be greater than is generally suspected and perhaps relevant to mechanism(s) of death in sudden infant death syndrome...|$|R

25|$|Sibutramine is well absorbed {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract (77%), but undergoes considerable first-pass metabolism, reducing its bioavailability. The drug itself reaches its {{peak plasma level}} after 1 hour and has also a half-life of 1 hour. Sibutramine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4 into two pharmacologically-active primary and secondary amines (called active metabolites 1 and 2) with half-lives of 14 and 16 hours, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations of active metabolites 1 and 2 are reached after <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours.</b> The following metabolic pathway mainly results in two inactive conjugated and hydroxylated metabolites (called metabolites 5 and 6).

50|$|Despite {{implementation}} since 1997 of {{road space}} rationing {{by the last}} digit of the plate number during rush hours every weekday, traffic in this 20-million-strong city still experiences severe congestion. According to experts, {{this is due to}} the accelerated rate of motorization occurring since 2003 and the limited capacity of public transport. In São Paulo, traffic is growing at a rate of 7.5% per year, with almost 1,000 new cars bought in the city every day. The subway has only 61 km of lines, though 35 further kilometers are under construction or planned by 2010. Every day, many citizens spend between <b>three</b> up <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> behind the wheel.

As a child, Kwan grew up speaking a mixture of Cantonese and English at home. Kwan’s interest in figure skating began {{at the age of}} five when she followed her two older siblings (ice hockey player Ron and figure skater Karen) onto the ice. Karen and Michelle began serious training when Michelle was about eight years old. They practiced <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> a day, waking up at 4:30am and arriving at the rink at 5:00am to skate before school, and then going back to the rink right after school to skate again. Paying for their increased skating-rink time led to financial hardship for Kwan’s working-class family. When Kwan was ten years old, her family could no longer afford a coach, but they were offered financial assistance by a fellow member of the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club that allowed them to train at the Ice Castle International Training Center in Lake Arrowhead, California.|$|E

As {{the ship was}} about to dock with the small wharf on her port side two or three aircraft of the German Lehrgeschwader 1 made a low-level attack with bombs and machine gun fire on the Norwegian steamer. Seven bombs were dropped from the aircraft, with two being direct hits, one between the funnel and the bridge, the other just aft of the fore cargo hatch. The first bomb entered the engine room and blew out the ship's sides and the second exploded {{in the bottom of}} the hull. The first bomb killed everyone in the refrigeration room, four men and three women. As the crew and passengers tried to abandon ship only one or two boats could be lowered into the water due to the fire that had broken out on board.

40|$|Intravenous {{treatment}} with alteplase, a {{tissue plasminogen activator}} (t-PA), has now {{been approved by the}} European Union (EU) regulatory authorities for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke within three hours of symptoms onset. Two major conditions were set for this approval. The first condition was that all patients treated with alteplase during a three year period within the EU, Norway and Iceland will be registered in the SITS internet database in accordance with the SITS Monitoring Study (SITS-MOST) protocol. The second condition was that a randomised controlled study of alteplase versus placebo, later called ECASS III (European Co-operative Acute Stroke Study III), should be launched for patients who could be treated within a <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>hour</b> time interval. SITS has accepted a request to provide the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) with biannual reports on the proportions of patients who experience a symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage or die following treatment or who are independent for activities of daily living (ADL) at three months follow up. Treatment within 3 hours after onset of ischaemic stroke is highly effective, as indicated in the consensus statement of this conference in October 20001, which was based on the outcome of eight randomised controlled trials 2 - 9. Intravenous t-PA was approved in US in 1996. Although the indication for this treatment seems widely accepted for patients within three hours of symptoms onset also in Europe, it has been claimed that the results were based on rather few patients included in randomised controlled trials 10. There is also a concern about the risk for symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage caused by the treatment. Since many stroke experts would regard a randomised trial of t-PA versus placebo control within three hours of stroke onset as unethical, such a trial would probably not be feasible 11.

50|$|The Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak Appellation has rocky {{volcanic}} soils of steep hillsides and ancient alluvial fans.

Despite the cooler days, growers on the mountain paradoxically experience relatively warmer night time temperatures, the result of cooler air dropping into the valley, displacing warm air upwards.
