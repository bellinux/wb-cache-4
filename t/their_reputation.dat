5|$|Following {{the capture}} of the city Japanese {{soldiers}} massacred Chinese prisoners of war, murdered civilians, and committed acts of looting and rape in an event known as the Nanking Massacre.

Contrary to Matsui's expectations, China did not surrender and the Second Sino-Japanese War continued for another eight years.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{a growth}} {{of work on}} building, {{managing}} and rehabilitating organizational reputation, we know relatively little about how organizations can effectively change <b>their</b> <b>reputations.</b> Through studying {{the case of a}} global management consulting firm, we show how firms with positive <b>reputations</b> can change <b>their</b> <b>reputations</b> despite resistance from different stakeholders. We find that particular organizational factors comprising of legitimated expertise, relevant celebrity and strong relationships as well as institutional conditions such as the knowledge of clients, competition environment and firm history can enable organizations to change <b>their</b> <b>reputations.</b> A significant contribution {{of this paper is to}} show how firms with established reputations can overcome the burden of reputation stickiness through satisfying certain organizational factors and institutional conditions...|$|R

5|$|The natural {{populations of}} black wildebeest, endemic to the {{southern}} part of Africa, were almost completely exterminated in the 19th century, due to <b>their</b> <b>reputation</b> as pests and the value of their hides and meat.

5|$|Ayers Rock's {{treatment}} by Australian radio stations during the 1970s {{was related to}} the popularity of AM. Unlike the US, which had a vibrant FM radio scene, in 1976 Australia only had ABC FM and a few community FM stations which primarily played classical music.

5|$|The 1895 {{capture of}} the Merina royal capitol, the Rova of Antananarivo, by the French sparked the Menalamba {{rebellion}} against foreigners, Christianity and Merina domination. In the chaotic 1895–97 period, bands of Sakalava, Marofotsy and other bandits engaged in raids to loot cattle and other goods. The Sihanaka were especially hard hit owing to <b>their</b> <b>reputation</b> as a relatively wealthy trading people. Many Sihanaka villagers resorted to sleeping in the forests and fields to avoid falling victim to nighttime pillage and arson; entire Sihanaka villages were burned.|$|E

As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the large}} number of factions created for the game, {{developers}} reintroduced the reputation system that was first used in Fallout 2 and had been absent in Fallout 3. Much like Karma, a player's standing with a faction can change depending on how they interact with them and what decisions they make. If, for example, players help a faction, <b>their</b> <b>reputation</b> with them improves in all locations controlled by that faction; opting to kill their members will cause a loss of reputation. The type of reputation the player has with each faction affects how non-player characters (NPCs) behave towards them; a good reputation might make completing some quests easier, provide discounts with the faction's vendors, and cause faction members to offer gifts; a bad reputation may lead to the faction refusing to help the player or attacking them on sight, or sending thugs after the player.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between CEO tenure and earnings quality. I find that, on average, CEOs with long tenures report earnings less aggressively than CEOs with short tenures, {{both in terms of}} recognizing economic losses in a timelier manner and reporting lower discretionary accruals. These results are consistent with the notion that {{at the beginning of their}} tenures, in order to build reputation of ability, CEOs have incentive to inflate earnings; after the CEOs have established <b>their</b> <b>reputations</b> through <b>their</b> long tenures, they report less aggressively in order to protect <b>their</b> <b>reputations.</b> I also find that long-tenured CEOs report more aggressively in their final year of tenure than in the years leading up to the final year of tenure. These results suggest that just prior to the completion of their tenures, long-tenured CEOs are not as concerned about <b>their</b> <b>reputations</b> because the aggressive reporting may be difficult for investors to detect until the firm’s future realizations become known. By then, these CEOs leave their firm...|$|R

5|$|NSB assured {{passengers}} {{that the}} trains were more capable than <b>their</b> <b>reputation,</b> {{and that they}} would continue to be used on the Bergen Line. If an alternative was needed, NSB stated {{that they would have to}} use El 18 locomotives in combination with B5 carriages. However, the carriages were at the time being used on regional rush-hour trains around Oslo, were in need of renovation and did not offer the facilities required by intercity travelers. In October, NSB stated that they planned to withdraw Class 73 from service on the Bergen Line, because the use of multiple units was not flexible enough. With locomotive-hauled trains, it was possible for the company to add or remove just a single carriage, but with multiple units, it was necessary to double the capacity if a single unit was insufficient. While originally planned to be introduced in 2008, delays in the upgrades delayed the delivery of the carriages beyond 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Duchess of York's Catholic secretary, Edward Colman, was, in 1678, falsely {{implicated in}} a fictitious plot against the King by Titus Oates.
