5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole <b>thing.</b> <b>So</b> my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

25|$|People with aphasia may {{experience}} {{any of the}} following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as dysarthria or apraxia and not primarily due to aphasia. Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain.

[...] He has also spoken about going to therapy to manage his anxieties – OCD, separation anxiety, social anxiety – and depression, the latter of which he struggled with a lot when he was younger, as well as how acting helped him better cope. He has said that acting serves as his coping mechanism.|$|E
500|$|Cagney's {{portrayal}} of Cody Jarrett in the 1949 film White Heat {{is one of}} his most memorable. Cinema had changed in the 10 years since Walsh last directed Cagney (in The Strawberry Blonde), and the actor's {{portrayal of}} gangsters had also changed. Unlike Tom Powers in The Public Enemy, Jarrett was portrayed as a raging lunatic with few if any sympathetic qualities. In the 18 intervening years, Cagney's hair had begun to gray, and he developed a paunch for the first time. He was no longer a romantic commodity, and this was reflected in his performance. Cagney himself had the idea of playing Jarrett as psychotic; he later stated, [...] "it was essentially a cheapie one-two-three-four kind of <b>thing,</b> <b>so</b> I suggested we make him nuts. It was agreed so we put in all those fits and headaches." ...|$|E

500|$|Stephen {{was written}} by Kesha Sebert, in {{collaboration}} with her mother Pebe Sebert, David Gamson, and Oliver Leiber. The song was produced by Gamson with additional production by Leiber. Gamson played all the instruments on the song, {{with the exception of}} the accordion which was performed by Kesha. The song's recording was commenced at ACME Recording, Long Island, California, and at Ollywood Studios, Hollywood, California, by Gamson. Kesha told Rolling Stone that Stephen was one of her favorite tracks on the album. She explained that the song stemmed from her experiences with a man that she had been [...] "stalking since [...] was 15." [...] It was written when the singer was sixteen, in collaboration with her mother. She found David Gamson to produce the song. [...] "He does all the keyboard stuff, he's amazing, a crazy cynical genius guy, and he liked my voice and my thing, and I really liked his <b>thing,</b> <b>so</b> we decided to work together" [...] she explained.|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} is a soca-pop song, and blends horns and {{background}} vocals with ukulele folk-pop and island percussion {{morphed into a}} programmed beat. It contains handclaps and subtle modern sound effects. Trainor uses an assertive throwback aural tone on the song. The rap verse in [...] "Title" [...] was compared to the works of Australian rapper Iggy Azalea and American duo Karmin. The song's lyrics see Trainor demanding her lover to put a name on their relationship status. It was described by the singer as [...] "call me your girlfriend, I'm sick of being your boo <b>thing,</b> <b>so</b> call me your girlfriend and give me that title". Musically, Trainor felt the song showcased what her artistic style was about, and said, [...] "I loved that 'Title' showed a little Caribbean drum before the chorus and then, like, a rap bridge that was, like… totally different sound." [...] Christina Garibaldi of MTV News wrote that the song serves a lesson for women not {{to settle for a}} friends-with-benefits relationship.|$|E
500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished <b>thing,</b> <b>so</b> everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time The Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: [...] "Mr. Burns gives [...] this terrible plaque above his desk that says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how sometimes things don't {{go the way}} you planned, which is pretty amazing in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover this horrible <b>thing</b> <b>so</b> it now reads, 'Do it for her.' It gives me a lump in the throat thinking about it." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: [...] "A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 seems a bit odd, but this {{is a good example of}} a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success." [...] In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune cited [...] "And Maggie Makes Three", [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", [...] "Homer Badman", and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] among his favorite episodes of the season.|$|E
500|$|The Gunnerkrigg Court webcomic is told in {{a series}} of episodic {{chapters}} such that each, while forming part of the overall storyline, also functions individually as a stand-alone story arc."Each of the chapters individually is sort of a self-contained <b>thing,</b> <b>so</b> if you were to just read one of them it wouldn't be like you {{had no idea what was}} going on." [...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 × 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames. At the bottom of the most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page, in which readers may comment on and discuss that day's comic.|$|E
500|$|The next attempt {{started in}} 2008, when Lasseter {{was able to}} {{convince}} Chris Buck (who co-directed the 1999 film Tarzan for the studio) to return to Walt Disney Feature Animation from Sony Pictures Animation (where he had recently co-directed the Oscar-nominated 2007 film Surf's Up); that September, Buck pitched several ideas to Lasseter, {{one of which was}} The Snow Queen. Buck later revealed that his initial inspiration for The Snow Queen was not the Andersen fairy tale itself, but that he wanted [...] "to do something different on the definition of true love." [...] "Disney had already done the 'kissed by a prince' <b>thing,</b> <b>so</b> [...] thought it was time for something new," [...] he recalled. It turned out Lasseter had been interested in The Snow Queen for a long time; back when Pixar was working with Disney on Toy Story in the 1990s, he saw and was [...] "blown away" [...] by some of the pre-production art from Disney's prior attempts. Development began under the title Anna and the Snow Queen, which was planned to be traditionally animated. According to Josh Gad, he first became involved with the film at that early stage, when the plot was still relatively close to the original Andersen fairy tale and Megan Mullally was going to play Elsa. By early 2010, the project entered development hell once again, when the studio again failed {{to find a way to}} make the story and the Snow Queen character work.|$|E

On October 2, 2013, {{after a few days}} of being credited as a co-producer of [...] "King Push", Joaquin Phoenix denied having assist in producing the song. He said, [...] "While it was widely reported that Pusha T used my beat and that I produced his song, I can't take any credit. A friend's son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye's camp." [...] On October 3, 2013, during an interview with Rap-Up, Pusha T revealed that it was actually the son of Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich who produced the song, saying [...] "Joaquin Phoenix gave the beat to 'Ye, so when I got the beat from 'Ye, it was, Yo, Joaquin gave me this beat. So me, I'm just like, OK, I know Joaquin's into music and you know the whole <b>thing,</b> <b>so</b> I'm like, Oh, damn. I believe it is the son of Lars Ulrich from Metallica.

500|$|... "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz compared {{the direction in}} [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] to the film-making of Sergio Leone, particularly in its [...] "extreme close-ups", [...] "tense silences" [...] and the [...] "saloon fight" [...] between Walter and Mike. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the filming techniques used in Jesse's party [...] "which starts off like a rap video then turns {{into some kind of}} distorted, jumpy tweak-vision" [...] effectively conveyed Jesse's frame of mind. He also liked the way the script conveyed Marie's [...] "increasing isolation" [...] in dealing with Hank. [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode a [...] "terrific, unsettling hour" [...] and particularly complimented director Michelle MacLaren and cinematographer Michael Slovis, especially for shooting Jesse's party scenes [...] "in a way that let you experience the chaos just as Jesse was trying to". Sepinwall strongly praised Aaron Paul, who he said [...] "keeps finding new layers of Jesse, and new talents to show them with". New York magazine writer Logan Hill praised the film noir elements in the episode's photography, and said the opening scene, with Walter staring into the mirror asking, [...] "So, how's it look?", refers to the season's ongoing theme of internal self-reflection and surveillance. Los Angeles Times writer Todd VanDerWerff said while the episode didn't advance the plot very far, it included a great deal of internal development among the characters, which he called [...] "an interesting new dynamic for the show to explore". He also called Jesse's emotional breakdown at the end [...] "easily the most chilling <b>thing</b> <b>so</b> far this season".|$|E
500|$|Qs Paul Du Noyer {{said that}} the source of The Joshua Trees [...] "potency lies in a kind of spiritual {{frustration}} – a sense of hunger and tension which roams its every track in search of some climactic moment of release, of fulfilment, that never arrives." [...] He concluded his review by writing that the music [...] "has the one thing vital to worthwhile rock, a <b>thing</b> <b>so</b> often absent: the urge to exist". Spin hailed the record as U2's [...] "first wholly successful album because it finally breaks free from the seductive but limiting chant-and-drone approach of earlier material". The review stated, [...] "There isn't a bad song on the record" [...] and that [...] "every one has a hook". The magazine praised U2 for eschewing ambient experimentation in favour of uncomplicated but layered arrangements. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said the album [...] "confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for three years now on stage: U2 is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago—the greatest rock and roll band in the world". Hilburn noted that the band showed [...] "sometimes breathtaking signs of growth" [...] and played more [...] "tailored and assured" [...] music. Hot Press editor and longtime U2 supporter Bill Graham said that [...] "The Joshua Tree rescues rock from its decay, bravely and unashamedly basing itself in the mainstream before very cleverly lifting off into several higher dimensions," [...] and that U2 [...] "must be taken very seriously indeed after this revaluation of rock". John Rockwell of The New York Times was complimentary of the band for expanding its musical range but said Bono's vocals were [...] "marred throughout by sobbing affectation" [...] and sounded too much like other singers, resulting in a [...] "curious loss of individuality". The Houston Chronicles Marty Racine felt it has [...] "music that both soothes and inspires, music that is anthemic, music with style". Racine, however, believed the group took itself too seriously, resulting in a record that is [...] "not a whole lot of fun, bordering on the pretentious", which caused him to lose interest by the second side. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice found the lyrics tasteful and the music [...] "mournful and passionate, stately and involved", but lamented what he felt was pompous singing by Bono, calling it [...] "one of the worst cases of significance ever to afflict a deserving candidate for superstardom".|$|E
