COTT {{provides a framework}} that helps the user to instrument object-oriented software to build the required controllability and observability. During testing, the tool facilitates creation of difficult-to-achieve states required for testing of difficultto-test conditions and observation of internal details of execution at unit, integration and system levels.

40|$|Introduction: Anticholinergic and {{sedative}} {{drugs from}} various therapeutic classes are frequently prescribed to older people. These drugs {{are known to}} impair cognitive and physical function in the short-term. However, long-term exposure to these drugs remains less examined. Methods: Data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, a Dutch nationally representative cohort study, collected over twenty years (1992 - 2012) at seven occasions, were analyzed. On each occasion, cumulative exposure to anticholinergic and sedative drugs was quantified with the Drug Burden Index (DBI), a linear additive pharmacological dose-response model. The relationships between the DBI and outcomes of cognitive function (MMSE, Alphabet Coding Task, 15 -Words Test) and physical function (Walking Test, Chair Stands Test, Cardigan Test, and Functional Independence Scale) were examined using linear mixed models adjusted for sex, marital status, age, education, smoking status, drugs not included in DBI, body mass index, depression, and co-morbidities. Results: At baseline, there were 2896 individuals (52 % women; mean age 70 ± 9 years). Of them, 62 % had no exposure to anticholin-ergic and sedative drugs (DBI= 0), 24 % moderate exposure (DBI = 0 - 1), and 14 % high exposure (DBI > 1). Significant independent associations {{were found between the}} DBI and physical function (Walking <b>Test</b> <b>log</b> transformed: B= 0. 02 [95 % CI: 0. 01; 0. 03], Cardigan <b>Test</b> <b>log</b> transformed: B= 0. 02 [95 % CI: 0. 01; 0. 03], Chair Stands Test B= 0. 48 [95 % CI: 0. 20; 0. 76], and Functional Independence: B=- 0. 89 [95 % CI:- 1. 22;- 0. 55]). No associations were found between the DBI and cognitive function. Conclusions: Over 20 years, higher anticholinergic and sedative exposure is associated with poorer physical but not poorer cognitive function...|$|E

40|$|The {{trend towards}} more commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) {{components}} in complex safety-critical systems is increasing {{the difficulty of}} verifying system correctness. Runtime verification (RV) is a lightweight technique to verify that certain properties hold over execution traces. RV is usually implemented as runtime monitors {{that can be used}} as runtime fault detectors or test oracles to analyze a system under test for bad behaviors. Most existing RV methods utilize some form of system or code instrumentation and thus are not designed to monitor potentially black-box COTS components. This thesis presents a suitable runtime monitoring framework for monitoring safety-critical embedded systems with black-box components. We provide an end-to-end framework including proven correct monitoring algorithms, a formal specification language with semi-formal techniques to map the system onto our formal system trace model, specification design patterns to aid translating informal specifications into the formal specification language, and a safety-case pattern example showing the argument that our monitor design can be safely integrated with a target system.

40|$|AbstractWith {{increasing}} {{deployment of}} Web services, {{the research on}} the dependability and availability of Web service composition {{becomes more and more}} active. Since unexpected faults of Web service composition may occur in different levels at runtime, log analysis as a typical data-driven approach for fault diagnosis is more applicable and scalable in various architectures. Considering the trend that more and more service logs are represented using XML or JSON format which has good flexibility and interoperability, fault classification problem of semi-structured logs is considered as a challenging issue in this area. However, most existing approaches focus on the log content analysis but ignore the structural information and lead to poor performance. To improve the accuracy of fault classification, we exploit structural similarity of log files and propose a similarity based Bayesian learning approach for semi-structured logs in this paper. Our solution estimates degrees of similarity among structural elements from heterogeneous log data, constructs combined Bayesian network (CBN), uses similarity based learning algorithm to compute probabilities in CBN, and classifies <b>test</b> <b>log</b> data into most probable fault categories based on the generated CBN. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms other learning approaches on structural log datasets...|$|E

METHODS: 233 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study from January 2002 to December 2007. 181 had outpatient treatment and 52 inpatient treatment. We used Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided Fisher's exact test, Chi-square <b>test,</b> <b>log</b> rank test and Kaplan-Meier curve. RESULTS: Incomplete excision was found in 16 / 52 (30. 8 %) cases in the inpatient group and 46 / 181 (25. 4 %) in the outpatient group (P = 0. 48). Six patients had post-operative complications: two cases of secondary haemorrhage in each group (in-LEEP 3. 8 %, out-LEEP 1. 1 %, P = 0. 22) and two cases of cervical stenosis amongst inpatients (3. 8 %, P = 0. 049). Alteration of specimen by thermal artifact were reported in 4 / 52 (7. 7 %) of in-LEEP cones and 10 / 181 (5. 5 %) of out-LEEP cones (P = 0. 52). Measurements of cones in both groups were comparable with a mean depth of 9. 35 mm (± 5. 5 mm) and 8. 4 mm (± 3. 4 mm), respectively.
