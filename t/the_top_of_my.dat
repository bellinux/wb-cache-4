500|$|The title {{refers to}} the rabbits' destination, Watership Down, a hill {{in the north of}} Hampshire, England, near the area where Adams grew up. The story began as tales that Richard Adams told his young daughters Juliet and Rosamond during long car journeys. As he {{explained}} in 2007, he [...] "began telling the story of the rabbits... improvised off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head, as we were driving along." [...] The daughters insisted he write it down—"they were very, very persistent". After some delay he began writing in the evenings and completed it 18 months later. The book is dedicated to the two girls.|$|E
500|$|The Badmotorfinger logo {{consists}} of a jagged, cyclone-like design. In {{the center of the}} logo is a triangle with the album's title, containing a spark plug. The album's cover art was illustrated by guitarist Mark Dancey from the Sub Pop band Big Chief. Thayil suggested the title Badmotorfinger as a joke on the Montrose song [...] "Bad Motor Scooter". Regarding the title, Thayil said, [...] "It was sort of off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head. I simply like it because it was colorful. It was kinda aggressive, too... It conjures up a lot of different kinds of images. We like the ambiguity in it, the way it sounded and the way it looked." ...|$|E

I rose clear of even the finest dust. Overwhelmed with joy, I hollowed out at <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> lungs, [...] "Old Yen-t'ou is alive and well! ...

500|$|Johnston's next {{international}} {{assignment was}} the 1949–50 tour to South Africa. The tour started badly; {{after taking a}} total of 5/28 in an innings win over Zululand in a non-first-class match, he fell {{asleep at the wheel}} outside Durban following a team function. He missed a turn, skidded across gravel and flipped and crashed his car. After a few hours, medical help arrived and Johnston was hospitalised. The team manager Chappie Dwyer was mistakenly informed that Johnston had died, and the bowler later described his injury as a [...] "nine-iron divot in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> skull". Johnston started coughing up blood, and he and Dwyer sought to have the accident private. However, news was leaked back to Australia, and Johnston's mother fainted; her husband and other son had already died and she was fearful that her lone remaining relative had joined them. After complaining of chest pain, it was later discovered that Johnston had two broken ribs and he had to rest further.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, the Al Green-styled [...] "Thinking of You", was {{one that}} the group {{conceived}} and recorded together at 3 a.m. in Saadiq's Pookie Labs studio. As he remembered it, [...] "I was just playing around and started singing off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head. I never wrote anything down, it was just what came out." [...] "Annie May", one of Wiggins' songs for House of Music, had Saadiq's backing vocals pre-recorded and then overdubbed to the track's final mix. One of Saadiq's songs for the album, [...] "Me and the Blind Man", was excluded from the final mix because, as Saadiq told Yahoo! Music, [...] "they didn't want anybody playing favorites, so one of my songs had to come off." [...] The recording was a moody blues piece with surrealistic lyrics about lust, longing, and a fictitious blind man's secret powers. Saadiq wanted to show [...] "a darker side... some depth" [...] to listeners with the song. [...] "To me songs like 'Blind Man,' make the whole sound, the House of Music", he remarked. It was featured on an album sampler sent by the group's label to music journalists.|$|E
500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred {{on the side of caution}} by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E

Father was busy with his team drawing off wheat and hogs and hay, and often came into the house at night, white with the storms through which he had passed. My trips to school were often interrupted by the cold, and the path which my sister and I trod was along the ever-deepening furrows made by the bob-sleighs of the farmers. Often when we met a team or were overtaken by one, we were {{forced out of the}} road into the drifts, and I can feel to this moment, the wedge of snow which caught in <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> tall boots and slowly melted into my gray socks.|$|R
500|$|The band {{entered the}} studio {{with most of the}} songs {{finished}} and rehearsed; producer Nick Raskulinecz, who also worked on One by One, stated that while [...] "One By One was very loose, [...] "In Your Honor was more planned out. Dave was more meticulous on that one". The electric album was done in segments by instrument, starting with the drums and guitars, then vocals, and finally bass. Mendel would write a bass line on Pro Tools at home before showing it to Grohl and Raskulinecz. The bass was recorded after the vocals, which Raskulinecz said was done because [...] "By doing bass last, you can really tailor it for tuning, parts and sound. If you do the drums and then the guitars, you can fill the hole that's left with bass. And sometimes that hole wants a certain frequency that isn't traditional for bass, but you have to go with it, which is even more fun." [...] During the last three weeks of work in the rock songs, the band was in the studio [...] "from noon to eight in the morning, making the rock record the most devastating thing we've ever done". After two months working with the rock songs, the band was approaching their established deadline and had a meeting where they decided that to finish the album [...] "Everyone has to be here all day, we need to do one song a day and no one's leaving until that song is done." [...] Grohl would listen to a click track, and [...] "we'd find a tempo and I'd just roll an arrangement off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head." [...] As the bandmembers recorded their parts, Grohl would write the lyrics. The rushed approach prevented Mendel from writing bass lines, so he ended up [...] "concentrating on just finding the notes and getting the rhythm right." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marvin {{composed}} the melody {{of the song}} with songwriter Sandra Greene during a 1970 recording session while Gaye was finishing edits of his song, [...] "What's Going On". Recorded on November 3, 1970, Gaye first recorded a rough version simply titled [...] "Head Title". Later in the same recording sessions, with help from his sister-in-law, Gwen Gordy Fuqua, Gaye composed more lyrics and gave it its title, [...] "Distant Lover". Gaye would rework the song {{several times during the}} 1970 recording sessions. In the [...] "Head Title" [...] version, Gaye began singing his lyrics [...] "right off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head" [...] and performed in a rasp-influenced growl.

2500|$|After the Liberals Gerry Phillips and Gerald M.

Then came a story {{on the front of the}} Globe and Mail saying that Ontarians would have to pay [...] "millions" [...] in extra premiums because the election call had delayed implementation of new auto insurance regulations promised by Eves on the eve of the campaign. On Wednesday the government was broadsided when - days after a raid at a meat packing plant exposed the sorry state of public health at some abattoirs - leaked documents showed the PC government had been sitting on recommendations to improve meat safety, leading to calls for a public inquiry by the opposition parties.
