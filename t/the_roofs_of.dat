5|$|Construction {{began on}} May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German {{architect}} living in Qingdao {{who had already}} completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> the towers as bell-shaped. However, <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.|$|E
5|$|Damage from Florence, with 421houses {{damaged and}} another three {{destroyed}}. The winds destroyed <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> three evacuation shelters, resulting in one injury.

After becoming extratropical, the remnants continued to the northeast, producing rainfall along its path before dissipating on September28 southeast of New England.|$|E

In Nicaragua, Bret killed 31people and left US$3million in damage, with many coastal towns isolated by floods. There was one death in neighboring Costa Rica and seven in Honduras, all due to flooding. In Central America, damage was compounded by Hurricane Gert moving through the region in early September.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in {{sheltered}} locations such as caves, natural rock crevices or under <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> houses. The nest is a half-cup of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather, the young can survive for days without being fed by metabolising body fat.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{extensive damage}} to fishing and farming communities in northeastern Mexico.

The winds destroyed <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> most buildings near where the hurricane moved ashore, and also caused widespread power outages which disrupted communications. Heavy rainfall destroyed or obstructed roadways across the region, with some flooded avenues in Tampico and reports of flooded highways near Ciudad Victoria.

5|$|Trogloraptor spin simple webs {{with only}} a few strands, hung from <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> caves. Griswold et al. stated that the claws may have a {{significant}} function in capturing prey. Similar to the Nelson cave spider of New Zealand (Spelungula cavernicola, a gradungulid), Trogloraptor probably dangle upside down from their webs, snatching at passing flying insects with their claws. However their exact prey remains unknown. Captured live specimens were raised in climate-controlled laboratory conditions in an effort to find out. These specimens were offered moths, crickets and other spiders as food; but these were declined and the specimens starved after two weeks. This may indicate a preference for very specific prey.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{triggered}} a tornado outbreak throughout {{portions of the}} Mid-Atlantic states. One tornado in Pender County, North Carolina destroyed 17homes and damaged 59houses, causing three deaths and $1.27million in damage (2004USD). In Stella, Bonnie generated a waterspout that struck a campground, damaged nine trailers, and wrecked small boats. A tornado in Richlands damaged several houses as well. In South Carolina, tornadoes across the state damaged nine homes. A suspected tornado in Danville, Virginia destroyed <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> several businesses. In South Carolina, rainfall peaking at 6.07inches (154mm) in Loris caused flooding across the state. The flooding, including a one-foot depth along U.S. Route 501, washed away a road and a bridge in Greenville County. In addition, 600people across the state were left without electricity.|$|E
5|$|Constructing a warship of {{the size}} of the Mary Rose was a major undertaking, {{requiring}} vast quantities of high-quality material. In the case of building a state-of-the-art warship, these materials were primarily oak. The total amount of timber needed for the construction can only be roughly calculated since only about one third of the ship still exists. One estimate for the number of trees is around 600 mostly large oaks, representing about 16 hectares (40 acres) of woodland. The huge trees that had been common in Europe and the British Isles in previous centuries were by the 16th century quite rare, which meant that timbers were brought in from all over southern England. The largest timbers used in the construction were of roughly the same size as those used in <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> the largest cathedrals in the high Middle Ages. An unworked hull plank would have weighed over 300kg (660lb), and one of the main deck beams would have weighed close to three-quarters of a tonne.|$|E
