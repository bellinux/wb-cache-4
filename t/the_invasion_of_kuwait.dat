5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to <b>the</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990 {{by the forces of}} Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by {{neighbouring}} Iraq in 1991, a {{total of}} eight Victor K.2s were deployed to Bahrain to provide in-flight refuelling support to RAF and other coalition aircraft during the subsequent 1991 Gulf War. RAF strike aircraft such as the Panavia Tornado would frequently {{make use of the}} tanker to refuel prior to launching cross-border strikes inside of Iraq. Shortly after the Gulf War, the remaining Victor fleet was quickly retired in 1993, at which point it had been the last of the three V-bombers in operational service; retiring nine years after the last Vulcan, although the Vulcan had survived longer in its original role as a bomber.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{a member}} of the {{international}} coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War, deploying a naval task group of two warships, a support ship and a clearance diving team; in total about 750 personnel. The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure. However, the Australian force did not see combat, and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Some ADF personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat, and a few were later decorated for their actions. Following the war, the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq. A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no-fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003.|$|E

25|$|Cooperation {{between the}} United States and the Soviet Union made {{possible}} the passage of resolutions in the United Nations Security Council giving Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait and approving {{the use of force}} if Saddam did not comply with the timetable. U.S. officials feared Iraqi retaliation against oil-rich Saudi Arabia, since the 1940s a close ally of Washington, for the Saudis' opposition to <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Accordingly, the U.S. and a group of allies, including countries as diverse as Egypt, Syria and Czechoslovakia, deployed a massive amount of troops along the Saudi border with Kuwait and Iraq in order to encircle the Iraqi army, the largest in the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|Kuwait {{also ordered}} 14 Lightnings in December 1966, {{comprising}} 12 F.53Ks and two T.55Ks. The first Kuwait aircraft, a T.55K first flew on 24 May 1968 and deliveries to Kuwait started in December 1968. The Kuwaitis somewhat overestimated {{their ability to}} maintain such a complex aircraft, not adopting the extensive support from BAC and Airwork Services that the Saudis used to keep their Lightnings operational, so serviceability was poor. The Kuwaiti Lightnings {{did not have a}} long service career; after unsuccessfully trying to sell them to Egypt in 1973, Kuwait replaced its last Lightnings with Dassault Mirage F1s in 1977. The remaining aircraft were stored at Kuwait International Airport, many were subsequently destroyed during <b>the</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by Iraq in August 1990.|$|E
25|$|By {{the eve of}} <b>the</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> {{which led}} to the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the army was {{estimated}} to number 1,000,000 men. Just before the Persian Gulf War began, the force comprised 47 infantry divisions plus 9 armoured and mechanised divisions, grouped in 7 corps. This gave a total of about 56 army divisions, and total land force divisions reached 68 when the 12 Iraqi Republican Guard divisions were included. Although it was said at the time in Western media that Iraqi troops numbered approximately 545,000 (even 600,000) today most experts think that both the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the Iraqi army at the time were exaggerated, as they included both temporary and auxiliary support elements. Many of the Iraqi troops were also young, under-resourced and poorly trained conscripts. Saddam did not trust the army; among counterbalancing security forces was the Iraqi Popular Army.|$|E

25|$|Bahrain became {{independent}} in August, and Qatar in September 1971. When the British-Trucial Sheikhdoms treaty expired on 1 December 1971, they became fully independent. The rulers of Abu Dhabi and Dubai decided {{to form a}} union between their two emirates independently, prepare a constitution, then call the rulers of the other five emirates to a meeting and offer {{them the opportunity to}} join. It was also agreed between the two that the constitution be written by 2 December 1971. On that date, at the Dubai Guesthouse Palace, four other emirates agreed to enter into a union called the United Arab Emirates. Bahrain and Qatar declined their invitations to join the union. Ras al-Khaimah joined later, in early 1972. In February 1972, the Federal National Council (FNC) was created; it was a 40-member consultative body appointed by the seven rulers. The UAE joined the Arab League in 1971. It was {{a founding member of the}} Gulf Cooperation Council in May 1981, with Abu Dhabi hosting the first summit. UAE forces joined the allies against Iraq after <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> on 9August1990 the British {{government}} assigned {{an initial}} 12 Jaguar GR1A and 12 Tornado F3 aircraft to the Middle East in Operation Granby, these aircraft operated from bases in Oman and Bahrain. On 23August1990, {{a squadron of}} Tornado GR1 interdictors were dispatched to the region as well, but the Tornado GR1 was difficult to keep operational in the high temperatures. Blackburn Buccaneers were dispatched in January 1991 to act as laser designators for the ground strike aircraft. The RAF's Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Persian Gulf War, including CRV7 high-velocity rockets and American CBU-87 cluster bombs which were used because the RAF's existing BL755 bombs were designed for low-level release, and therefore unsuitable for higher-altitude operations common over the Persian Gulf. The RAF's detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties, with no aircraft being lost. XZ364 [...] "Sadman" [...] flew 47 missions; {{the highest number of}} missions of any aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Thatcher {{was in the}} US on a {{state visit}} when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded {{neighbouring}} Kuwait in August 1990. During her talks with President George H. W. Bush, who had succeeded Reagan in 1989, she recommended intervention, and put pressure on Bush to deploy troops in the Middle East to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. Bush was apprehensive about the plan, prompting Thatcher to remark to him during a telephone conversation that [...] "This {{was no time to}} go wobbly!" [...] Thatcher's government supplied military forces to the international coalition in the build-up to the Gulf War, but she had resigned by the time hostilities began on 17 January 1991. She applauded the coalition victory as a backbencher, but warned that [...] "the victories of peace will take longer than the battles of war". It has since been made public that Thatcher suggested threatening Saddam with chemical weapons after <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. <b>The</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by Iraqi forces {{led to the}} 1990–91 Gulf War. Egypt, Qatar, Syria and Saudi Arabia {{joined a}} {{multinational}} coalition that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by Jordan and Palestine resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states.

2500|$|The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation sent {{investigators}} to Kuwait {{who went through}} the hospital and counted the incubators and they found that [...] "except {{for one or two}} that may have been misplaced" [...] all of the incubators were still in the hospital.

And the doctor who provided Amnesty International with the number of babies killed dropped from 312 to 72 and then 30, 19 of which died before <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by Iraq. After the war, The New York Times wrote, [...] "It's plainly wrong for a member of congress to collaborate with a public relations firm to produce knowingly deceptive testimony on an important issue.

2500|$|During the Iran-Iraq war, the CIA {{had backed}} both sides. The CIA had {{maintained}} {{a network of}} spies in Iran, but in 1989 a CIA mistake compromised every agent they had in there, and the CIA had no agents in Iraq. In the weeks before <b>the</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> the CIA downplayed the military buildup. During the war CIA estimates of Iraqi abilities and intentions flip-flopped and were rarely accurate. In one particular case, the DOD had asked the CIA to identify military targets to bomb. One target the CIA identified was an underground shelter. The CIA didn't {{know that it was}} a civilian bomb shelter. In a rare instance the CIA correctly determined that the coalition forces efforts were coming up short in their efforts to destroy SCUD missiles. Congress took away the CIA's role in interpreting spy-satellite photos, putting the CIA's satellite intelligence operations {{under the auspices of the}} military. The CIA created its office of military affairs, which operated as [...] "second-echelon support for the pentagon... answering... questions from military men [...] 'how wide is this road?'" ...|$|E

During <b>the</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> the Kuwait MB (along with other MB in the Gulf States) supported the American-Saudi coalition forces against Iraq and [...] "quit the brotherhood's international agency in protest" [...] over its pro-Sadam stand. However following the Arab Spring and the crackdown on the Egyptian Brotherhood, the Saudi government has put “pressure on other states that have Muslim Brotherhood adherents, asking them to decree that the group is a terrorist organization”, and the local Kuwaiti and other Gulf state Brotherhoods have not been spared pressure from their local governments.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November 1989 Heffer {{announced}} that he would not fight the next election. The decision was prompted {{by the fact that he}} had been diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer.

When Parliament was recalled to debate <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in September 1990, Heffer made what he knew would be his last speech in the House of Commons to urge the United Kingdom not to go to war. His gaunt and white appearance showed how ill he was. In January 1991 he attended the House of Commons to vote against the Gulf War in a wheelchair, when John Major crossed the floor to shake his hand. In March 1991 he was awarded the freedom of the city of Liverpool, but as he was too ill to travel there, he received it at Westminster. On Heffer's deathbed he said to Kinnock, [...] "You should be dying, not me" [...] – reflecting bitterness of what he saw as Kinnock's betrayal of the Labour movement with the expulsion of members of Militant.|$|E
