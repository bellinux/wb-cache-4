40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>thick</b> stellar <b>disks</b> in spiral galaxies is studied. Simulations of gas-rich young galaxies show {{formation of}} internal clumps by gravitational instabilities, clump coalescence into a bulge, and disk thickening by strong stellar scattering. The bulge and <b>thick</b> <b>disks</b> of modern galaxies may form this way. Simulations of minor mergers make <b>thick</b> <b>disks</b> too, {{but there is}} an important difference. <b>Thick</b> <b>disks</b> made by internal processes have a constant scale height with galactocentric radius, but <b>thick</b> <b>disks</b> made by mergers flare. The difference arises because in the first case, perpendicular forcing and disk-gravity resistance are both proportional to the disk column density, so the resulting scale height is independent of this density. In the case of mergers, perpendicular forcing is independent of the column density and the low density regions get thicker; the resulting flaring is inconsistent with observations.

Overall, the growth of an embedded thin disk can cause a substantial contraction in both the radial and vertical direction, resulting in a significant decrease in the scale lengths and scale heights of <b>thick</b> <b>disks.</b> Kinematically, a growing thin disk can induce a notable increase in the mean rotation and velocity dispersions of thick-disk stars.

40|$|Our goal is {{to study}} the {{physical}} properties of the circumstellar environment of young stellar objetcs (YSOs). In particular, {{the determination of the}} scattering mechanism can help to constrain the optical depth of the disk and/or envelope in the near infrared. We used the IAGPOL imaging polarimeter along with the CamIV infrared camera at the LNA observatory to obtain near infrared polarimetry measurements at the H band of a sample of optically visible YSOs, namely, eleven T Tauri stars and eight Herbig Ae/Be stars. An independent determination of the disk (or jet) orientation was obtained for twelve objects from the literature. The circumstellar optical depth could be then estimated comparing the integrated polarization position angle (PA) with the direction of the major axis of the disk projected in the plane of the sky. In general, optically thin disks have polarization PA perpendicular to the disk plane. In contrast, optically <b>thick</b> <b>disks</b> produce polarization PA parallel to the disks. Among the T Tauri stars, three are consistent with optically thin disks (AS 353 A, RY Tau and UY Aur) and five with optically <b>thick</b> <b>disks</b> (V 536 Aql, DG Tau, DO Tau, HL Tau and LkHalpha 358). Among the Herbig Ae/Be stars, two stars show evidence of optically thin disk (Hen 3 - 1191 and VV Ser) and two of optically <b>thick</b> <b>disks</b> (PDS 453 and MWC 297).
