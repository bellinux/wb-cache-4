The reason is that a custodian candidate in <b>the</b> <b>forwarding</b> area after a wait will be found close to the edge of <b>the</b> current custodian's <b>forwarding</b> area.

5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of <b>the</b> <b>forward</b> market.

This effectively means that <b>the</b> <b>forward</b> rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E

5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest rates between two countries, <b>the</b> <b>forward</b> exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>forward</b> rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how <b>the</b> <b>forward</b> premium or discount is calculated.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>forward</b> {{exchange}} rate (also {{referred to as}} forward rate or forward price) is the {{exchange rate}} at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} <b>the</b> <b>forward</b> rate for hedging purposes. <b>The</b> <b>forward</b> exchange rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that <b>the</b> <b>forward</b> rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>forward</b> rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E

5|$|This {{equation}} {{represents the}} unbiasedness hypothesis, {{which states that}} <b>the</b> <b>forward</b> exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate.
