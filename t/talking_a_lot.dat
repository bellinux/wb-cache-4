500|$|Escape was {{recorded}} in 16 days at Battery Studios in London, with Hutchins often writing lyrics in the studio. He {{found it difficult to}} write a complete song at home, and finished the lyrics later. Hutchins worked well with Smith, and said that the producer became involved in the music-making and [...] "would start <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of shit to us to let us feel like he felt". Smith's presence is evident on [...] "Friends", whose beat was (according to Hutchins) [...] "nothing like the way it sounded after he got to it". Whodini often argued with the studio personnel; Hutchins said that he [...] "never seen studio sessions like ours. Criticism would be flying around that studio like skyrockets and bullets ... But we knew we got something right when Larry started grabbing his dick, and that was the craziest thing in the world." [...] Smith encouraged Whodini to use a variety of instruments on each track, from Linn LM-1 and Roland TR-707 drum machines to a Fender Jazz Bass.|$|E
500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life. He got drunk {{for the first time}} at age 13, and on more than one occasion, Valo has also been {{reported}} to have performed intoxicated. In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he opened the door and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Previously Mitch Albom had {{chronicled the}} Fab Five {{in a book}} {{entitled}} Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, The American Dream, and Fox Sports had attempted to review the group. The press regarded this as the first complete recounting of the fabled group. Rose describes this film as [...] "almost like the Bible of the Fab Five Story". An ESPN commentator describes the five players as the greatest incoming college basketball recruiting class ever. He notes that they were presented {{to the world as}} the embodiment of what was wrong with college sports because they wore revolutionary baggy shorts and black socks and blasted hip-hop music while <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of trash. The film documents the [...] "formation, rise, scandal and epilogue of the team". It documents the 1991–92 and 1992–93 teams, the University of Michigan basketball scandal, and related off the court issues such as hate mail. Forbes notes that the legacy of the quintet, which includes successive appearances in the championship game of the NCAA Men's DivisionI Basketball Championship, was overshadowed by the scandal, which necessitated the removal of Final Four banners and vacating of games. The film is noted for presenting the inside story a group of players who the contemporary media derided as thugs and villains, while enterprise rode them as a multimillion-dollar merchandising juggernaut.|$|E

2500|$|He {{supports}} U.S. political {{intervention and}} {{economic sanctions against}} state sponsors of terrorism. Santorum views [...] "Islamic-fascism" [...] in Iran {{as the center of}} the [...] "world's conflict", and his geo-political strategy for peace involves the United States promoting [...] "a strong Lebanon, a strong Israel, and a strong Iraq." [...] He sponsored the Syria Accountability Act of 2003 to require Syria cease all activity with Lebanon and end all support for terrorism. In 2005, Santorum sponsored the Iran Freedom and Support Act, which appropriated $10 million aimed at regime change in Iran. The Act passed with overwhelming support. However, Santorum nevertheless voted against the Lautenberg amendment, which would have closed the loophole that allows companies like Halliburton to do business with Iran through their foreign affiliates. Santorum reflected on his last year in the Senate as one spent <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about Iran, and was characterized by The Atlantic Wire as an [...] "extreme hawk" [...] in his approach with Iran. Santorum stated that Iran was the creator of Hezbollah and the driving force of Hamas. He said Iran {{was at the center of}} [...] "much of the world's conflict" [...] but he was opposed to direct military action against the country in 2006. Santorum was one of only two senators who voted against confirming the nomination of Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. Santorum stated that his objection was to Gates' support for talking with Iran and Syria, because it would be an error to talk with radical Islamists.|$|E

We saw the schooner away out, running to leeward, with ten pairs of binoculars sweeping the sea, no doubt on all sides. I advised the governor to give her time to beat back again before we made a start. So we stayed up that creek something like ten days, as snug as can be. On the seventh day we had to kill a man, though--the brother of this Pedro here. They were alligator-hunters, right enough. We got our lodgings in their hut. Neither the boss nor I could habla Espanol--speak Spanish, you know--much then. Dry bank, nice shade, jolly hammocks, fresh fish, good game, everything lovely.
