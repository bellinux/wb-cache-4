5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion, until {{he ran out of}} petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends have recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|Pfaster, who {{was behind}} the exhumations, proves Mulder's {{prediction}} correct when he brings a prostitute to his apartment. When the prostitute discovers a collection of funerary wreaths in Pfaster's bedroom, he kills her and removes her fingers. Later, Pfaster—having been hired as a frozen food delivery man through charming the female interviewer—delivers to a low-security house {{of a woman with}} teenage daughters. He requests the bathroom <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands, and whilst there steals some discarded hair from a brush he found in the trashcan. Pfaster attends a night class at a community college, where a female classmate defends herself after he makes threatening advances. He is arrested and is placed in a jail cell across from a suspect being interrogated for Pfaster's crimes by Mulder, Scully, and Bocks. Pfaster shows interest in Scully, and learns her name from the interrogated suspect. Pfaster is later released as his charges were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid's feast day is 12 October or 24 April. Both dates were {{celebrated in}} early medieval England, but the April date {{appeared}} {{first in the}} liturgical calendars. The April date is the date when his relics were translated to a new shrine. Immediately after his death Wilfrid's body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened {{at the spot where}} the water used <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> body was discarded. A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's relics were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod's later poem on Wilfrid's life. However, according to Byrhtferth's Vita Sancti Oswaldi, or Life of Saint Oswald, Oda's nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there to care for them. The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, but it is possible that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon. The relics that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid's relics were placed in their own shrine.|$|E

25|$|Major Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, {{claimed in}} his memoirs to have {{discovered}} bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly {{running out of the}} basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before. Ripper author Martin Fido thought it unlikely that the culprit would wait <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands in a semi-public place about forty minutes after the crime, and Smith's memoirs are both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect.

500|$|Australia {{were due}} to tour England to contest the Ashes in 1909. [...] Hill, along with other senior players, was {{fighting}} against a proposal to move the management of international tours away from the players to the new Australian Board of Control for International Cricket Matches. Hill by now was a team selector and strongly opposed the selection in the team of 40-year-old Peter McAlister, who Hill claimed [...] "was past his best" [...] and [...] "not suited to English conditions". McAlister was {{also a member of}} the selection panel and was able to secure a majority for his selection. Hill accused his fellow selectors of conspiracy and said he had [...] "decided <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands of the affair" [...] and that [...] "he did not consider that the best men had been chosen". Hill's relationship with McAlister would remain fractious. [...] Hill was also a delegate on the Board of Control, representing the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA). [...] At the Board meeting in February 1909 to set the terms to be offered to the players selected for the tour, the SACA delegates were outvoted on every point. Hill declined to accept the terms offered. Since his marriage in 1905, Hill had spent considerable time away from his wife with his commitments during two Test series against England and this may have also influenced his decision not to tour.|$|E
500|$|On June 8, Stoughton {{ordered a}} woman accused of {{witchcraft}} (Bridget Bishop) {{to be executed}} only two days later, though tradition had been to allow at least four days between order and execution. The following Monday the clergy were asked to officially weigh in on the issue. This was likely Phips asking for the opinion of Increase Mather, and his son Cotton, and {{to put it in}} writing. The response is called The Return of the Ministers, simultaneously urging caution and speedy prosecution. Most importantly it cautioned against, but did not disallow, or discredit, the admission of spectral evidence (accusations of a crime committed by one's [...] "spector", against which there is no alibi possible). The Mathers, father and son, and the other area ministers continued to debate this issue throughout the summer and into the fall, as documented by the minutes of the Cambridge Association. At the end of June, five more women were condemned to die. Phips granted a reprieve to one of these, but was impressed upon [...] "by some Salem gentlemen" [...] to take it back. At this point, Phips seemed <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands of the proceedings, not relishing the idea of gaining the enmity of his own lieutenant governor and the clergymen allied with him, including the fully committed Cotton Mather, and the waffling Increase Mather. There is no record of Phips ever having travelled north to meet any of the [...] "afflicted", or attend a single Oyer and Terminer trial, or execution. Instead, Phips continued to work on recruiting troops and gathering supplies to build a fort in Maine and he left the province at the end of July, and was gone the entire month of August and much of September, officially handing over all executive powers to Stoughton in his absence beginning August 1.|$|E
500|$|Several {{factors have}} led to {{speculation}} that Webster was not alone when he killed Leigh. According to the transcript of Webster's confession, he was never asked if he acted alone. Carrington accused police of accepting Webster's confession at face value, ignoring both forensic and witness evidence. Her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in Webster's confession, and in the forensic evidence. For example, Webster stated in his confession that he had choked Leigh {{with his left hand}} as he knelt beside her although, according to the autopsy report, the bruises on Leigh's neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand. Carrington also questioned Webster's statement that he walked along lit streets {{to the other side of}} the Stockton peninsula <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> bloodstained hands, when he could have washed his hands in total darkness at the beach less than [...] away. She also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes, despite Leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2.8 metres one way from her body and 1.3 metres the other way. Webster stated that he walked to the beach with Leigh, though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to the beach alone; two witnesses stated they saw Webster and Wilson leave the surf club together. Neither NC1 nor Wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at the time of the murder; Wilson told police he was alone on the beach when Leigh walked past him as she left the club, minutes before she was murdered. Webster's statement that he only penetrated Leigh with his finger has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with the autopsy findings of genital trauma, and the trauma is also inconsistent with NC1's account that his sex with her was consensual. In reviewing the autopsy, Boettcher said that the numerous blows which killed Leigh came from multiple directions, and were probably inflicted with different items, indicating the possibility of more than one perpetrator.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Aaron was {{to offer the}} fat of the sin-offering.

The bull and goat of sin offering were to be taken outside the camp and burned, and he who burned them was <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> clothes and bathe in water. The text then commands this law for all time: On the tenth day of the seventh month, Jews and aliens who reside with them were to practice self-denial and do no work.

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God then told Moses and Aaron the ritual for {{cleansing}} {{a person who}} had a genital discharge. When a man had a discharge from his genitals, he was unclean, and any bedding on which he lay and every object on which he sat was to be unclean. Anyone who touched his body, touched his bedding, touched an object on which he sat, was touched by his spit, or was touched by him before he rinsed his hands was <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> clothes, bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening. An earthen vessel that he touched was to be broken, and any wooden implement was to be rinsed with water. Seven days after the discharge ended, he was <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> clothes, bathe his body in fresh water, and be clean. On the eighth day, he was to give two turtle doves or two pigeons to the priest, who was to offer them to make expiation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), {{a person who}} was clean was to add fresh water to ashes of the Red Cow, dip hyssop it in the water, and {{sprinkle}} the water on the tent, the vessels, and people who had become unclean. The person who sprinkled the water was then <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> clothes, bathe in water, and be clean at nightfall. Anyone who became unclean and failed to cleanse himself was to be cut off from the congregation. The person who sprinkled the water of lustration was <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> clothes, and whoever touched the water of lustration, whatever he touched, and whoever touched him were to be unclean until evening. The Israelites arrived at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, and Miriam died and was buried there. The people were without water, and they complained against Moses and Aaron. Moses and Aaron fell on their faces at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and the Presence of God appeared to them.|$|E
