5|$|A {{notoriously}} violent man, Yamashita {{was known}} for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast numeric advantage, added to the fact <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, purposely breaking the arms of three of them in the process. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for excessive use of violence. When confronted by Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed the same way he liked to harm people.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{pages were}} {{adolescent}} boys {{and young men}} conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of PhilipII onward, although more solid evidence dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted {{as a means to}} introduce them to political life. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during symposia (i.e. formal drinking parties). Although there is little evidence for royal pages in the Antigonid period, it is known <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168BC.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the Global {{financial}} crisis of 2008, some policymakers and others have called for a new international monetary system <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> also dub Bretton Woods II.

25|$|Greek wall {{painting}} {{tradition is}} {{also reflected in}} contemporary grave decorations in the Greek colonies in Italy, e.g. the famous Tomb of the Diver at Paestum.

25|$|During this period, in {{the event}} known as the Convoy of 35, the Palmach lost 18 men (along with 17 other Haganah fighters) {{on their way to}} {{reinforce}} the garrison at Kfar Etzion after they were attacked by hundreds of Arab locals and militias.

25|$|Etymology of the {{settlement}} names show <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are of Slavic origin, which indicate that they were initially inhabited by Slavs. For example, Bivalo (Bivaljoš) was a large Slavic settlement dating to the 5th-6th century. Some other settlement names are of Hungarian origin (for example Bélakút, Kűszentmárton, Vásárosvárad, Rév), which indicate that they were inhabited by Hungarians before the Ottoman invasion in the 16th century. Some settlement names are of uncertain origin.|$|E

50|$|From 1891 to 1893, Landsteiner studied {{chemistry}} in Würzburg under Hermann Emil Fischer, in München, Eugen Bamberger and in Zürich under Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch.

25|$|Another common reason {{nowadays}} for Global serializability relaxation is {{the requirement}} of availability of internet products and services. This requirement is typically answered by large scale data replication. The straightforward solution for synchronizing replicas' updates of a same database object is including all these updates in a single atomic distributed transaction. However, with many replicas such a transaction is very large, and may span several computers and networks <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> {{are likely to be}} unavailable. Thus such a transaction is likely to end with abort and miss its purpose.|$|E
25|$|The English at Saybrook {{were not}} happy about the raid, but agreed <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> would {{accompany}} Endecott as guides. Endecott sailed along the coast to a Pequot village, where he repeated the previous year's demand for {{those responsible for the}} death of Stone, and now also for those who murdered Oldham. After some discussion, Endecott concluded that the Pequots were stalling and attacked, but most escaped into the woods. Endecott had his forces burn down the village and crops before sailing home.|$|E

Others are thought to be somewhere in the southeastern-most regions of the country.

25|$|Seventy-three hostages (including six minors) were {{rendered}} {{no medical}} aid. There were several Chechens among the hostages {{and it may}} be <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were not treated because of their Chechen names. Money and other valuables belonging to the victims vanished; official reports stated that the valuables were stolen by an FSB officer who was later killed in a car crash. The Russian authorities initially maintained that none of the deaths among the hostages occurred through poisoning. They spoke of health problems that were exacerbated by the three-day ordeal with very little food or water, or indeed, medical attention.|$|E

Graduating in 1947, he soon moved to journalism and became a professional journalist in 1952. He became {{the editor in chief of}} Espresso Sera daily newspaper in Catania — the main city on Sicily's east coast — and in 1980 of Il Giornale del Sud, where he formed a team of young journalists that turned the paper into an independent, investigative journal. At the time, not much was known about the owners, but it became clear <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had connections with the Mafia. Fava was fired.|$|E
25|$|It {{is a fine}} {{thing that}} a man astride two wheels can, in a six-day race, {{distance}} a hound, horse, or a locomotive. It confirms the assumption, no longer much contested, that the human animal is superior to the other animals. But this undisputed thing is being said in too solemn and painful way at Madison Square Garden. An athletic contest in which participants 'go queer' in their heads, and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them, is not sport. It is brutality. Days and weeks of recuperation {{will be needed to}} put the Garden racers in condition, and it is likely <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> will never recover from the strain.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s {{pioneering}} work of Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and others, scientists have developed techniques {{that attempt to}} use genetic markers to indicate the ethnic background and history of individual people. The data developed by these mainstream scientists {{tell us that the}} Native Americans have very distinctive DNA markers, and <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are most similar, among old world populations, to the DNA of people anciently associated with the Altay Mountains area of central Asia. This conclusion from a genetic perspective supports a large amount of archaeological, anthropological, and linguistic evidence that Native American peoples' ancestors migrated from Asia at the latest 16,500–13,000 years ago. (See Settlement of the Americas and Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas).|$|E
25|$|Pre-war tram {{networks}} {{remain largely}} intact {{in a number}} of European cities, and many still use PCCs as part or all of their rolling stock. Late-model PCCs remain in use in Belgium. The vehicles used in Antwerp and Ghent are metre-gauge, while those used in Brussels are standard-gauge. One of the peculiarities of the four-axle Brussels PCC vehicles is <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have been equipped with bogies and electric motors acquired second-hand in the United States from decommissioned streetcars from Kansas City, Missouri, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The last of the originally 171 four-axle class 7000 PCC cars in Brussels were withdrawn on February 12, 2010, with the articulated PCCs (130 class 7700 six-axle cars and 60 class 7900 eight-axle cars) remaining in service.|$|E
25|$|One of the rioters {{sat in the}} Speaker's chair where Morin {{had been}} sitting {{only a few minutes}} before, and {{declared}} the dissolution of the House. The room was turned upside down while other men entered the room of the Legislative Council. The acts of vandalism that were reported included the destruction of the seats and desks, stamping on the portrait of Louis-Joseph Papineau, that had been hanging on the wall next to that of Queen Victoria. Perry claimed to have set fire to the room himself when he hit the gas chandelier suspended on the ceiling with a brick, aiming for the clock that was directly above the Speaker's chair. The clock, whose ticking apparently got on his nerves, was, according to his account, showing 9:40pm when it happened. Other sources, including newspapers of the time, believed the fire to have been started when rioters outside the building started throwing the torches <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had carried from the Champ-de-Mars meeting.|$|E
