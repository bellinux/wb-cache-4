5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} {{years of his}} life, Kennedy had come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a major figure and {{spokesman}} for American progressivism. In 2008, Kennedy was hospitalized after suffering a seizure and {{was diagnosed with a}} malignant brain tumor, which limited his appearances in the Senate. He died at age 77 on August 25, 2009, at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The Anatomy Act 1832 {{ended the}} {{dissection}} of murderers, {{and most of}} the animal tortures depicted were outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, so by the 1850s The Four Stages of Cruelty had come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a somewhat historical series, though still one with the power to shock, a power it retains for a modern audience.|$|E
50|$|During the Vietnam War, Dak <b>To</b> <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a {{strategic}} area {{because of its}} proximity to a major branch of the Ho Chi Minh trail, which Hanoi maintained through the neighboring country of Laos. It {{was the site of}} the Battle of Dak To.|$|R

5|$|Admiralty {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused the sea <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a unique jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, Genovese, and Hanseatic codes which established the first English courts of admiralty. Unlike the usual English common law system, the courts of admiralty hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open for abuse {{that contributed to the}} American Revolution. The adoption of the present constitution reintroduced admiralty law to the United States, but with a relatively larger sphere for trials by jury.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the freedom offered by the genres, gay {{characters}} often remain contrived and stereotypical, and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions. Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically, or by including LGBT characters {{in such a way}} as to not contradict mainstream society's assumptions about gender roles. Works that feature gay characters are more likely to be written by women writers, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.|$|E
5|$|Many of Model's fellow {{officers}} considered him a Nazi. He frequently harangued his troops {{to have faith}} in the Führer and uphold the virtues of National Socialism. He accepted the offer of SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to appoint a Waffen-SS officer as his adjutant at Army Group North in 1944, after the Heerespersonalamt had refused him an adjutant, and filled the Nationalsozialistischer Führungsoffizier (NSFO, essentially a Nazi political commissar) post at Army Group B that had been vacant before his arrival. His habit of parroting the Führer's orders caused him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a sycophant, even if he often undermined or ignored those orders in practice.|$|E

5|$|The mid-20th century {{brought new}} forms of music from Trinidad, Brazil, the United States, Cuba and the Dominican Republic to Barbados, and the Barbadian calypso style came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> lowbrow or inferior. Promoters like Lord Silvers and Mighty Dragon, however, kept the popular {{tradition}} alive through shows at the Globe Theatre, featuring pioneers Mighty Romeo, Sir Don Marshall, Lord Radio and the Bimshire Boys and Mike Wilkinson. These performers {{set the stage for}} the development of popular Barbadian calypso in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> special cases of it.|$|E
5|$|The main {{villages that}} {{supported}} Shahin's government were Rayfoun, Ajaltoun, Ashqout, Qleiat and Mazraat Kfardebian. The representatives of these villages {{were able to}} gain the solidarity of other villages by persuading their inhabitants through both peaceful and coercive means that as Christians they were all a part of single community with a united purpose. The leaders of some villages, {{such as those of}} Ghosta, Aramoun, Ghazir and Ftuh opposed Shahin and his revolt. Shahin's popularity among the Christian peasants of Mount Lebanon grew as he came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> their savior from both the Druze nobles and the traditional Maronite elites. This reputation was further solidified after Shahin's men backed Christian residents in a clash with Druze residents in the mixed village of Beit Meri in Matn in August 1859.|$|E

5|$|Vermigli {{was widely}} {{respected}} and very cautious. He {{was able to}} continue his reform efforts in Lucca without any suspicion of unorthodox views, despite a papal meeting there with Emperor Charles V in 1541. His eventual downfall was caused by two of his followers, one of whom openly questioned papal authority and another who celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist. The reconstitution of the Roman Inquisition in 1542 {{may have been in}} part a response to fear that Lucca and other cities would defect from the Catholic Church. The authorities of the Republic of Lucca began to fear that their political independence from the Holy Roman Empire was at stake if their city continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a Protestant haven. Bans on Protestant books heretofore ignored were enforced, religious feasts which had been dropped were reinstated, and religious processions were scheduled to assure Rome of Lucca's loyalty.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of its {{military}} outcome, the Siege of Dubrovnik is primarily remembered for the large-scale looting by JNA troops and the artillery bombardment of Dubrovnik, especially its Old Town. The reaction of the international media and {{media coverage of the}} siege reinforced an opinion, already taking shape since the fall of Vukovar, that the conduct of the JNA and the Serbs was barbaric and intent on dominating Croatiaregardless of the destruction of priceless cultural heritage that occurred in the process. Serbian authorities thought the international community had no moral grounds to judge because they did not interfere when hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed in Croatian concentration camps during World War II. Besides the protests made by Mayor Zaragoza, Vance and the ECMM, 104 Nobel Prize laureates published a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on 14 January 1992 at the incentive of Linus Pauling, urging governments throughout the world to stop the unrestrained destruction by the JNA. Because the siege shaped the international opinion of the Croatian War of Independence, it became a major contributor to a shift in the international diplomatic and economic isolation of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia, which came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> an aggressor-state in the West. On 17 December 1991, the European Economic Community agreed to recognize the independence of Croatia on 15 January 1992.|$|E

50|$|In some analyses, {{the perfect}} is {{identified}} {{as one of the}} grammatical aspects. In the perfect aspect, the event being referred <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> already completed at the time of reference. It {{should not be confused with}} the perfective aspect, which marks a situation as a single event without internal structure, and does not imply prior occurrence or present relevance as the perfect aspect does. The perfect also contrasts with the prospective aspect, which encodes the present relevance or anticipation of a future event. While the perfect is a relatively uniform category cross-linguistically, its relation to the experiential and resultative aspects is complex - the latter two are not simply restricted cases of the perfect.|$|R
25|$|Diabetics, despite {{not having}} {{clinically}} detectable atherosclerotic disease, have more severe debility from atherosclerotic events over time than non-diabetics {{who have already}} had atherosclerotic events.

25|$|This {{tendency}} to see kami as tutelary deities was strengthened during the Edo period (1603–1868) by the terauke system.

25|$|In the 1970s, by {{the time}} of the Extended Standard Theory, {{following}} the work of Joseph Emonds on structure preservation, transformations came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> holding over trees.

25|$|The {{principle}} of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a form of vertical time line, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.|$|E

When the ruling monarch of the United Kingdom George III, who suffered from a mental disorder, experienced a remission in 1789, mental illness {{came to be seen}} as something which could be treated and cured. The introduction of moral treatment was initiated independently by the French doctor Philippe Pinel and the English Quaker William Tuke.|$|E
