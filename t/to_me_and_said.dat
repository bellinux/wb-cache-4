25|$|I didn't {{play that}} well in {{stages of the}} tour and other players {{deserved}} a game. But we got to halfway through the tour and (captain) Greg Chappell came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> there was trouble {{at the top of}} the order and asked if I would like to open the batting in the county games. I did that and I was quite successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E
60|$|They {{were glad}} <b>to</b> see <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{they had a}} splendid time all day. They were up before sunrise, and had explored, tramped, boated, and I don't know what else.|$|R
60|$|It {{did seem}} {{a good plan}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>said</b> so. But Mrs. Makely was so much {{in love with it}} that she was not {{satisfied}} with my modest recognition.|$|R
6000|$|I {{confess that}} this sounded like mere sentimentalism <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>said,</b> [...] "Really, Aristides, I can't follow you. How are {{innocent}} {{people to be}} protected against this wretch, if he wanders about among them at will?" ...|$|R
500|$|For Streep, {{the most}} {{significant}} thing about the film was that [...] "his was the first time, on any movie I have ever made, where men came up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I know what you felt like, {{this is kind of}} like my life.' That was for me the most ground-breaking thing about Devil Wears Prada—it engaged men on a visceral level," [...] she told Indiewire.|$|E
500|$|Matt Groening noted: [...] "I can't {{tell you}} how many times people have come up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I know who you based that comic book guy on. It's that comic-book guy right down the block.' And I have to tell them, 'No, it's every comic-bookstore guy in America.'" [...] Cast member Hank Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a student who went by the name [...] "F" [...] and lived in the room next door at his college.|$|E
500|$|Keith Miller {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the Second World War. It changed him ... In the first post-war Ashes Test ... England were caught on a sticky ... Bill Edrich came in. He'd had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought, 'He's my old Services mate. The last thing he wants after five years' war is to be flattened by a cricket ball, so I eased up. Bradman came up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Don't slow down, Keith. Bowl quicker.' That remark put me off Test cricket. Never {{felt the same way}} about it after that.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Thus a {{construction}} of the following type could conceivably arise: [...] "It nearly knocked me off me plates—he was wearing a syrup! So I ran up the apples, got straight on the dog <b>to</b> <b>me</b> trouble <b>and</b> <b>said</b> I couldn't believe me mincers." ...|$|R
500|$|Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Ron Swanson's jazz musician alter ego before they learned Nick Offerman actually played the saxophone in real life, and had for his entire life. Offerman praised the decision: [...] "When he came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'You're {{going to have an}} alter ego who plays jazz saxophone,' I go, 'How do you see inside me?'" [...] After the episode broadcast, NBC created an official [...] "Duke Silver" [...] website, which included a biography, discography, reviews, gallery, tour schedule and booking information for the fictional band.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, he {{was chosen}} to captain the England B team in a match against the full {{national}} team of Malta, but {{it was to be}} his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described {{as one of the best}} defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team. Bruce later stated, [...] "I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica (sic). He came up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'I should have capped you'. It was nice to hear but it still didn't get me one .... I'll always be a little disappointed I didn't get one." ...|$|E
500|$|Recognizing Dylan's {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{progress}} of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: [...] "Grossman came up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard me. We got a thing going here'". Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's Music Row in February 1966.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that Wood would take a brief break from the program to film the fifth installment in the Final Destination film series, Final Destination 5. Wood recorded several scenes in advance of her planned absence. In May 2012, when The Bold and the Beautiful was shooting [...] Hope and Liam's wedding on location in Italy, Wood performed her own stunts in a drowning scene. Wood learned about her Daytime Emmy nomination just before filming a scene in the Adriatic sea, stating, [...] "I was just about to shoot a scene in the Adriatic sea in Italy.

500|$|The {{success of}} Stieg Larsson's novel created Hollywood {{interest}} in adapting the book, as became apparent in 2009, when Lynton and Pascal pursued {{the idea of}} developing an [...] "American" [...] version unrelated to the Swedish film adaptation released that year. By December, two major developments occurred for the project: Steven Zaillian, who had recently completed the script for Moneyball (2011), became the screenwriter, while producer Scott Rudin finalized a partnership allocating full copyrights to Sony. Zaillian, who was unfamiliar with the novel, got a copy from Rudin. The screenwriter recalled, [...] "They sent it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'We want to do this. [...] We will {{think of it as}} one thing for now. It's possible that it can be two and three, but let's concentrate on this one.'" [...] After reading the book, the screenwriter did no research on the subject.|$|E

Roger Waters and David Gilmour {{were in the process}} of completing Pink Floyd's Ummagumma album when they got involved with The Madcap Laughs that July and helped Barrett finish his album − [...] "in a two-day sprint", according to Pink Floyd biographer Rick Sanders. [...] "We had very little time," [...] Gilmour recalled in a May 2003 interview. [...] "Syd was very difficult, we got that very frustrated feeling: Look, it's your fucking career, mate. Why don't you get your finger out and do something? The guy was in trouble, and was a close friend for many years before then, so it really was the least one could do." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Guide {{referred}} to Todd as a breakout character. At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have come up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I think, right now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd".|$|E
500|$|The first writers {{assigned}} to the script were twins Julius and Philip Epstein who, against the wishes of Warner Brothers, left at Frank Capra's request early in 1942 {{to work on the}} Why We Fight series in Washington, D.C. While they were gone, the other credited writer, Howard Koch, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were re{{assigned to}} Casablanca and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. Koch later commented, [...] "When we began, we didn't have a finished script... Ingrid Bergman came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!" [...] In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, and Koch earned $4,200.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, who directed Beyoncé's videos, [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy". The video is inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film, The Band Wagon and has a Studio 54 style. Paired with Usher, Beyoncé dances seductively and flirts with him to portray a naughty girl. She {{felt that they were}} a [...] "perfect match" [...] for the dancing scenes in the video. According to Usher, the video is a homage to classic [...] "ultimate entertainers"; including dancers, singers and actors. He further talked about the collaboration on the video, saying, [...] "Beyoncé and me have been talking about doing a record together. She reached out <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> she had an idea and really wanted me to be the lead in her video... I was like, 'Well let me hear the idea.' It sounded like something totally different than what had been on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for [...] "The Winds of Winter" [...] was {{composed}} by Ramin Djawadi. Djawadi {{has worked on}} the series since its inception, and additionally composed the show's main theme. In an interview, Djawadi spoke about the score he created {{for the beginning of}} the episode, titled [...] "Light of the Seven", which largely consisted of piano, something unusual for the series. Djawadi stated, [...] "The interesting thing to me was the use of the piano. When we started the season, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached out <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'There's something coming up in episode 10.' We talked about 'The Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be a new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't want to tip the audience. Miguel brought it up: 'What about the piano?' We discussed it. The piano is not really {{in the language of the}} Game of Thrones score." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] was {{recorded}} in 2008 at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. Speaking to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Rihanna explained: [...] "I went into the studio making music my way. I found myself all at once." [...] In an interview on This Morning, Rihanna said that the song is not necessarily about a specific personal experience, but rather the general feelings of mental anguish, anxiety and confusion. Rihanna further explained {{that she wanted to}} record the song because she felt that listeners would be able to relate to the subject matter. When Good Girl Gone Bad was repackaged, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, boss of Def Jam, suggesting to release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as a single and follow-up to [...] "Take a Bow". Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and she knows what she wants to say. She's at that place where she can do that." ...|$|E
