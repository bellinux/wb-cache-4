5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, {{the station}} owners {{sent a letter}} of concern to the state, seeking <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> Impact Report for the museum and {{footbridge}} consider a breadth of possible impacts, particularly from the footbridge. The museum itself received a Finding Of No Significant Impact in March 2014. The Environmental Impact Evaluation for the footbridge, released in July 2014, analyzed seven alternatives for the footbridge location. Alternative 5a, located east of the baggage building and including a section to the garage, was the preferred alternative. The state committed $20 million towards {{the cost of the}} potential footbridge.|$|E

5|$|In February 2000, the Turnpike Authority {{gave in to}} {{the orders}} from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to have Route 92 undergo an {{environmental}} impact study, which could go up to two years, to help see if they should award the contract for construction. Opponents of the Route 92 project hailed this decision for the thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impact statement (EIS) would back up their beliefs. Four months later, the Army Corps of Engineers held a meeting {{to decide what to}} take into account for the impact statement and held opinions from both the supporters and opponents of the freeway. Around this time, locals sent an editorial to News 12 New Jersey to say that Middlesex County Route 522, already a four-lane freeway, should become the primary freeway across the portion of Middlesex County. However, the Turnpike Authority replied citing that Route 522 would be inadequate to handle the amount of traffic by 2015 that Route 92 was to handle. In December 2003, the Army Corps of Engineers approved the statement and although agencies still disagreed on the wetlands issues, held public hearings in 2004.|$|E

25|$|In 1998 {{a lawsuit}} was filed {{challenging}} the project, alleging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impact {{review of the}} project violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In 2001 the federal court {{ruled in favor of}} VDOT on the suit but required the agency to complete a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement addressing the road's impacts on the South Fork Rivanna Reservoir and the mitigation to minimize those impacts. That document was completed and accepted by the Federal Highway Administration in 2003.|$|E

25|$|The Sierra Club, The Humane Society, and the Eco-Justice Program {{have all}} officially {{endorsed}} the Green Bible. Reaction to the Green Bible among Christian leaders has been mixed. Some leaders have praised {{the concept of}} the Green Bible, but have raised issues with how some content is presented, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> message deemphasizes the Bible’s central message of the Gospels. Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission said about the edition: “Sure it's important, but when they asked Jesus what was most important, he said, 'Love your God, and love your neighbor as yourself.' He didn't say anything about creation”.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the Spring District, and its use of public funding to build roads and a light rail station to serve it, was opposed by Downtown Bellevue real estate developer Kemper Freeman. Freeman funded the campaigns {{of a set of}} Bellevue City Council candidates in the 2011 elections, while Spring District developer Wright Runstad funded a set of opposing candidates. Freeman had filed an appeal with the city prior to the election, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impact of additional automobile traffic generated by the Spring District would require further study than the current master plan. It was settled in 2012, with the city requiring a future study of traffic impacts in exchange for the withdrawal of the appeal.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} use of sound in The Last of Us. Eurogamers Welsh felt that the sound design was {{significantly}} better than in other games, while Game Informers Helgeson dubbed it [...] "amazing". Mc Shea of GameSpot stated that the audio added {{to the effect of}} the gameplay, particularly when hiding from enemies. Kelly of Computer and Video Games found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> audio positively impacted gameplay, and that Gustavo Santaolalla's score was [...] "sparse and delicate". Both Game Informers Helgeson and Destructoid's Sterling called the score [...] "haunting", with the latter finding that it complements the gameplay.|$|E
500|$|In the {{research}} studies on photosynthetic bacteria conducted in 1983, the dominant species identified were Chlorobium vibrioforme and Chlorobium limicola. Thiocapsa roseopersicina and Rhodopseudomonas palustris {{were also found}} but at lower density. In the anoxic water zone (temperature range of [...] to [...] ) of the lake, Chlorobium spp. and T. roseopersicina were found. It was also noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs. The dominance of the species Chlorobium spp. was attributed to [...] "more efficient maintenance metabolism in winter and of their greater efficiency in utilizing low intensity light".|$|E
500|$|Also, in 2012, {{researchers}} in Italy published findings that the pneumatic drilling machines that plant corn seeds coated with clothianidin and imidacloprid release {{large amounts of}} the pesticide into the air, causing significant mortality in foraging honey bees. According to the study, [...] "Experimental results show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> release of particles containing neonicotinoids can produce high exposure levels for bees, with lethal effects compatible with colony losses phenomena observed by beekeepers." [...] Commonly used pesticides, such as the imidacloprid, reduce colony growth and new queen production in experimental exposure matched to field levels. [...] Lu et al. (2012) reported {{they were able to}} replicate CCD with imidacloprid. Another neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, causes navigational homing failure of foraging bees, with high mortality.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, {{the tallest}} mast {{in the region}} at [...] above ground level, the Mendip UHF {{television}} transmitter, was installed on Pen Hill near Wells, {{one of the highest}} points of the Mendips. The transmitter's antenna rises to almost [...] above sea level. Since 2003, arguments have raged over plans to erect a wind turbine near Chewton Mendip. The proposal was initially rejected by Mendip District Council, which enjoyed the support of a range of local groups and organisations, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impact {{on the edge of the}} AONB outweighed the nominal amount of electricity which would be generated.

500|$|Definitions of {{the niche}} {{date back to}} 1917, but G. Evelyn Hutchinson made {{conceptual}} advances in 1957 by introducing a widely adopted definition: [...] "the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist and maintain stable population sizes." [...] The ecological niche is a central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub-divided into the fundamental and the realized niche. The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists. The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more technically as a [...] "Euclidean hyperspace whose dimensions are defined as environmental variables and whose size {{is a function of}} the number of values <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> values may assume for which an organism has positive fitness." ...|$|E
500|$|The city of Santee faced {{problems}} {{in the construction of}} the freeway from SR125 to SR67. As early as 1995, it was clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impact report was delayed and that there would be funding difficulties. SANDAG allocated $23milliondollars (about $ in [...] dollars) in 1999 to purchase properties needed for the right-of-way. In 2001, SANDAG gave $138million (about $ in [...] dollars) to the expansion of SR52 to SR67, which was necessary for extending the freeway past Cuyamaca Street. But by 2003, the transportation committee of SANDAG voted to delay the project due to decreased state funding. The city of Santee was required to make improvements to Forester Creek to accommodate potential flooding, which cost $30million (about $ in [...] dollars); the work began in May2006. Funding issues were finally resolved in 2006 with voter-approved statewide transportation bonds. In 2007, highway construction costs increased; that year, the SANDAG transportation committee voted to fund the construction, taking money from a planned reversible lanes project on SR52.|$|E

500|$|On April 1, 1998, the EPB {{published}} {{a press release}} claiming responsibility for {{an attack on a}} facility housing machinery and equipment being used to build the Superaqueduct, one of the Roselló administration's flagship projects. The organization informed that two of its Special Military Units, identified by the names [...] "Manolo el Leñero" [...] and [...] "Francisco Pachín Marín", infiltrated the locale during the previous night. The EPB cited that the government had been working on the project during nighttime, despite the existence of a case in the Appellation Circuit emitted an opinion stating that it lacked proper permits from several agencies including the Department of Natural Resources and that it violated zoning and construction laws, as the justification for their actions. Referring to the Roselló administration as a [...] "political mafia", the organization stated that the government acted [...] "in a dictatorial manner" [...] by [...] "disrespecting the Puerto Rican courts, with no hesitance" [...] and [...] "ignoring the positive and economic alternatives proposed by legitimate defenders of the environment [...] to satisfy the economic interests of private developers." [...] The EPB further argued that the large investment in this and other projects [...] "would end in the pockets of corrupt" [...] individuals, predicting that a portion of it would be used to fund the PNP's political campaign and its lobbyists in Washington. The organization made argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> damage to the central region and Lago Dos Bocas would be irreparable, also criticizing that the water was only being redirected to the metropolitan area. The group cited local scientists opposed to the Superaqueduct by stating that the effect would also affect Río Grande estuary and the natural reserve of Caño Tiburones in Arecibo, besides offering a subpar quality of water that could endanger the public health. The EPB also expressed concern in the competentcy of those manning the machinery, claiming that it could endanger the safety of children, concluding that these actions formed part of an initiative of [...] "policy of National Salvation" [...] that intended to protect sectors of the general public and workers of entities that the Roselló administration intended to privatize, such as the Puerto Rico Telephone Company. Los Macheteros claimed responsibility for an explosion at a small power station in the San Juan metropolitan area. The explosion caused limited power outages.|$|E
