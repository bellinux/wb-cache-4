5|$|Relatively common {{where it}} occurs, kitefin sharks are usually solitary in nature but may form small groups. It {{is a slow}} swimmer with a large liver filled with squalene, a lipid less dense than water, {{allowing}} it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover above <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>with</b> little effort. Studies {{off the coast of}} North Africa and in the Gulf of Genoa have found males outnumbering females by 2:1 and 5:1 respectively; this imbalanced sex ratio has not been observed off South Africa and may reflect sampling bias. The kitefin shark is preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks, as well as by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Parasite data on this species is limited; an examination of two sharks caught off Ireland found three nematodes in the stomach lumen. One could be identified as Anisakis simplex L3, while another may have been a larval Raphidascaris.|$|E
5|$|The crest was {{altered in}} 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons – {{one at the}} top, with Animo et Fide, and one at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>with</b> Stockport County F.C.. In addition, the {{football}} was again removed from the shield. The Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer Umbro who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013–14 season, replacing Nike, thus making County the only senior club in the UK to wear the Umbro strip in the 2013–14 season. For {{the start of the}} 2014–15 season, County again changed their kit manufacturer, this time from Umbro to Spanish-based manufacturer Joma which supplied County with a new Home, Away and Third kit along with training wear.|$|E
5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>with</b> little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E

5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at <b>the</b> <b>bottom)</b> <b>with</b> Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E
5|$|González-Gordon worked most of {{his life}} for the family company González Byass, which specializes in making sherry. He was the fifth {{generation}} of the family to chair the company. While working for the firm he was involved in the making, tasting and commercialisation of sherry and in later years he also helped the company expand into producing brandy and several sorts of wine. Immediately after he finished his studies in 1946 he joined the business and started at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>with</b> the picking and crushing of grapes. During this time he also learned about the solera system, which is used to age different type of liquids. His interest in oenology had only developed after visiting California the year he graduated. He visited California after previously being sent to New York by boat with twelve containers of wine. In 1955 he founded the first research center for viticulture and winemaking in Spain by establishing one at González Byass. For twenty years he was occupied as head of wine selection at the company. González-Gordon also served on the board of González Byass beginning in 1961, and was president of the company between 1993 and 1999. During this period González-Gordon managed to expand the business by exporting all over the world, including to the United States, United Kingdom, China and East Asia. After his time as president he continued to serve as an advisor to his son, Mauricio Junior, who took over his position. Apart from his work at González Byass González-Gordon also diverted some of his time towards the regulatory council of the sherry making industry, serving for 24 years.|$|E

25|$|Maintenance inspection: All {{types of}} {{extinguishers}} should be inspected {{at least once}} a year. The extinguisher is checked that it has the correct volume and pressure of extinguishing agent, that it is within the required hydrotest and internal maintenance intervals, that it is in good condition, and that all external parts are still serviceable. Dry chemical and dry powder types may also be hit on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>with</b> a rubber mallet to make sure the powder is free-flowing.

25|$|The main {{difference}} from the previous model was the replacement of a 100hp rotary engine with a much more powerful 150hp Salmson radial engine, which improved performance. The engine was unusual, {{being one of the}} few water-cooled radial engines, hence the plane had a water radiator in front of the upper wing. This engine was license-built in Russia. The forward fuselage was similar to its predecessor, with a partial engine cowling, open at <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>with</b> characteristic holes. The plane was also slightly larger and more heavily armed, adding a synchronised forward-firing machine gun for the pilot in addition to the observer's weapon.|$|E

The Raja Permaisuri Agong's standard is green in colour, with the coat of arms at the centre surrounded by the paddy wreath. The Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong's standard is bicolored, yellow at the top and light blue at <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>with</b> the coat of arms at the centre (without the paddy) and below that is the office bearer's title.|$|E

25|$|As firefighters {{on shore}} and in fire boats poured {{water on the}} blaze, the ship {{developed}} a dangerous list to port due to water pumped into the seaward side by fireboats. The ship's designer Vladimir Yourkevitch arrived at the scene to offer expertise, but he was barred by harbor police. His suggestion was to enter the vessel and open the sea-cocks. This would flood the lower decks and make her settle the few feet to <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> <b>With</b> the ship stabilised, water could be pumped into burning areas without the risk of capsize. The suggestion {{was rejected by the}} commander of the 3rd Naval District, Rear Admiral Adolphus Andrews.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, the Central Intelligence Agency started {{sponsoring}} a program known as Diamond Lil, in which Chinese Nationalist pilots {{were trained to}} fly RB-57Ds. Six Black Cat Squadron Taiwanese pilots were trained on the B-57C at Laughlin AFB, Texas, arriving back in Taiwan, {{and two or three}} Group A RB-57Ds were ferried to Taoyuan AB, near Taipei, Taiwan in early 1959. During early 1959, they carried out deep penetration reconnaissance flights over the Chinese mainland, photographing airfields, military establishments and ports. They flew in Republic of China Air Force markings, being painted white on top and black on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>with</b> lettering stenciled in red.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Ages, most {{winemaking}} technology advances {{were made}} by religious orders (particularly in France and Germany) who owned vast amounts of vineyard land and produced large quantities of wines in their abbeys and bishoprics. It was here that the basket press became popular. The press included large cylindrical basket made of wood staves bound together by wood or metal rings with a heavy horizontal disc fitted at the top. After the grapes were loaded into the basket, the disc would depress towards <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>with</b> juice seeping out between the staves into a waiting basin or tray. In some presses, added pressure would come from a giant lever or manual hand crank.|$|E

The fasces are held together by two ropes in gold that tie the fasces at the top and at the bottom and in which the middle is tied in the form of an x-shaped cross. In the middle of the fasces, above the ropes lies an argent riband in which engraved to it are the Greek Letters Phi Iota Alpha.

25|$|The Consort {{was first}} {{shown at the}} 1956 Commercial Motor Show. It was a {{development}} of the Venturer, but {{in place of the}} previous oval the four-part grill was now enclosed by a near-trapezoidal outline (though actually hexagonal), wider at the top than <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>with</b> the headlamps outside. Trim was revised to be much squarer in outline, featuring ribbed brightwork, and the curved rear quarter lights, first standardised on the Venturer III, were now incorporated into the main window line. However, a year later the Consort II was announced, re-introducing the oval grill outline of the Venturer – but now surrounding a plainer grill with chrome flash across the middle - while the trim lines so recently squared up were softened once again. The evident popularity of the oval- shaped grill then ensured its survival as a Plaxton hallmark for many years to come.|$|E
25|$|If {{the match}} is not ended by a fall, {{technical}} fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers {{to begin the}} second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this {{is determined by the}} colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in a place called the referee's position on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action {{at the center of the}} mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>with</b> his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (with the palm of his hand against the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.|$|E
