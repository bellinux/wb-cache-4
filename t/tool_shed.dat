5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Great Notch station, which was falling into disrepair, {{received}} a new paint job, {{changed from the}} red-green colors for the Erie Lackawanna to a new all red Erie Railroad paint scheme. The abandoned <b>tool</b> <b>shed</b> made {{out of the old}} wooden boxcar was also removed. Due to the removal of the tool boxcar, the propane tanks that heated the station building were also made visible. After the ending of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in 1976, the Great Notch station lay abandoned. In June 1979, the State of New Jersey began to remove the tracks for the Caldwell Branch, which also lay abandoned at Great Notch. Currently, what was the track leading to the Caldwell Branch is a siding. On January 20, 1988, the newly rehabilitated station building was destroyed by fire. During the construction of the Montclair Connection in 2001, the adjacent Great Notch Yard received a major upgrade, becoming a new state-of-the-art yard with new trains storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|In a California forest, a {{group of}} alien botanists land in a spacecraft, {{collecting}} flora samples. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving {{one of their own}} behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their <b>tool</b> <b>shed.</b> The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E
50|$|After {{the land}} was {{converted}} to a park, but still unopen to the public, the camp was often vandalized. One of Nelson's <b>tool</b> <b>sheds</b> was burned down; the arsonist attempted to burn other buildings but was unsuccessful.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{there were}} no {{facilities}} designated for conjugal visits. Some prisoners used <b>tool</b> <b>sheds</b> and storage areas in the camp areas, and others took their wives and girlfriends into the prisoner barracks and placed blankets over beds to allow for privacy.

25|$|The unincorporated {{hamlet of}} Hardy was {{established}} {{on the north}} boundary of Tower Rock as a siding by the Montana Central Railway in 1888. Named for rancher Rufus Hardy, who in 1866 became the first white settler {{on the west bank}} of the river in the canyon, the settlement was given a post office the year it was founded. Although the town had 52 residents in the 1910s, a depression in the agricultural sector in the 1920s and the Great Depression reduced its population to near zero. By 1934, Hardy consisted only of the railroad station and a <b>tool</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|E

50|$|Gardens in the Gateway Greening network {{have access}} to a number of benefits, the most visible of these is the {{biannual}} expansion application which allows gardens to apply for additional supplies such as raised beds, soil, garden tools, wheelbarrows, compost bins, and <b>tool</b> <b>sheds.</b> Other benefits including ongoing educational opportunities for gardeners at Gateway Greening’s Bell Demonstration & Community Garden and the network’s Community Resource Gardens, many of which are free and also open to the public.|$|R
30|$|The {{mathematics}} of nonlinear Dynamical System Theory (DST), including attractor dynamics (see Glossary) and {{the paradigm}} of self-organization, {{can be regarded as}} a contribution towards building a deeper understanding of what neural or cognitive information really is. Furthermore, these new <b>tools</b> <b>shed</b> light on how the flow of informational elements are integrated into complex systematic structures, from the most basic perceptual representations, generated by cell assemblies, to the most complex cognitive representations, like symbol structures, generated by tensor products or oscillatory representations.|$|R
25|$|Leaving Childs on guard, {{the others}} {{head out to}} test Blair, {{only to find that}} he has {{tunneled}} out of the <b>tool</b> <b>shed.</b> They realize that Blair is assimilated and has been scavenging equipment to build a small escape craft. Discovering that Childs is missing and the station's power generator is destroyed, MacReady speculates that the Thing now intends to hibernate until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to dynamite the complex, hoping to destroy the Thing. As they set the explosives, Blair kills Garry and Nauls disappears. Blair transforms into a much larger monster and attacks, destroying the detonator, but MacReady still triggers the blast with a stick of dynamite, destroying the base.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans were}} {{approved}} by the municipal council in February 1936, allowing construction of the 18,000-Norwegian krone project to commence. Two-thirds of the investments went to building the floating wharfs. The terminal cost NOK4,600, NOK600 was used for an outhouse and a <b>tool</b> <b>shed.</b> NOK700 was invested in providing water and sewer lines to the site and the last NOK100 was used to upgrade the road. This was in contrast {{to most of the}} other water aerodromes along the coast, which lacked a wharf to which the aircraft could dock. The airport and the DNL route with the three-engine Junkers Ju 52 Havørn were opened on 7 June 1936. The first season there were three weekly round trips. Havørn crashed with the mountain of Lihesten on 16 June, killing all on board in the Havørn Accident. Therefore, Ternen was put into service on the route until a new Ju 52, Falken, entered service on 28 June. The service was only flown for the summer.|$|E
25|$|At Stoney Creek Station, a {{gatehouse}} {{was erected}} in 1909. By 1911 the complex included an open shelter shed with an enclosed office, plus a ladies' {{room with a}} curved roof to the east. By 1936 the complex consisted of the shelter shed; ladies' room; a water tank for steam trains, supplied from Stoney Creek Falls and a sand shed (west end of station); plus two fettler's camping quarters and a trolley and <b>tool</b> <b>shed</b> (either side of track, east end of station). Only the shelter shed, the water tank and the sand shed survive. The latter was once used to refill sandboxes on trains, which enabled dry sand to be dropped onto the tracks to assist traction. In the 1980s a telephone line and its poles were removed. The siding is used by QR maintenance gangs to wait for tourist trains to pass, and the shelter shed is used when it is raining. Exotic plantings in the station's gardens have being replaced by natives, {{in keeping with the}} National Park, although mature mango trees of heritage significance have been retained.|$|E

500|$|Train {{service at}} Great Notch {{originated}} in 1891, when the Caldwell Railway opened, serving Great Notch, Overbrook Hospital, Verona, and Caldwell. The station at Great Notch was first constructed in 1905 as a double station {{building for the}} Erie Railroad. The station was a green and red building serving the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, along with the Caldwell Branch. The station also used an old boxcar as a <b>tool</b> <b>shed</b> for maintenance. By the early 1970s, the station had fallen into disrepair, and by 1974, was repainted Erie Railroad-style red with the <b>tool</b> <b>shed</b> box car removed. The station was abandoned when the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad {{went out of business}} and was later picked up by New Jersey Transit. After making deals with the mayor of Little Falls, New Jersey Transit gave the station a one-year [...] "trial" [...] to attract ridership. Ridership went down, however, and so the trial was canceled on December 18, 2009. The town of Little Falls was contacted by New Jersey Transit at that time, reporting that the Great Notch Station would be closed on January 17, 2010 due to the [...] "anemic" [...] ridership at the station.|$|E
