5|$|In 1979, {{problems}} with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing allies of the U.S. at a disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France's Dassault Mirage 2000. Barry N. Blechman, Assistant Director of <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> and Disarmament Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales. At the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.|$|E

25|$|Amongst the {{legislation}} passed by Congress during the Kennedy Administration, unemployment benefits were expanded, aid {{was provided to}} cities to improve housing and transportation, funds were allocated to continue {{the construction of a}} national highway system started under Eisenhower, a water pollution control act was passed to protect the country’s rivers and streams, and an agricultural act to raise farmers’ incomes was made law. A significant amount of anti-poverty legislation was passed by Congress, including increases in social security benefits and in the minimum wage, several housing bills, and aid to economically distressed areas. A few antirecession public works packages, together with a number of measures designed to assist farmers, were introduced. Major expansions and improvements were made in Social Security (including retirement at 62 for men), hospital construction, library services, family farm assistance and reclamation. Food stamps for low-income Americans were reintroduced, food distribution to the poor was increased, and there was an expansion in school milk and school lunch distribution. The most comprehensive farm legislation since 1938 was carried out, with expansions in rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, farm credit, and marketing orders. In September 1961, <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> and Disarmament Agency was established as the focal point in government for the “planning, negotiation, and execution of international disarmament and arms control agreements.” Altogether, the New Frontier witnessed the passage of a broad range of important social and economic reforms.|$|E
25|$|Sanctions {{have reduced}} Iran's access to {{products}} {{needed for the}} oil and energy sectors, have prompted many oil companies to withdraw from Iran, and have also caused a decline in oil production due to reduced access to technologies needed to improve their efficiency. According to Undersecretary of State William Burns, Iran may be annually losing as much as $60 billion in energy investment. Many international companies have also been reluctant {{to do business with}} Iran for fear of losing access to larger Western markets. As well as restricting export markets, the sanctions have reduced Iran's oil income by increasing the costs of repatriating revenues in complicated ways that sidestep the sanctions; Iranian analysts estimate the budget deficit for the 2011/2012 fiscal year, which in Iran ends in late March, at between $30bn to $50bn. The effects of U.S. sanctions include expensive basic goods for Iranian citizens, and an aging and increasingly unsafe civil aircraft fleet. According to <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> Association, the international arms embargo against Iran is slowly reducing Iran's military capabilities, largely due to its dependence on Russian and Chinese military assistance. The only substitute is to find compensatory measures requiring more time and money, and which are less effective. According to at least one analyst (Fareed Zakaria), the market for imports in Iran is dominated by state enterprises and state-friendly enterprises, because the way to get around the sanctions is smuggling, and smuggling requires strong connections with the government. This has weakened Iranian civil society and strengthened the state.|$|E

500|$|In 1958, Kistiakowsky {{suggested}} to President Eisenhower that inspection of foreign military facilities {{was not sufficient}} to control their nuclear weapons. He cited the difficulty in monitoring missile submarines, and proposed that <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> strategy focus on disarmament rather than inspections. In January 1960, as part of arms control planning and negotiation, he suggested the [...] "threshold concept". Under this proposal, all nuclear tests above the level of seismic detection technology would be forbidden. After such an agreement, the US and USSR would work jointly to improve detection technology, revising the permissible test yield downward as techniques improved. This example of the [...] "national means of technical verification", a euphemism for sensitive intelligence collection used in arms control, would provide safeguards, without raising the on-site inspection requirement to a level unacceptable to the Soviets. The US introduced the threshold concept to the Soviets at the Geneva arms control conference in January 1960 and the Soviets, in March, responded favorably, suggesting a threshold of a given seismic magnitude. Talks broke down {{as a result of}} the U-2 Crisis of 1960 in May.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Kennedy {{sided with}} those arguing for resumed testing. In particular, an {{argument}} by William C. Foster, {{the head of}} <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> and Disarmament Agency, swayed Kennedy. Foster argued that if the US {{failed to respond to}} the Soviet test series, Moscow could order a second test series, which could give the Soviet Union a significant advantage. Furthermore, a second test series, without US reciprocation, could damage the push for a test ban and make Senate ratification of any agreement less likely. On 2 March 1962, building on the November 1961 announcement, Kennedy promised to resume atmospheric testing by the end of April 1962 if Moscow continued to resist the Anglo-American test-ban proposal. To an extent, the announcement was a compromise, as Kennedy restricted atmospheric tests to those tests which were [...] "absolutely necessary," [...] not feasible underground, and minimized fallout. The condition that testing would resume only if the Soviet Union continued to oppose the Anglo-American proposal also served as a concession to dissenting voices within his administration and to Macmillan.|$|E

2500|$|This {{was based}} on his prior {{historic}} speech before the Japanese National Diet on 29 November 1985, in which he said: [...] "Let us remove the mental partitions which obstruct the ennobling vision of the human family linked together in peace and prosperity.

The foiled bid of India recently to enter the Nuclear Suppliers Group, echoed his policy of [...] non-proliferation {{to be linked to}} universal disarmament, which the World Nuclear Association refuses to recognise; non-proliferation being seen by India as essentially a weapon of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> regime, of the big nuclear powers as United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, and China. In his [...] five-day visit to the United States, in June 1985, he was provided with unbelievable security by the Ronald Reagan administration due to the separatist Sikhs, whose terrorist apparatus was now fully amalgamated with [...] Islamic fundamentalist terror, both Libyan and Iranian.

2500|$|In December, the ISIS {{said that}} Iran had {{produced}} 425 kilograms of uranium, and that Iran had [...] "not yet achieved a break-out capability", but that Iran may {{be close to}} a break-out capability. In response to statements that Iran had enough material to make a weapon, <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> Association urged the U.S. and the media to exhibit greater care when making claims about Iran's nuclear program. Ivan Oelrich and Ivanka Barzashka, from the Federation of American Scientists, said that the [...] "simplistic calculations" [...] contained in the ISIS article were wrong because [...] "just taking the quantity of LEU and multiplying by the U-235 concentration does not work because {{not all of the}} U-235 is recovered". Cheryl Rofer, a retired 35 year researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory and former president of the Los Alamos Committee on Arms Control and International Security, has argued that for Iran to make a bomb from this material it would need to kick all the inspectors out of the country, reconfigure thousands of closely watched centrifuges, and then engage in years of enrichment. According to the American Institute of Physics, the most difficult step in building a nuclear weapon is the production of fissile material. Iran has enriched uranium to [...] "less than 5%", consistent with fuel for a nuclear power plant and well below the purity of WEU (around 90%) typically used in a weapons program. HEU with a purity of 20% or more is usable in a weapon, but this route is less desirable because far more material is required to obtain critical mass. [...] "Our production of a nuclear energy program is completely within the framework or structure of international laws," [...] said Ali Akbar Javanfekr, media adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. David Albright, president of the group which published the report, maintained that Iran's enriched uranium meant that Israel was losing control over the timing of Iran's nuclear activities and that even Iran pretending to have a bomb would be a threat. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its inspectors have not found evidence to suggest that Iran is attempting to process low-enriched uranium into weapons-grade uranium, but expressed concern that Iran was still refusing to comply with the United Nation's requirement of ending its uranium enrichment activity.|$|E
