5|$|Odontocetes, such as {{the sperm}} whale, possess teeth with {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of the}} tooth outside of <b>the</b> <b>gum,</b> whale teeth have cementum outside <b>the</b> <b>gum.</b> Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. Mysticetes have large whalebone, as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas Odontocetes contain only one.|$|E
5|$|The Māori {{had many}} uses for <b>the</b> <b>gum,</b> which they called kapia. Fresh gum {{was used as}} a type of chewing gum (older gum was {{softened}} by soaking and mixing with juice of the puha thistle). Highly flammable, <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> was also used as a fire-starter, or bound in flax to act as a torch. Burnt and mixed with animal fat, it made a dark pigment for moko tattooing. Kauri gum was also crafted into jewellery, keepsakes, and small decorative items. Like amber, kauri gum sometimes includes insects and plant material.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1830s and 1840s, merchants, {{including}} Gilbert Mair and Logan Campbell, were buying gum from local Māori for £5 ($8.25) a ton, or trading it for goods. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> was exported to America and London (from whence it was distributed throughout Europe), although smaller amounts were sent to Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Russia.|$|E

50|$|Different {{toothbrush}} {{types are}} more inclined to cause abrasion, such as those with medium or hard bristles. The bristles combined with forceful brushing techniques applied can roughen the tooth surface and cause abrasion as well as aggravating <b>the</b> <b>gums.</b> Repetitive irritation to the gingival margin can eventually cause recession of <b>the</b> <b>gums.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>gums</b> recede, <b>the</b> root surface is exposed which is more susceptible to abrasion.Comparatively, electric toothbrushes have less abrasive tendencies.|$|R
50|$|Subgingival biofilm is plaque that {{is located}} under <b>the</b> <b>gums.</b> It occurs after the {{formation}} of the supragingival biofilm by a downward growth of the bacteria from above <b>the</b> <b>gums</b> to below. This plaque is mostly made up of anaerobic bacteria, meaning that these bacteria will only survive if there is no oxygen. As this plaque attaches in a pocket under <b>the</b> <b>gums,</b> they are not exposed to oxygen in the mouth and will therefore thrive if not removed.|$|R
5|$|Kauri gum is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing several areas to revert to sand dunes, scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> and the remaining forests.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum was Auckland's main export in {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{sustaining}} much of the early growth of the city. Between 1850 and 1950, 450,000tons of gum were exported. The peak in <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> market was 1899, with 11,116tons exported that year, with a value of £600,000 ($989,700). The average annual export was over 5,000tons, with the average price gained £63 ($103.91) per ton.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gumfields were in Northland, Coromandel and Auckland, {{the site}} of the {{original}} kauri forests. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> was readily accessible, commonly found lying on the ground. Captain Cook reported the presence of resinous lumps on the beach at Mercury Bay, Coromandel, in 1769, although he suspected it came from the mangroves, and missionary Samuel Marsden spoke of their presence in Northland in 1819.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the colour}} of <b>the</b> <b>gums</b> can vary, {{uniformity}} of colour {{is more important}} than the underlying color itself. Excess deposits of melanin can cause dark spots or patches on <b>the</b> <b>gums</b> (melanin gingival hyperpigmentation), especially at the base of <b>the</b> interdental papillae. <b>Gum</b> depigmentation (aka gum bleaching) is a procedure used in cosmetic dentistry to remove these discolorations.|$|R

5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of <b>the</b> <b>gum,</b> whale teeth have cementum outside <b>the</b> <b>gum.</b> Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people with}} AML may {{experience}} {{swelling of the}} gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> tissue. Rarely, {{the first sign of}} leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow, called a chloroma. Occasionally, a person may show no symptoms, and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} {{was found to}} mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used kauri gum. It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E
5|$|These lemurs have {{relatively}} long hindlegs. For gripping tree trunks and large branches, they have large {{hands and feet}} with extended pads on the digits, as well as claw-like nails. They have a long tongue which assists obtaining <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> and nectar, {{as well as a}} long caecum, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (forward-facing) lemuriform toothcomb (formed by the lower incisors and canines) is long and more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth.|$|E

On behalf of 2007 champions Milan, their technical operations director and former player Leonardo, and club director Umberto Gandini presented the trophy back to UEFA president Michel Platini, who passed it on to the Mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, for it to be displayed in five cities around the country – Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Krasnodar, Saint Petersburg and Samara – before returning to Moscow ahead of the final. Also in attendance at the ceremony were final ambassador Rinat Dasayev and Russian Football Union president Vitaly Mutko.|$|E

5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the silk protein, fibroin, gummed together with sericin. In the traditional process, <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> is removed by soaking in hot water, and the silk is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E

50|$|Treatment of {{periodontitis}} {{may include}} several steps, {{the first of}} which often requires the removal of the local causative factors {{in order to create a}} biologically compatible environment between the tooth and the surrounding periodontal tissues, <b>the</b> <b>gums</b> and underlying bone.

25|$|In some people, {{gingivitis}} progresses to periodontitis – {{with the}} destruction of the gingival fibers, <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> tissues separate from the tooth and deepened sulcus, called a periodontal pocket. Subgingival microorganisms (those that exist under <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> line) colonize the periodontal pockets and cause further inflammation in <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> tissues and progressive bone loss. Examples of secondary causes are those things that, by definition, cause microbic plaque accumulation, such as restoration overhangs and root proximity.|$|E
25|$|While {{hydrophobic}} polymers beneficially repel {{water and}} contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness of gum results from this hydrophobic nature, as gum can form bonds and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one’s shoe. To make matters worse, unsticking <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> is a challenge because the long polymers of <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> base stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic of gum may be problematic during processing if <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> sticks to any machinery or packaging materials during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating of gum {{toward the end of}} the process. By adding either a powder or a coating to the exterior of <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> product, the hydrophobic gum base binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which it may come in contact.|$|E
25|$|First, {{gum base}} is {{previously}} prepared through a melting and straining or filtering process. The formulation for gum base is proprietary information known to few individuals within each gum-producing company. Next, other ingredients such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners and flavors {{are added to}} <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> base until the warm mixture thickens like dough. <b>The</b> <b>gum</b> base mixture is heated during this mixing process {{in order to increase}} the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape <b>the</b> <b>gum.</b> Next, <b>the</b> <b>gum</b> goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut and wrap (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the extruder using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums. Next, gum is either conditioned by being sprinkled with a powdered polyol or coated via the application of subsequent layers of coating using temperature controlled coating basins before it is sent to packaging.|$|E
