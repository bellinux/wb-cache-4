50|$|In 2003, RazorUSA {{introduced}} its first electric Razor scooter. It operates {{with the use}} of a <b>twisting</b> <b>throttle.</b> These new models reach speeds up to 15 miles per hour. Electric scooters became a popular way to travel slightly longer distances than one might with a traditional Razor scooter, yet distances short enough that using a bike would be excessive.|$|R
50|$|The pedals on a {{motorised}} bicycle must be {{the primary}} source of power for the vehicle. If the motor is {{the primary source of}} power then the device cannot be classed as a motorised bicycle. For example, a device where the rider can <b>twist</b> a <b>throttle</b> and complete a journey using motor power only without using the pedals, would not be classed as a motorised bicycle.|$|R
50|$|The Chairiot solo {{is not a}} conversion; it was {{designed}} from inception {{to be driven by}} a disabled person using a wheelchair. The vehicle is entered through a large rear door and integrated ramp; a floor dock secures the wheelchair to the car. It is controlled by a steering wheel with a spinner knob, along with a combination <b>twist</b> grip <b>throttle</b> and lever for braking. All controls are operable with modest upper body strength. There are no foot pedals in the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} model year was 1971, though the sled {{had been in}} development since 1969. There were two 1971 models, the Raider and the Roamer. The 1971 Raider featured a single cylinder JLO 2-stroke engine {{in the beginning of}} the model year, but later may have switched to CCW. The 1971 Roamer featured a 10 hp Briggs & Stratton 4 cycle engine. The production numbers are unknown, but it is believed that approximately 50 '71 Roamers and 50 '71 Raiders were produced. 1971 Raiders and Roamers featured a <b>twist</b> grip <b>throttle,</b> which was found to be hard to control in bumpy conditions.|$|R
50|$|To {{ease the}} pilot's workload, a {{mechanical}} throttle correlator adjusts the throttle as the collective pitch control is raised or lowered. The pilot {{needs to make}} only small adjustments by <b>twisting</b> the <b>throttle</b> grip on the collective throughout the flight regime. Later models are also equipped with an electronic governor which works to maintain RPM within normal operating limits (between 97% and 104% RPM); the governor is active only when the engine is running above 80% RPM, and is most effective in normal flight conditions. The governor can be switched on or off with a toggle switch located {{at the end of}} the pilot's collective pitch control. When the governor is not engaged, a yellow caution light glows on the instrument panel.|$|R
50|$|The player {{had to go}} as fast as {{possible}} without skidding off the road or colliding with other racing bikes on the screen. Turn the handlebars, and the bike would corner and bank. <b>Twist</b> the handle <b>throttle</b> open, and it would accelerate. When a collision with another bike occurs, the handlebars vibrate and the screen flashes a reverse image. To increase the challenge, the size of the bike can be regulated by the operator.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanically, {{there were}} few changes within the series. The KZP has over 95% parts {{compatibility}} across the entire production run, {{and in fact the}} <b>throttle</b> <b>twist</b> assembly, which holds the switches for the pursuit lights and siren, kept the [...] "M" [...] position used by the C-series to lock the speedometer needle. A major change was in 2002, when the chain size was changed from 630 to 530, saving weight and increasing acceleration.|$|R
50|$|The {{first use}} of the <b>twist</b> grip <b>throttle</b> control was on the Roper steam {{velocipede}} of 1867-69. Rather than a sleeve that rotated around the handlebar, Sylvester H. Roper's steam motorcycle's entire handlebar rotated, with a dual mode operation. When rotated forward it opened the throttle, and when rotated backwards it applied the spoon brake. Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr said that pioneering this technology was a point {{in favor of the}} Roper's precedence as the first motorcycle, in response to Cycle World Technical Editor Kevin Cameron's position that the 1885 Daimler Reitwagen was more deserving because it used the more successful technology, internal combustion rather than steam. The design drawings of the Reitwagen depicted a twist grip speed control, also applying the brake when turned one way, but when turned the other way, it would have tensioned the belt drive's idler pulley, applying power to the rear wheel {{in the manner of a}} clutch. The actual working model, however, did not have the twist grip, belt drive, or brakes.|$|R
5000|$|Some late-1950s Cushmans, {{designated}} Road King and Pacemaker, had jet-age body styling. Sears sold {{a version}} of these models under the Allstate brand. Cushman scooters featured an automatic centrifugal clutch, which allowed the rider to twist the right grip to accelerate. Oddly, the <b>throttle</b> <b>twisted</b> forward during acceleration, opposite the usual pattern in most other motorcycles and scooters. Cushman claimed 75 miles per gallon, and advertised penny-a-mile operating cost. Cushman scooters usually weighed about 250 to 335 pounds and had as much as [...] In comparison to european scooters, Cushman scooters had a higher weight, larger cubic capacity (up to 0,4 l), but not more power.|$|R
5000|$|Kiekhaefer Mercury foresaw {{that the}} average American's {{interest}} in boating would increase after the war. Kiekhaefer introduced a 19.8 cubic inch, 10 horsepower (hp), two-cylinder alternate firing design engine at the 1947 New York Boat Show called the [...] "Lightning" [...] or KE-7. This engine, also called the [...] "Super 10", actually developed around 14 horsepower. Its designation was updated to KF-7 for 1949. For 1951 the engine block, though still displacing 19.8 cubic inches, was updated a great deal, and given the name [...] "Hurricane". The 1951 kg-7 [...] "Super 10" [...] featured this engine, which developed around 16 horsepower. For 1952, this model was updated with a [...] "forward, neutral, reverse" [...] gearset, and a <b>twist</b> grip <b>throttle.</b> It was renamed [...] "Cruiser" [...] at this point, and no longer called [...] "Super 10". This engine later became {{the heart of the}} [...] "Mark 25", of the mid to late fifties. Initially rated at 16 horsepower, this engine was soon beefed up to 20. There was also an [...] "H" [...] version, which produced more power but carried no rating. [...] "H" [...] version Mercurys were mostly used for racing.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{having only}} a single rotor, the RE5's engine was {{mechanically}} complex and its numerous subsystems made for a heavy motorcycle. Rotary engines produce a lot of heat, and the RE5 had [...] water- and oil-cooling, and double-skinned exhaust pipes. [...] Ignition was CDI, with two sets of ignition points actuated via vacuum and rpm sensors, to light a solitary NGK spark plug. Three oil reservoirs served the sump, gearbox and total loss tank. Separate oil pumps fed (respectively) the main bearings and the inlet tracts (to lubricate tip seals). The throttle controlled both the primary carburetor butterfly and a second valve in the inlet manifold of the secondary throat (the [...] "port" [...] valve), as well as governing oil supply to the combustion chamber. Five cables in total were moved by the <b>throttle</b> <b>twist</b> grip! The carburetor {{was similar to that}} in a rotary-powered car, and was far more complicated than for normal motorcycles.|$|R
