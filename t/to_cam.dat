5|$|In December 1944 the United States Navy's {{high command}} became {{concerned}} that the IJN would attempt to cut the supply line to the planned beachhead at Lingayen Gulf. On 26 December a Japanese naval force operating from Cam Ranh Bay in Japanese-controlled French Indochina shelled the Allied beachhead at Mindoro, but inflicted no damage. One of the Japanese destroyers involved in this operation was sunk, {{and all of the}} remaining ships were damaged by Allied air and naval attacks before returning <b>to</b> <b>Cam</b> Ranh Bay.|$|E

General Trưởng also ordered the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment (3rd Infantry Division) to depart from Da Nang, and protect Tam Kỳ, so that General Nhut's forces could be free up to fight the North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|The first cacti {{are thought}} to have been only {{slightly}} succulent shrubs or small trees whose leaves carried out photosynthesis. They lived in tropical areas that experienced periodic drought. If Pereskia clade A is a good model of these early cacti, then, although they would have appeared superficially similar to other trees growing nearby, they had already evolved strategies to conserve water (some of which are present in members of other families in the order Caryophyllales). These strategies included being able to respond rapidly to periods of rain, and keeping transpiration low by using water very efficiently during photosynthesis. The latter was achieved by tightly controlling the opening of stomata. Like Pereskia species today, early ancestors may have been able to switch from the normal C3 mechanism, where carbon dioxide is used continuously in photosynthesis, <b>to</b> <b>CAM</b> cycling, in which when the stomata are closed, carbon dioxide produced by respiration is stored for later use in photosynthesis.|$|E

5|$|Starting at 11am on March 14, Thieu {{flew out}} <b>to</b> <b>Cam</b> Ranh for a {{briefing}} with General Phu. The events {{which took place}} after this briefing would go down {{as one of the}} greatest failures in military history. After Phu had outlined the military situation in the Central Highlands, he asked Thieu to bolster the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division with more aircraft and additional brigades to defend Kontum and Pleiku. Thieu refused to send further reinforcements because the South Vietnamese military no longer had the resources. Phu was ordered to move all his units down to the Mekong region where they could continue fighting. General Vien cautioned against moving large military formations down Highway 19; he reminded Thieu of the destruction suffered by the French Mobile Group 100 in the region in 1954. Thieu and his commanders made the decision to use Route 7 instead, in an attempt to surprise the North Vietnamese, who would not expect them to use that road due to its poor condition.|$|E

50|$|A cam and {{follower}} {{is formed}} by the direct contact of two specially shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the {{cam and follower}} determines {{the movement of the}} mechanism. In general a cam follower mechanism's energy is transferred from <b>cam</b> <b>to</b> follower. The <b>cam</b> shaft is rotated and, according <b>to</b> the <b>cam</b> profile, the follower moves up and down. Now slightly different types of eccentric cam followers are also available in which energy is transferred from the follower <b>to</b> the <b>cam.</b> The main benefit of this type of cam follower mechanism is that the follower moves a little bit and helps <b>to</b> rotate the <b>cam</b> 6 times more circumference length with 70% force.|$|R

25|$|The {{effects of}} Ca2+ are also remarkable: it cooperates with DAG in {{activating}} PKC and can activate the CaM kinase pathway, in which calcium-modulated protein calmodulin (CaM) binds Ca2+, undergoes {{a change in}} conformation, and activates CaM kinase II, which has unique ability to increase its binding affinity <b>to</b> <b>CaM</b> by autophosphorylation, making CaM unavailable for the activation of other enzymes. The kinase then phosphorylates target enzymes, regulating their activities. The two signal pathways are connected together by Ca2+-CaM, {{which is also a}} regulatory subunit of adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase in the cAMP signal pathway.|$|E

25|$|O. ficus-indica is {{sensitive}} to lack of oxygen in the root zone, requiring well-drained soils. Opuntia ficus-indica is similar <b>to</b> <b>CAM</b> species which are not salt-tolerant in their root zone where growth may cease under high salt concentration. O. ficus-indica grows usually in regions where relative humidity is above 60% and saturation deficit occurs. O. ficus-indica is absent in regions where there is less than 40% humidity {{for more than a}} month. Mean daily temperature required to develop is at least 1.5-2°C. At -10 to -12°C, prickly pear growth is inhibited even if it is exposed to these temperatures only for a few minutes. The maximum temperature limit of prickly pear is above 50°C.|$|E
25|$|After a {{stopover}} {{of several}} weeks at the minor port of Nossi-Bé, Madagascar, {{that had been}} reluctantly allowed by neutral France {{in order not to}} jeopardize its relations with its Russian ally, the Russian Baltic fleet proceeded <b>to</b> <b>Cam</b> Ranh Bay in French Indochina passing on its way through the Singapore Strait between 7 and 10 April 1905. The fleet finally reached the Sea of Japan in May 1905. The logistics of such an undertaking in the age of coal power was astounding. The squadron required approximately 500,000tons of coal to complete the journey, yet by international law, it was not allowed to coal at neutral ports, forcing the Russian authorities to acquire a large fleet of colliers to supply the fleet at sea. The weight of the ships' stores needed for such a long journey was to be another major problem.|$|E

25|$|East Carolina (ECU) got {{the ball}} to start the game, and {{promptly}} went three-and-out, ultimately punting. Ohio achieved a few first downs, however quarterback Tyler Tettleton threw an interception to Michael Dobson, setting ECU up with good field position around midfield. On the ensuing possession, ECU drove down the field on 5 plays for 55 yards, with the drive culminating in a 5-yard pass from Shane Carden <b>to</b> <b>Cam</b> Worthy, taking a 7–0 lead. Ohio failed to respond, and punted on their next drive. When ECU regained possession of the ball, they embarked on a drive that was highlighted by a 39-yard rush by Vintavious Cooper, {{as well as a}} 15-yard pass to Justin Hardy on which he broke the career receiving yard record, but failed to score when Ohio stopped ECU on a fourth down conversion attempt in the red zone. Ohio could not capitalize, and ultimately punted. ECU subsequently embarked on an 11-play drive that covered 76-yards and took up 3:40, and culminated with a 2-yard run by Breon Allen for a touchdown. Ohio's offense finally came to life on their next drive, which culminated in the second quarter.|$|E

Before dawn on 12 January, Task Group 38.5 launched aircraft to search for Japanese ships in the Cam Ranh Bay area. The crews of these aircraft radioed back the location of Japanese ships, and conducted an intensive search for the two Ise-class battleships and any other capital ships. When none were located {{it was believed that}} the warships had been hidden from view by camouflage; the US Navy did not learn that they had not been in the area for several more months. By 6 am on 12 January Task Group 38.2 was within [...] of Cam Ranh Bay. It and the other two task groups began launching their first strikes of the day at 07:31 am, about half an hour before sunrise.

This {{deployment}} was made to both reinforce the remaining elements of the IJN in the area and place the ships near a source of fuel. During their voyage from Japan, each of the battleship-carriers was loaded with about [...] of munitions for the units defending Manila in the Philippines. Due to heavy Allied air attacks on Manila, the two warships unloaded their supplies in the Spratly Islands from 14November. They sailed for Lingga Roads near Singapore on the 20th of the month and arrived there two days later. The Allies learned from intelligence gained by decrypting Japanese radio signals that the battleship-carriers had sailed. Allied submarines were ordered to keep watch for the ships, but did not intercept Ise or Hyūga during their voyage to Singapore. The two battleship-carriers were deployed <b>to</b> <b>Cam</b> Ranh Bay in Indochina during December and returned to Singapore on 11January 1945.
