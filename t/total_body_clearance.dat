50|$|The <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>{{clearance}}</b> will {{be equal}} to the renal clearance + hepatic clearance + lung clearance. Although for many drugs the clearance is simply considered as the renal excretion ability, that is, {{the rate at which}} waste substances are cleared from the blood by the kidney. In these cases clearance is almost synonymous with renal clearance or renal plasma clearance. Each substance has a specific clearance that depends on its filtration characteristics. Clearance is a function of glomerular filtration, secretion from the peritubular capillaries to the nephron, and re-absorption from the nephron back to the peritubular capillaries. Clearance is variable in zero-order kinetics because a constant amount of the drug is eliminated per unit time, but it is constant in first-order kinetics, because the amount of drug eliminated per unit time changes with the concentration of drug in the blood. The concept of clearance was described by Thomas Addis, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School.|$|E

Eight methyl amide and methyl ester phosphoramidate monoesters composed of d- or l-phenylalanine or tryptophan and AZT were synthesized. The plasma stability and protein binding studies were carried out in vitro. Then in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluations of six of the compounds were conducted. Sprague-Dawley rats received each compound by intravenous bolus dose, and serial blood and urine samples were collected. AZT and phosphoramidate concentrations in plasma and urine were quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV or fluorescence detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by standard noncompartmental means. The plasma half-lives of the phosphoramidates were 10 - to 20 -fold longer than the half-life of AZT. Although the renal clearances of the phosphoramidates were similar to AZT, their <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>clearances</b> were significantly greater than that of AZT. The 3 - to 15 -fold-larger volume of distribution (Vss) for the phosphoramidates relative to AZT appeared to be dependent on the stereochemistry of the amino acid, with the largest values being associated with the l-amino acids. The increased Vss indicates a much greater tissue distribution of the phosphoramidate prodrugs than of AZT.

Blood samples were collected at specified times after dosing and assayed for isepamicin by a validated radioimmunoassay method. The individual plasma concentration-time curves were analyzed by noncompartmental methods. In general, the pharmacokinetics after intravenous infusion and intramuscular injection were similar. As expected, the maximum concentration of isepamicin in serum following intramuscular injection (37. 2 microg/ml) was lower than the observed concentration at the end of infusion (66. 7 microg/ml). The areas under the concentration-time curves from 0 h to infinity following intramuscular and intravenous administration were 164. 8 and 154. 5 microg x hr/ml, respectively, indicating complete absorption following intramuscular administration. The respective mean terminal-phase half-life (t 1 / 2) values were 2. 6 and 3. 6 h.

Ajmaline exhibited a significantly increased negative dromotropic action (increased PQ interval) in rats after coronary occlusion compared with that in sham-operated rats. The difference seems {{to be due to}} the pharmacokinetic change since the concentration-effect relationship was similar in the two groups of rats. We suggest that the measurement of drug levels is important in the assessment of antiarrhythmic agents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There {{are various}} methods for {{predicting}} human pharmacokinetics. Among these, a whole body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (WBPBPK) model is useful {{because it gives}} a mechanistic description. However, WBPBPK models cannot predict human pharmacokinetics with enough precision. This {{study was conducted to}} elucidate the primary reason for poor predictions by WBPBPK models, and to enable better predictions to be made without reliance on complex concepts. Methods The primary reasons for poor predictions of human pharmacokinetics were investigated using a generic WBPBPK model that incorporated a single adjusting compartment (SAC), a virtual organ compartment with physiological parameters that can be adjusted arbitrarily. The blood flow rate, organ volume, and the steady state tissue-plasma partition coefficient of a SAC were calculated to fit simulated to observed pharmacokinetics in the rat. The adjusted SAC parameters were fixed and scaled up to the human using a newly developed equation. Using the scaled-up SAC parameters, human pharmacokinetics were simulated and each pharmacokinetic parameter was calculated. These simulated parameters were compared to the observed data. Simulations were performed to confirm the relationship between the precision of prediction and the number of tissue compartments, including a SAC. Results Increasing the number of tissue compartments led to an improvement of the average-fold error (AFE) of <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>clearances</b> (CL tot) and half-lives (T 1 / 2) calculated from the simulated human blood concentrations of 14 drugs. The presence of a SAC also improved the AFE values of a ten-organ model from 6. 74 to 1. 56 in CL tot, and from 4. 74 to 1. 48 in T 1 / 2. Moreover, the within- 2 -fold errors were improved in all models; incorporating a SAC gave results from 0 to 79 % in CL tot, and from 14 to 93 % in T 1 / 2 of the ten-organ model. Conclusion By using a SAC in this study, we were able to show that poor prediction resulted mainly from such physiological factors as organ blood flow rate and organ volume, which were not satisfactorily accounted for in previous WBPBPK models. The SAC also improved precision in the prediction of human pharmacokinetics. This finding showed that the methodology of our study may be useful for functionally reinforcing a WBPBPK model. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Manganese (Mn) {{produces}} neurobehavioral toxicity {{in various}} animal species including the young chicks. The present study examines toxicokinetics of Mn in 7 - 10 -day old chicks after an intramuscular injection at 20 mg/kg. Materials and Methods: Samples of the blood, whole brain, {{liver and kidney}} were obtained from chicks (5 /each time period) at 0 time (base-line) and then at times between 0. 17 to 4 h. The concentrations of Mn in the plasma and tissues were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Toxicokinetic parameters of Mn were calculated from the mean metal concentrations in the plasma by a non-compartmental analysis using a Windows-based computer program. Results: Injection of Mn significantly increased the metal levels in the plasma, whole brain, liver and kidney of the chicks when compared to respective base-line control values at times 0. 17 to 4 h after the injection (with the exception at 2 and 4 h in the brain). The highest concentration of Mn in the plasma and the whole brain appeared one h after the injection, whereas those of the liver and kidney appeared 4 h post-injection. The concentrations of Mn in the plasma ranged between 0. 43 to 1. 2 &# 956;g/ml within 0. 17 to 4 h. Those of the whole brain, liver and kidney were 0. 11 &# 8211; 0. 46, 6. 3 &# 8211; 15 and 5. 3 &# 8211; 22. 9 &# 956;g/g, respectively. The elimination half-life of Mn was 3. 02 h with steady state volume of distribution 24. 34 L/kg and <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>clearances</b> of 4. 78 L/h/kg. The mean residence time of Mn was 5. 09 h and its area under the plasma concentration-time curve (0 -) was 4. 18 &# 956;g. h/ml. The elimination half-life of Mn from the brain was 3. 12 h with an elimination rate constant of 0. 22 h- 1. Conclusion: The data suggest that Mn is well absorbed and rapidly distributed after an intramuscular administration in chicks and further support the reported neurobehavioral toxic effects of the metal which are observed within one h after treatment.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of teicoplanin after single 6 -mg/kg intravenous and intraperitoneal doses {{were studied}} in five noninfected patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Biological samples were assayed for teicoplanin content by a microbiological assay technique. Terminal disposition half-life (266. 4 +/- 51. 9 h [mean +/- standard error of the mean]) was prolonged and <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>clearance</b> (0. 040 +/- 0. 004 ml/min per kg) was reduced compared with values previously reported {{in subjects with}} normal renal function. The volume of distribution at steady state (1. 15 +/- 0. 19 liters/kg) was higher than values previously reported in subjects with normal renal function (0. 56 to 0. 72 liter/kg). Peritoneal dialysis clearance (0. 007 +/- 0. 001 ml/min per kg) accounted for only 16. 1 % of <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>clearance.</b> The absolute systemic bioavailability of teicoplanin after intraperitoneal administration was 81. 5 +/- 10. 7 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of zidovudine {{were evaluated}} in 41 patients with Centers for Disease Control HIV class IVA infection. The patients were assigned escalating doses of zidovudine (300, 600, or 1, 500 mg daily) and were randomized to receive either zidovudine alone or zidovudine {{with a high}} dose of acyclovir (4, 800 mg per day). Single and multiple intravenous- and oral-dose pharmacokinetic studies were performed on days 1 and 7 and weeks 6 and 12 of therapy. Zidovudine concentrations were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by noncompartmental methods. Zidovudine concentrations in serum declined in a biphasic manner, with half-lives ranging from 1 to 2 h, and were independent of acyclovir administration or length of zidovudine therapy. The median time of peak concentrations in serum following oral doses was 0. 75 h (range, 0. 25 to 3 h). Accumulation of zidovudine in serum was not observed, but the maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve increased proportionally with increased zidovudine doses. Mean day 7 oral Cmax values were 0. 20 +/- 0. 12, 0. 55 +/- 0. 33, and 1. 0 +/- 0. 5 micrograms/ml for 17 patients receiving total daily doses of, respectively, 300, 600, and 1, 500 mg of zidovudine alone, whereas Cmax values were, respectively, 0. 27 +/- 0. 18, 0. 43 +/- 0. 33, and 1. 2 +/- 0. 80 micrograms/ml for 15 comparably treated recipients of zidovudine plus acyclovir (P was not significant). The median bioavailability of oral zidovudine was 67 % (42 to 120 %) and did not vary with dosage. Absolute and apparent <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>clearances</b> were similar among the patients given the various zidovudine doses regardless of whether there was concomitant acyclovir therapy. Drug-related toxicities were observed more frequently in the subjects who received high doses of zidovudine {{than they were in}} those who received median and low doses of zidovudine (P= 0. 03). Overall, acyclovir did not influence the disposition of zidovudine over a wide range of zidovudine doses. No unusual toxicities could be attributed to the zidovudine and high-dose acyclovir combination during the 12 -week observation period...|$|R
40|$|As {{the primary}} route for {{elimination}} of clinafloxacin is renal clearance (CLR) of unchanged drug, studies {{were conducted to}} determine the pharmacokinetic profile of clinafloxacin following administration to young and elderly subjects, subjects with various degrees of renal function, and subjects requiring dialysis. These were open-label studies in which subjects received single oral clinafloxacin doses. Sixteen young subjects (18 to 35 years old) and 16 elderly subjects (> 65 years old) were enrolled in a study comparing pharmacokinetic profiles of clinafloxacin in young and elderly subjects. Twenty subjects having various degrees of renal function were enrolled into one of three groups based on degree of renal function as measured by creatinine clearance (CLCR). Twelve subjects with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis enrolled in a third study. Clinafloxacin was generally well tolerated by all subjects. Clinafloxacin pharmacokinetic profiles in elderly subjects were dependent only on age-related decreases in renal function. Clinafloxacin maximum concentrations in plasma, areas under the concentration-time curves, and terminal elimination half-life values increased with decreasing CLCR values. <b>Total</b> apparent <b>body</b> <b>clearance</b> of clinafloxacin from the plasma after oral administration (CLoral) and CLR were dependent on CLCR according to the following relationships: CLoral = 2. 3 · CLCR + 77 and CLR = 1. 74 · CLCR. Hemodialysis had no significant effect on clinafloxacin clearance. Based {{on the relationship between}} CLCR and clinafloxacin CLoral and CLR values, the clinafloxacin dose should be halved in patients having a CLCR of < 40 ml/min.

40|$|Six stable {{patients}} on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis were evaluated for {{the appearance of}} ciprofloxacin in their peritoneal dialysate following oral ingestion of 750 mg of the drug every 12 h for four doses. Three subjects {{participated in this study}} twice, once while taking and once while abstaining from phosphate-binding aluminum antacids. Subjects tolerated the medication without evidence of toxicity. Food may have delayed or decreased the absorption of ciprofloxacin, whereas antacids definitely decreased the absorption of the drug. Peak concentrations in serum noted in the absence of antacids ranged from 2. 9 to 6. 4 micrograms/ml, and peak concentrations in dialysate in the absence of antacids ranged from 1. 8 to 4. 5 micrograms/ml. Peak ciprofloxacin concentrations in serum achieved in subjects taking antacids were 14 to 50 % of those achieved in subjects without antacids. The peak concentrations in dialysate achieved in subjects on antacids were 8 to 33 % of those observed in subjects off antacids. The clearance of ciprofloxacin by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis represented 2 % of the <b>total</b> <b>body</b> (systemic) <b>clearance.</b> Simultaneous ratios of concentration in dialysate to concentration in serum (D/S) were determined at various durations of dialysate dwelling within the peritoneum. A progressive rise of the D/S ratio was noted as dwell time increased. At 4 h D/S was 0. 57 +/- 0. 07 (mean +/- standard error of the mean; n = 9), and at 8 h it was 0. 75 +/- 0. 04 (n = 26). Long-dwell exchanges may be necessary to achieve reasonable concentrations of orally ingested ciprofloxacin in dialysate...|$|R
