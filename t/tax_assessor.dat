5|$|The {{state is}} divided into 77 {{counties}} that govern locally, each headed by a three-member council of elected commissioners, a <b>tax</b> <b>assessor,</b> clerk, court clerk, treasurer, and sheriff. While each municipality operates as a separate and independent local government with executive, legislative and judicial power, county governments maintain jurisdiction over both incorporated cities and non-incorporated areas within their boundaries, but have executive power but no legislative or judicial power. Both county and municipal governments collect taxes, employ a separate police force, hold elections, and operate emergency response services within their jurisdiction. Other local government units include school districts, technology center districts, community college districts, rural fire departments, rural water districts, and other special use districts.|$|E

A group of residents has complained to the New Jersey Division of Taxation, claiming that home values had been calculated incorrectly and arbitrarily, showing data that a sample of smaller homes saw taxes drop 8% while taxes on larger homes increased by 10%.

500|$|In 2003, Amondson was {{approached}} by Thompson Township, Pennsylvania <b>tax</b> <b>assessor</b> James Hedges, the Prohibition Party's only elected official. He convinced Amondson to seek the nomination of his faction of the Prohibition Party, which split over perennial presidential nominee Earl Dodge's leadership of the party. Hedges' faction felt Dodge was more concerned with his campaign button business than advancing the party's goals. Dodge had run as the party's nominee in every election since 1984, but received only 208 votes in the 2000 election, down approximately 1,000 from the 1996 election. Amondson commenced his first presidential campaign with the nomination of Hedges' faction. Dodge received the other faction's nomination. According to Dodge, Amondson had previously contacted him about the vice presidential nomination, but {{it had already been}} filled. Dodge reasoned Amondson was [...] "probably a very nice man... he may not have known exactly what he was getting into." [...] Conversely, Amondson referred to Dodge as a [...] "good man" [...] with whom he shared the same message, but argued, [...] "Dodge is just not getting the job done. He's too old.

2500|$|The United States Supreme Court held, in Nordlinger v. Hahn, that Proposition 13 was constitutional. Justice Harry Blackmun, {{writing the}} {{majority}} opinion, noted that California had a [...] "legitimate interest in local neighborhood preservation, continuity, and stability" [...] {{and that it}} was acceptable to treat owners who have invested for some time in property differently from new owners. If one objected to the rules, they could choose not to buy. Stephanie Nordlinger, the plaintiff in this case, sued the Los Angeles County <b>Tax</b> <b>Assessor</b> Kenneth Hahn {{on the grounds of the}} Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Nordlinger purchased a property in the Los Angeles area and, under the provisions of Proposition 13, was required to have the property reassessed at a new value. The reassessed value of Nordlinger’s property raised her tax rates by 36%, while her neighbors continued to pay significantly lower rates on their property. Disheartened by the disparity in taxation, Nordlinger viewed this reassessment as favoritism in the eyes of the law and elected to bring charges up on the Los Angeles County Tax Assessment office and its primary assessor, Kenneth Hahn. Pleading that the reassessment of her property did not grant equal protection, stated as a right in the 4th Amendment, Nordlinger took Hahn to court and appealed in the Supreme Court in 1981. The court ruled in favor of Hahn, affirming Proposition 13 as constitutional.|$|E
