5|$|Castor and Pollux– An elderly {{conjoined}} twin, they usurped the Oracle of Delphi {{and decided}} who could see her. When Kratos attempted {{to see the}} Oracle without any offerings, <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> made themselves younger by using the Amulet of Uroborus and then fought Kratos. They attempted to kill the Oracle so that Kratos could not see her. After crushing the Oracle under rocks, Kratos then killed <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> and took the amulet. Castor and Pollux were voiced by David W. Collins and Brad Grusnick, respectively, in Ascension.|$|E
5|$|Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Mountains Formation of {{northern}} Texas, the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel Formation in Maryland and in Florida. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based on changes in ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Mountains Formation. This indicates that <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112million years ago. The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers. Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.|$|E
