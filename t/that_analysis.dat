40|$|Abstract—Evolutionary {{algorithms}} (EAs) are {{general purpose}} optimization tools {{that can be}} applied in vari-ous situations, therefore, general analysis approaches are appealing for facilitating the analysis of EAs in different problems. Expected running time is a key theoretical issue of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Several general analysis approaches for the running time analysis of EAs have been proposed and have stimulated the theoretical development. Recently, switch analysis was proposed, which derives the running time of an EA process by comparing it with a simpler EA process. It has been proven <b>that</b> drift <b>analysis</b> and fitness level method are reducible to switch <b>analysis,</b> which means <b>that</b> switch <b>analysis</b> can derive at least as tight results as the two approaches. In this paper, we further prove <b>that</b> another <b>analysis</b> approach, convergence-based analysis, is reducible to switch analysis. We also show in a case study <b>that</b> switch <b>analysis</b> leads to a tighter result than convergence-based analysis. I...|$|R

25|$|The {{emphasis}} on speed and agility is a {{defining characteristic of}} taekwondo and has its origins in analyses undertaken by Choi Hong Hi. The results of <b>that</b> <b>analysis</b> are known by ITF practitioners as Choi's Theory of Power. Choi based his understanding of power on biomechanics and Newtonian physics as well as Chinese martial arts. For example, Choi observed {{that the power of}} a strike increases quadratically with the speed of the strike, but increases only linearly with the mass of the striking object. In other words, speed is more important than size in terms of generating power. This principle was incorporated into the early design of taekwondo and is still used.|$|E

25|$|Eclecticism is {{not open}} to the {{superficial}} objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which {{is not in the}} individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not at once to impose <b>that</b> <b>analysis</b> or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.|$|E

500|$|This {{lengthening}} {{has received}} {{a number of different}} explanations within the context of theoretical phonology.

[...] argue that the fortis sonorant is tense (a term only vaguely defined phonetically) and that this tenseness is transferred to the vowel, where it is realized phonetically as vowel length and/or diphthongization. [...] argues that the triggering consonant is underlyingly associated with a unit of syllable weight called a mora; this mora then shifts to the vowel, creating a long vowel or a diphthong. [...] expands on <b>that</b> <b>analysis</b> to argue that the fortis sonorants have an advanced tongue root (that is, the bottom of the tongue is pushed upward during articulation of the consonant) and that diphthongization is an articulatory effect of this tongue movement.|$|E
