500|$|To {{create the}} lyrics, Eno would later play these backing tracks singing {{nonsense}} syllables to himself, then take them and form them into actual words, phrases and meaning. This lyric-writing method {{was used for}} all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s. The lyrics on Here Come the Warm Jets are macabre with an underlying sense of humour. They are mostly free-associative and have no particular meaning. Exceptions include [...] "The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch", about the historical A.W. Underwood of Paw Paw, Michigan with the purported ability to set items ablaze with his breath; according to Eno, the song [...] "celebrates {{the possibility of a}} love affair with the man." [...] Eno has attempted to dissuade fans from reading too much into his words; he claims that the song [...] "Needles in the Camel's Eye" [...] was [...] "written in less time <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to sing... I regard [...] as an instrumental with singing on it".|$|E

2500|$|The basic {{cause of}} {{starvation}} is an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. In other words, the body expends more energy <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> in.

2500|$|Peter Singer {{has pointed}} out that the ethical {{argument}} for vegetarianism may not apply to all non-vegetarian food. For example, any arguments against causing pain to animals would not apply to animals that do not feel pain. It has also often been noted that, while it takes a lot more grain to feed some animals such as cows for human consumption <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to feed a human directly, not all animals consume land plants (or other animals that consume land plants). For example, oysters consume underwater plankton and algae. In 2010, Christopher Cox wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|It takes {{considerable}} {{energy to}} force nuclei to fuse, {{even those of}} the lightest element, hydrogen. When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and brought close enough such that the attractive nuclear force {{is greater than the}} repulsive Coulomb force. The strong force grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially [...] "fall" [...] into each other and result is fusion and net energy produced. The fusion of lighter nuclei, which creates a heavier nucleus and often a free neutron or proton, generally releases more energy <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to force the nuclei together; this is an exothermic process that can produce self-sustaining reactions.|$|E

40|$|The {{path that}} the hand takes to {{intercept}} an elongated moving target {{depends on the}} target’s orientation. How quickly do people respond {{to changes in the}} moving target’s orientation? In the present study, participants were asked to intercept moving targets that sometimes abruptly changed orientation shortly after they started moving. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> the participants slightly more than 150  ms to adjust their hands’ paths to a change in target orientation. This is about 50  ms longer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> them to respond to a 5 -mm jump in the moving target’s position. It is only slightly shorter <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> them to initiate the movement. We propose that responses to changes in visually perceived orientation are not exceptionally fast, because there is no relationship between target orientation and direction of hand movement that is sufficiently general in everyday life for one to risk making an inappropriate response in order to respond faster...|$|R

2500|$|Hurt cosponsored the Balanced Budget Amendment, {{which did}} not pass the House of Representatives in November 2011. Hurt said of the bill, “By passing a Balanced Budget Amendment, Congress will be {{required}} to spend no more <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> in, reining in out of control spending once and for all” Hurt also sponsored the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act that would exempt private equity funds advisers from certain registration and reporting standards. In July, 2011 Hurt sponsored the Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act which would “protect the taxpayers of the United States by requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to sell or dispose of the assets of such enterprises that are not critical to their missions.” [...] However, because very little political leverage was used to pass this legislation, it most likely will die in committee. Hurt’s position on Government regulation is clear in his statement that “By reducing the unnecessary government regulations that hinder small businesses, keeping taxes low and allowing people to keep more of what they make, and cutting spending to get our fiscal house in order, the private sector will gain the confidence necessary to expand and create the jobs that the people of the 5th District need and deserve.” ...|$|E
