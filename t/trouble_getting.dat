5|$|The Haunted Mask {{was written}} by R. L. Stine and {{originally}} illustrated by Tim Jacobus. The author says {{the idea for the}} book came from his son Matthew Stine, who was wearing a Halloween mask that he had <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> off. Stine also says that he incorporated a duck costume his parents got him for trick-or-treating in the book. Tim Jacobus's niece was the model for the cover of the book.|$|E
5|$|The Haunted Mask is the {{eleventh}} book in Goosebumps, {{the series of}} children's horror fiction novels created and authored by R. L. Stine. The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a Halloween mask from a store. After putting on the mask, she starts acting differently and discovers that the mask has become her face; she is unable to pull the mask off. R. L. Stine says he {{got the idea for}} the book from his son who was wearing a mask he had <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> off.|$|E
5|$|They {{returned}} to Botany Bay {{on the evening}} of 23 January, when Phillip gave orders to move the fleet to Sydney Cove the next morning, 24 January. That day, there was a huge gale blowing, making it impossible to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; they were having as much <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> into the bay as the First Fleet was having getting out.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the three-cent nickel piece {{remained}} stable throughout its run, and there are few varieties. An overdate is known, 1887/6. The die that struck those coins was originally dated 1886, when no circulation strikes were made. So the die would not be wasted, the Mint altered the last digit from a 6 to a 7; evidence of both numbers is visible. Some 1865 pieces in proof condition display a wreath on the reverse that comes much closer to touching the rim than on later issues. These were most likely pattern coins but they are accepted as issued because the Mint placed them in some 1865 proof sets. Many of the three-cent nickel pieces were not fully struck, and are missing details of the design; {{this is because the}} head of Liberty is directly opposite the III, and the Mint had <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> the hard metal alloy to adequately flow to the high points of both sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} more {{important}} friendship was with Fanny (Frances) Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind. Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck {{out on her own}} in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady's companion to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in Bath. However, Wollstonecraft had <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> along with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in Thoughts on the Education of Daughters, 1787). In 1780 she returned home, called back to care for her dying mother. Rather than return to Dawson's employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood's brother, for example).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E

25|$|By 1975 Morgan became {{noted for}} its {{lacrosse}} team. Lacrosse, a sport that, up until then, had been dominated by white athletes.

25|$|The {{majority}} of the local stores were never rebuilt because, even though store owners had great desire to rebuild, they had <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> loans; myths about the area arose discouraging investment {{in the area and}} preventing growth of employment.

25|$|However, Moscow under Luzhkov invited several {{restrictions}} to this rule, partially {{keeping the}} old system.

25|$|A month shy of his 55th birthday, Unser {{entered the}} 1994 race with Arizona Motorsports, hoping {{to qualify for}} what would be his 28th Indy 500.

After some minimal practice the following day, he quit the team. He announced his retirement on May 17, 1994.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} lot {{of musical}} talent shown by the younger {{community}} of Jersey. The dominant genres are indie, punk and metal. The main event that these bands take part in is a Battle of the Bands each summer, the most recent winners being No Star Hotel.

25|$|Some {{patients}} {{may need to}} do an overnight sleep study to determine if insomnia is present. Such a study will commonly involve assessment tools including a polysomnogram and the multiple sleep latency test. Specialists in sleep medicine are qualified to diagnose disorders within the, according to the ICSD, 81 major sleep disorder diagnostic categories. Patients with some disorders, including delayed sleep phase disorder, are often mis-diagnosed with primary insomnia; when a person has <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> to sleep and awakening at desired times, but has a normal sleep pattern once asleep, a circadian rhythm disorder is a likely cause.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Johnson {{saved the}} lives of Colonel Thomas Henderson, the young editor of the Raleigh Star, and his friend Mr. Callum, when the {{enthusiastic}} group of fishermen capsized their fishing skiff on Walnut Creek near Hunter's Mill in December 1811.

25|$|The Bills intercepted Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino twice, {{recovered}} three fumbles, forced four sacks, {{and held}} Miami to just 33 rushing yards.

Thurman Thomas, who had been knocked out of the game in both of the Bills prior two playoff contests, rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 70, while Kenneth Davis added 61 rushing yards and four receptions for 52.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} {{regional}} farmers in Brampton had <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> insurance from city-based companies. After several meetings in Clairville Hall, {{they decided to}} found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company. In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West. The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business {{in what is now}} Brampton.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Mutombo {{with the}} Mutombo Foundation began {{plans to open}} a $29 million, 300-bed {{hospital}} on the outskirts of his hometown, the Congolese capital of Kinshasa. Ground was broken in 2001, but construction didn't start until 2004, as Mutombo had <b>trouble</b> <b>getting</b> donations early on although he personally donated $3.5 million toward the hospital's construction. Initially Mutombo had some other difficulties, almost losing the land to the government because it was not being used and having to pay refugees who had begun farming the land to leave. He also struggled to reassure some {{that he did not have}} any ulterior or political motives for the project. The project has been on the whole very well received at all social and economic levels in Kinshasa.|$|E
