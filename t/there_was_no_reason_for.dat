5|$|In {{the final}} days before the 2015 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team began its season for new head coach Jim Harbaugh against Utah, Morris was in a quarterback battle with incoming graduate student transfer Jake Rudock, who had started the prior two seasons for Iowa. On Monday before the Thursday September 3 game, Harbaugh would not name his starter. Rudock started the game. After the second game, against Oregon State, there was controversy when Wilton Speight took the mopup snaps during the 357 victory instead of Morris. Harbaugh explained that since Speight had already used his redshirt season and Morris had not, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Morris to lose a season unless it was for meaningful snaps, but that Morris is the #2 quarterback. When Rudock was sidelined {{in the third quarter}} with the team trailing in the October 31, 2015, Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota, Speight engineered the game-winning drive via his first touchdown pass with less than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Harbaugh explained that Speight had earned the backup role in practice in the preceding weeks.|$|E

25|$|Two {{years before}} the {{beginning}} of World War I, on 4 May 1912, the British magazine Country Life carried a seemingly unremarkable advertisement: the roofing balustrade and urns from the roof of Trentham Hall could be purchased for £200. One of Britain's great ducal country houses, Trentham Hall was demolished with little public comment or interest. It was its owner's property, to do with as he wished. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> public interest or concern; the same magazine had frequently published in-depth articles on new country houses being built, designed by fashionable architects such as Lutyens. As far as general opinion was concerned, England's great houses came and they went; so long as their numbers remained, continuing to provide local employment, the public were not largely concerned. The Country Life advertisement, however, was to prove a hint of things to come.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, Boston {{businessman}} and historian Charles Deane {{was the first}} scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest-surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating Queen Anne to treat Pocahontas with dignity. The time gap in publishing his story {{raises the possibility that}} Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, in a recent book, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> him to write down the story until this point.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} year of {{operational}} service, Hartmann felt a distinct lack of respect towards Soviet pilots. Most Soviet fighters did not even have proper gunsights, and their pilots were forced to draw one on the windscreen by hand: [...] "In the early days, incredible as it may seem, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> you to feel fear if the Russian fighter was behind you. With their hand-painted gunsights they couldn't pull the lead properly (deflection shooting) or hit you." [...] Hartmann also considered the Bell P-39 Airacobra, the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, and the Hawker Hurricane to be inferior to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and Bf109, although they did provide the Soviets with valuable gunsight technology.|$|E

However, [...] he did not consider himself a favourite to win the championship. Button became concerned that his team would lose its recent momentum but said he would get the maximum amount needed from his car to help him remain in contention. Despite being afflicted with reliability issues with his Red Bull car, Vettel said <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> him or his team to panic and was looking forward to the European Grand Prix in Valencia.

500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well reviewed in biological journals. It received {{a much more}} mixed reaction among sociologists, mainly triggered by the brief coverage {{of the implications of}} sociobiology for human society in the first and last chapters of the book; the body of the text was largely welcomed. A review reached {{the front page of the}} New York Times, such was the level of interest in the debate. The sociologist Gerhard Lenski, admitting that sociologists needed to look further into non-human societies, agreed that human society was founded on biology but denied both biological reductionism and determinism. Lenski observed that since the nature-nurture dichotomy was false, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> sociologists and biologists to disagree. Other sociologists objected in particular to the final chapter, on [...] "Man": Devra G. Kleiman called Wilson's attempt to extend his thesis to humans weak and premature, and noted that he had largely overlooked the importance of co-operative behaviour and females in mammalian societies.|$|E
500|$|Duke Victor Amadeus II of Savoy {{procured}} {{the style}} Royal Highness from Spain and the Holy Roman Empire in June 1689, infuriating Grand Duke Cosimo, who complained to Vienna that a duke was inferior status {{to a grand}} duke, and proclaimed it [...] "unjustly exalted...since the House of Savoy had not increased {{to the point of}} vying with kings, nor had the House of Medici diminished in splendour and possessions, so <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> promoting one and degrading the other." [...] Cosimo also played upon all the times Tuscany provided financial and military assistance to the Empire. The Emperor, anxious to avoid friction, suggested that Anna Maria Luisa should marry the Elector Palatine to compensate for the affront. The Elector Palatine, two years later, several months before his marriage to Anna Maria Luisa, went about acquiring the aforesaid style for Cosimo and his family, {{despite the fact that they}} had no claim to any kingdom. Henceforth, Cosimo was His Royal Highness The Most Serene Grand Duke of Tuscany.|$|E
500|$|As it {{had done}} in 2005, ERT asked 2004 entrant Sakis Rouvas to {{represent}} Greece in the 2006 contest, but he once again denied. In an interview with Down Town magazine Rouvas recalled getting the proposal from the network in [...] "either August or September" [...] and considering it briefly; however, he ultimately found <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> him to go, especially when Greece was the reigning champion, making chances of winning little to none. Nevertheless, ERT still wanted Rouvas involved in some way and they asked him to host the competition, which he accepted. With the news leaked by the newspaper Ethnos, a public announcement was made on 1 November 2005. Rouvas said of his decision, [...] "but when I received the proposal for the hosting of Eurovision I found it intriguing", {{and that it would}} challenge him. American television personality and actress Maria Menounos was eventually announced as his female co-host.

500|$|The {{ice skating}} scenes were shot {{in an actual}} rink. According to Jenna Fischer, Steve Carell used to play hockey, and the writers {{had been looking for}} a reason to use Carell's ice skating skills in an episode. Fischer had also learned to skate in {{preparation}} for the movie Blades of Glory, but the writers decided that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Pam to be a good skater, so they had Pam lean on Jim. Saturday Night Live alumna Nancy Walls, who played Carol Stills, is actually Steve Carell's wife. At the rink, Michael tells Pam to be wary of breast cancer. This is the third joke that Stupnitsky and Eisenberg had aimed at Pam's breasts, after one each in [...] "The Fight" [...] and [...] "The Secret". Fischer later jokingly said that [...] "my breasts {{play a central role in}} one of tonight's scenes." [...] Fischer also noted that, due to the slight emphasis her breasts were receiving, many fans on the internet were arguing that Fischer had had breast implants. Fischer denied the rumors, but stated that she was [...] "flattered".|$|E
500|$|... "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] has {{received}} generally favorable reviews from contemporary critics. [...] Regarding the song's musical genre, Roger Holland of PopMatters believed <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Swift to limit herself into only {{the country music}} or why she should be a country artist at all. Holland continued, [...] "Yet this is the channel to market she has chosen, and so {{she has to be}} prepared to hear complaints about the way that trademarked Mutt Lange guitar whine has been married to her bright shiny pop songs in order to get them onto CMT, GAC, and country radio." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com rated [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] four out of five stars. Lamb complimented Swift's vocal delivery and songwriting style, but criticized the production and arrangement, perceiving them to be dull. He added that the track's refrains were most impacting and deemed it among the most memorable songs of 2007. Sean Dooley, also of About.com, described Swift's vocals as [...] "nothing less than captivating." ...|$|E
500|$|Gerhard Lenski, in Social Forces, {{admitted}} that sociologists had too often ignored non-human societies, and thought the book {{should be required}} reading. Human societies were plainly founded on biology, but this did not imply either biological reductionism or determinism. Comparison with other species would be productive, as nonhuman societies often had traditions handed down {{from one generation to}} the next, such as [...] "the flyways of migratory birds or dietary patterns among primates". Issues of conflict and cooperation were similarly illuminated. But in his view the book raised [...] "uncomfortable issues". The first chapter could sound, he argued, like [...] "intellectual imperialism" [...] as Wilson called sociology [...] "an essentially nontheoretical, descriptive science, not unlike taxonomy and ecology forty years ago, before they were 'reshaped entirely ... neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory'". Lenski however took Wilson more openly than that, noting Wilson's precursors, Julian Huxley, George Gaylord Simpson, Dobzhansky and others of the modern synthesis. They had tried repeatedly to talk to sociologists, and in Lenski's view that remained necessary. Further, he suggested, the nature-nurture dichotomy was evidently false, so <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> sociologists and biologists to disagree. In his view, continued rejection of biology by sociologists only invited [...] "a reductionist response on the part of biologists." [...] Lenski found the final chapter on Man [...] "disappointing", as Wilson had been unable to penetrate the [...] "barriers" [...] put up by social science against the modern synthesis, and Wilson's overestimation of the influence of genetics compared to culture and technology on human society. All the same, Lenski thought these [...] "flaws" [...] could be mended by dialogue between sociology and biology.|$|E
