40|$|<b>The</b> anodic <b>dissolution</b> and {{cathodic}} {{deposition of}} Cu and effect of allyl thiourea on the processes in acidic media were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry and EQCM.

No Cu (+) ions, adsorbed Cu (I) species or intermediate Cu (+) was evidenced by in situ EQCM measurements, allyl thiourea may change the mechanism of <b>the</b> anodic <b>dissolution</b> and cathodic deposition of Cu. The M/n values of <b>the</b> anodic <b>dissolution</b> and cathodic deposition of Cu in the presence of allyl thiourea are 61. 9 and 65. 4 g/mol, respectively, indicating the one-electron processes and producing Cu(I) species. The mechanism of <b>the</b> anodic <b>dissolution</b> and cathodic deposition of Cu can be considered as: AT(solution) = AT(suface); Cu = Cu (+) (solution) + e; Cu (+) + AT = (CuAT) (+) (solution). The EQCM studies provided quantitative results of surface mass changes during cathodic deposition and anodic dissolution of Cu, and threw a new light in the elucidating electrodeposition and anodic dissolution of Cu...|$|R
