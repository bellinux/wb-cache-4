2500|$|The {{combination}} of a moisture fetch set up by Subtropical Depression 22 and Tropical Storm Tammy, {{as well as an}} additional tropical disturbance which rode up a stationary frontal zone, set up excessive rains from coastal sections of the Mid-Atlantic states through southern New England. [...] In New Hampshire, the Monadnock region was affected, with Alstead among the hardest hit as 300mm (12in) of rain fell within 30 hours, allowing <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> be the wettest {{in the history of the}} Granite State.

2500|$|The {{regulation}} {{contains two}} key components: the [...] "locate" [...] and the [...] "close-out." [...] The locate component attempts to reduce failure to deliver securities by requiring a broker possess or have arranged to possess borrowed shares. The close out component requires that a broker {{be able to}} deliver the shares that are to be shorted. In the US, initial public offers (IPOs) cannot be sold short for a month after they start trading. This mechanism is in place to ensure a degree of price stability during a company's initial trading period. However, some brokerage firms that specialize in penny stocks (referred to colloquially as bucket shops) have used the lack of short selling during <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> pump and dump thinly traded IPOs. Canada and other countries do allow selling IPOs (including U.S. IPOs) short.|$|E
2500|$|The {{month of}} June {{was chosen for}} LGBT Pride Month to commemorate the Stonewall riots, which {{occurred}} {{at the end of}} June 1969. As a result, many pride events are held during <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> recognize the impact LGBT people have had in the world. Brenda Howard is known as the [...] "Mother of Pride", for her work in coordinating the first LGBT Pride march, and she also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around Pride Day which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June. Additionally, Howard along with fellow LGBT rights activists Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk) and L. Craig Schoonmaker are credited with popularizing the word [...] "Pride" [...] to describe these festivities. As LGBT rights activist Tom Limoncelli put it, [...] "The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [...] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.'" ...|$|E

Singer was scheduled to be deposed November 19 in Los Angeles, with Cosby's deposition occurring on November 23 in Boston.

6000|$|... ...I {{feel now}} {{more at home}} in London than {{anywhere}} else in the world--so much so that I am afraid my sense of peculiarities, my appreciation of people and things, as London people and things, is losing its edge. I have taken a great fancy to the place; I won't say to the people and things; and yet these must have a part in it. It makes a very interesting residence at any rate; not the ideal and absolutely interesting--but the relative and comparative one. I have, however, formed no intimacies--not even any close acquaintances. I incline to believe that I have passed the age when one forms friendships; or that every one else has. I have seen and talked a little with a considerable number of people, but I have become familiar with almost none. To tell the truth, I find myself a good deal more of a cosmopolitan (thanks to that combination of the continent and the U.S.A. which has formed my lot) than the average Briton of culture; and to be--to have become by force of circumstances--a cosmopolitan is of necessity to be a good deal alone. I don't think that London, by itself, does a very great deal for people--for its residents; and those of them who are not out of the general social herd are potentially deadly provincial. I have become in all these years as little provincial as possible. I don't say it from fatuity and I may say it to you; and yet to be so is, I think, necessary for forming here many close relations. So my interest in London is chiefly that of an observer in a place where there is most in the world to observe. I see no essential reason however why I should not some day see much more of certain Britons, and think that I very possibly may. But I doubt if I should ever marry--or want to marry--an English wife! This is an extremely interesting time here; and indeed that is one reason why I have not been able to bring myself to go abroad, as I have been planning all <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> do. I can't give up the morning papers! I am not one of the outsiders who thinks that the [...] "greatness" [...] of England is now exploded; but there mingles with my interest in her prospects and doings in all this horrible Eastern Question a sensible mortification and sadness. She has not resolutely played a part--even a wrong one. She has been weak and helpless and (above all) unskilful; she has drifted and stumbled and not walked like a great nation. One has a feeling that the affairs of Europe are really going to be settled without her. At any rate the cynical, brutal, barbarous pro-Turkish attitude of an immense mass of people here (I am no fanatic for Russia, but I think the Emperor of R. might have been treated like a gentleman!) has thrown into vivid relief the most discreditable side of the English character. I don't think it is the largest side, by any means; but when one comes into contact with it one is ready to give up the race! ...|$|E

(Here is a restless dog, crying {{cabbages}} and savoys, plagues me every morning about this time; he is now at it. I wish his largest cabbage were sticking in his throat.) I lodge over against the house in Little Rider Street, where DD lodged. Don't oo lememble, maram? To-night I must see the Abbe Gaultier,(15) to get some particulars for my History. It was he who was first employed by France in the overtures of peace, and I have not had time <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> see him; he is but a puppy too. Lady Orkney has just sent to invite me to dinner; she has not given me the bed-nightgown;(16) besides, I am come very much off from writing in bed, though I am doing it this minute; but I stay till my fire is burnt up. My grate is very large; two bushels of coals in a week: but I save it in lodgings. Lord Abercorn is come to London, and will plague me, and I can do him no service. The Duke of Shrewsbury goes {{in a day or}} two for France, perhaps to-day. We shall have a peace very soon; the Dutch are almost entirely agreed, and if they stop we shall make it without them; that has been long resolved. One Squire Jones,(17) a scoundrel in my parish, has writ to me to desire I would engage Joe Beaumont to give him his interest for Parliament-man for Trim: pray tell Joe this; and if he designed to vote for him already, then he may tell Jones that I received his letter, and that I writ to Joe to do it. If Joe be engaged for any other, then he may do what he will: and Parvisol may say he spoke to Joe, but Joe's engaged, etc. I received three pair of fine thread stockings from Joe lately. Pray thank him when you see him, and that I say they are very fine and good. (I never looked at them yet, but that's no matter.) This is a fine day. I am ruined with coaches and chairs this twelvepenny weather. I must see my brother Ormond at eleven, and then the Duchess of Hamilton, with whom I doubt I am in disgrace, not having seen her these ten days. I send this to-day, and must finish it now; and perhaps some people may come and hinder me; for it im ten o'clock (but not shaving-day), and I must be abroad at eleven. Abbe Gaultier sends me word I can't see him to-night; pots cake him! I don't value anything but one letter he has of Petecum's,(18) showing the roguery of the Dutch. Did not the Conduct of the Allies make you great politicians? Fais, I believe you are not quite so ignorant as I thought you. I am glad to hear oo walked so much in the country. Does DD ever read to you, ung ooman? O, fais!
