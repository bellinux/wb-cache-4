5|$|After {{receiving}} highly exaggerated {{reports about}} the role of <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> and their help to the British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu decided to minimise the threat to his kingdom from the British and banish <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> of Canara. According to Severine Silva, this decision was the logical outcome of the plans he had nurtured since the time of the conquest of Mangalore with his father Hyder in 1768.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} among <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> of Neapolis decreased, {{tensions between}} the Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became {{the site of a}} deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> further.|$|E

5|$|Historians (List of Historians {{till now}} not found, hence cannot be trusted) claim that Hyder was {{extremely}} tolerant towards <b>the</b> <b>Christians.</b> According to historian Severine Silva, {{he followed the}} same policy of religious tolerance towards Christians as he had from the beginning, even though <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> had revolted against him. The Second Anglo-Mysore War began in 1780 and led to Hyder's death on 7 December 1782, at Arcot. Afterwards the British recaptured the fort at Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|Hyder's army {{included}} several Catholic soldiers and he allowed Christians {{to build a}} church within the Seringapatam Fort where French generals offered prayers and priests visited. Mangalorean historian A.L.P. D'Souza mentions that Hyder had also used Canara Christians for administrative purposes. In accordance with the two treaties concluded with Portugal, Hyder allowed Portuguese priests to settle disputes among <b>the</b> <b>Christians.</b> Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> in general hated Hyder Ali because of the heavy taxes they were made to pay to the king's treasury.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} propaganda of the Goan priests and the alliance of <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> with the English cause Tipu to banish the community from Canara.

However, Alan Machado Prabhu dismisses the idea of large-scale Christian support for the British during the Second Mangalore War as a myth which {{is not based on}} any concrete evidence.|$|E

5|$|Jerome {{reports that}} {{apparently}} <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> {{had intended to}} remove Joseph's bones to their city, but a column of fire rose skyward from the tomb scaring them away. The Samaritans subsequently covered the tomb with earth rendering it inaccessible.|$|E
5|$|Mufarrij {{also tried}} to win support among <b>the</b> <b>Christians,</b> and {{possibly}} curry the favour of the Byzantine Empire as well, by sponsoring works to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which had only recently been demolished on the orders of al-Hakim, and by arranging the re-appointment of a Patriarch to the vacant see.

5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's hatred of Christians was {{compounded}} by fears that as they shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> were viewed as a potential fifth column {{in the event of}} a British attack. To this, he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against him, even though he knew it wasn't true.|$|E

5|$|Severine Silva {{points out}} that <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> of Canara were eager {{to get rid of}} Tipu. The History of the Diocese of Mangalore by J. Moore and Angelus Francis Xavier Maffei also purports to show that <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> of Canara were charged with {{assisting}} the British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Tipu made a number of accusations against <b>the</b> <b>Christians,</b> including that they had invited the British to invade Canara in 1781–82, furnished supplies to and otherwise assisted General Matthews' army when it landed and took possession of Onore, accompanied the British detachment to Mangalore, provided it with supplies {{both before and after the}} march, aided the British in repairing breaches made when the fort was besieged by Tipu and plundered the state treasury at Nuggur when that fortress fell to General Matthews.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Christians</b> were {{alleged to}} have helped General Mathews with a sum of Rs. 3,30,000/-. Hyder summoned a Portuguese officer and several Christian priests from Mangalore to suggest the {{punishment}} for the Mangalorean Catholics for treachery. The Portuguese officer suggested {{the death penalty for}} those Catholics who helped the British, because it was a fitting punishment for people who betrayed the sovereign. But Hyder exhibited a diplomatic stance and imprisoned <b>the</b> <b>Christians,</b> rather than killing them.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Christians,</b> {{believing that}} this tribulation came upon {{them for their}} neglect of the Law of God and their {{religious}} duties, began to fervently read the Krista Purana, an epic poem {{on the life of}} Jesus Christ written by the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens (1549–1619). On discovering this, some Muslims destroyed the books, but <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> constructed subterranean refuges in which to perform their religious devotions, read the books, and strengthen their faith. According to Mr. Silva of Gangollim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment ordered by Tipu was amputation of the ears, nose, feet and one hand.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Christian</b> Heritage Party {{remained}} somewhat {{bitter about}} {{the collapse of}} <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Coalition. While considerable tension had existed between <b>Christian</b> Heritage and <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Democrats, Graham Capill apparently believed a resolution possible. After <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Democrats left, however, Christian Heritage re-affirmed all its traditional policies, including those that had seemed too extreme for the Coalition.|$|R
5|$|When Tipu issued {{his orders}} to seize <b>the</b> <b>Christians,</b> the British, who had {{entered into a}} treaty with him on 11 March 1784, were helpless. Captives also {{included}} Malayali Christians, and Tamil Christians from the Tamil-countries. The Portuguese, guardians of the Christian faith in Canara, intervened and requested Tipu not to imprison the priests. They suggested that he let <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> live peacefully as his father Hyder Ali had done. But Tipu paid no heed to their request. Estimates suggest that about 7,000 people remained in hiding. Many were actively assisted by the Hindus whilst the few Christians in Canara who escaped Tipu's initial captivity fled to Coorg and Malabar, where they were protected by the native rulers.|$|E
5|$|When Tipu's embassy {{visited the}} court of the French King Louis XVI in 1788, Pope Clement XIV's {{representative}} conveyed the appeal to the embassy. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War (1789–92), the British and their allies defeated Tipu. Desperate to break the alliance of powers surrounding him on all sides, Tipu sought {{to make peace with}} Portugal, the Marathas, and other powers. According to Severine Silva, he consequently gave up the persecution of Christians, opened negotiations with the Portuguese Government and with the Archbishop of Goa, with a promise that he would stop molesting <b>the</b> <b>Christians,</b> further asserting that he would rebuild all destroyed churches at his own cost. <b>The</b> <b>Christians</b> found their supervision relaxed and Tipu became more conciliatory in his attitude. <b>The</b> <b>Christians</b> now escaped from the camps of Seringapatam and gradually began to enter the neighbouring kingdoms of Coorg and Malabar.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{also noted}} that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail.

40|$|In this article, I {{apply the}} theory of {{tradition}} Karl Popper developed in {{an article on the}} rationalist tradition to Christianity. Popper helps us to distinguish between four functions of <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> tradition. (1) <b>The</b> <b>Christian</b> tradition helps people to order their perceptions by suggesting distinctions between what is important and what is less important. (2) <b>The</b> <b>Christian</b> tradition provides people with guidelines for their (moral) behaviour. (3) <b>The</b> <b>Christian</b> tradition provides a framework that helps us to understand the past of our own culture, and can also function as a background against which we may form our own authentic views of life. (4) <b>The</b> <b>Christian</b> tradition is closely connected to <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> community, which functions as a social group to which people may belong and by reference to which they can define their identity. These four functions shed light on the question why people attach value to participating in <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> tradition, and why they deplore the decline of <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> tradition...|$|R
