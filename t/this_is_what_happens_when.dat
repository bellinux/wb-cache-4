2500|$|The {{theory of}} the {{behavior}} of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician Leonhard Euler. He derived the formula, the Euler formula, that gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is perfectly straight, made of a homogeneous material, and free from initial stress. When the applied load reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the critical load, the column comes to be in a state of unstable equilibrium. At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly [...] "jumping" [...] to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> a person stands on an empty aluminum can and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns). The formula derived by Euler for long slender columns is given below.|$|E

50|$|In {{structural}} engineering and material science, fast fracture {{is a term}} given to a phenomenon in which a flaw (such as a crack) in a material expands quickly, and leads to catastrophic failure of the material. Stress acting on a material when fast fracture occurs {{is less than the}} material's yield stress. A very representative example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> poking a blown up balloon with a needle, that is, fast fracture of the balloon's material.|$|E

50|$|For {{detection}} {{systems that}} record discrete events, such as particle and nuclear detectors, the dead {{time is the}} time after each event during which {{the system is not}} able to record another event.An everyday life example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> someone takes a photo using a flash - another picture cannot be taken immediately afterward because the flash needs a few seconds to recharge.

50|$|To {{understand}} why the glued IOL works better compared to a sutured IOL or AC IOL, let us think of a camera.

Imagine if we would glue the lens to the camera body both the lens and the body of the camera would move in unison. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in a glued IOL and there is no movement of the IOL (pseudo phacodonesis) which gives a better picture quality.|$|R

50|$|The Life Orientation Inventory (LOI) is a self-report {{measure that}} comes in both a 30 {{question}} and 110 question form. Both forms use a 4-point Likert scale to answer items, which are divided into six sub-scales on the longer form: self-esteem vulnerability, over-investment, overdetermined misery, affective domination, alienation, and suicide tenability. This scale has strong reliability and validity, and {{has been shown to}} be able to differentiate between control, depressed, possibly suicidal, and highly suicidal individuals. It also contains 3 validity indices, similar to the MMPI. However, while useful, this inventory is now out of print. On a clinical and individual level the LOI is not practical. Suicidal people aren't rational and their biographical memories are impaired. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> depression affects memory and stress affects the hippocampus.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the domains}} can also exist in other {{configurations}} {{in which their}} magnetization mostly points in the same direction, creating an external magnetic field. Although these are not minimum energy configurations, due to a phenomenon where the domain walls become [...] "pinned" [...] to defects in the crystal lattice they can be local minimums of the energy, and therefore can be very stable. Applying an external magnetic field to the material can make the domain walls move, causing the domains aligned with the field to grow, and the opposing domains to shrink. When the external field is removed, the domain walls remain pinned in their new orientation and the aligned domains produce a magnetic field. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> a piece of ferromagnetic material is [...] "magnetized" [...] and becomes a permanent magnet.|$|E
