It was an unfolding story throughout the day as the ALP demanded to know how the cut would be paid for. Treasurer, Chris Bowen rejected Tony Abbott’s claim that the cut could be paid for by previously announced spending cuts as: “magic pudding economics” and double-counting.

50|$|In January 2013, Salopek {{embarked}} on a seven-year walk along one of the routes taken by early humans to migrate out of Africa. The transcontinental foot journey will cover more than 20,000 miles, beginning in Africa, in Ethiopia, across the Middle East and through Asia, via Alaska and down {{the western edge of}} the Americas to the southern tip of Chile. The project, entitled Out of Eden Walk, is funded by National Geographic Magazine, the Knight Foundation and the Abundance Foundation. The project is designed as a laboratory of slow journalism that engages with <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> our time—from climate change to technological innovation, from mass migration to cultural survival—by walking alongside the populations who inhabit such headlines every day. The object is to immerse readers in the lives of people encountered en route: the nomads, villagers, traders, farmers, and fishermen who rarely make the news. When the seven-year trek ends, the walk will have generated a global mosaic of stories, faces, sounds, and landscapes highlighting the pathways that connect us to each other—a mostly digital archive of our shared humanity at the start of a new millennium.|$|E
40|$|More {{emphasis}} is {{being placed on}} newspaper design and graphics than ever before. Most American newspapers have made changes in their appearance in hopes of attracting more readers and {{holding on to the}} ones they already have. While research on publication design has been conducted for quite some time, more research is being done as the importance of graphics to the survival of many newspapers grows. Traditionally, emphasis has been placed on reporting <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> the day and getting them first and right. And, traditionally, that has been enough to attract the readers that the newspaper industry needs to survive. Means to increase declining readership and circulation have included anything from increased local coverage to special promotions and discounts. Now, however, more attention is being paid to newspaper design-more specifically, making the front page look good, to increase reader satisfaction and circulation. Readers still want hard-hitting, responsible journalism, but they also want a product that is appealing to the eye. According to Steve Pasternack and Sandra Utt in their study, Front Pages of U. S. Daily Newspapers, "Newspapers have become increasingly concerned about how they look as well as what they say. " (Pasternack and Utt, 1984, p. 279) With this increased awareness of what good newspaper design can do for a newspaper, most American newspapers have made at least minor changes in their appearance, while many others have undergone complete redesigns- adding digests, teasers, infographics or other graphic devices. Editors are finding that graphics not only make a newspaper look better, but they also make it easier to read. A 1984 survey of Society of Newspaper Design members, which revealed that within the preceding year 22 percent had introduced the use of informational graphics and 60 percent had increased graphics use at their newspapers, lends support to the idea of increased emphasis on design. (Smith and Hajash, 1988, p. 714) Mario Garcia, author of Contemporary Newspaper Design, wrote, "To think graphically means to invite the reader into each page with attractive, provocative and orderly use of photos, typography and illustrations. " (Pasternack and Utt, 1984, p. 880) As a rule, newspapers have adopted a more graphically appealing format. A study by the Newspaper Advertising Bureau found that newspapers are changing their typefaces, using more photographs and redesigning their mastheads. In another study, it was found that 52 percent of the papers ran between six and 10 graphics daily, and three percent ran more than 20 graphics daily. Newspaper managers have even found that design improvements in their newspapers can {{have a positive effect on}} circulation figures, making newspaper design even more important. The Wabash (Ind.) Plain Dealer, involved in a circulation battle, recently redesigned its front page, even placing a comic strip on page one. The Trenton (NJ) Times has redesigned its product as part of an ongoing circulation battle. Another study by Utt and Pasternack (1984) of selected newspapers from the Editor and Publisher Yearbook with an average circulation of 25, 000 or more tried to characterize the design of the average American daily newspaper. But the most important thing they found from the study was that editors were tremendously concerned with the appearance of their newspapers, as 94. 9 percent believed that a "good looking" paper could be a factor in both competitive and noncompetitive situations. This paper is a compilation of all of the studies done on newspaper design and graphics since 1980 and published in either Journalism Quarterly or the Newspaper Research Journal, the two most notable journals publishing research done on the newspaper industry. Newspaper design and graphics is defined as any article on photography, color, informational graphics, and redesign, excluding research done on advertising design. The compilation covers a ten-year period from 1980 to 1990, a decade when newspaper design began to be emphasized by daily newspapers. The studies are in chronological order according to the date published in the journal and each contains a summary of the methodology, results and suggestions for future studies. The compilation will be valuable to anyone interested in newspaper design since all of the studies will be in one location for easy access. Department of JournalismThesis (M. A. ...|$|E
