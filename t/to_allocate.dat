5|$|As {{a member}} of the House Appropriations Committee, Moran worked <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> federal funding to {{projects}} in Northern Virginia, usually in the technology and defense industries. He also assisted in authorizing the replacement of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, a bridge between Alexandria, Virginia, and Prince George's County, Maryland, which had gained a reputation over the years among Northern Virginia residents as the site of numerous rush-hour traffic jams.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{existing}} infantry battalions of the Citizens Force were redesignated {{to perpetuate the}} numerical designations of the AIF, and although {{an attempt was made}} <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> these designations based on regional considerations, ultimately this was not always possible and ultimately when the 3rd Division was re-established, only two of its component battalions—the 37th and 39th Battalions—had previously been assigned to the division.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Ma was {{appointed}} the Director of the Shanghai Museum. When {{the museum was}} omitted from Shanghai's five-year reconstruction plan in 1992, Ma lobbied Mayor Huang Ju for its rebuilding. After seeing the dilapidated rooms of the Zhonghui Building where the museum was then housed, Huang agreed <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> a prime site on the People's Square, but the museum had to raise its own building funds. Ma raised US$25 million by leasing the old building to a Hong Kong developer. He also made many trips abroad to solicit donations, mainly from the Shanghai diaspora who had fled to Hong Kong after the Communist revolution, raising another US$10 million. The money still ran short, but he eventually persuaded the city government <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> another 140 million yuan to complete the building.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Robin Raphel {{joined the}} Afghanistan-Pakistan task force known as AfPak, joining the late Richard Holbrooke, U.S. Special Representative for the region.

That legislation was enacted in late 2009, tripling civilian U.S. aid to Pakistan to approximately $1.5 billion annually.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} to note that the boundaries between category are able to be moved <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E

Storyboarding the commercial meant that the agency could determine {{how much of the}} £1.3M budget <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> to each section, and provided them with visuals to use as part of the presentation to Diageo when pitching the various concepts for a decision on which to pursue.

5|$|The Japanese {{attacks on}} the Mariana Islands during 1944 and 1945 did not seriously disrupt the USAAF's {{strategic}} air campaign against Japan. They did, however, force the United States <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> forces to defend the islands {{in order to prevent}} further losses of expensive B-29s. Moreover, due to the high cost of the heavy bombers, the ratio of losses was in favor of the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The long-running HUG process {{complicated}} the RAAF's management of its fleet of F/A-18s.

5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915. The Germans were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> {{any of their}} wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans {{for up to six}} of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.|$|E
5|$|Christie {{urged the}} Navy Department <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> a target ship for {{extensive}} field {{tests of the}} torpedo and exploder. The Chief of Naval Operations authorized {{the use of the}} obsolete destroyer , but placed so many restrictions on its use, Newport was forced to decline the offer. As a result, neither the Mark 6 exploder nor the Mark 14 torpedo ever underwent a live test, and their shortcomings would not become apparent until the outbreak of hostilities. It would be twenty months before the problems were corrected, over Christie's objections.|$|E
