40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to make a {{quantitative}} contribution to the inflation versus price level targeting debate. It considers a policy-maker that can set policy either through an inflation <b>targeting</b> <b>rule</b> or a price level <b>targeting</b> <b>rule</b> to minimize a quadratic loss function using the actual projection model of the Bank of Canada (ToTEM). The paper finds that price level targeting dominates inflation targeting, although it can lead to much more volatile inflation depending on the weight assigned to output gap stabilization in the loss function. The price level <b>targeting</b> <b>rule</b> is also found to mimic the full-commitment solution quite well. There is, however, an important difference: the full-commitment solution does not require stationarity in the price-level. The paper then analyzes the extent to which the results are sensitive to Hansen and Sargent (2004) model uncertainty. The paper finds the price level <b>targeting</b> <b>rule</b> to be robust; its performance deteriorates slower than the inflation <b>targeting</b> <b>rule</b> and the absolute decline in performance is small in magnitude.

40|$|One {{issue in}} the {{literature}} on monetary policy in New Keynesian models has been the relative merits of instrument versus <b>target</b> <b>rules.</b> This paper focuses on optimal instrument and <b>target</b> <b>rules</b> within three workhorse models in the literature: IS-LM, AS-AD and the New Keynesian model. The focus on optimal rules enables us to exploit the equivalence among alternative expressions of optimal policies for a given information set. We find that in the AD-AS model, characterized by the presence of observable information variables and unobservable target variables, an optimal explicit instrument rule, a combination policy, and a <b>target</b> <b>rule</b> produce identical outcomes for the target variables. In the New Keynesian model, the optimal explicit instrument rule achieves the same stabilization results as the globally optimal <b>target</b> <b>rule.</b> However, the latter approach provides a more direct rationale for introducing inertia into policymaking. This seems to be the key advantage of the <b>target</b> <b>rule</b> approach. Along other dimensions such as robustness and transparency, <b>target</b> <b>rules</b> offer no clear advantages over optimal instrument rules. ...|$|R

40|$|Applying a {{stochastic}} dynamic general equilibrium model, {{the performance}} of various simple rules is analyzed in a small open economy context. The aspects that are considered in the analysis include the degree of exchange rate pass-through, trade openness, the policy objective and the source and persistency of shocks. The main objective of this analysis is to investigate if the rule reacts to exchange rate performs better than the basic closed economy rule without exchange rate term. Comparison on the performances is also made between the consumer inflation targeting and domestic inflation <b>targeting</b> <b>rules.</b> The results show that adding the exchange rate term to the policy rule enhances improvement especially in the higher pass-through case. The superior rule is the hybrid rule that reacts to the exchange rate term. CPI inflation <b>targeting</b> <b>rules</b> outperform the domestic inflation <b>targeting</b> <b>rules</b> in term of welfare loss. However, more complicated domestic inflation <b>targeting</b> <b>rules</b> generate lower loss in term of relative loss. On {{the second part of}} this chapter, comparisons on the performances of different exchange rate regimes are made under different source and persistency of shocks. The floating (pegged) regime is favored under more prominent real (nominal) shocks.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{consequences}} of debt stabilization for inflation targeting. If the monetary authority perfectly stabilizes inflation while the fiscal authority holds constant {{the real value of}} debt at maturity, the equilibrium dynamics might be indeterminate. However, determinacy can be restored by committing to <b>targeting</b> <b>rules</b> for either monetary or fiscal policy that include a concern for stabilization of the output gap. In solving the indeterminacy problem, flexible inflation targeting appears to be more robust than flexible debt targeting to alternative parameter configurations and steady-state fiscal stances. Conversely, flexible fiscal <b>targeting</b> <b>rules</b> lead to more desirable welfare outcomes. The paper further shows that if considerations beyond stabilization call for a combination of strict inflation and debt <b>targeting</b> <b>rules,</b> the indeterminacy result can be overturned if the fiscal authority commits to holding constant debt net of interest rate spending.

A novel feature of this criterion is that is has a relative weight on output gap deviations that changes synchronously with changes in the cost of price adjustment.

40|$|How {{and under}} what {{circumstances}} can adjusting the inflation target serve as a stabilization-policy tool and contribute to welfare improvement? We answer these questions quantitatively with a standard New Keynesian model that includes cost-push type shocks which create a trade-o↵ between inflation and output gap stabilization. We show that this trade-o↵ leads to a non-trivial welfare cost under a standard Taylor rule, even with optimized policy coefficients. We then propose an additional policy tool of an inflation <b>target</b> <b>rule</b> and find that the optimal target needs to be adjusted in a persistent manner and in the opposite direction to the realization of a cost-push shock. The inflation <b>target</b> <b>rule,</b> combined with a Taylor rule, significantly reduces fluctuations in inflation originating from the cost-push shocks and mitigates the policy trade-o↵, resulting in a similar level of welfare to that associated with the Ramsey optimal policy.
