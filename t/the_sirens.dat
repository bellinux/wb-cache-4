5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sirens</b> and Ulysses {{is a large}} oil {{painting}} on canvas by the English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1837. It depicts the scene from Homer's Odyssey in which Ulysses (Odysseus) resists the bewitching song of <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> by having his ship's crew tie him up, while they are ordered to block their own ears to prevent themselves from hearing the song.|$|E
5|$|Beau Garrett as Gem, {{one of four}} {{programs}} {{known as}} Sirens. <b>The</b> <b>Sirens</b> operate the Grid's game armory, equipping combatants with the armor needed {{to compete in the}} games, while also reporting to Castor.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{had used}} {{experimental}} techniques to make <b>The</b> <b>Sirens</b> and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem {{made worse by}} the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in {{the archives of the}} Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century {{there were a number of}} unsuccessful attempts to repair <b>The</b> <b>Sirens</b> and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.|$|E
2500|$|Time is kept by two off-field officials, {{known as}} [...] "timekeepers", who sound <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> at <b>the</b> start {{and end of}} each quarter. The quarter or match ends {{immediately}} when a field umpire hears <b>the</b> <b>siren,</b> with <b>the</b> exception that a player is allowed to kick for goal after <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> from a mark or free kick which was paid before <b>the</b> <b>siren.</b>|$|R
25|$|Camberley {{falls under}} <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> test area of Broadmoor Hospital, a secure mental {{hospital}} in nearby Crowthorne. <b>The</b> <b>siren</b> was installed following a public outcry at the escape of child-murderer John Thomas Straffen in April 1952. <b>The</b> <b>siren</b> is still tested every Monday at 10am.|$|R

On February 7, 1999, she debuted as {{a nightclub}} singer at the Denver Chop House & Brewery, where she {{performed}} {{on behalf of}} the homelessness charity Family Homestead. In June 2003, she sang at Denver's Rattlebrain Theatre on Sunday nights with <b>The</b> <b>Sirens.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sirenia, {{commonly}} sirenians, {{are also}} referred to by the common name sirens, deriving from <b>the</b> <b>sirens</b> of Greek mythology. This comes from a legend about their discovery, involving lonely sailors mistaking them for mermaids. Seekoei (sea cow) is also the name for a hippopotamus in Afrikaans.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sirens</b> and Ulysses shows three Sirens singing on an island, {{surrounded}} by the rotting corpses of dead sailors. Ulysses is visible in the background tied to the mast of his ship, while dark clouds rise in the background.|$|E

25|$|At this point, the Fremantle players {{began to}} {{celebrate}} {{what they thought}} was a one-point victory. Nicholls, however, did not hear <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> and refused to listen to the claims of Fremantle players, particularly Byron Schammer, that <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> had sounded. He also did not confer with the other two umpires as to whether <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> had sounded before restarting play.|$|R
5|$|While {{traditionally}} <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> {{had been}} depicted as human–animal chimeras, Etty portrayed them as naked young women, {{on an island}} strewn with decaying corpses. The painting divided opinion {{at the time of}} its first exhibition, with some critics greatly admiring it while others derided it as tasteless and unpleasant. Possibly owing to its unusually large size, 442.5cm by 297cm (14ft 6in by 9ft 9in), the work initially failed to sell, and was bought later that year at a bargain price by the Manchester merchant Daniel Grant. Grant died shortly afterwards, and his brother donated <b>The</b> <b>Sirens</b> and Ulysses to the Royal Manchester Institution.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the {{repaired}} {{painting was}} moved {{back from the}} conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, {{open to the public}} to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and <b>The</b> <b>Sirens</b> and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} appearance of <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> is not {{described in the}} Odyssey, and the traditional Greek representation of them was as bird-lion or bird-human chimeras. Etty rationalised the fully human appearance of his Sirens by explaining that their forms became fully human once out of the sea, an approach followed {{by a number of}} later painters of the subject.|$|E

50|$|Leach played {{most of his}} {{football}} in the backline, but is best remembered for kicking a goal after <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> to win a game against Brisbane in 1997. Fremantle were behind by one point when Leach took a mark about 30 metres from goal, just seconds before <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> sounded to end the game. His kick after <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> went straight through the goals and Fremantle won the game by 5 points.|$|R
5|$|The word mermaid is a {{compound}} of the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a girl or young woman). The equivalent term in Old English was merewif. They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair. As cited above, they are sometimes equated with <b>the</b> <b>sirens</b> of Greek mythology (especially the Odyssey), half-bird femmes fatales whose enchanting voices would lure soon-to-be-shipwrecked sailors to nearby rocks, sandbars or shoals.|$|E
5|$|In October 1941, Reggie {{was offered}} a post as {{lecturer}} at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and the raids terrified Manning, who irritated Reggie and Liddell by insisting that all three descend to the air raid shelter whenever <b>the</b> <b>sirens</b> wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver's death in a plane crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.|$|E
5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some {{salamanders}} have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. <b>The</b> <b>sirens</b> are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner of}} earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E

25|$|Nick Riewoldt (St Kilda) {{knocked the}} ball across the field, and another pack formed as the {{official}} timekeeper's clock reached 0:00. (The timekeeper's clock is displayed on the television broadcast.) The umpire controlling play, Matthew Nicholls, signalled another ball-up to restart play; he was oblivious to the noise of <b>the</b> <b>siren,</b> which was barely audible over the raucous crowd. A number of Fremantle players, particularly Scott Thornton, appeared to have either heard <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> or reacted to other players hearing <b>the</b> <b>siren.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of an adaptive filter system, capable of reducing significantly <b>the</b> effect of <b>siren</b> noise within <b>the</b> cab of an emergency vehicle, is described. The system is capable of removing <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> noise {{picked up by the}} radio microphone inside the vehicle, without degrading the wanted voice signal, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> to be used at all times...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sirens</b> and Ulysses {{was painted}} using an {{experimental}} technique, which {{caused it to}} begin to deteriorate {{as soon as it}} was complete. It was shown in a major London exhibition of Etty's work in 1849 and at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, but was then considered in too poor a condition for continued public display and was placed in the gallery's archives. Restoration began on the work in 2003, and in 2010 the painting went on display in the Manchester Art Gallery, over 150 years after being consigned to storage.|$|E
5|$|Ulysses appears {{larger than}} his fellow sailors, while <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> hold out their arms in {{traditional}} dramatic poses. The three Sirens {{are very similar}} in appearance, and Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson believes it likely that Etty painted the same model in three different poses. Robinson considers their classical poses {{to be the result}} of Etty's lifelong attendance at the Academy's Life Classes, where models were always in traditional poses, while former curator of York Art Gallery Richard Green considers their pose a tribute to the Nereids in Rubens's The Disembarkation at Marseilles, a work Etty is known to have admired and of which he made a copy in 1823.|$|E
5|$|With a few exceptions, adult {{amphibians}} are predators, {{feeding on}} virtually anything that moves {{that they can}} swallow. The diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles, caterpillars, earthworms and spiders. <b>The</b> <b>sirens</b> (Siren spp.) often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a Brazilian tree frog (Xenohyla truncata) includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet. The Mexican burrowing toad (Rhinophrynus dorsalis) has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites. It projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first, their tongues being hinged at the front.|$|E

40|$|Sirens used by police, {{fire and}} {{paramedic}} vehicles {{have been designed}} {{so that they can}} be heard over large distances, but unfortunately <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> noise enters <b>the</b> vehicle and corrupts intelligibility of voice communications from the emergency vehicle to the control room. Often <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> needs to be turned off to enable the control room to hear what is being said. This paper discusses a siren noise filter system that is capable of removing <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> noise picked up by the two-way radio microphone inside the vehicle. The removal of <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> noise improves <b>the</b> response time for emergency vehicles and thus save lives. To date, the system has been trialed within a fire tender in a non-emergency situation, with good results. ...|$|R
25|$|A 1982 VFA {{match between}} Frankston and Geelong West ended in similar circumstances. The {{controlling}} umpire failed to hear <b>the</b> <b>siren,</b> allowing Geelong West's Simon Taylor {{to kick the}} winning goal after time expired, while the non-controlling umpire heard <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> and signalled <b>the</b> end of play; the two umpires conferred and awarded the goal. Frankston appealed the result, but the appeal was rejected. As in the St Kilda vs Fremantle match, the Association found that the timekeeper should have sounded <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> for longer.|$|R
5|$|With the victory, the Indians {{received}} their first playoff berth since the 1920 World Series. Indians' Manager Lou Boudreau dedicated the victory to pitcher Don Black, {{who suffered a}} cerebral hemorrhage the previous month. The Indians went on to face the Boston Braves in the 1948 World Series, winning it four games to two. The Red Sox fans experienced disappointment when Boston mayor James M. Curley ordered the fire department sirens sounded when Boston won the pennant. <b>The</b> <b>sirens</b> did sound, but it was instead for {{a fire in the}} Boston navy yard.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{considered}} {{the painting to}} be his best work, insisting that it form the centrepiece of his 1849 Royal Society of Arts solo exhibition. The Royal Manchester Institution was concerned that the painting would be damaged if moved, refusing {{to allow it to}} be used in the exhibition until Etty, and a number of influential friends, visited Manchester to beg them to release it. Etty died later that year, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. As it was rarely exhibited, <b>The</b> <b>Sirens</b> and Ulysses had little influence on later artists, although it is credited as an influence on Frederic Leighton's 1858 The Fisherman and the Syren.|$|E
5|$|Etty was {{prolific}} and commercially successful {{throughout the}} 1840s, {{but the quality}} of his work deteriorated throughout this period. As his health progressively worsened he retired to York in 1848. He died in 1849, shortly after a major retrospective exhibition. In the immediate aftermath of his death his works became highly collectable and sold for large sums. Changing tastes meant his work later fell out of fashion, and imitators soon abandoned his style. By the end of the 19th century the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices, and outside his native York he remained little known throughout the 20th century. Etty's inclusion in Tate Britain's landmark Exposed: The Victorian Nude exhibition in 2001–02, the high-profile restoration of his <b>The</b> <b>Sirens</b> and Ulysses in 2010 and a major retrospective of his work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12 led to renewed interest in his work.|$|E
