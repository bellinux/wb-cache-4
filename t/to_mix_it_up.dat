2500|$|In December 1902 and January 1903, Bemus and Hawley Pierce {{helped the}} All-Syracuse {{football}} team win the World Series of Football. [...] On December 29, 1902, the Pierce brothers played {{in what was}} billed as the first professional football game played in New York City. [...] The game, played in front of 3,500 spectators at Madison Square Garden, matched the All-Syracuse team featuring the Pierce Brothers and Glenn Warner against a local New York City team. [...] The wood flooring of the arena was pulled up, and a gridiron was laid out on dirt, with a field 70 yards long and 35 yards wide. [...] A newspaper from Syracuse credited the Pierce brothers with playing to win. Pops Warner and Bemus Pierce were credited with [...] "tearing great holes in the Gotham line." [...] And on offense, the paper wrote that [...] "Bemus Pierce hurdled like a racehorse for distance." [...] "Another interesting chapter occurred when the temper of Bemus Pierce was aroused and he threatened <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with everybody in general." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Brothers in Rhythm remix of [...] "Too Far" [...] {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} most music critics. Charlie Porter from Amazon.co.uk was positive towards the remix, stating [...] "Brothers In Rhythm work their slinky magic on [...] "Too Far"...". Porter highlighted the song as an album stand out track. Brendan Swift from AllMusic was mixed {{in his review}} from Impossible Remixes, which the Brothers in Rhythm remix of [...] "Too Far" [...] was included on. He commented that [...] "with ten versions of four songs ("Too Far", [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", [...] "Did it Again", and [...] "Breathe"), there's {{not a lot of}} room for variation... and the repetition certainly makes for classic club fodder." [...] However, Swift acknowledge that Brothers in Rhythm, and other remix artists from the two accompanying albums, [...] "do their best <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and they succeed by drip-drying the pop melodies and distilling them into pure club-style mash." [...] Despite an airplay and vinyl release, the Brothers in Rhythm remix failed to appear on any record charts. No music video was directed or produced.|$|E

[...] "When you don't know {{anything}} about the wines, {{it is very difficult to}} take an interest in them. It is like learning that a town in India is on the Ganges.

5000|$|Kevin's musical {{style is}} {{considered}} eclectic. Having {{been exposed to}} so many differing genres and styles, he likes <b>to</b> (when possible) <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> stylistically. Most of the projects he has worked on are R&B oriented, but he appreciates the sophisticated harmonies of gospel, nice string arrangements and [...] "rocked out" [...] guitars whenever possible. The aspect of music Kevin likes best {{is the ability to}} express emotions vocally or instrumentally. He has a background in sound design and likes to employ sound effects as well as music to convey a feeling.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{contrast}} between Heinrich's carefulness and Teddy's easy-goingness, come {{to look at}} it, is I suppose {{one of the most}} fundamental in the world. It reaches <b>to</b> everything. <b>It</b> <b>mixes</b> <b>up</b> with education, statecraft, morals. Will you make or will you take? Those are the two extreme courses in all such things. I suppose the answer of wisdom to that is, like all wise answers, a compromise. I suppose one must accept and then make all one can of it.... Have you talked at all to my eldest son?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it {{had been}} sung by itself, {{it would have been}} {{uncommon}} sweet, I don't deny it; but what they wanted <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with 'Old Bob Ridley' for, I can't make out. Why, they don't go together, at all. They are not of the same nature. 'Bob Ridley' is a common rackety slam-bang secular song, one of the rippingest and rantingest and noisiest there is. I am no judge of music, and I don't claim it, but in my opinion nobody can make those two songs go together right." ...|$|E

And Miss Lavendar ain't to be trusted to do a thing. I was thankful when Mr. Irving came a few minutes ago and took her off for a walk in the woods. Courting's all right in its place, Miss Shirley, ma'am, but if you try <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with cooking and scouring everything's spoiled. That's MY opinion, Miss Shirley, ma'am." ...|$|E
60|$|Sheen nearly chuckled. It was all {{so beautifully}} simple. What a fool he had been <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in the first round. If he only kept his head and stuck to out-fighting he could win with ease. The man couldn't box. He {{was nothing more than}} a slogger. Here he came, as usual, with the old {{familiar}} rush. Out went his left. But it missed its billet. Peteiro had checked his rush after the first movement, and now he came in with both hands. It was the first time during the round that he had got to close quarters, and he made the most of it. Sheen's blows were as frequent, but his were harder. He drove at the body, right and left; and once again the call of Time extricated Sheen from an awkward position. As far as points were concerned he had had the best of the round, but he was very sore and bruised. His left side was one dull ache.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Thin Line Between Chuck and Nate" [...] was {{watched by}} 2.27 million of viewers and {{received}} positive reviews from critics. New York Magazine praised the episode following the show's {{return from the}} Writer's Strike {{and the use of}} Gossip Girl to elevate the episode. [...] "We were concerned after last week's episode that Gossip Girl was embarking on a downward spiral, that the writers' strike would cause it to slink off the air like a disgraced social climber, ... Every time we find ourselves doubting or mistrustful of our lover, he or she surprises us, we are proven wrong, and we fall in [...] "love" [...] all over again. As the great writer Jessica Fletcher once said, what does not kill us makes us stronger. And this week's season finale had us feeling strong indeed! ... it was the first to play up the role of Gossip Girl herself and her effect on the character's lives." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club lauded the development of the Blair/Nate/Chuck triangle, [...] "...one, it adds another layer to the big revelation that she lost her virginity to Chuck before losing her fake virginity to Nate. It would have been hard enough to deal with the truth about who’s sleeping with whom, but adding a paternity test <b>to</b> the <b>mix</b> kicks <b>it</b> <b>up</b> several notches. For two, we get to see Blair’s swift and stunning fall from grace after Chuck decides to finally play his hand on the Gossip Girl site." ...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the murderous}} basis of Freddy Krueger, New Line Cinema opted to not develop a {{television}} series {{with a regular}} batch of characters <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with Krueger on a continuous basis; deeming it futile, since he would inevitably kill most of them, {{and there would be}} no one left.
