5000|$|The Dodge Challenger SRT® Demon {{is built}} {{to be an}} elite {{performance}} machine. It's powered by an 840 hp rated, Supercharged 6.2L HEMI® SRT Demon V8 engine and armed with a functional Air-Grabber™ hood scoop and <b>Torque</b> <b>Reserve</b> Launch System. According to Dodge, [...] "While the Demon V8 engine shares its architecture with the 707-horsepower Supercharged 6.2L HEMI® Hellcat V8 engine, {{it is not simply}} a Hellcat V8 engine with more boost. The Demon V8 engine has 25 major component upgrades from the Hellcat engine, including, pistons, rods, supercharger, valve train and fuel injection system." ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} performance of a diesel engine in an agricultural tractor, using Diesel S 500 (B 5) and mixture with 3 % (ED 3), 6 % (ED 6), 9 % (ED 9), 12 % (ED 12) and 15 % (ED 15) of hydrous ethanol. Variables evaluated were the power, torque, specific fuel consumption, <b>torque</b> <b>reserve,</b> speed reserve and elasticity index of engine. Results indicated that using B 5 and ED 3 the values of torque and engine power not differ, in addition, with the ED 3 the fuel consumption was lower than 5. 92 %. Using ED 12, power has reduced in 2. 97 %, compared with B 5, while their fuel consumption had no difference. With ED 15, the power was lower 6. 30 % and the fuel consumption increase 3. 77 %, both compared with B 5. <b>Torque</b> <b>reserve</b> value was increased with increasing the ethanol content in B 5, reducing the speed reserve and elasticity index of engine. Ethanol in Diesel S 500 (B 5) can be used as an alternative fuel in agricultural tractor engines without presenting high changes in the performance, since the ethanol content is at low percentages, up to 12 %...|$|E

O país dispõe de mais de 350 milhões de litros de óleo de frango por ano. Considerando a aplicação dos combustíveis alternativos para os motores a diesel, em máquinas agrícolas, o trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar o desempenho do motor de um trator agrícola de 53 kW acoplado pela TDP em bancada dinamométrica, operando com biodiesel metílico de óleo de frango e misturas com óleo diesel, sendo: B 5 (testemunha), B 20, B 40, B 60, B 80 e B 100. Avaliaram-se a potência, o torque, a reserva de torque, o consumo de combustível, o consumo de energia e a eficiência térmica do motor. O ensaio foi instalado com delineamento inteiramente casualizado (DIC) em esquema fatorial com seis tratamentos. Os resultados foram submetidos à análise de variância e as médias ajustadas por equações de regressão. Foram observadas perdas na geração de potência e torque, aumento no consumo de combustível, redução do consumo energético e melhoria na eficiência térmica do motor, de acordo com o aumento da proporção de biodiesel na mistura. Brazil, {{the world}} third largest producer of biodiesel, {{and also the}} third largest producer of chicken, may increase the energy matrix, using oil derived from chicken, {{as an alternative to}} fossil fuels and reduce dependence on soybean oil for this purpose. The country can produce over 350 million liters of chicken oil per year. Considering the application of alternative fuels on diesel engines in agricultural machinery. The study aimed to evaluate the performance of a engine agricultural tractor with 53 kW coupled by PTO in dynamometer bench operating with methyl biodiesel oil chicken and mix with diesel oil. Fuels B 5 (reference), B 20, B 40, B 60, B 80 and B 100 mixtures were used. The power, torque, <b>torque</b> <b>reserve,</b> fuel consumption, energy consumption and thermal efficiency of the engine were evaluated. The trial was conducted with a completely random design (CRD) in a factorial design with six treatment, which was held after the analysis of variance and adjusted means for the regression equations. Losses were observed in the generation of power and torque, increase in fuel consumption, reduction of energy consumption and improvement in engine thermal efficiency, according to the increasing proportion of biodiesel in the blend...|$|E
40|$|When the new Volvo S/V 60 was {{released}} it was marketed as a sporty and dynamic car. The chassis and {{handling of the}} car makes it enjoyable and it communicates in a direct fashion with the driver which is greatly appreciated by journalists and enthusiast car drivers. The great reception of the car encouraged to investigate what {{that could be done}} within driveline control {{in order to make it}} even more fun to drive. In this thesis the following enthusiast features are developed and tested: Launch control, down shift support, controlled exhaust detonations during shifts, injection cuts for sound and response reasons, distinct/sporty accelerator pedal characteristics in neutral and a system for increasing the response of the engine after gear change. All features are implemented within the engine controller. Models for the new functionality were developed in Matlab/Simulink. The launch control was simulated using VSim, a Volvo developed tool for longitudinal vehicle analyses. For the functionalities not well represented by VSim, measurement data from the test vehicle was run through the models to verify that the output signals were correct. The Simulink models were then adapted to the ECM and implemented into a test vehicle. The test vehicle used was a Volvo S 80 with a 2. 5 liter turbocharged port fuel injected five cylinder engine, manual transmission and a Denso ECM. The testing and calibration was conducted on test tracks, regular roads and in a chassis dynamometer. The result of the addition of new features is a car that is more fun to drive, offers quicker acceleration, better response and gives a more direct and sporty impression. Use of launch control gives quick and repetitive 0 - 100 km/h times. The time to regain boost after gear change is reduced by 0. 3 seconds and boost pressure never drops below 160 kPa absolute pressure with the response system active. The "Skip stroke" injection cut strategy proved to be useful for building <b>torque</b> <b>reserves</b> with very moderate exhaust temperatures. The down shift support gives a smoother and more stable ride while letting the driver impress his friends with his down shifting skills. The sportier accelerator pedal characteristics proved to make the communication between car and driver feel more direct and finally the addition of exhaust detonations during gear changes makes it impossible not to smile...|$|R
