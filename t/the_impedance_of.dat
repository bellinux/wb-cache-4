5|$|Following on from Foster, Cauer {{generalised}} {{the relationship}} between the expression for <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> a one-port network and its transfer function.|$|E
5|$|This {{follows from}} the fact <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> L and C {{elements}} are themselves simple rational functions and any algebraic combination of rational functions results in another rational function.|$|E
5|$|VSWR and the {{positions}} of the nodes are parameters that can be directly measured with an instrument called a slotted line. This instrument makes use of the reflection phenomenon to make many different measurements at microwave frequencies. One use is that VSWR and node position can be used to calculate <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> a test component terminating the slotted line. This is a useful method because measuring impedances by directly measuring voltages and currents is difficult at these frequencies.|$|E
40|$|The study {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} d-glucose solutionby a Zinc Oxide (ZnO) thin film biosensor. The ZnO thin film sensor {{was developed by the}} RF sputtering method over a glass substrate. Two adjacent electrodes were used to measure <b>the</b> <b>impedances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various concentrations of d-glucose. A in-house developed contiuous monitoring system was also used to study <b>the</b> <b>impedances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same and it was also tested for its continuous monitoring capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impedances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> d-glucose concentrations...|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} principle used {{in crystal}} radio design to transfer maximum {{power to the}} earphone is impedance matching. The maximum power is transferred {{from one part of}} a circuit to another when <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> one circuit is the complex conjugate of that of the other; this implies that the two circuits should have equal resistance. However, in crystal sets, <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> the antenna-ground system (around 10-200 ohms) is usually lower than <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> the receiver's tuned circuit (thousands of ohms at resonance), and also varies depending {{on the quality of the}} ground attachment, length of the antenna, and the frequency to which the receiver is tuned.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> {{a device}} can be {{calculated}} by complex division of the voltage and current. <b>The</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> the device {{can be calculated}} by applying a sinusoidal voltage to the device in series with a resistor, and measuring the voltage across the resistor and across the device. Performing this measurement by sweeping the frequencies of the applied signal provides the impedance phase and magnitude.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{amplifiers}} are devices {{somewhat similar}} to a transformer where one winding is used to control the saturation of a magnetic core and hence alter <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> the other winding.|$|E

5000|$|Directly {{measuring}} image impedance {{by adjusting}} terminations is inconveniently iterative and requires precision adjustable components {{to effect the}} termination. An alternative technique to determine <b>the</b> image <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> port 1 is to measure <b>the</b> short-circuit <b>impedance</b> ZSC (that is, <b>the</b> input <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> port 1 when port 2 is short-circuited) and <b>the</b> open-circuit <b>impedance</b> ZOC (<b>the</b> input <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> port 1 when port 2 is open-circuit). <b>The</b> image <b>impedance</b> is then given by, ...|$|R

25|$|When {{used for}} {{measuring}} voltage, the input impedance of the multimeter {{must be very}} high compared to <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> the circuit being measured; otherwise circuit operation may be changed, and the reading will also be inaccurate.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> {{headphones}} is {{of concern}} because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> the headphones, significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be louder and more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also an}} {{experimental}} method of characterizing electrochemical systems. This technique measures <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> a system over a range of frequencies, and therefore the frequency response of the system, including the energy storage and dissipation properties, is revealed. Often, data obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is expressed graphically in a Bode plot or a Nyquist plot.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{special case}} is when <b>the</b> load <b>impedance</b> {{is equal to}} <b>the</b> {{characteristic}} <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line (i.e. the line is matched), in which case <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> reduces to <b>the</b> characteristic <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line so thatfor all [...] and all [...]|$|R
50|$|In general, <b>the</b> {{iterative}} <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> port 1 is {{not equal}} to <b>the</b> iterative <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> port 2. They will be equal if {{the network is}} symmetrical, however physically symmetry is not {{a necessary condition for}} <b>the</b> <b>impedances</b> to be equal.|$|R
50|$|Generally in {{audio and}} hifi, <b>the</b> input <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> {{components}} is several times (technically, more than 10) <b>the</b> output <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device connected to them. This is called impedance bridging or voltage bridging.|$|R

The Prebendary of Cualan as at September 2011 is the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Revd M. G. St A. Jackson.|$|E
25|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, signal processing, {{and similar}} fields, signals that vary periodically {{over time are}} often described as a combination of sinusoidal functions (see Fourier analysis), and these are more conveniently expressed as the sum of exponential functions with imaginary exponents, using Euler's formula. Also, phasor analysis of circuits can include Euler's formula to represent <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> a capacitor or an inductor.|$|E
25|$|Slew rate is {{the maximum}} {{rate of change}} of the output, usually quoted in volts per second (or microsecond). Many {{amplifiers}} are ultimately slew rate limited (typically by <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> a drive current having to overcome capacitive effects {{at some point in}} the circuit), which sometimes limits the full power bandwidth to frequencies well below the amplifier's small-signal frequency response.|$|E
50|$|The {{connection}} between the two can further be seen by noting an alternative, but equivalent, definition <b>of</b> image <b>impedance.</b> In this definition, <b>the</b> image <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> a network is <b>the</b> input <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> an infinitely long chain of cascaded identical networks (with the ports arranged so that like impedance faces like). This is directly analogous to <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> characteristic <b>impedance</b> as <b>the</b> input <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> an infinitely long line.|$|R
50|$|In electronics, <b>impedance</b> {{matching}} is <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> designing <b>the</b> input <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> {{an electrical}} load or <b>the</b> output <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> its corresponding signal source {{to maximize the}} power transfer or minimize signal reflection from the load.|$|R

25|$|The G5RV Antenna is a {{dipole antenna}} with a {{symmetric}} feeder line, which {{also serves as}} a 1:1 impedance transformer allowing the transceiver to see <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> the antenna (it does not match the antenna to the 50-ohm transceiver. In fact the impedance will be somewhere around 90 ohms at the resonant frequency but significantly different at other frequencies).|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} used determine the substrate's dielectric constant. This constant is also dependent on frequency, usually decreasing with frequency. As this constant determines the signal propagation speed, frequency dependence introduces phase distortion in wideband applications; as flat dielectric constant vs frequency characteristics as achievable is important here. <b>The</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> transmission lines decreases with frequency, therefore faster edges of signals reflect more than slower ones.|$|E
25|$|The earth {{can be used}} as ground plane, but it is a poor conductor. The {{reflected}} antenna {{image is}} only clear at glancing angles (far from the antenna). At these glancing angles, electromagnetic fields and radiation patterns are the same as for a half-wave dipole. Naturally, <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> the earth is far inferior to that of a good conductor ground plane. This can be improved (at cost) by laying a copper mesh.|$|E

Ridge gap waveguides {{belongs to a}} new metamaterial-based waveguide technology for millimeter and submillimeter waves which emerged recently. A formula for <b>the</b> characteristic <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> an ideal PEC-over-PMC ridge gap waveguide has been derived.

40|$|A {{measurement}} set-up {{is presented}} containing a multichannel frequency response analyser {{system that allows}} <b>the</b> measurements <b>of</b> <b>impedance</b> spectra <b>of</b> single cells in a fuel cell stack simultaneously. As a proof of reliability, <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impedances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single cells is compared to <b>the</b> measured <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole stack. A good correlation was found. The absolute deviation is less than 2. 5 %. A measurement of the stack during low load operation is presented. Differences in the individual cell voltages are investigated. A flooding event in a single cell is observed by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> measurement minutes before the polarisation shows a voltage drop...|$|R
25|$|When {{there is}} an uneven {{distribution}} of cations and anions, {{there will be a}} small voltage called half-cell potential associated with the current. In the DC system that is used by the ECG and EEG instruments, the difference between the half-cell potential and the zero potential is shown as DC offset which is an undesirable characteristic. Silver/silver chloride is a popular choice of biological electrodes due to its low half-cell potential of approximately 220 mV and the lower of <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> the electrode by silver chloride.|$|E
25|$|In {{a slab of}} {{conventional}} material with an ordinary refractive index – a right-handed material (RHM) – the wave front is transmitted away from the source. In a NIM the wavefront travels toward the source. However, the magnitude {{and direction of the}} flow of energy essentially remains the same in both the ordinary material and the NIM. Since the flow of energy remains the same in both materials (media), <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> the NIM matches the RHM. Hence, the sign of the intrinsic impedance is still positive in a NIM.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to artifacts {{generated by the}} body, many artifacts originate from outside the body. Movement by the patient, or even just settling of the electrodes, may cause electrode pops, spikes originating from a momentary change in <b>the</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> a given electrode. Poor grounding of the EEG electrodes can cause significant 50 or 60nbsp&Hz artifact, depending on the local power system's frequency. A third source of possible interference can be {{the presence of an}} IV drip; such devices can cause rhythmic, fast, low-voltage bursts, which may be confused for spikes.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, <b>the</b> input <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> load network being {{connected}} and <b>the</b> output <b>impedance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source determines how the source current and voltage change i.e. {{the transfer function}} from the source to the input terminals of the circuit.|$|R
