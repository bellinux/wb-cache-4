5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the {{strategy}} of the Imperial Japanese Navy {{was based on the}} radical Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, as promoted by French military advisor and naval architect Emile Bertin. This emphasised cheap torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive, heavily armoured ships. The acquisition of two German-built s by the Imperial Chinese Beiyang Fleet in 1885 threatened Japan's interests in Korea. A visit by the Chinese warships to Japan in early 1891 forced the Japanese government <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> IJN required similarly armed and armoured ships of its own to counter the ironclads; the three lightly armoured s ordered from France would not suffice, despite their powerful guns. The IJN decided to order a pair of the latest battleships from the United Kingdom as Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships.|$|E

25|$|On 26 May 1886, a union {{committee}} went {{to several}} mine managers {{to propose that}} the $3 daily wage be restored to the lower-paid workers, but all the mine managers they spoke to refused. From the start, mine managers and owners took the position that they were meeting and negotiating with miners, and refused <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> miners were union representatives. A union committee again met {{with a group of}} mine managers on 19 June, and was again rebuffed, although some managers said that they would consider the idea. That evening, a union meeting attended by about 1,200 miners voted almost unanimously that all workers receiving $2.50 per day should go on strike. The strike began that night with the 11:30 shift change, and by the next day, 968 miners had walked out, shutting down a number of mines.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} critical autoethnography as {{an innovative}} approach to conducting research in marginalized, vulnerable communities. Combining autoethnography, ethnography, and critical pedagogy, the researcher becomes {{a participant in}} the study, turning inward to examine the Self and the complexities of cultural perspectives through the lens of critical pedagogy. Intense reflexivity and introspection undergird this study of Self as participant, going beyond recounting facts as objectively as possible, as occurs with autobiography, <b>to</b> <b>acknowledging</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> researcher is interpreting the facts through cultural perspectives formed through years of sociocultural, socio-historical, sociopolitical, and socioeconomic events and circumstances. Subsequently, the researcher, more than likely a member of the dominant culture in some categories is able to understand herself as an oppressor.  </p...|$|R

One of SSI's later games, Pursuit of the Graf Spee, uses an altered version of Computer Bismarcks core system.|$|E

Two months after Alfred's complaint to the NNC, CBS defended its people. Network vice-president Robert Chandler dismissed the bulk of Alfred's complaints as [...] "trivial, irrelevant or clearly represent matters of opinion or judgment".

After the meeting, Castro announced that ₡20 million (approximately US$40,000) would be allocated for a monument in Mora's honor in the form of either a new turtle observation area or an online tribute with video of nesting sea turtles. Castro also confirmed that the government had plans to turn Moín Beach into a protected park. However, the plan to name the park after Mora was abandoned at the request of his family.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we argue <b>that,</b> {{alongside}} <b>the</b> creation of functional tools, lithic manufacture embodied {{a range of}} sensory experiences and provided a means through which prehistoric people gained expression and negotiated social strategies. While traditional approaches to lithic scatters provide detailed information about the activities occurring at sites, new research on the social significance of sound {{in the context of}} lithic manufacture adds an important dimension to our interpretations. Using data from a Mesolithic site in Caithness, northern Scotland, we draw on techniques developed in auditory archaeology, in which sound is considered a dynamic source of information: a means by which people express themselves. Based on this premise, we discuss ways in which we can move beyond the physical transformation of lithic material, <b>to</b> <b>acknowledging</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> process of manufacture resulted in multiple experiences integral to daily life...|$|R
