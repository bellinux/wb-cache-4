5|$|Backbreaker is a simulation-style American {{football}} game, {{which allows}} the player {{to take control of}} a team of football players and compete against the CPU or another player in a variety of game modes. The game features 56 built-in teams plus three unlockable teams, and also allows the player to create 32 additional ones for a total of 91 possible teams. It lacks any licensing from the National Football League, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not able to negotiate a licensing agreement with the NFL or NFLPA Because of this, the developers emphasized the game's customization tools.|$|E

5000|$|During the five-century {{period of}} Ottoman rule in Bulgaria, the sultan was {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} [...] "tsar".

5|$|In 1939, a new {{radio network}} based at station WBN in Chicago, Illinois, begins its inaugural night. The station's owner, General Walt Whalen, depends on his {{employees}} to impress main sponsor Bernie King. This includes writer Roger Henderson, assistant director Penny Henderson (Roger's wife, seeking divorce), page boy Billy Budget, engineer Max Applewhite, conductor Rick Rochester, announcer Dexter Morris, director Walt Whalen, Jr. and stage manager Herman Katzenback. After King commissions rewrites {{on the radio}} scripts, the WBN writers get angry, adding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have not been paid in weeks.|$|E
5|$|Locomotive tenders {{were also}} changed as new, {{improved}} designs became available. Some {{examples of the}} second batch (70025–70029) were equipped with the BR1A tender, which had a higher water capacity of 5,000 gallons. Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another tender design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were intended for use on longer runs {{in the north of}} the railway network. This tender design also featured a steam-powered coal pusher, which eliminated the need for crew members to mount the tender to pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} the class entered British Railways service in 1948, and from 1955 23 of the U class {{received}} chimneys of the British Railways Standard Class 4 variety and replacement cylinders, which had become worn through intensive use. A few {{members of the}} class were given replacement frames at overhaul with a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and smokebox. During the early 1960s, the withdrawal of the ageing T9 class designed by Dugald Drummond saw the U class replacing them on services west of Exeter, though their large wheels offered little advantage on the steeper gradients that characterised this part of the railway network. The favoured form of 2-6-0 motive power west of Exeter was the smaller-wheeled N class, while heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid’s Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within the weight restrictions imposed in this area. The U class represented one of the less glamorous classes of passenger locomotive due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were used mainly on mixed-traffic and secondary passenger duties.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "high {{policing}}" [...] refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> such policing {{benefits the}} [...] "higher" [...] {{interests of the}} government rather than individual citizens or the mass population.

5|$|Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's {{vice-president}} of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell Home Pong, but were rejected. Retailers felt {{the product was}} too expensive and would not interest consumers. Atari contacted the Sears Sporting Goods department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed {{the game with a}} representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy trade fair in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not know that they needed a private showing.|$|E
5|$|Jane's legal husband, who {{was still}} living in London, {{attempted}} to blackmail her in 1838 by publishing {{the details of her}} marital status in Barnard Gregory's The Satirist. Johnson published the notice after learning that she was living with a Mr. Hogg. He was mistaken as to the identity of her lover, however, and attempted to blackmail James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly. After James Hogg prepared to bring a libel suit, Johnson quickly disappeared. Although one journalist initially planned to publish the correct identities of the parties involved, at Mary Shelley's request Leigh Hunt convinced him not to publish the story. Johnson died in Hammersmith in 1840, ensuring an end to the matter. Though they were now free to marry, Jane and Thomas declined to marry in order not to draw attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been unmarried for so long.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{saw little}} active service, in part owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were {{considered}} too large and thus too valuable to risk during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. The Ottoman fleet {{was placed in}} reserve for the following two decades, during which the four ships of the Osmaniye class were heavily rebuilt into more modern barbette ships. They were in poor condition by {{the outbreak of the}} Greco-Turkish War in 1897, like {{much of the rest of}} the fleet, and as a result saw no action during the war. The Navy considered rebuilding the ships for the second time in the early 1900s, but abandoned the idea due to their deteriorated state. As a result, the four ships were decommissioned in 1909 and Mahmudiye and Orhaniye were broken up in 1913, with Osmaniye and Aziziye remaining in the Navy's inventory until 1923, when they too were scrapped.|$|E

5|$|Only one runestone {{mentioning}} the Byzantine Empire {{has been found}} on Gotland. This may be due both <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> few rune stones were raised on Gotland in favour of image stones, as well as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Gotlanders dealt mainly in trade, paying a yearly tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Swedes for military protection.|$|R
5|$|The consul of the Roman Republic was {{the highest-ranking}} {{ordinary}} magistrate. Two consuls were elected {{for an annual}} term (from January through December) by the assembly of Roman soldiers, the Centuriate Assembly. After they were elected, they were granted imperium powers by the assembly. If a consul died before his term ended, another consul (the consul suffectus), was elected to complete the original consular term. Throughout the year, one consul was superior in rank to the other consul. This ranking flipped every month, between the two consuls. Once a consul's term ended, he held the honorary title of consulare {{for the rest of}} his time in the senate, and had to wait for ten years before standing for re-election to the consulship. Consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters, which was due, in part, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> held the highest ordinary grade of imperium (command) powers. While in the city of Rome, the consul was the head of the Roman government. While components of public administration were delegated to other magistrates, the management of the government was under the ultimate authority of the consul. The consuls presided over the Roman Senate and the Roman assemblies, and had the ultimate responsibility to enforce policies and laws enacted by both institutions. The consul was the chief diplomat, carried out business with foreign nations, and facilitated interactions between foreign ambassadors and the senate. Upon an order by the senate, the consul was responsible for raising and commanding an army. While the consuls had supreme military authority, they had to be provided with financial resources by the Roman Senate while they were commanding their armies. While abroad, the consul had absolute power over his soldiers, and over any Roman province.|$|E

50|$|The National Gallery of B&H {{was closed}} in September 2011 {{for almost a}} year due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{authorities}} were neglecting <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> resolve its status which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gallery was unable to appoint new director.
