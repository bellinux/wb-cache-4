Three Canadian cities have rapid transit systems, four have light rail systems, and three have {{commuter}} rail systems (see below). In 2006, 11% of Canadians used public transportation to get to work. This compares to 80.0% <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work using a car (72.3% by driving, 7.7% as a passenger), 6.4% that walked and 1.3% that rode a bike.|$|E

When Greg moved to drivetime, the feature was reinvented so that the two teams make music choices to be played between 17:15 and 17:45, the winning team, <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> play their choices, was chosen by listener vote. This feature ended when The Official Chart occupied the Friday show.|$|E

The difficulty of a winter ascent {{will be difficult}} to understand for people unfamiliar with Alaskan climbing, and nobody had successfully climbed any large Alaskan peak in winter until 1967, when Gregg Blomberg organized an expedition <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the top of Denali (Blomberg himself did not summit). This team lost one member {{and the rest of them}} almost died in a storm on the way down. Team member Art Davidson's book about the climb was named after that storm — Minus 148°.|$|E

25|$|With his vessels {{effectively}} trapped, Porter sent {{an urgent}} appeal {{for help to}} the Army, and then issued orders to his captains to prepare to destroy their ships rather than let them fall into enemy hands. The soldiers, with the personal prodding of Major General William T. Sherman, made a forced march <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the flotilla on March 22. They easily drove off the Confederate patrols that were blocking the retreat, so Porter and his vessels were able to move back into Steele's Bayou. By March 27, the entire expedition {{was back on the}} Mississippi, having accomplished nothing.|$|E
500|$|The first {{war ended}} in 1851, but would resume in 1864. During this interlude, Ernest fervently opposed the {{marriage}} of his nephew Albert Edward, Prince of Wales ('Bertie') to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, a daughter of the future Christian IX of Denmark (and therefore {{an enemy of the}} German states). He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests. Albert replied angrily [...] "What has <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do with you?... Vicky has racked her brains to help us to find someone, but in vain...We have no [...] choice". Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match, but as he could find no alternative bride, he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter (and outside the realm of government) was [...] "the only way to prevent a break with Prussia {{and the only way to}} keep the game in our own hands, impose the conditions that we think necessary, and as far as we can, take off its political edge". Albert also warned his son of Ernest's endeavors to interfere with the match, commenting, [...] "Your uncle...will try his hand at this work. Your best defence will be not to enter on the subject, should he broach it".|$|E
500|$|In December 1967, {{the group}} added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied {{with him at}} Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had {{performed}} at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set. Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of £30 per week (...) , and in January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member; the second guitarist and its fifth member, the band intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. Jenner commented: [...] "The idea was that Dave would... cover for [...] eccentricities and when <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be not workable, Syd {{was just going to}} write. Just to try to keep him involved". In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up [...] "Arnold Layne" [...] and [...] "See Emily Play", instead introduced [...] "Have You Got It Yet?" [...] to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photo-shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance.|$|E

2500|$|Benny would {{sometimes}} {{joke about the}} propriety of [...] "Love in Bloom" [...] as his theme song. On a segment often played in Tonight Show retrospectives, Benny talks with Johnny Carson about this. Benny {{says he has no}} objections to the song in and of itself, only as his theme. Proving his point, he begins reciting the lyrics slowly and deliberately: [...] "Can it be the trees. That fill the breeze. With rare and magic perfume. Now what the hell has <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do with me?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott's {{opinion was}} {{reinforced}} by Shackleton's experience on his Nimrod expedition <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> within [...] of the pole. Shackleton used ponies.

Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, Lawrence Oates, whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the amount}} of {{hand-held}} shooting required for the film, the producers and crew decided to shoot using the digital Red One 4K camera. Cinematographer Trent Opaloch used nine digital Red Ones owned by Peter Jackson for primary filming. According to HD Magazine, District 9 was shot on RED One cameras using build 15, Cooke S4 primes and Angenieux zooms. The documentary style and CCTV style cam footage was shot on the Sony EX1/EX3 XDCAM-HD. [...] Additionally, the post-production team was warned that the most RED Camera footage they could handle a day was {{about an hour and a}} half.

2500|$|In late December 1967, drummer Nick Mason {{approached}} Gilmour {{and asked}} him if he would be interested in joining Pink Floyd. He accepted and soon afterward became their fifth member; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a non-performing songwriter. One of the group's business partners, Peter Jenner, commented: [...] "The idea was that Dave would... cover for Barrett's eccentricities and when <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved". By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult, so Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and Andrew King to discuss the situation. During the meeting, Barrett agreed to leave the band and the others committed to moving on without him. Waters later admitted: [...] "He was our friend, {{but most of the time}} we now wanted to strangle him". Jenner and King, who believed Barrett to be the creative genius of the band, decided to represent him and end their partnership with Pink Floyd.|$|E
2500|$|Prescott {{explained}} Swope's {{methods in}} a 1997 interview: [...] "What Martin did ... was tape {{something that was}} going on live, manipulate it, and send it back in (via the soundboard) as a sort of new instrument. You couldn't predict exactly how it would sound, and <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be the really fun thing I think we all liked. We wanted to play this hammer-down drony noise stuff, but we also wanted another sound in there." [...] Swope's tapework ranged from subtle and nearly subaural (such as the quiet shifting feedback sounds in Conley's [...] "That's When I Reach For My Revolver"), to prominent and even jarring (such as the high-pitched two-note squeal in Miller's [...] "Red"). Journalist Michael Azerrad later wrote: [...] "A lot of people never knew about Swope's contribution and were mystified by how the musicians onstage could wring such amazing phantom sounds from their instruments." [...] Though his contribution is widely considered an integral part of Burma's sound, Swope very rarely appeared onstage, only occasionally appearing to play second guitar during encores.|$|E

2500|$|While {{still playing}} in South Africa, he joined Sussex in 2005 as an {{overseas}} player for the English season playing in 17 matches altogether. He then joined his second English county in 2007 playing for Northamptonshire, but didn't finish {{the season after}} being called up by South Africa for the World Twenty20, and he was replaced by Nicky Boje (who next year became captain). The next year his was signed as a Kolpak player, however just before the season started he was banned by the ECB for playing in the Indian Cricket League (IPL) alongside four other players including Northampton's new signing Andrew Hall. A month later after an appeal, he and Hall were allowed to play again, a spokesman {{said it was a}} [...] "unlawful, unreasonable, capricious and discriminatory" [...] ban. During that year, Johan recorded his best first class figures of 7/60 and took 43 wicket altogether that season. In 2009, he was an important team member of the Northants Steelbacks Twenty20 Cup squad <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the finals day at Edgbaston. During the group stages he won the match against Worcestershire Royals scoring the 22 needed in the last over that kept Northamptonshire's winning run going. That season proved to be Johan's best season at Northants as he took over 50 first class wickets and scored just under 500 runs. Van der Wath and Riki Wessels were unable to play for the county in the 2010 season.|$|E
