25|$|Early 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw {{objects as}} {{perceived}} within an environment {{according to all}} of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of perception—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It {{is based on the}} here and now, and in the way things are seen. Images can be divided into figure or ground. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is perceived at first glance: the figure in front, or the background.|$|E
25|$|Since 1972, {{however, the}} U.K. has fallen under the cross-border-competition law regime of the European Community, which is found {{primarily}} in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of the European Community. Companies that form a cartel or collude to disrupt competition (Article 81) or to abuse a dominant {{position in the}} market – for instance through a monopoly (Article 82) – face fines from the public-enforcement authorities, {{and in some cases}} they also face a cause of action in tort. A huge issue in the E.U. is whether to follow the U.S. approach of private damages actions to prevent anti-competitive conduct. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> should be seen as a private wrong (as was held in the vertical restraints case of Courage Ltd v Crehan) and what should be seen as a public wrong where only public enforcers are competent to impose penalties. In 1998 the United Kingdom brought its legislation up to date, with the Competition Act 1998, followed by the Enterprise Act 2002, a regime mirroring that of the European Union. The domestic enforcers are the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission.|$|E
500|$|As Michael Robertson and Garry Walter suppose, {{psychiatric}} {{power in}} practically all societies expands {{on the grounds}} of public safety, which, {{in the view of the}} leaders of the USSR, was best maintained by the repression of dissidence. According to Gwen Adshead, a British forensic psychotherapist at the Broadmoor Hospital, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is meant by the word [...] "abnormal." [...] Evidently it is possible for abnormal to be identified as [...] "socially inappropriate." [...] If that is the case, social and political dissent is turned into a symptom by the medical terminology, and thereby becomes an individual's personal problem, not a social matter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{of several}} probability puzzles {{related to the}} Monty Hall problem is Bertrand's box paradox, posed by Joseph Bertrand in 1889 in his Calcul des probabilités (Barbeau 1993). In this puzzle there are three boxes: a box containing two gold coins, a box with two silver coins, and a box with one of each. After choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random {{that happens to be}} a gold coin, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is the probability that the other coin is gold. As in the Monty Hall problem the intuitive answer is , but the probability is actually [...]|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> are {{the ways}} in which peasant music is taken over and becomes transmuted into modern music? We may, for instance, take over a peasant melody {{unchanged}} or only slightly varied, write an accompaniment to it and possibly some opening and concluding phrases. This kind of work would show a certain analogy with Bach's treatment of chorales.... Another method... is the following: the composer does not make use of a real peasant melody but invents his own imitation of such melodies. There is no true difference between this method and the one described above.... There is yet a third way... Neither peasant melodies nor imitations of peasant melodies can be found in his music, but it is pervaded by the atmosphere of peasant music. In this case we may say, he has completely absorbed the idiom of peasant music which has become his musical mother tongue.|$|E
