50|$|The British and Germans shared {{similar and}} differing {{experiences}} as POWs. The Continental Congress' policies {{on the treatment}} of POWs remained {{the same for all}} enemy combatants, so the prisoner system was generally the same for the two nationalities. However, the British troops were valued more than the German mercenaries, so <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> examples of British prisoner exchanges than German prisoner exchanges. Americans grew to hate the British prisoners more than the Germans. German prisoners were much less ill-behaved than the British. The British were more likely to cause disturbances, get into fights, and oppose the guards and the militia, and this was because they were more invested in the defeat of the Americans than the Germans were.|$|E

50|$|The first movement, Molto moderato, the {{original}} melody is {{repeated three times}} without not much variation and a coda at the end. The mode of this melody comes from the Dorian mode scale on C, but the accompaniment plays unrelated triad chords, all of them derived from melody notes. In the second movement, Molto capriccioso, the main melody is repeated also three times, but here, even though it shares its Dorian mode on C, there are fragments written in Mixolydian mode, its rhythm is much more syncopated, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> sudden tempo changes and {{it is much more}} dissonant than the first. The third movement, Lento rubato, is polytonal. The fourth, Allegretto scherzando, is a very quick scherzo-like movement.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the turn}} of the 21st century, {{comprehension}} lessons usually consist of students answering teachers' questions, writing responses to questions on their own, or both. [...] The whole group version of this practice also often included [...] "Round-robin reading", wherein teachers called on individual students to read a portion of the text. In {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, evidence accumulated that the read-test methods were more successful assessing rather than teaching comprehension.

5000|$|Winstanley was Trinitarian, but {{cautioned that}} {{a rule that}} held true only in the New Testament {{in all but the}} disputed cases was too flimsy a ground on which to try to prove the divinity of Christ to the Socinians (Unitarians). Instead he said, [...] "think <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> cogent {{arguments}} in reserve, when Sharp's rule of interpretation shall be abandoned." [...] His biggest criticisms of Sharp's rule rest in the fact that 1) the early church fathers do not follow it and 2) the early church father's never invoked this rule to prove the divinity of Christ (though it would have been an obvious tool against such heresy). He concludes, [...] "Hence it may be presumed that the doctrine then rested on other grounds." ...|$|E
