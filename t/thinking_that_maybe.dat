25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E
500|$|However, Ryan Book of Music Times, {{was less}} {{critical}} with his review: [...] " [...] {{took a break}} from colorful music videos {{to make a statement}} of racial relations... the song uses a less clear sample than the other tracks, but interpolates his words into the electronic breakdown {{at the end of the}} song". Marc Robisch of Thought Catalog felt that [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] is [...] "one of the most interesting out of any on Love. Angel. Music. Baby.", further adding that the outro of the song resembles the work of M.I.A.. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was mixed with his review, stating that the song [...] "is a jarring buzz kill – and that's what's appealing about L.A.M.B., even if it such a shallow celebration of fleeting style and outdated bling-bling culture, it can grate". [...] A review from Traxionary described [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] as [...] "a plea for interracial love–or the tolerant embrace of it–the central contention that [...] "beauty" [...] can be [...] "black or white/yellow or green"". In an extremely positive review of the track, Mike Usinger writing for The Georgia Straight, claimed that [...] " [...] a surprisingly soulful duet with Andre 3000, Stefani has come up with the kind of solo album that gets singers <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> they don't need a backing band at all," [...] referencing Stefani's time spent with No Doubt.|$|E

5000|$|Henry said {{producer}} Patrick McCarthy, who {{had worked}} with U2 and Robbie Robertson, helped reshape his approach to songwriting and production. [...] "When you begin a career in music, people hear where you are and assume that that's all you are. And if you're not careful, you might start assuming the same thing. I did, for a while, hear my 'voice' as a writer, producer and singer, and believe it was all that was available to me. And it's funny in retrospect to think that I could have been frustrated to the point of quitting without <b>thinking</b> first <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> I just ought to learn a new way to work. But once someone put my nose in it—that someone being my new co-producer Patrick McCarthy—I felt liberated for the first time; the recording process now becoming as much 'a process' as writing had always been.|$|R
40|$|The {{general view}} of the {{construction}} process {{is that it is}} an ordered, linear phenomenon, which can be organized, planned and managed top down. The frequent failures to complete construction projects on budget and schedule give rise to a <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> the process <b>maybe</b> not is as ordered and predictable in its nature as it may look. A closer examination reveals that construction is indeed a complex, nonlinear and dynamic phenomenon, which often ex-ists on the edge of chaos. The paper introduces the world of complex systems and examines construction in this perspective, and by that it proposes several new elements to the understanding of project management. ...|$|R

[...] After arriving in St. Louis, Asher {{fell in love with}} both Jean-Claude and Anita, but feared that they could not love him fully, either because of his scars or because of their feelings for each other. [...] Recently, he has accepted that both Jean-Claude and Anita love him for himself, although he is unwilling to be restricted to one-way monogamy with Anita, resulting in a longtime dalliance with Narcissus. (Many of Jean-Claude's vampires, and even Anita herself, assume that they have an affair but this relationship is denied by both of them.

Obama rejected the offer outright by noting [...] "With all due respect. I won twice as many states as Sen. Clinton. I've won more of the popular vote than Sen. Clinton. I have more delegates than Sen. Clinton. So, I don't know how somebody who's in second place is offering vice presidency to the person who's in first place". Obama stated that the nomination process {{would have to be a}} choice between himself and Clinton, saying [...] "I don't want anybody here <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> 'Somehow, <b>maybe</b> I can get both'", by nominating Clinton as president and assuming he would be her running mate". Some suggested that it was a ploy by the Clinton campaign to denigrate Obama as less qualified for the presidency. Later, when Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee, former President Jimmy Carter cautioned against Clinton being picked for the vice president slot on the ticket, saying [...] "I think it would be the worst mistake that could be made. That would just accumulate the negative aspects of both candidates", citing opinion polls showing 50% of US voters with a negative view of Hillary Clinton.|$|R

[...] "I don't know how somebody who is in second place is offering the vice presidency to somebody who is in first place", he said. He told supporters in Columbus, Mississippi, that Clinton's VP suggestion was an example of what he called [...] "the old okey-doke", further stating that the Clinton camp was trying to [...] "bamboozle" [...] or [...] "hoodwink" [...] voters., Biloxi Sun Herald, March 10, 2008 Obama wondered aloud why the Clinton campaign believed him competent for the vice presidency, but said he was [...] "not ready" [...] to be president.

Then the onward ride again, until all faded away into a dull mist and he knew no more. When next he woke it was with the pungent smell of burned vinegar in his nostrils and with the feeling of a cool napkin bathing his brow. He opened his eyes and then closed them again, thinking he must have been in a dream, for he lay in his old room at the peaceful monastery of the White Cross on the hill; the good Father Abbot sat near by, gazing upon his face with the old absent student look, Brother John sat in the deep window seat also gazing at him, and Brother Theodore, the leech of the monastery, sat beside him bathing his head. Beside these old familiar faces were the faces of those who had been with him in that long flight; the One-eyed Hans, old Master Nicholas his kinsman, and the others. So he closed his eyes, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> it was all a dream. But the sharp throbbing of the poor stump at his wrist soon taught him that he was still awake.|$|E
