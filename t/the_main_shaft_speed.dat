40|$|Most wind {{turbines}} use planetary gearboxes {{to transform the}} relatively low rotational <b>speed</b> of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> into higher <b>speeds</b> required for power generation. Because of excessive service load, inappropriate operating conditions or simply end of life time, fault can occur in wind turbine planetary gearbox components. When a fault, either distributed or localized, is incurred, the stiffness and consequently vibration characteristics of the defected component will vary. A possible non-destructive technique for fault detection and severity assessment {{can be derived from}} vibration signal analysis. This paper presents the use of vibration analysis in the detection, quantification, and advancement monitoring of fault incurred by wind turbine gearbox components. Eac...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{determine}} the drag characteristics and the torque of three C-section blades wind car. Three C-section blades are directly connected to wheels by using of various kinds of links. Gears are used to convert the wind energy to mechanical energy to overcome the load exercised on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> under low <b>speed.</b> Previous work on three vertical blades wind car resulted in discrepancies when compared to this work. Investigating these differences was the motivation for this series of work. The calculated values were compared to the data of three vertical blades wind car. The work was conducted in a low wind speed. The drag force acting on each model was calculated with an airflow velocity of 4 m/s and angular velocity of the blade of 13. 056 rad/s...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} reveal and {{investigate}} important drivetrain dynamics {{in relation to}} offshore wind turbines. Emphasis is placed on drivetrains of the spar-type floating wind turbines (FWTs). FWTs are proposed {{to be used for}} offshore wind power extraction at the deeper-water sites where fixed foundations are economically infeasible. The FWT is a complex machine that is subjected to tough offshore environmental conditions and access for maintenance, repair and overhaul is limited and expensive. It is therefore important to understand the FWT drivetrain because gearbox failures have consistently plagued the wind energy industry and {{have not been able to}} reach the 20 year design life. Moreover, gearbox failures often result in massive downtime. Some industry players have even labelled the gearbox as the ’missing link’. There is a need for new insight into the understanding of drivetrain dynamics from an offshore perspective in order to improve its design and better predict its life. The findings in this thesis contribute to the de-risking process of offshore wind. The drivetrain and wind turbine from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) Gearbox Reliability Collaborative (GRC) project are used as the case studies. There are three main topics in this thesis. In the first topic, the modelling of the planet carrier is investigated in detail. The study is performed in two parts. First, the influence of subcomponents mated to the planet carrier in the gearbox assembly is investigated in detail. These components consist of the planet pins, bearings and <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> In <b>the</b> second part of the study, the flexible body modelling of the planet carrier for use in multi-body simulations is examined through the use of condensed finite element and multi-body simulation models. The second topic is the collaborative work with NREL which compared the multi-body models with the measurements taken from the GRC test campaigns. Data from the planetary stage is used to evaluate the accuracy and computation time of numerical models of the gearbox. A set of models that represent different levels of fidelity are established and compared to the measurement test results. The last topic, which is also <b>the</b> <b>main</b> topic, deals with the modelling and analysis of the FWT drivetrain. Various spar platforms with different drafts in the spar buoys and mooring line designs for the GRC wind turbine are specially designed for this purpose. A decoupled solution is used, i. e., the drivetrain is assumed to have no feedback on the rotor. Global aero-hydro-elastic-servo simulations are performed and <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> loads, generator <b>speed</b> and nacelle motions are calculated. These are used as inputs to a multi-body drivetrain model. Comparisons of the FWT and the land-based wind turbine (WT) are performed. Detailed sensitivity studies of the influences of the design parameters on the drivetrain loads and other wind turbine component loads are also performed.

40|$|Shaft {{fracture}} at {{an early}} stage of operation is a common problem for a certain type of wind turbine. To determine the cause of shaft failure a series of experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the chemical composition and mechanical properties. A detail analysis involving macroscopic feature and microstructure analysis of the material of the shaft was also performed to have an in depth knowledge of the cause of fracture. The experimental tests and analysis results show that there are no significant differences in the material property of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> when comparing it with the Standard, EN 10083 - 3 : 2006. The results show that stress concentration on the shaft surface close to the critical section of the shaft due to rubbing of the annular ring and coupled with high stress concentration caused by the change of inner diameter of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> reasons that result in fracture of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> In addition, inhomogeneity of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> micro-structure also accelerates up the fracture process of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> theoretical calculation of equivalent stress {{at the end of the}} shaft was performed, which demonstrate that cracks can easily occur under the action of impact loads.
