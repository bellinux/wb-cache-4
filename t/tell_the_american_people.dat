5000|$|The climax {{is reached}} as Catherwood's {{return from a}} {{flashback}} is bungled, resulting in the duplication of every character except Lieutenant Bradshaw. Just as Danger is about to try something daring {{to solve this problem}} and extricate himself from his trap, the action is abruptly interrupted by a special news bulletin, in which President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Bergman) wearily <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> of <b>the</b> attack on Pearl Harbor. He declares our [...] "rendezvous with destiny" [...] demands the United States [...] "unconditionally surrender" [...] to the Empire of Japan.

You may say this is just a coincidence, but there was another fellow that we were also going to interview, and he was killed in a plane crash. Jerry, are these coincidences? I dont think so."When asked about the spot, Matrisciana admitted he was not a reporter and replied [...] "I doubt our lives were actually ever in any real danger. That was Jerrys idea to do that ... He thought that would be dramatic." ...|$|R

In the United States however, where it aired on some PBS channels, [...] "The Africans" [...] drew {{a great amount of}} scrutiny for being allegedly anti-western. According to critics, [...] "The Africans" [...] blames too many of Africa’s problems on the negative influences of Europe and America, and the loudest criticisms came for the portrayal of Muammar el-Qaddafi as a virtuous leader.The loudest critic of the documentary series was Lynne Cheney who was, at that time, the chairman of the National Endowment on the Humanities. The endowment had put $600,000 toward the funding of [...] "The Africans" [...] and Lynne Cheney felt that Mazrui had not held to the conditions on which the endowment had granted the funding. Cheney said that she was promised a variety of interviews presenting different sides of the story, and was outraged when there were no such interviews in the show. Lynne Cheney demanded that the National Endowment on the Humanities’ name and logo be removed from the credits. She also had the words [...] "A Commentary" [...] added to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> version of <b>the</b> series, alongside Ali Mazrui’s credits.In defense of [...] "The Africans" [...] and its apparent anti-western bias, Mazrui made the statement [...] "I was invited by PBS and <b>the</b> BBC to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> and British <b>people</b> about the African people, a view from the inside. I am surprised, then, that people are disappointed not to get an American view. An effort was made to be fair but not to sound attractive to Americans." [...] Ward Chamberlain the president of WETA, who co-produced [...] "The Africans", also stepped in to publicly defend the series and Mazrui saying that, in a fair <b>telling</b> of history, <b>the</b> western world shouldn’t be expected to come out looking good from the African perspective.|$|R
