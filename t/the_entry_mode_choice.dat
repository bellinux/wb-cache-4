40|$|In {{the decade}} since China gained {{membership}} to the World Trade Organisation {{the number of}} Chinese multinational enterprises (MNEs) has risen dramatically. Yet despite foreign direct investment (FDI) and entry mode choice being among the most researched topics {{in the field of}} international business, there are relatively few studies that apply this knowledge to the case of Chinese firms. In order to contribute to this small but growing body of literature, this study analyses the determining factors of <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choice</b> between wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS) and joint-venture (JV). The subject matter is addressed using an empirical, explanatory approach which follows the process of deduction throughout. Building on two leading theoretical perspectives, the institution and resource-based views, hypotheses are developed to test the impact of cultural distance and country risk upon <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choice</b> of Chinese firms. Through the collection of secondary data, a sample of 33 Chinese companies and 87 entry mode decisions were observed and subjected to binomial logistic regression analyses. The study, employing data from 2009 - 2011, represents the most up to date in the field of research. To the extent that the results depart from conventional wisdom, cultural distance and country risk were shown not exert a significant influence on entry mode choice. The results do however appear to give further credence to the view that Chinese firms exhibit unique characteristics that differ substantially from their counterparts in more developed countries. In this respect the development of the institution-based view will hold substantial value to both theoreticians and practitioners of Chinese international business (IB) ...|$|E

40|$|Based on the institution-based view, {{this thesis}} investigates {{the effects of}} {{subnational}} institutional environments within a host country on foreign direct investment decisionsand the performance of foreign affiliates. Subnational institutional environments refer {{to the rules of}} the game of a society in a subnational region, shaping the manners of individual and organizational activities in the region. I focus on two aspects ofsubnational institutional environments, the level of subnational institutional development and legitimating actors’ cognition of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in a subnational region, and then develop three studies examining the influences of subnational institutional environments on <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choices</b> of multinational corporations (MNCs), the performance of foreign affiliates, and the subsequent expansions of foreign affiliates. The first study proposes that the levels of subnational economic, political and social institutional development have positive effects on MNCs to take wholly owned subsidiaries (WOSs) at <b>the</b> time of <b>entry,</b> while <b>the</b> high level of acceptance in legitimating actors’ cognition of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries also encourages MNCs to choose WOSs as <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> <b>modes.</b> <b>The</b> influences of the two aspects of subnational institutional environments on <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choices</b> of MNCs vary in degree. The second study examines the independent and relative influences of the levels of subnational economic, political and social institutional development on the level of and variation in foreign affiliate performance. The third study hypothesizes that the subsequent expansions of foreign affiliates within a subnational region are contingent onboth the levels of subnational economic, political and social institutional development and the affiliates’ relative performance to their aspiration levels. The poor performance feedback stimulates a foreign affiliate to take advantage of high levels of subnational political and social institutional development for changing the current situation via expanding the operational size within a subnational region. Drawing from the foreign-invested firms positing in different subnational regions of a large institutional transition economy, China, I test hypothesized relationships based on a measurement of subnational institutional development that captures economic, political and social institutional conditions of subnational regions within the country.

40|$|Abstract Internationalisation {{has become}} the major topic for both {{scholars}} and practitioners in recent years. Different with the business conditions in the previous decades, MNEs from the developing nations have become major power of outward FDI activities. Over the years of development, China has not only been regarded as the most attracting FDI inward place for foreign investors, but also it {{has become the}} important player in the FDI outward activities. Theoretically, a great number of studies have been conducted to identify the motives behind the FDI outward activities of MNEs from emerging markets such as China. As majority of emerging MNEs use acquisitions or strategic alliances with the well-established brands in the developed markets, the aim {{of this study is to}} explore the key determinants for <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choices</b> between <b>the</b> alliances and the acquisition. To this end, this study conducts the case study of two successful Chinese international brands, the Lenovo and the TCL, with a focus on their <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> strategy in <b>the</b> US and the European market. The study identifies eight factors that greatly affect the choices between the acquisition and the alliances for these two case companies. Under such conditions, <b>the</b> best suitable <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choices</b> for <b>the</b> emerging MNEs seems to be determined by the intangible assets, the industrial similarities between China and the target host country, the industrial growth, the transaction cost, partner size, company's international experience, capital intensity, the market size and preference.

40|$|The study {{over the}} South Korean asset {{management}} industry {{has not been}} comprehensively conducted in terms of breadth and depth. More foreign financial institutions (FFIs) are being involved in this market due to its potential growth. In particular, the current regulatory reform implemented by Korean government is expected to bring a major revamp in Korean financial industry including asset management industry. In this aspect, this case study aims to provide the most updated snapshot of Korean asset management industry (AMI), with a particular focus given on <b>the</b> FFI <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choice</b> and <b>the</b> potential effect {{of the most recent}} regulatory reform on FFI's internationalization strategy. The data collected from various channels indicated that <b>the</b> <b>entries</b> of FFIs in Korean AMI gradually increased from 1997 to 2007. It is interpreted that the local government's regulatory reforms resulted in such an increase of FFI's market entry to Korean AMI. FFI market entry was encouraged in 2004 when local government released further deregulation proposal of FISCMA when IIAMBA was already in force. The data also demonstrate that FFIs preferred to enter Korean AMI using partnering mode more than buying and building during the period. However, from year 2004 to 2007, annual entry of FFIs increased but FFIs did not show any specific preference on <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choice.</b> This research also found out that a linkage exists between internationalization of FFIs and financial deregulation in Korean AMI. Such regulatory reform also delivers an important message to FFIs which plan to exploit this bonanza. When FISCMA takes effect in Korean AMI, <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> barrier becomes lower, and the possibility of consolidation with other financial institutions (both AMCs and non-AMCs) increases which in turn will make the market more competitive. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> of FFIs is predicted to increase and <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choices</b> of FFIs more diversified. Secondly, a FFI is likely to face a decision about consolidation with domestic AMCs or other non-AMC financial institutions. Thirdly, the increased competition led by the regulatory reform is expected to bring Wimbledon effect, which is likely to bring a consequence of the market dominance by FFIs.
