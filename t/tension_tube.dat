40|$|Two-phase gas-liquid flows are {{expected}} to occur in many future space operations. Due {{to a lack of}} buoyancy in the microgravity environment, two-phase flows are known to behave differently than those in earth gravity. Despite these concerns, little research has been conducted on microgravity two-phase flow and the current understanding is poor. This dissertation describes an experimental and modeling study of the characteristics of two-phase flows in microgravity. An experiment was operated onboard NASA aircraft capable of producing short periods of microgravity. In addition to high speed photographs of the flows, electronic measurements of void fraction, liquid film thickness, bubble and wave velocity, pressure drop and wall shear stress were made {{for a wide range of}} liquid and gas flow rates. The effects of liquid viscosity, surface <b>tension</b> and <b>tube</b> diameter on the behavior of these flows were also assessed. From the data collected, maps showing the occurrence of various flow patterns as a function of gas and liquid flow rates were constructed. Earth gravity two-phase flow models were compared to the results of the microgravity experiments and in some cases modified. Models were developed to predict the transitions on the flow pattern maps. Three flow patterns, bubble, slug and annular flow, were observed in microgravity. These patterns were found to occur in distinct regions of the gas-liquid flow rate parameter space. The effect of liquid viscosity, surface <b>tension</b> and <b>tube</b> diameter on the location of the boundaries of these regions was small. Void fraction and Weber number transition criteria both produced reasonable transition models. Void fraction and bubble velocity for bubble and slug flows were found to be well described by the Drift-Flux model used to describe such flows in earth gravity. Pressure drop modeling by the homogeneous flow model was inconclusive for bubble and slug flows. Annular flows were found to be complex systems of ring-like waves and a substrate film. Pressure drop was best fitted with the Lockhart- Martinelli model. Force balances suggest that droplet entrainment may be a large component of the total pressure drop...|$|R

Little knowledge is currently available for conditions that determine the diameter of myelin figures and their degree of multilamellarity. Examining more than 300 samples, we realized that there are distinct populations of myelin figures protruding from discrete regions of lipid stack. Each population contains myelin figures with similar diameters. This indicates a direct relationship between local characteristics of parent lipid stack and the diameter of myelin figures.

Such string causes inhomogeneous decay of the false vacuum to the true vacuum via rapid expansion of the radius of the tube and hence its formation would be inconsistent with the present Universe. However, we demonstrate that there exist metastable solutions which do not expand rapidly. Furthermore, when the true vacua are degenerate, the structure inside the tube becomes involved.

40|$|The tubular {{morphology}} of intracellular membranous compartments {{is actively}} maintained through interactions with motor proteins and the cytoskeleton. Moving along cytoskeletal elements, motor proteins exert {{forces on the}} membranes {{to which they are}} attached, resulting in the formation of membrane tubes and tubular networks. To study the formation of membrane tubes by motor proteins, we developed an in vitro assay consisting of purified kinesin proteins directly linked to the lipids of giant unilamellar vesicles. When the vesicles are brought into contact with a network of immobilized microtubules, membrane tubes and tubular networks are formed. Through systematic variation of the kinesin concentration and membrane composition we study the mechanism involved. We show that a threshold concentration of motor proteins is needed and that a low membrane <b>tension</b> facilitates <b>tube</b> formation. Forces involved in tube formation were measured directly with optical tweezers and are shown to depend only on the tension and bending rigidity of the membrane. The forces were found to be higher than can be generated by individual motor proteins, indicating that multiple motors were working together to pull tubes. We propose a simple mechanism by which individual motor proteins can dynamically associate into clusters that provide the force needed for the formation of tubes, explaining why, in contrast to earlier findings [Roux, A., Cappello, G., Cartaud, J., Prost, J., Goud, B. & Bassereau, P.

40|$|The Casimir scaling {{phenomena}} of the nonperturbative force is viewed {{in terms of}} the hadronic flux tube as described by the dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory, the dual superconducting scenario of confinement. The ratios of the string <b>tension</b> of flux <b>tube</b> between higher and fundamental SU(3) representations, d_D≡σ_D/σ_D= 3, are systematically studied in a Weyl symmetric formulation of the DGL theory {{as a function of the}} Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter, κ≡ m_χ/m_B, the mass ratio between monopoles m_χ and dual gauge bosons m_B. While the ratios d_D satisfy a simple flux counting rule in the case of Bogomol'nyi limit (κ= 1), systematic deviation from this appears as increasing κ, which can be understood as a result of self interaction between fundamental flux inside a higher dimensional flux tube. In spite of the Abelian nature of the DGL theory, the ratio of string tension is not only far from the Abelian scaling, but even consistent with the Casimir scaling. This result suggests that not only the group theoretical factor but also dynamical mechanism, such as the flux-tube formation can become a possible origin of the "Casimir scaling" phenomena suggested by lattice QCD simulations...|$|R

Moreover, the tubes pulled by nonprocessive motors exhibit rich dynamics as compared to those pulled by their processive counterparts. We report distinct phases of persistent growth, retraction, and an intermediate regime characterized by highly dynamic switching between the two.

The model is originally inspired from three simple theoretical indications including: treating baryons as a two body {{system with a}} diquark and quark connected by a flux tube, thereby indicating that they lie on Regge trajectories; allowing for independent combinations of diquark and quark to enumerate the observed trajectories; and that spin-flavor symmetric diquarks are more massive than their stisymmetric counterparts. With this framework essentially all hadrons can be consistently organized confirming the first three hypotheses and elucidating new ones, including: a universal slope or flux <b>tube</b> <b>tension</b> for both baryons and mesons implying the same color-charge at the flux tube ends, small spin forces external to diquarks, {{and the existence of}} tunneling effects.

The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate SPR of the head in respect to effective doses, the influence of dose-reduction measures, and comparison with conventional x-ray. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Entrance doses for default and minimal settings were measured on a LightSpeed Ultra CT scanner and on conventional x-ray equipment. Effective doses for different scanning fields of the head were calculated for an adult, a 10 -year-old child, and a neonate by using the commercially available software PCXMC. RESULTS: Depending on projection and technique, SPR effective doses for adults were 1. 9 – 27. 7 Sv; for the 10 -year-old child, 2. 1 – 31. 1 Sv; and for the neonate, 5. 2 – 97. 2 Sv. Doses with the tube under the table were 1. 3 – 3. 4 times lower. Doses for conventional radiography were higher than SPR doses for adults and partially lower for children.

40|$|Following {{theoretical}} and {{experimental studies of}} multi-axial creep fracture with particular reference to the behaviour of copper at 250 °C, a polycrystalline model simulating grain boundary cavitation is examined. In the model, a modified form of Kachanov's damage concept is combined with the Hull and Rimmer vacancy diffusion mechanism to yield a novel rate equation that is critically sensitive to the spacing between cavities. Adoption of various relationships between spacing and applied stress is shown to permit prediction of various stress criteria for creep failure time. The model also incorporates equations expressing the equilibrium of forces at grain boundaries, and compatibility of the displacements arising from mass transfer at cavities. With the aid of numerical integration, these equations show the model behaviour to be relatively insensitive to grain geometry, material properties, and initial and final states of damage, although marked changes in grain shape or ultimate strength can significantly change fracture times. Experimentally, fracture times for copper tested at 250 °C in uniaxial tension, biaxial <b>tension</b> and torsion (<b>tube</b> and disc specimens) {{are found to be}} a power function of maximum principal applied stress. Model simulation of these fracture times is demonstrated on the adoption of a simple expression, relating void spacing to maximum principal applied stress, suggested by metallographic examination of tapered tensile specimens subsequent to creep tests. Apart from wide variations observed in the damage at any given stage of creep, the main microstructural features of cavitation under steady load are also well simulated. For prediction, the spacing-stress relationship is found inadequate on two counts: it cannot be independently determined by metallo-graphic techniques with sufficient accuracy, and it is inconsistent with the behaviour of tensile specimens briefly preloaded at twice the creep stress...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{some aspects}} of the {{recently}} uncovered connection between gauge theories and gravity, known as the AdS /CFT, or bulk-boundary, correspondence. This is a remarkable statement of equivalence between string or M-theory on certain backgrounds and field theories living on the boundaries of the corresponding spacetimes. Under the duality between four-dimensional N = 4 SU (N) superYang-Mills (SYM) and Type IIB string theory on AdS 5 × S 5, a baryon is mapped onto N fundamental strings terminating on a wrapped D 5 -brane. We examine the structure and energetics of this system {{from the vantage point of}} the fivebrane worldvolume action, making use of the Born-Infeld string approach. We construct supersymmetric fivebrane embeddings which correspond to gauge theory configurations with n external quarks, 0 ≤ n ≤ N. The extension of these solutions to the full asymptotically flat geometry of N D 3 -branes provides a detailed description of the creation of strings as the fivebrane is dragged across the threebranes. We also study baryon configurations in large N non-supersymmetric gauge theories. Using the D 5 -brane worldvolume theory in the near-horizon geometry of non-extremal D 3 -branes, we find embeddings which describe baryonic states in three-dimensional QCD. In particular, we construct solutions corresponding to a baryon made of N quarks, where a fraction ν of these quarks are pulled away from the rest, drawing out a confining color flux <b>tube.</b> The <b>tension</b> of this <b>tube</b> is found to display a nontrivial ν-independence. A similar picture, based on D 4 -branes, is developed for the four-dimensional case. Finally, we analyse the correspondence between strings in AdS space and external charges in N = 4 SYM. Specifically, by examining fluctuations sustained by such strings, we are able to obtain the radiation field produced by oscillating quarks in the strongly-coupled gauge theory. In addition, we determine the static fields produced by a baryon and a quark-antiquark pair in the non-confining theory...|$|R
40|$|Electromechanical {{resonators}} of {{a proposed}} type would comprise single carbon nanotubes suspended between electrodes (see Figure 1). Depending on the nanotube length, diameter, and tension, these devices will resonate at frequencies in a range from megahertz through gigahertz. Like the carbon-nanotube resonators described in the preceding article, these devices will exhibit high quality factors (Q values), will be compatible with integration with electronic circuits, and, unlike similar devices made from silicone and silicone carbide, will have tunable resonant frequencies as high as several GHz. An efficient electromechanical transduction method for the carbon nanotube resonators {{is provided by the}} previously observed variation of carbon nanotube length with charge injection. It was found that injection of electrons or holes, respectively, lengthens or shortens carbon nanotubes, by amounts of the order of a percent at bias levels of a few volts. The charge-dependent length change also enables a simple and direct means of tuning the resonant frequency by varying the DC bias and hence the <b>tension</b> along the <b>tube,</b> much like tuning a guitar string. In its basic form, the invention is a tunable high-Q resonator based on a suspended carbon nanotube bridge with attached electrodes (see Figure 1). An applied DC bias controls the tension and thus the frequency of resonance. If one were to superimpose a radio-frequency (RF) bias on the DC bias, then the resulting rapid variation in tension or length would set the tube into vibration. If, on the other hand, the carbon nanotube were to be set into vibration by interaction between an incident RF electric field and electric charges in the nanotube, then the vibration would give rise to an RF signal output that is proportional to the RF amplitude at the resonance frequency. Because the transduction mechanism is extremely sensitive and the active volume is only a few nanometers in diameter, this device is not well suited for use as a microwave power device. Instead, this carbon nanotube mechanical resonator would be useful primarily as part of a highly precise, sensitive, frequency-selective detector. An array of such devices featuring nanotubes of different lengths (and thus different frequencies) could be made to operate as a highspeed spectrum analyzer (see Figure 2...|$|R

The proportion of saturated fatty acid was above half of the PC. Concerning molecular species of PC, dipalmitoyl species was 11. 3 %. Saturated molecular species of PC was calculated to be 16. 7 %. ? Protein analysis was accomplished with SDS-PAGE. There were five bands in the gel which did not exist in the serum. Therefore, materials that occured in the eustachian tubal lavage fluid may be produced in the tube itself, and not derived from the serum. 3. Surface tension in phospholipid emulsion was measured. PC appeared to have the strongest surface tension activity in phospholipid classes. There was an analogous effect among the various PCs except for DPPC. 4. The measurement of opening and closing pressures was also accomplished by using phospholipid emulsions. PC was assumed to decrease the opening and closing pressures of the eustachian tube. Therefore, PC may act in maintenance of the physiological eustachian tube function. PC may {{play an important role in}} the surface tension lowering substance. 5. The eustachian tubal dysfunction causes many pathological conditions of the middle ear cavity. Phospholipid, particularly PC would be a useful agent for supplementary therapy against eustachian tubal dysfunction...|$|R
