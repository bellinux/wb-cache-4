5|$|According to Sharaf, 1934–1937 was <b>the</b> <b>happiest</b> {{period of}} Reich's {{personal}} life, despite the professional problems. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg {{was good and}} he considered marrying her. When she became pregnant in 1935, they were initially overjoyed, buying clothes and furniture for the child, but doubts developed for Reich, who saw the future as too unsettled. To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst Edith Jacobson helped to arrange it.|$|E

5|$|Elves {{have few}} children, {{as a rule}} (Fëanor and Nerdanel were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are {{relatively}} sizeable intervals between each child (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman).

5|$|After the 1934 tour, Woodfull and Ponsford—Australia's first-choice opening pair—retired, leaving {{vacancies}} in the Test team. Fingleton scored {{four centuries}} {{and was the}} leading run-scorer during the 1934–35 domestic season to earn a recall to the Australian team for the 1935–36 tour of South Africa. From that point onwards until the outbreak of World War II, he opened the batting with his New South Wales partner Bill Brown. With Bradman absent due to illness, it was <b>the</b> <b>happiest</b> time of Fingleton's career, and he scored centuries in three consecutive innings as Australia won {{each of the last}} three Tests by an innings.

5|$|As {{a result}} of his performances, Fingleton was {{recalled}} to the Test team for the tour of South Africa in 1935–36, where he partnered Brown {{at the top of the}} innings. Under normal circumstances, the Australians would have been captained by Fingleton's rival Bradman, who had been vice-captain to Woodfull. However, Bradman was unable to tour for medical reasons and Vic Richardson led the team instead. With Bradman out of the way, the tour was to be the most prolific and peaceful phase of Fingleton's international career and included several large opening stands with Brown. During the tour, Fingleton played with an attacking flair that contrasted with his established reputation for doggedness. For Fingleton, it was <b>the</b> <b>happiest</b> tour he had been on, in large part due to Bradman's absence.|$|E
