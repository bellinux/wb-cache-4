When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> with them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted {{to spend as much}} time with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family.|$|E

Meals are structured in a cyclical order by Palestinians and span into two main courses and several intermediate ones like coffee, fruits and sweets as well as dinner. Like in most Arab cultures, meals are a <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> with family and could last 1–2 hours depending on the specific time of the day. Unlike other cultures, lunch is the primary course and breakfast and dinner are lighter in contents.|$|E

Mr. and Mrs. Yeo's (Jack Neo and Xiang Yun) busy schedules give them little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> with their children, leading to a strained relationship. With his mother absent, Chengcai was raised by his ex-convict father (Huang Yiliang), whose fighting skills he inherited.|$|E

25|$|Some women self-select out {{of higher}} status positions, {{choosing}} instead {{to have more}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> at home and with their families. According to Sarah Damaske, this choice is often made because high status positions do not allow time for the heavy domestic workload that many women expect to take on due to the gendered division of labor in the home. Working class women, in particular, also sometimes self-select out of more time-intensive or higher -status positions {{in order to maintain}} the traditional gender hierarchy and household accord.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, {{at the age}} of 19, Edison {{moved to}} Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an {{employee}} of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.|$|E
25|$|German and Soviet armies {{relied heavily}} on work horses to pull {{artillery}} and supplies. Horses {{seemed to be a}} cheap and reliable transport especially in the spring and fall mud of the Eastern Front but the associated costs of daily feeding, grooming and handling horses were staggering. In theory horse units could feed off the country, but grazing on grass alone rendered horses unfit for work and the troops had no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> searching the villages for fodder. Hard-working horses required up to twelve pounds of grain daily; fodder carried by the troops made up a major portion of their supply trains.|$|E

25|$|During the Gilded Age, many Americans {{began working}} fewer hours {{and had more}} {{disposable}} income. With new-found money and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> on leisure activities, Americans sought new venues for entertainment. Amusement parks, set up outside major cities and in rural areas, emerged to meet this new economic opportunity. These parks served as source of fantasy and escape from real life. By the early 1900s, hundreds of amusement parks were operating in the United States and Canada. Trolley parks stood outside many cities. Parks like Atlanta's Ponce de Leon and Idora Park, near Youngstown, OH, took passengers to traditionally popular picnic grounds, which by the late 1890s also often included rides like the Giant Swing, Carousel, and Shoot-the-Chutes. These amusement parks were often based on nationally known parks or world's fairs: they had names like Coney Island, White City, Luna Park, or Dreamland. The American Gilded Age was, in fact, amusement parks' Golden Age that reigned until the late 1920s.|$|E

The family is materially well-off, with a plush home and a Mercedes, but justifiably so—Perowne and his wife work hard.

500|$|In the inter-war period, {{officers}} led a [...] "country club existence". They {{had a high}} social standing, {{equivalent to}} that of an upper-middle-class professional.

They and their families had access to free medical and dental care. They had free life insurance, and an adequate salary, which could be stretched because Army commissaries and post exchanges sold many everyday goods tax-free. [...] They invariably lived on-base in good housing, and in tight-knit and supportive communities. When posted overseas, they took their families with them. A secure and steady job was highly prized during the Great Depression years from 1929 to 1939, and resignations were rare.|$|E
