5|$|Tax {{law also}} makes special {{exemptions}} for charitable trusts. They are {{free from the}} income <b>tax</b> <b>paid</b> by individuals and companies, and also the corporation <b>tax</b> <b>paid</b> by incorporated and unincorporated associations. There is no requirement for charitable trusts to pay capital gains tax or council tax, although they are obliged to pay VAT. This freedom from tax liability applies not just to charitable trusts, but also to people who donate to them. Individuals who donate via Gift Aid are free from paying tax on that amount, while companies who give gifts to charity can claim tax on the amount back from HM Revenue & Customs.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} landowner's land <b>tax</b> <b>paid</b> in {{a portion of}} their crop yield, the poll tax and {{property}} taxes were paid in coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.|$|E

5|$|English {{taxation}} {{after the}} Norman Conquest of 1066 {{was based on}} the geld or danegeld, a national <b>tax</b> <b>paid</b> by all free men, those who were not serfs or slaves. The geld {{was based on the}} number of hides of land owned by the taxpayer, and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects. During King Henry I's reign, an increasing number of exemptions, and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld, lowered its importance to the Exchequer—the treasury of England. It is unclear whether the geld was collected at all during the reign of Henry's successor, King Stephen. Stephen's successor, King Henry II, collected the geld only twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161–1162. The geld was unpopular, and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it.|$|E

50|$|The {{effective}} <b>tax</b> rate <b>paid</b> by {{an individual}} in the upper income bracket is highly dependent on the ratio of income they earn from capital gains, interest and dividends. As discussed in a Wall Street Journal article, the effective tax rate of income <b>tax</b> directly <b>paid</b> may differ from the effective economic incidence. When all <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> to local, state, and federal government are included, low, middle, and high income groups pay a similar share of their income to government. The article, using 2011 estimates of total income received versus total <b>taxes</b> <b>paid,</b> reported that the lowest 20% in income paid 2.1% of total taxes while receiving 3.4% of income. The middle 20% <b>paid</b> 10.3% of <b>taxes</b> while getting 11.4% of the income, and the top 1%, those with yearly incomes averaging $1,371,000, <b>paid</b> 21.6% of <b>taxes</b> while getting 21% of total income.

25|$|Australia and New Zealand have a {{dividend}} imputation system, wherein companies can attach franking credits or imputation credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the <b>tax</b> <b>paid</b> {{by the company}} upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company <b>tax</b> <b>paid</b> generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 - company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders {{who are able to}} use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.|$|E
40|$|Corporate tax related {{empirical}} research often uses effective tax rates to investigate cross- sectional {{differences in the}} tax attributes of companies. Effective tax rates are often defined as (current or total) tax expense over financial accounting income before taxes, where the (current or total) tax expense is {{an estimate of the}} actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid.</b> This approximation of the actual tax payment by using tax expense is often used, as the actual tax payment and taxable income were or are proprietary information, thereby rendering it difficult if not impossible to use this information to calculate effective tax rates. Due to changes in financial accounting standards more information on the actual tax payment and taxable income is now generally available in US financial statements. This paper argues that the use of an effective tax rate measure utilizing tax expenses has some inherent dangers which are to a lesser extent the case in an effective tax rate using actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid.</b> Two inherent dangers of a tax expense based ETR measure are the quality of the tax expense measure as an estimation of the actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> and timing differences between tax expense and actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid.</b> The differences between tax expenses and actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> ETRs are researched in an empirical study as well as other proposed ETR measures. Results from this empirical study indicate that in certain situations it is more appropriate to use an effective tax rate measure based on actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> rather than on tax expenses. ...|$|R
