This meeting came about in August 2009, when Chomsky visited the Latin American country. In a press conference to commence the meeting, Chávez made reference to the intellectual's work, remarking [...] "Hegemony or survival; we opt for survival", before comparing Chomsky's thesis with the concept of [...] "Socialism or Barbarism" [...] advocated by German Marxist Rosa Luxemburg in the early 20th century. Speaking through an interpreter, Chomsky replied that [...] "I write about peace and criticize the barriers to peace; that's easy. What's harder is to create a better world... and what's so exciting about at last visiting Venezuela is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> how a better world is being created." [...] He went on to Venezolana de Televisión, where he commented on the U.S. government's role in orchestrating the 2009 Honduran coup d'état to overthrow leftist President Manuel Zelaya. He also expressed cautious support for the leftist reforms being implemented by Chávez's administration, remarking his opinion that their moves [...] "toward the creation of another socio-economic model could have a global impact if these projects are successfully carried out".|$|E

Corbyn said his view about the desirability of putting bin Laden on trial was shared by Boris Johnson and Barack Obama.|$|E

After saying he had lived alone for centuries in that cave, he told the peasant: [...] "Give me your hand, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> how strong are men today". The shepherd, scared, gave him the horn of the cow, which, when seized by the giant man, was immediately broken. The poor villager ran away terrified, but not without hearing Bernardo say: [...] "Current men are not like those who helped me to kill Frenchmen in Roncevaux".|$|E

[...] A journalist asked American Horse what {{he thought}} of the East and he replied, ”I see so much that is wonderful and strange that I feel a wish {{to go out in the}} forest and cover my head with a blanket, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> no more and have a chance to think over what I have seen.” On March 31, 1887, Chief American Horse, Chief Blue Horse and Chief Red Shirt and their families boarded the S.S. State of Nebraska in New York City, leading a new journey for the Lakota people when they crossed the sea to England on Buffalo Bill’s first international to perform at the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria and tour through Birmingham, Salford and London over a five–month period. The entourage consisted of 97 Indians, 18 buffaloes, 2 deer, 10 elk, 10 mules, 5 Texas steers, 4 donkeys, and 108 horses.|$|E
