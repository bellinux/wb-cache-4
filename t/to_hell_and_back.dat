5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was {{a highly}} {{decorated}} American soldier and Medal of Honor recipient who turned actor. He portrayed himself in the film <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> <b>Back,</b> the account of his World War II experiences. During the 1950s and 1960s he was cast primarily in westerns. While often the hero, he proved his ability to portray a cold-blooded hired gun in No Name on the Bullet. A notable exception to the westerns was The Quiet American in which he co-starred with Michael Redgrave. Murphy made over 40 feature films and often worked with directors more than once. Jesse Hibbs who directed <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> <b>Back</b> worked with the star on six films, only half of which were westerns. When promoting his 1949 book <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> <b>Back</b> he appeared on the radio version of This Is Your Life. To promote the 1955 film of the same name, he appeared on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. He was a celebrity guest on television shows such as What's My Line? and appeared {{in a handful of}} television dramas. Murphy's only television series Whispering Smith had a brief run in 1961. For his cooperation in appearing in the United States Army's Broken Bridge episode of The Big Picture television series he was awarded the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{cooperation}} of the United States Army and the United States Defense Department was extended for Murphy's media appearances to publicize the film <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> <b>Back.</b> Among the 1955 celebrity television shows on which Murphy appeared to promote the film was Toast of the Town hosted by Ed Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Murphy {{enjoyed a}} 21-year acting career. He played {{himself in the}} 1955 autobiographical film <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> <b>Back,</b> based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, but most of his roles were in westerns. He made guest {{appearances}} on celebrity television shows and starred in the series Whispering Smith. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred quarter horses in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.|$|E
2500|$|Film {{director}} John Waters hailed Antichrist {{as one of}} the ten best {{films of}} 2009 in Artforum, stating [...] "If Ingmar Bergman had committed suicide, gone <b>to</b> <b>hell,</b> <b>and</b> come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> earth to direct an exploitation/art film for drive-ins, [...] is the movie he would have made." ...|$|R

50|$|G-Men from Hell is a 2000 American comedy film {{directed}} by Christopher Coppola and written by Robert Cooper, Richard L. Albert, and Nicholas Johnson. It {{is based on}} Michael Allred's comic book series Grafik Muzik. It stars William Forsythe and Tate Donovan as two violent FBI agents who die, go <b>to</b> <b>hell,</b> <b>and</b> escape <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Earth, where they become embroiled in a mystery.|$|R
5|$|Although Murphy was {{initially}} reluctant {{to appear as}} himself in <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> <b>Back,</b> {{the film version of}} his book, he eventually agreed to do so. Terry Murphy portrayed his brother Joseph Preston Murphy at age four. The film was directed by Jesse Hibbs with an on-screen introduction by General Walter Bedell Smith. Susan Kohner, daughter of Murphy's agent Paul Kohner, made her acting debut in the film. The finale shows Murphy being awarded the Medal of Honor while images of his unit's casualties pass across the screen. It became the biggest hit in the history of Universal Studios at the time.|$|E
5|$|Both Murphy and Universal gave serious {{considerations}} to {{a follow-up}} {{version of his}} post-war life. Murphy rejected the Richard J. Collins script The Way Back which created the fictional scenario that filming <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> <b>Back</b> had been so therapeutic for Murphy that it cured him of his combat fatigue. Spec McClure scripted a second unused version of The Way Back that incorporated Murphy's real-life friends into the storyline and ended with the star living happily ever after with Pamela and their two sons. A third version by an unknown writer focused on the Murphy-McClure friendship and {{was rejected by the}} threat of a lawsuit from McClure. Desi Arnaz offered to bankroll a 1965 project titled Helmets in the Dust. At Murphy's request McClure wrote a film treatment, but the project never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|The Hibbs-Murphy team {{proved so}} {{successful}} in <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> <b>Back</b> {{that the two}} worked together on {{a total of five}} subsequent films. Hibbs directed Murphy in Ride Clear of Diablo in 1954. The partnership resulted in the commercially unsuccessful non-traditional 1956 western Walk the Proud Land. Hibbs and Murphy teamed with each other for non-westerns Joe Butterfly and World in My Corner. They worked together a final time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail. Veteran character actor Dan Duryea who portrayed villain Whitey Kincaide in Ride Clear of Diablo played a second lead in two more Murphy vehicles, Night Passage and Six Black Horses. The Story of Charles Russell with Murphy as the lead was under development at Universal but shelved after the disappointing receipts of Walk the Proud Land. Murphy, however, was enthusiastic enough about a biopic of Charles Marion Russell to give serious consideration tor his own production that would star Guy Mitchell in the lead, but no such film was made.|$|E

500|$|Since his {{military}} service, Murphy had been plagued with insomnia and bouts of depression, and {{he slept with}} a loaded pistol under his pillow. A post-service medical examination on 17 June 1947 revealed symptoms of headaches, vomiting, and nightmares about the war. His medical records indicated that he took sleeping pills to help prevent nightmares. During the mid-1960s, he recognized his dependence on Placidyl, and locked himself alone {{in a hotel room}} for a week to successfully break the addiction. Post-traumatic stress levels exacerbated his innate moodiness, and surfaced in episodes that friends and professional colleagues found alarming. His first wife, Wanda Hendrix, stated that he once held her at gunpoint. She witnessed her husband being guilt-ridden and tearful over newsreel footage of German war orphans. Murphy briefly found a creative stress outlet in writing poetry after his Army discharge.
