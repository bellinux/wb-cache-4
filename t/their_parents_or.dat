5|$|Despite {{the shift}} in policy from {{educational}} assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children from their families by state officials continued {{through much of the}} 1960s and 70s. The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of Section 88 to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of child welfare. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System. Often taken without the consent of <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> community elders, some children were placed in state-run child welfare facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.|$|E

25|$|Faroese {{is spoken}} {{in the entire}} area as a first language. It is {{difficult}} to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the Faroese language, because many ethnic Faroese live in Denmark, and few who are born there return to the Faroes with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> as adults.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that {{domestic}} geese descended from the Greylag goose are effectively the same species as their wild ancestor (being a subspecies formed through domestication), escaped individuals readily breed with wild populations, resulting in the offspring sometimes resembling either one of <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>or</b> bearing mixed plumage with patterns of grey and white feathers.|$|E
25|$|In Egypt, {{studies have}} shown that mamluks from Georgia {{retained}} their native language, were aware of the politics of the Caucasus region, and received frequent visits from <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> other relatives. In addition, they sent gifts to family members or gave money to build useful structures (a defensive tower, or even a church) in their native villages.|$|E
25|$|According to the Pāli Canon & Āgama (the Early Buddhist scriptures), {{there is}} no any saying that same or {{opposite}} gender relations {{have anything to do}} with sexual misconduct, and some Theravada monks express that same-gender relations do not violate the rule to avoid sexual misconduct, which means not having sex with someone under age (thus protected by <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> guardians), someone betrothed or married and who have taken vows of religious celibacy.|$|E

50|$|Children who are {{securely}} attached typically are visibly upset as their caregivers leave, {{but they are}} happy upon their return. These children seek comfort from <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> caregiver when frightened. In an instance when <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> primary caregiver is not available, these children can be comforted to a degree by others, but they prefer <b>their</b> familiar <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> caregiver. Likewise, when parents with secure attachments reach out to their children, the children welcome the connection. Playing with children is more common when parents and children have a secure attachment. These parents react more quickly to their children's needs and are typically more responsive to a child they are {{securely attached}} to than one of insecure attachment. Attachment carries on throughout {{the growth of the}} children. Studies support that secure attachments with primary caregivers lead to more mature and less aggressive children than those with avoidant or ambivalent attachment styles.|$|R

25|$|Finally, {{under the}} Immigration Act, 1971, {{the concept of}} patriality or right of abode was created. CUKCs and other Commonwealth {{citizens}} had the right of abode in the UK only if they, their husband (if female), <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> their grandparents were connected with the United Kingdom. This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. However, the concept of patriality was only a temporary solution to halt a sudden wave of migration. The British government later reformed the law, resulting in the British Nationality Act, 1981.|$|E
25|$|Siblings {{taken into}} care {{together}} were often separated and contact between siblings was discouraged. Boys and girls were usually separated in institutions so {{brothers and sisters}} rarely had close contact. Family ties were cut when one sibling ended up in care while others remained at home with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> were sent elsewhere. The result is that many people never knew they had siblings or only found out much later in life. Children's names were often changed and poor and incomplete records kept of children in care. This {{makes it difficult for}} older care leavers to find out why and how they ended up in care, and to trace parents, siblings or other living relatives.|$|E
25|$|Swiss {{nationals}} are {{citizens of}} their municipality of origin, their canton {{of origin and}} the Confederation, in that order: a Swiss citizen is defined {{as someone who has}} the bourgeoisie of a Swiss municipality (article 37 of the Swiss Federal Constitution). They are entered in the family register of their place of origin. One's place of origin depends on how one has acquired Swiss nationality. Nationals who are naturalised take the nationality of the municipality in which they were naturalised; citizens who became Swiss by virtue of <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> of their marriage to a Swiss national, take the municipality of their father or spouse. It is {{not to be confused with}} the place of birth, which may be different.|$|E

25|$|Children aged six by 15 September must be {{enrolled}} {{in their first}} school year in that calendar year. In addition, children who reach {{the age of six}} between 16 September and 31 December may be authorized to attend the first stage of education, provided a request is submitted by <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> guardians to the school nearest to their residence (or place of work) during the annual enrollment period. State-run schools are free of charge; private school tuition is refunded by the State in part or fully, when state-run schools in the area are filled to capacity. The first cycle of basic mandatory education covers years 1st-4th, the second cycle years 5th-6th and the third cycle years 7th-9th. The curriculum contains only general education until the 9th year at which point vocational subjects are introduced.|$|E
25|$|Rock-throwing {{and mass}} demonstrations had played {{no part in}} Fatah's {{previous}} guerrilla activities, and the uprising came as a complete surprise to the PLO Stone-throwing, which had been intermittent and confined locally, broke out on a large systematic organized and spontaneous grassroots scale and took root with the First Intifada in December 1987 {{after two decades of}} Israeli rule, becoming the major symbol of the intifada itself. Those who participated, among the best-educated in the Middle East, took to brandishing their banned national flag and throwing rocks and molotov-bombs at IDF forces, to express their frustrations at limited opportunities after decades of growing up under Israeli occupation. It has been called 'the first stone-throwing rebellion against Israel.' Shame and guilt for not doing enough to help <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> free their land also played a motivational role.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} when the CONADEP report was prepared, the Asociación Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo or Abuelas), had records of 172 {{children}} who disappeared together with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> were born at the numerous concentration camps and had not been returned to their families. The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo now believe up to 500 grandchildren were stolen. 102 are believed to have been located. On 13 April 2000, the grandmothers received a tip off that the birth certificate of Rosa Roisinblit's infant grandson, born in detention, had been falsified and the child given to an Air Force civil agent and his wife. Following the anonymous phone call, he was located and agreed to a DNA blood test, confirming his true identity. Rodolfo Fernando, grandson of Roisinblit, is the first known newborn of missing children returned to his family through the work of the grandmothers. Roisinblit's daughter, 25-year-old Patricia Julia Roisinblit de Perez, who was active in the Montoneros, was kidnapped along with her husband, 24-year-old José Martínas Pérez Rojo, on 6 October 1978.|$|E

500|$|Family {{values are}} {{important}} in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>or</b> other elders in the family. Marriage {{is thought to be}} for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low. , just 1.6 percent of Indian women were divorced but this figure was rising due to their education and economic independence. Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age. Female infanticide and female foeticide in the country have caused a discrepancy in the sex ratio, [...] it was estimated that there were 50 million more males than females in the nation. However a report from 2011 has shown improvement in the gender ratio. The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines. Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.|$|E
