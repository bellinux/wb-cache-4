25|$|Exposure to {{weightlessness}} causes {{changes to}} the signals from the receptors to touch, pressure, and gravity, i.e., all information necessary for postural stability. Adaptive modifications in the central processing of sensory information take place to produce motor responses <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> for the new gravitational environment. As a result, terrestrial motor strategies are progressively abandoned in weightlessness, as astronauts adapt to the weightless environment. This is particularly true for the major postural muscles found in the lower legs. The modifications in posture, movement, and locomotion acquired in reduced gravity are then inappropriate for Earth's gravity upon return. After landing, postural instability approaching clinical ataxia is manifested {{as a result of}} this in-flight neural reorganization.|$|E

Frequently, the Council has criticized programs on BET, Comedy Central, E!, FX, MTV, Spike, TNT, and VH1 because they claim some of the content aired on those channels is inappropriate for younger viewers. On {{the other side of}} the issue, the PTC has awarded its [...] "Seal of Approval" [...] to cable networks Disney Channel and Hallmark Channel for their original programs several years ago.|$|E

2500|$|Gardner defines an {{intelligence}} as [...] "bio-psychological potential to process {{information that can}} be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture." [...] According to Gardner, there are more ways to do this than just through logical and linguistic intelligence. [...] Gardner believes that the purpose of schooling [...] "should be to develop intelligences and to help people reach vocational and avocational goals <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> to their particular spectrum of intelligences. People who are helped to do so, [...] believe, feel more engaged and competent and therefore more inclined to serve society in a constructive way." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{experiences}} {{as head of}} a management consulting firm focused his attention {{on the relationship between}} cost accounting and industrial efficiency. He emphasized that cost accounting is a service function whose value depends on its usefulness to other departments. As a staff man negotiating with foremen and executives, the cost accountant must be diplomatic, yet forceful enough {{to take full advantage of}} the discipline that costing makes possible. Nicholson stressed the importance of supplying cost figures <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> for each executive level, and the need to educate foremen and department heads about overhead costs as a first step toward controlling such costs. Cost accountants should give department managers comparative costs of materials, labor, overhead, production quantities, and inventories. Each production department should in turn inform the sales department how all these amounts are likely to vary in relation to changes in sales volume.|$|E
2500|$|During her June 12, 2010, {{appearance}} on Freedom Watch, Palin elaborated on her stance {{that even though}} marijuana should not be legalized, enforcement of marijuana prohibition laws should be made a lower priority: [...] "Well, if we’re talking about pot, I’m not for the legalization of pot because I think that that would just encourage, especially, our young people {{to think that it}} was okay to go ahead and use it. And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I {{think that we need to}} prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{paper has}} been {{manufactured}} at the household level {{but this has}} changed somewhat. There {{are two types of}} production units in the town. The first consists of households of up to five members, with production varying greatly during the year depending on other economic activities and/or means to produce the paper. The other type is primarily devoted to producing paper, with family members often involved in bark collection and commercialization of end products along with producing the paper itself. In most cases, the work goes on in the home. The appearance of workshops for paper-making first started to appear in the 1990s. [...] Paper manufacture is dependent on the weather, with May through July being the driest months of the region and therefore the most suitable. Less paper is produced December through February because of the weather. Another factor is religious festivals such as Holy Week and Day of the Dead in which paper demand peaks. On days <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> for paper-making, work goes from sunrise to sunset {{to take advantage of the}} weather.|$|E
2500|$|When the Royal Hours are chanted (the Eve of Nativity, the Eve of Theophany and Great Friday), the First Hour is not {{joined to}} Matins as normal, but {{it becomes the}} first office in an {{aggregated}} office composed of the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours and the Typica. [...] This is the most elaborate form of the First Hour. Both the priest and deacon are vested and serve, and the Gospel Book is set on an analogion (lectern) {{in the center of}} the temple (church building). [...] At the beginning of the First Hour, the deacon performs a full censing of the church, clergy and faithful. [...] Two of the three fixed psalms (89 and 100) are replaced by others <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> to the particular feast day being celebrated. [...] A number of hymns (stichera) are sung in place of the Troparion of the Day. Then a prokeimenon, the reading of a relevant Old Testament prophecy, an Epistle and a Gospel are chanted. [...] The Kontakion of the Day is chanted by the choir, instead of being read. [...] Since at the Royal Hours other services immediately follow the First Hour, there is no dismissal.|$|E

The appliance must be water, and not sand--or rather water or sand, with judgment, discrimination, and tact; for the gardener often finds that a judicious mixture of sand with the clayey and clammy soil about the roots of his plants is just what is required. The principle is, that the appliance must be an appropriate one--that is, one indicated by a wise consideration of {{the circumstances of the}} case, and of the natural characteristics of the infantile mind.|$|E
