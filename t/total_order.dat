The order consisted of 55 sleeping cars, 38 coaches, 20 dining cars, 15 lounges, and 12 transition-dormitory cars. The initial order cost $340 million, and included {{an option for}} 39 additional cars. In late 1993 Amtrak exercised the option for 55 cars {{at a cost of}} $110 million, bringing the <b>total</b> <b>order</b> of Superliner II cars to 195. The option included ten dining cars, ten lounges, and 35 transdorms. Bombardier built the order in Barre, Vermont.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{there was}} an {{intention}} to procure up to 400 aircraft for the Royal Navy and the RAF, but the development cost for the changes to accommodate the Spey turbofans meant that the per-unit price eventually ended up three times the price of an F-4J. Because the government then had a policy of negotiating fixed-price contracts, these costs could not be evened out by a large production run, which left the <b>total</b> <b>order</b> at 170.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, two new {{aircraft}} carriers were planned. The {{requirements for the}} intended force of four carriers meant that five squadrons of Phantoms would be needed. However, in its 1966 Defence White Paper, the Government decided to cancel the two new carriers, which led to reductions in the <b>total</b> <b>order</b> for the Royal Navy's Phantoms. Initially 143 were ordered, which was cut to 110, and finally just 50, with options for another seven. The intention was to form a pair of front-line squadrons, each of twelve aircraft, that would operate from the two remaining, heavily modernised fleet carriers. The rest of the aircraft would be a reserve and for training.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the tests}} in Oslo, a {{delegation}} {{was sent to}} look at compatible systems outside Oslo. After it had returned, the company went into negotiations with three manufacturers: Duewag, Bautzen and Ansaldo/Firema. Oslo Sporveier {{signed a contract with}} Ansaldo/Firema for delivery of 17 units in 1997–98, with options for additional 15 units. The first 17 units cost , or NOK20million per vehicle. The option rights were later exercised, and the <b>total</b> <b>order</b> was increased to 32. This allowed Oslo Sporveier to replace all trams that were not articulated, and would give a maximum age in the tram fleet to 18 years. While Oslo Sporveier at first had planned to debt-finance the purchase, by 1999 it was decided that the trams would be leased from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. Due to a labor dispute about privatizing the operation of the tramway and the Oslo Metro, the ownership of all trams and metro trains, including the SL95, were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, the Accident Investigation Board Norway {{criticized the}} braking system of the trains. During 2009, there were 83 {{incidents}} where trains with locked wheels slid down steep sections of track. The Accident Investigation Board found that the metro had conducted insufficient testing of {{the braking system}} on steep slippery lines, had not adjusted the brakes satisfactorily, and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently. In December 2010, Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three-car units, bringing the <b>total</b> <b>order</b> up to 115 three-car units. The last trains will be delivered in 2012. There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase, with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase, while the right-winged parties voted to order 19 units. The extra trains {{will make it possible}} to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line (Line 1) with six-car lines, compared to a situation with only three-car trains on the Lambertseter Line, the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line (lines 4 and 6) would only use three-car trains.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Every <b>total</b> <b>ordering</b> of a {{commutative}} domain can {{be extended}} uniquely to its field of fractions. This result is extended in two directions. Firstly, {{the notion of a}} <b>total</b> <b>ordering</b> is generalized so that a nonzero element can have more than two signs (in fact, these signs form a group). Secondly, commutative domains are replaced by noncom-mutative ones and we consider the following types of rings of fractions: Ore extensions, maximal (right or two-sided) rings of fractions, division hulls of free algebras and epic fields. Throughout the paper several examples are given to illustrate the theory. It is well-known that every <b>total</b> <b>ordering</b> of a commutative domain extends uniquely to a <b>total</b> <b>ordering</b> of its field of fractions. There are several generalizations of this result to (noncommutative) associative domains. While there is only one definition of a <b>total</b> <b>ordering</b> of an associative domain, several nonequivalent definitions of a ring of fractions exist in the literature. Existence and uniqueness of extensions of total orderings depend on the definition chosen. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we introduce the notion of a G-ordering of an associative unital ring which generalizes the notion of an ordering of higher level. W...|$|R
