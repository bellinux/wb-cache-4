The required temperature for the tower reboiler return flow was 135 C at [...] per hour but the procedure was not followed. During this start-up, this return flow temperature reached 153 C with a rate increase of [...] per hour. The erroneous 93% reading from the defective level transmitter still indicated an ongoing safe level condition in the tower {{but there was still}} no flow of heavy raffinate from the splitter tower to the storage tank as the level control valve remained closed; instead of the hydrocarbon liquid level being at 8.65 ft, i.e. 93% level, as indicated, it had actually reached 67 ft. Just before midday, with heat increasing in the tower, the actual fluid level had risen to 98 ft. Pressure started to build up in the system as the remaining nitrogen in the tower and associated pipework became compressed with the increasing volume of raffinate. The operations crew thought that the pressure rise was a result of overheating in the <b>tower</b> <b>bottoms</b> as this was a known start-up issue, so the pressure was released.|$|E

Fuel physical properties were de-emphasized by using fuel injectors which produced highly atomized, and hence rapidly vaporizing sprays. A substantial fuel spray characterization effort was conducted to allow selection of nozzles which assured that such sprays were achieved for all fuels.

40|$|Integration of {{innovative}} steps into new advanced processes {{have the potential}} to reduce costs for producing liquid fuels. In this program, objective is to develop a new approach to liquefaction that generates an all distillate product slate at a reduced cost of about US$ 25 /barrel of crude oil equivalent. A Counterflow Reactor was developed in cooperation with GfK mbH, Germany. Advantages are low hydrogen recycle rates and low feed preheating requirements. Coal/heavy oil slurry is injected into the top of the reactor while the recycle gas and make up hydrogen is introduced into the bottom; hydrogenation products are withdrawn from the top.

40|$|Commercial ebullated bed hydroprocessors, {{such as the}} LC-Finer, {{are used}} for the {{production}} of synthetic crude oil by upgrading bitumen extracted from the Alberta oil sands. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the impact of an increased vacuum distillation <b>tower</b> <b>bottoms</b> feed fraction on the reactor fluid dynamics (e. g., bed and freeboard phase holdups, bubble characteristics and local fluidization behaviour). Industrial conditions were simulated in a high pressure gas-liquid-solid fluidization system based on dimensional and geometric similitude. Considering important geometric characteristics and matching dimensionless groups, base-case conditions resulted in an ebullated bed of nitrogen, 0. 5 wt. % aqueous ethanol, and aluminum cylinders (average lengths and diameters of 7. 5 and 3. 2 mm, respectively) operating at 6. 5 MPa and a gas-to-liquid superficial velocity ratio of 0. 78. The proposed scale-down method resulted in high gas holdup conditions similar to industrial measurements. The use of the Sauter mean diameter to account for particle size and shape at the simulation conditions was investigated by comparing glass spheres with diameters of 4 and 1. 5 mm to aluminum cylinders with equivalent volume-to-surface area ratios. Local bubble characteristics, including gas holdups, bubble rise velocities, and chord lengths, were then investigated under various operating conditions using a monofibre optical probe. Overall fluid dynamics were studied when increasing the liquid viscosity and varying the gas and liquid superficial velocities due to their relevance for industrial ebullated bed hydroprocessors. Freeboard and bed region gas holdup relations were studied and correlations were developed for gas and solid holdups at the simulation conditions based on the dimensionless groups. Mesophase generation in hydroprocessors due to undesired secondary reactions was also considered for an increased vacuum residue feed fraction. Adding a dispersed immiscible liquid phase which preferentially wetted the particles was therefore experimentally studied at non-simulating conditions using nitrogen, biodiesel, glycerol and various particles, where fluidization behaviour and phase holdups were considerably affected due to particle clustering. A study on the impacts of particle size, shape and material demonstrated the influences of fluid and particle properties, specifically the relative surface energies and viscous forces, on agglomeration due to interparticle liquid bridging...|$|E

30|$|The {{desulfurization}} system mainly includes desulfurizing reaction tower (T- 101) {{and washing}} tower (V- 101).

40|$|AbstractThe six {{different}} non-linear {{finite element model}} of the transmission tower-line system which have different spans and different height difference was established by the finite element analysis software, and wind velocity time series with resorting to weighted amplitude wave superposition (WAWS) was simulated. Based on the established models and the simulated wind velocity time series, the wind-induced response of transmission tower-line system in time history was calculated to achieve wind-induced vibration coefficient of transmission towers of various models. By comparative analyzing, span and height difference {{on the impact of}} wind-induced vibration coefficient of transmission towers was studied. The results show that the span and height difference have a certain impact on wind-induced vibration coefficient of transmission towers, and the effects on tower top are more obvious than <b>tower</b> <b>bottom.</b> With the increase of span, wind-induced vibration coefficient reduces gradually, but with the increase of height difference, wind-induced vibration coefficient increases gradually...|$|R

5000|$|Distillation towers (such as {{in images}} 3 and 4) use various vapor and liquid {{contacting}} methods {{to provide the}} required number of equilibrium stages. Such devices {{are commonly known as}} [...] "plates" [...] or [...] "trays". [...] Each of these plates or trays is at a different temperature and pressure. The stage at the <b>tower</b> <b>bottom</b> has the highest pressure and temperature. Progressing upwards in the tower, the pressure and temperature decreases for each succeeding stage. The vapor-liquid equilibrium for each feed component in the tower reacts in its unique way to the different pressure and temperature conditions at each of the stages. That means that each component establishes a different concentration in the vapor and liquid phases at each of the stages, and this results in the separation of the components. Some example trays are depicted in image 5. A more detailed, expanded image of two trays {{can be seen in the}} theoretical plate article. The reboiler often acts as an additional equilibrium stage.|$|R

40|$|With {{wind farms}} being {{installed}} in deeper water depths new topologies of structure {{are used as}} substructure. A good solution is a jacket substructure that can be cost effective for water depths up to 60 m. To make a finite element model of a jacket structure with, in this case, 84 different members requires a number of degrees of freedom much higher than a monopile model consisting of only one beam. When simulating the time response in an aeroelastic sotware, Hawc 2 in this case, {{the high number of}} degrees of freedom will increase the computational time by a factor of around 6 compared to a monopile. This increase in the computational time slows the process of designing and validating the installation for the offshore wind turbine. In order to solve the problem an Euler-Bernoulli finite element model of the jacket is made, this is reduced by means of the Craig-Bampton method and the natural frequencies and mode shapes are checked to match the original model. The reduced model is coupled to the turbine and the natural frequencies and mode shapes are checked again to match the offshore wind turbine with the original jacket. The load analysis is made for two load cases at 6 and 14 m/s, the aerodynamic loads, loads at the <b>tower</b> <b>bottom</b> and at two points of a leg are compared with both models. The mode shapes and natural frequencies are well approximated with the jacket and its reduced model when not coupled to the other parts of the structure. When coupled error is introduced in the natural frequencies on the fore-aft and side to side modes of the structure and in the logarithmic decrement of 1 st, 2 nd, 6 th and 7 th modes corresponding to fore-aft and side to side and tower displacements. The aerodynamic loads are not affected for the reduction while the loads on the <b>tower</b> <b>bottom</b> are influenced by the effects of damping but are essentially accurate both in mean and standard deviation. Loads in the jacket are found not to be representative of the real loads on the structure...|$|R
