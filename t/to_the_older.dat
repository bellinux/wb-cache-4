5|$|Damage {{was also}} {{reported}} in Prince Edward Island {{as a result}} of the storm, particularly around Charlottetown, where its waterfront sustained heavy wave damage to pleasure craft and sea walls, as well as significant damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> urban forest in that city's downtown core. Extensive tree damage was also reported across the island, as well as structural damage to weaker buildings, such as barns and silos. The hurricane left portions of the island without power. The narrow path meant that damage was quite localized; little damage was reported in New Brunswick or western Prince Edward Island. Voting in the PEI general election on September29 was also disrupted, though more than 80% of voters made it to polling stations.|$|E

5|$|Fernando Alonso {{began the}} weekend's event knowing {{he would start}} {{from the back of}} the grid due to a number of {{penalties}} incurred for changing engine parts. Honda provided him with an upgraded internal combustion engine, which had been designed using the team's last four in-season development tokens. Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button had to continue using the old-specification engine at this race as Honda only had one of the upgraded power units available. However, Alonso used the new power unit only in the first practice session before switching back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> unit, albeit voicing satisfaction with the performance of the new specification.|$|E
5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, David Sasson {{immigrated to}} Bombay and {{established}} himself as a magistrate of the cotton industry. He built the Magen David Synagogue in Kolkata in 1861; this was in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Magen Hasidim synagogue. His son, Abdulla Sassoon, transformed the weaving industry in Bombay. To cater to the increasing need of the Baghdadi Jews, Knesset Eliyahoo synagogue was constructed on a premium piece of land in the hub of Bombay's commercial area by Jacob Sassoon, grandson of David Sassoon, commemorating his father, Eliyahoo Sassoon. It was established in 1884.|$|E

5|$|Next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> {{and much}} steeper stairs {{leading to the}} Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse riders to ascend the hill without dismounting. The railings are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble renditions of Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E
5|$|Post-war {{growth in}} {{newspaper}} readership prompted an even larger, $3.5 million expansion in 1964 to fit eight-unit presses {{and a new}} three-story press room {{to the west of}} the printing plant. Four years later, an even larger $6 million addition would use up the last of the surface parking lots on the property's block, building a two-story newsroom clad in reinforced concrete instead of the limestone used on the 1931 building; a skybridge was built across an alley to connect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> office building. In 1979, the new newsroom was renovated and modernized and a nearby alley was filled and enclosed.|$|E

5|$|The British {{occupation}} of this road was of special {{significance for the}} British Raj in India. Bridges, pathways and newer inns were constructed by the British for the first thirty-seven years of their reign since the {{occupation of}} Punjab in 1849. The British followed roughly the same alignment as the old routes, and at some places the newer routes ran parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Atheis came, according to Oemarjati, {{sometime during the}} early 1940s. In Mihardja's observations, Marxism–Leninism and anarcho-nihilism {{were among the most}} common ideologies in Indonesia; this led him to depict Rusli and Anwar as holding those ideologies. Meanwhile, emerging writers such as Idrus, Asrul Sani, and Chairil Anwar were increasingly critical of the older generation of Indonesian authors, whom they decried as narrow-minded and provincial. Mihardja, who was older than many contemporary writers and wrote in a similar style <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> authors, disliked this comparison; according to Maier, this may have led him to represent Chairil Anwar as a much-flawed character. Mihardja formalised his concept throughout the early 1940s and completed the writing during a period of unemployment from May 1948 until February 1949.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder and Scully believe that a serial killer from the 1940s passed his genetic trait of violence to his grandchild after a detective, BJ Morrow (Deborah Strang) mysteriously uncovers the remains of an FBI agent who disappeared almost fifty years before while investigating a modern-day murder case similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> cold case.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} {{games in the}} series, Wipeout 64 was {{developed}} by Liverpudlian developer Psygnosis and was published by Midway Games - marking {{the first and only}} time in the Wipeout series where one of the games were not published by Psygnosis or SCE Studio Liverpool (their future name). The game {{is one of the few}} N64 titles to have noticeable load times, disguised by the request 'Please Wait'. Load times between levels in Wipeout 64 are approximately a few seconds long due to the need for sound decompression, according to Psygnosis in a later interview with IGN. Psygnosis used the Nintendo 64's analogue stick to their benefit; thus rendering the D-Pad obsolete so that ships could respond quickly and more precisely in improvement regarding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> games.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, the Disney short {{subjects}} were no longer being produced on a regular basis, with many of the shorts divisions' personnel either leaving the company or begin reassigned to work on Disney television programs such as The Mickey Mouse Club and Disneyland. While the Disney shorts had dominated the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) during the 1930s, its reign over the award had been ended by MGM's Tom and Jerry cartoons, Warner Bros' Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, and the works of United Productions of America (UPA), whose flat art style and stylized animation techniques were lauded as more modern alternatives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Disney style. During the 1950s, only one Disney short, the stylized Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, won the Best Short Subject (Cartoons) Oscar.|$|E
50|$|Prismet {{is known}} for its {{location}} in proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Town Museum from which the building is clearly visible and offers a strong contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>old,</b> half-timbered buildings in the museum.

40|$|Philosophy {{of science}} and Introduction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament <b>The</b> study of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament has always taken place {{in a context of}} {{theological}} and philosophical presuppositions about knowledge, truth, history, religion, etc. This article investigates the relationship between <b>the</b> Introduction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament's theoretical base and modern trends in the philosophy of science. In the end the conclusion is reached that <b>the</b> Introduction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament has not kept track of current questions in the philosophy {{of science and}} this emphasises <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> bring <b>the</b> study of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament up <b>to</b> date with <b>the</b> modern view of science as a socially and historically determined human activity...|$|R
50|$|In 1913, the new Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof {{was built}} near the {{marshalling}} yard. The freight lines were engineered {{so that they}} largely avoided crossing <b>the</b> passenger lines <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hauptbahnhof. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> Karlsruhe freight yard had been connected directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Rhine Valley Railway on <b>the</b> line <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Hauptbahnhof near <b>the</b> city centre, so the dead-end yard was now only accessible via the bypass {{from the direction of}} Hagsfeld, or via a track construction plant from <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Durlach-Karlsruhe line from the north side or via another track from this line from the south side. The same was true of access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Durlach freight yard.

5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day {{was awarded}} the 2001 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for sound, IGN's Game of the Month for March 2001, and GameSpot's Best Platform Game for 2001. In 2009, Official Nintendo Magazine placed Conker's Bad Fur Day at #97 on their list of 100 Greatest Nintendo Games Ever, and GameTrailers rated it #1 on their list of Top Ten Funniest Games. In 2010, UGO {{included}} the game at #3 on their list of The 11 Weirdest Game Endings. Although the game fared well with critics in both the United Kingdom and United States, it sold worse than expected (only about 55,000 copies as of April 2001), partly due to its prohibitively high cost, advertisements exclusive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> audience, and release {{towards the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle. Nevertheless, the game has enjoyed a cult following due to its unique styling.|$|E
5|$|During the {{beginning}} of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had re-introduced the draft (conscription) in September 1940, and Koval registered for it on January 2, 1941. Raven Electric Company secured him a year's deferment from service until February 1942. According to historian Vladimir Lota, Koval's handlers wanted him to steal information about chemical weapons, and felt {{that he would not}} be able to do so while drafted. When the deferment expired, Koval was inducted into the United States Army. He received basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey before being sent to the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Koval served as a private in the 3410th Specialized Training and Reassignment Unit. On August 11, 1943, he was transferred to the Army Specialized Training Program, a unit established in December 1942 to provide talented enlistees with an education and technical training. Koval attended the City College of New York (CCNY) and studied electrical engineering. His CCNY classmates looked up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Koval as a role model and father figure who never did homework and was a noted ladies' man, never knowing about his Soviet education and wife. Colleagues recalled that he never discussed politics or the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, with Ken Bates now {{owner of}} the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked. The new badge {{featured}} a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications {{such as the use}} of different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned. With the new ownership of Roman Abramovich, and the club's centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 2005–06 season and marked a return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 YEARS' and 'CENTENARY 2005–2006' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.|$|E
