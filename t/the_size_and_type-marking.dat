5000|$|With the {{invention}} of the printing press, books began to be manufactured in large numbers. As paper began to be produced in bulk, page <b>size</b> <b>and</b> shape were increasingly determined by <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> shape of mould which was most practical for producers. As pages became more standardized, so did <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> shape of margins. In general, margins in books have grown smaller over time. The wide margins common during the Renaissance have given way to much narrower proportions. However, there is still much variation depending on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> purpose of <b>the</b> book.|$|R
