5|$|There are two {{contrasting}} views {{regarding the}} marital status of Tulsidas. According to the Mula Gosain Charita {{and some other}} works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the Jyeshta month (May–June) in Vikram 1583 (1526 CE). Ratnavali {{was the daughter of}} Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the Bharadwaja Gotra, who belonged to Mahewa village of Kaushambi district. They had a son named Tarak who died as a toddler. Once when Tulsidas had gone to a Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father's home with her brother. When Tulsidas came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>this,</b> he swam across the Yamuna river in the night to meet his wife. Ratnavali chided Tulsidas for this, and remarked that if Tulsidas was even half as devoted to God as he was to her body of flesh and blood, he would have been redeemed. Tulsidas left her instantly and left for the holy city of Prayag. Here, he renounced the Grihastha (householder's life) stage and became a Sadhu (Hindu ascetic).|$|E

25|$|The ancient Greek {{philosophers}} took {{such questions}} very seriously. Indeed, {{many of their}} general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. Plato (424/423BC 348/347BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic Ideas (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non-material kind of existence, {{in a world of}} mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is discovered by humans. In the Meno Plato's teacher Socrates asserts {{that it is possible to}} come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> truth by a process akin to memory retrieval.|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century, {{modifications}} to syllogism were incorporated {{to deal with}} disjunctive ("A or B") and conditional ("if A then B") statements.

Though there were alternative systems of logic such as Avicennian logic or Indian logic elsewhere, Kant's opinion stood unchallenged in the West until 1879 when Frege published his Begriffsschrift (Concept Script). [...] This introduced a calculus, a method of representing categorical statements (and statements that are not provided for in syllogism as well) {{by the use of}} quantifiers and variables.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was found}} that the speed {{restriction}} sign for the bend at Sandilands was not visible to drivers until the tram had travelled for [...] past the point where braking would need to have been initiated to reach the required speed at the sign, drivers [...] "were expected <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> from their knowledge of the route". At Sandilands, an additional speed restriction was imposed before the curve, and chevron signs were installed to give better warning of the curve. Chevron signs were also installed at three other locations on the Croydon Tramlink system. Following recommendations made in the first interim report into the accident, tram systems in the United Kingdom introduced stepped speed reductions where there was a required reduction in speed of [...] or more. This affected systems in Blackpool, Edinburgh, the West Midlands and Nottingham.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{interim report}} was {{released}} on 20 February 2017. In April 2017, {{it was reported that}} there had been three cases of speeding on the section of line which included the accident site in the period November 2016 – April 2017. In one case, a tram was reported to be doing [...] in a [...] zone. Within the second interim report the RAIB notes that drivers of trams approaching the curve can be expected to sight the curve and the speed restriction sign from 90 meters with full beam headlights on and 60 meters with dipped beam headlights. Although the report states that the tram's braking system was not capable of slowing the tram sufficiently between the point where the speed restriction sign became visible and {{the point at which the}} speed restriction is enforced it also says [...] "There was no sign to indicate to drivers where they should begin to apply the brake for the Sandilands curve; they were expected <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> from their knowledge of the route." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the {{radioisotope}} undergoes positron emission decay (also {{known as}} positive beta decay), it emits a positron, an antiparticle {{of the electron}} with opposite charge. The emitted positron travels in tissue for a short distance (typically less than 1mm, but dependent on the isotope), during which time it loses kinetic energy, until it decelerates {{to a point where}} it can interact with an electron. The encounter annihilates both electron and positron, producing a pair of annihilation (gamma) photons moving in approximately opposite directions. These are detected when they reach a scintillator in the scanning device, creating a burst of light which is detected by photomultiplier tubes or silicon avalanche photodiodes (Si APD). The technique depends on simultaneous or coincident detection of the pair of photons moving in approximately opposite directions (they would be exactly opposite in their [...] center of mass frame, but the scanner has no way <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>this,</b> and so has a built-in slight direction-error tolerance). Photons that do not arrive in temporal [...] "pairs" [...] (i.e. within a timing-window of a few nanoseconds) are ignored.|$|E

Turns out someone's holding a grudge! We were booted off several bills, specifically because Anthony Kiedis did not want us on the bill. He threatened to pull the Chili Peppers if Mr. Bungle was on the bill." [...] In a separate interview, he also clarified that [...] "the rest of the band doesn't care. It's something to do with Anthony." [...] Mr. Bungle's guitarist Trey Spruance added, [...] "We were booked, months in advance, to do eleven festival dates in Europe. Come Summer, we get a call from the three biggest of those festivals, all of them the same day, saying that we can't play, because the headlining band retains the right to hire and fire whomever they wish.

2500|$|In {{his desire}} to become a saint, Dominic {{attempted}} to perform physical penances, like making his bed uncomfortable with small stones and pieces of wood, sleeping with a thin covering in winter, wearing a hair shirt, and fasting on bread and water. When his superiors (i.e., John Bosco, or his Rector, or his confessor) came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>this,</b> they forbade him from doing bodily mortification, as it would affect his health. John Bosco told Dominic that as a schoolboy, the best penance would be to perform all his duties with perfection and humility, and that obedience was the greatest sacrifice. Thus, Dominic formed {{an important aspect of}} his philosophy of life, which was, in his words, [...] "I can't do big things but I want everything to be for the glory of God." [...] Don Bosco notes that from that time on, Dominic did not complain about the food or the weather, unlike some other boys at the Oratory, [...] bore all suffering cheerfully, and practised custody of his eyes and tongue. Eugenio Ceria, a Salesian commentator on the autobiography of John Bosco, (Memoirs of the Oratory of Saint Francis de Sales) notes that by this time, owing to his experience as an educator, John Bosco's ideas on several pedagogical and spiritual principles were well developed and linked and this led him to associate the fulfillment of daily duties with holiness in his advice to Savio.|$|E
2500|$|Sahasrārjunavadhaḥ (Sanskrit: सहस्रार्जुनवधः). Paraśurāma starts {{teaching}} the Vedas. He calls an assembly of Brāhmaṇas ("priest class") {{in which he}} discourses about the essential qualities of a Brāhmaṇa and asks them not to deviate from their duties. He then leaves for a desolate forest to perform penance. Sahasrārjuna comes to the Āśrama of Jamadagni when Paraśurāma is away. Jamadagni welcomes him and his army by using the services of the wish-granting cow Kāmadhenu. Sahasrārjuna requests Jamadagni to give Kāmadhenu to him, saying that being the king he deserves all the treasures in his kingdom. When Jamadagni refuses, Sahasrārjuna takes Kāmadhenu away by force to his capital Māhiṣmatī. Paraśurāma is enraged <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> when he returns, and sets out alone to [...] Māhiṣmatī to get Kāmadhenu back. On reaching Māhiṣmatī, he challenges Sahasrārjuna to war, which Sahasrārjuna accepts. Paraśurāma kills Sahasrārjuna's whole army. A fierce battle between Paraśurāma and Sahasrārjuna follows {{in which the two}} use divine arrows. Paraśurāma then decides he has let Sahasrārjuna entertain him for long in the theatre of war. Paraśurāma at once splits each of his five hundred bows asunder. Then he destroys the chariot of Sahasrārjuna. Sahasrārjuna then goes and attacks Paraśurāma in a duel. Paraśurāma chops off all the thousand arms of Sahasrārjuna with his axe before using the axe to behead him. The deities extol Paraśurāma for ending the menace of Sahasrārjuna. Paraśurāma returns victorious with Kāmadhenu to his Āśrama and is welcomed by everybody.|$|E
