5|$|Osorkon ruled {{during one}} of the most chaotic and {{politically}} fragmented periods of ancient Egypt, in which the Nile Delta was dotted with small Libyan kingdoms and principalities and Meshwesh dominions; as the last heir of the Tanite rulers, he inherited the easternmost parts of these kingdoms, the most involved in all the political and military upheavals that soon would afflict the Near East. During his reign, he had to face the power, and ultimately submit himselfâ€”to the Kushite King Piye during Piye's conquest of Egypt. Osorkon IV also had to deal with <b>the</b> <b>threatening</b> Neo-Assyrian Empire outside his eastern borders.|$|E
5|$|Peckinpah {{originally}} wanted actor Jack Palance to {{play the}} role of Rudy Butler but could not afford his salary. Impressed by his performance in The Panic in Needle Park (1971), Hill recommended Richard Bright. Bright had worked with McQueen fourteen years before, but he did not have <b>the</b> <b>threatening</b> physique that McQueen pictured for Butler because the two men were the same height. Due to his friendship with Bright, Peckinpah cast him as the con man. Al Lettieri was brought to Peckinpah's attention for the role of Butler by producer Albert S. Ruddy, who was working with the actor on The Godfather (1972). Like Peckinpah, Lettieri was a heavy drinker, which caused problems while filming due to his unpredictable behavior.|$|E

5|$|Submarine {{films like}} Robert Wise's 1958 Run Silent, Run Deep {{constitute}} a distinctive subgenre {{of the war}} film, depicting the stress of submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, as well as <b>the</b> <b>threatening</b> sounds of a destroyer's propellor and of an approaching torpedo.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{documentary}} {{account of}} Gibraltar {{is available for}} the period following the Madinat al-Fath project, {{there are reasons to}} believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of Tarifa in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that Sancho would lay siege to Algeciras (it did not eventually happen) in order to sever the most direct links of the Marinids with the Iberian peninsula. <b>The</b> <b>threatening</b> presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have led to the establishment of a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would have protected the rearguard of Algeciras and provide a fallback position should Algeciras have fallen. At the same time, and with the increased presence of the Christian fleets in the Straits, Gibraltar provided an excellent lookout post.|$|E

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where <b>the</b> <b>threatening</b> action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on <b>the</b> <b>threatening</b> aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E
5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation {{and the perception}} of imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, he met with the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. <b>The</b> <b>threatening</b> tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E
