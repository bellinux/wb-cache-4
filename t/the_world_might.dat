25|$|Brave New World Revisited (Harper & Brothers, US, 1958; Chatto & Windus, UK, 1959), {{written by}} Huxley {{almost thirty years}} after Brave New World, is a non-fiction work in which Huxley {{considered}} whether the world had moved toward or away from {{his vision of the}} future from the 1930s. He believed when he wrote the original novel that it was a reasonable guess as to where <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>might</b> go in the future. In Brave New World Revisited, he concluded that the world was becoming like Brave New World much faster than he originally thought.|$|E
25|$|Edward Fredkin and Konrad Zuse {{pioneered the}} idea of a computable universe, the former by writing a line in his book on how <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>might</b> be like a {{cellular}} automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt. It has been claimed that NKS tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe if a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame. Jürgen Schmidhuber has also charged that his work on Turing machine-computable physics was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.|$|E

500|$|McCormack {{enrolled}} at Ryerson University School of Theatre in Toronto to further improve his acting. He left Ryerson in 1985, {{several months before}} graduating, [...] to accept a position with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, where he spent five seasons performing. [...] "It was all I wanted, to be a classical actor {{for the rest of}} my life, but during the last couple of years I was there, I started to realise that it wasn't for me. Perhaps I didn't have to give my Hamlet before I died, that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>might</b> be an OK place without my Hamlet, in fact." [...] McCormack appeared in the productions A Midsummer Night's Dream, Henry V, Murder in the Cathedral and Three Sisters. McCormack later performed with the Manitoba Theatre Centre in a production of Burn This, as well as with Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre in Biloxi Blues.|$|E
500|$|While Christian theologians {{held that}} the natural world {{was part of an}} unchanging {{designed}} hierarchy, some theologians speculated that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>might</b> have developed through natural processes. Thomas Aquinas went even farther than Augustine of Hippo in arguing that scriptural texts like Genesis should not be interpreted in a literal way that conflicted with or constrained what natural philosophers learned about the workings of the natural world. He saw that the autonomy of nature was a sign of God's goodness, and detected no conflict between a divinely created universe and the idea that the universe had developed over time through natural mechanisms. However, Aquinas disputed the views of those (like the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles) who held that such natural processes showed that the universe could have developed without an underlying purpose. Aquinas rather held that: [...] "Hence, it is clear that nature is nothing but a certain kind of art, i.e., the divine art, impressed upon things, by which these things are moved to a determinate end. It is as if the shipbuilder were able to give to timbers that by which they would move themselves to {{take the form of a}} ship." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics responded {{positively}} to the film. In {{an article in}} The Times David Chater awarded the programme the TV choice of the day, describing it as [...] "tremendous", and [...] "the wonderful surprise of Christmas". The film was described in The Telegraph as a [...] "rare treat", as it is [...] "something that teenagers and parents can watch together". This view was shared by producer Anne Brogan, {{who said that the}} film was something [...] "that parents and children will enjoy watching while giving them much to talk about". Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, said Stevenson was [...] "good as a woman who was far more comfortable in the past than the present", and that [...] "her performance was more than matched by that of Dakota Blue Richards as April, mostly banked-down and wary but prone to sudden wild flashes of anger". He criticised some of the [...] "implausibilities", saying that the plot was, at times, [...] "a lot kinder than <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>might</b> have been", but said that [...] "it still made you well up with its final reconciliation" [...] with emotion that had been [...] "honestly earned". Euan Ferguson, in an article in The Guardian, said that the film [...] "hooked and haunted", and added that Stevenson played Marion like [...] "a kind of updated" [...] Jean Brodie.|$|E
30|$|Finally, several {{creative}} {{attempts have}} been made to use objective measures of presence based on user performance or behavior. For example, Slater and Usoh [65] examined presence by examining participant reactions to simulated objects flying towards their head. Presence is also thought to be a factor of attentional resource allocation [85], meaning increased presence is a result of increased attention. Therefore, performance on a secondary task performed concurrently in <b>the</b> real <b>world</b> <b>might</b> be used to infer an individual’s level of spare attention [77]. However, a drawback to this approach is that a secondary task located outside <b>the</b> virtual <b>world</b> <b>might</b> in itself be distracting and lower presence.|$|R

500|$|Webster {{retired in}} June 1970. The music critic Charles Osborne wrote, [...] "When he retired, he {{handed over to}} his {{successor}} an organization of which any opera house in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>might</b> be proud. No memorial could be more appropriate". The successor was Webster's former assistant, John Tooley. One of Webster's last important decisions had been to recommend to the board that Colin Davis should be invited to take over as musical director when Solti left in 1971. It was announced in advance that Davis would work in tandem with Peter Hall, appointed director of productions. Peter Brook had briefly held that title in the company's early days, but in general the managerial structure of the opera company differed markedly {{from that of the}} ballet. The latter had always had its own director, subordinate to {{the chief executive of the}} opera house but with, in practice, a great degree of autonomy. The chief executive of the opera house and the musical director exercised considerably more day-to-day control over the opera company [...] Appointing a substantial theatrical figure such as Hall was an important departure. Hall, however, changed his mind, and did not take up the appointment, going instead to run the National Theatre. His defection, and the departure to Australian Opera of the staff conductor Edward Downes, a noted Verdi expert, left the company weakened on both production and musical sides.|$|E

2500|$|In 1928, Orwell {{began his}} career as a {{professional}} writer in Paris at a journal owned by the French Communist Henri Barbusse. His first article, [...] "La Censure en Angleterre", was an attempt to account for the 'extraordinary and illogical' moral censorship of plays and novels then practised in Britain. His own explanation was that the rise of the [...] "puritan middle class," [...] who had stricter morals than the aristocracy, tightened the rules of censorship in the 19th century. Orwell's first published article in his home country, [...] "A Farthing Newspaper", was a critique of the new French daily the Ami de Peuple. This paper was sold much more cheaply than most others, and was intended for ordinary people to read. Orwell pointed out that its proprietor François Coty also owned the right-wing dailies Le Figaro and Le Gaulois, which the Ami de Peuple was supposedly competing against. Orwell suggested that cheap newspapers were no more than a vehicle for advertising and anti-leftist propaganda, and predicted <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>might</b> soon see free newspapers which would drive legitimate dailies out of business.|$|E

2500|$|The Oregon years saw an {{increased}} emphasis on Rajneesh's prediction that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>might</b> be destroyed by nuclear war or other disasters sometime in the 1990s. Rajneesh had said as early as 1964 that [...] "the third and last war {{is now on the}} way" [...] and frequently spoke of the need to create a [...] "new humanity" [...] to avoid global suicide. This now became the basis for a new exclusivism, and a 1983 article in the Rajneesh Foundation Newsletter announcing that [...] "Rajneeshism is creating a Noah's Ark of consciousness... I say to you that except this there is no other way", increased the sense of urgency in building the Oregon commune. In March 1984, Sheela announced that Rajneesh had predicted the death of two-thirds of humanity from AIDS. Sannyasins were required to wear rubber gloves and condoms if they had sex, and to refrain from kissing, measures widely represented in the press as an extreme over-reaction since condoms were not usually recommended for AIDS prevention because AIDS was considered a homosexual disease at that stage.|$|E
2500|$|On February 19, 2017, Robert Allen wrote a {{piece for}} the Detroit Free Press, which was republished by USA Today about Voris that also invoked Bannon. The article {{declared}} that Voris' studio in Ferndale was [...] "the nerve center for a growing, religious group hoping the forces that elected President Donald Trump will tear down the wall between church and state." [...] The article called Voris' apostolate [...] "a fringe group claiming to be Catholic but denounced by the church, [...] broadcasts pro-life, anti-gay, anti-feminist, Islam-fearing content on its website". It noted that Voris had dismissed Trump's past moral problems by making an analogy with Constantine the Great, whom Voris called a [...] "power-hungry egomaniac" [...] but {{who served as a}} human vessel by which God ended Christian persecution and protected Christianity. Voris was quoted saying, [...] "The personal proclivities, the personal sins or life of a particular leader is a separate discussion from how that man's view of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>might</b> influence his policies. And if that policy is favorable to the church, well then, very good." [...] The article held that [...] "Many of Church Militant's headlines are similar to those on Breitbart News, the far-right news organization that White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon previously ran." [...] It noted [...] "Many of Breitbart's articles are cited on the Church Militant website. But unlike Breitbart, Church Militant is under a Christian, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization." ...|$|E
2500|$|A few {{writers of}} the first six centuries AD speak of a relic known to be still in {{existence}} and venerated by the faithful. St. Paulinus of Nola, writing after 409, refers to [...] "the thorns with which Our Saviour was crowned" [...] as relics held in honour along with the Cross {{to which he was}} nailed and the pillar at which he was scourged (Epistle Macarius in Migne, Patrologia Latina, LXI, 407). Cassiodorus (c. 570), when commenting on Psalm lxxxvi, speaks of the crown of thorns among the other relics which are the glory of the earthly Jerusalem. [...] "There", he says, [...] "we may behold the thorny crown, which was only set upon the head of Our Redeemer in order that all the thorns of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>might</b> be gathered together and broken" [...] (Migne, LXX, 621). When Gregory of Tours in De gloria martyri avers that the thorns in the crown still looked green, a freshness which was miraculously renewed each day, he does not much strengthen the historical authenticity of a relic he had not seen, but the Breviarius, and the itinerary of Antoninus of Piacenza (6th century) clearly state that the crown of thorns was currently shown in the church on Mount Zion. From these fragments of evidence and others of later date (the [...] "Pilgrimage" [...] of the monk Bernard shows that the relic was still at Mount Zion in 870), it is likely that a purported crown of thorns was venerated at Jerusalem from the fifth century for several hundred years.|$|E
