5|$|The Maya had few {{domestic}} animals; {{dogs were}} domesticated by 3000 BC, and the Muscovy duck by the Late Postclassic. Ocellated turkeys were unsuitable for domestication, but were rounded {{up in the}} wild and penned for fattening. All of these were used as food animals; dogs were additionally used for hunting. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>deer</b> were also penned and fattened.|$|E
25|$|Multiple Taiwanese Aboriginal {{villages in}} {{frontier}} areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to acts of oppression, {{such as when}} the Dutch ordered that aboriginal women {{be turned over to}} them for sex, and when they demanded <b>that</b> <b>deer</b> pelts and rice be given to them by aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village, sparking a rebellion in December 1652. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and two additional Dutch people died, after an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan. The aboriginals were forced to sue for peace in February 1653.|$|E
500|$|MD24 and US1 head {{northeast}} {{together as}} a four-lane undivided highway. [...] The two highways pass under Vale Road before reaching {{the northern end of}} the concurrency, which is a partial cloverleaf interchange with Rock Spring Road. [...] This road heads south toward downtown Bel Air as MD924; MD24 leaves US1 and heads north on this road. [...] The state highway heads north through a commercial area as a five-lane road with center turn lane. [...] The highway reduces to two lanes and passes through another commercial area before its intersection with MD23 (EastWest Highway) in Forest Hill. [...] At Jarrettsville Road, which is the old alignment of MD23, MD24's name changes to Rocks Road and enters a mix of farmland and forest. [...] The state highway crosses Stirrup Run before beginning to closely parallel Deer Creek. [...] MD24 passes through several sharp curves as the highway enters Rocks State Park, where the state highway passes through the gorge <b>that</b> <b>Deer</b> Creek has cut through Rock Ridge.

40|$|Mites of {{the genus}} Psoroptes {{frequently}} infest bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in southwestern North America. Although based on a small sample (n = 15), evidence from the San Bernardino Mountains, California, previously suggested <b>that</b> mule <b>deer</b> (Odocoileus hemionus) sympatric with bighorn sheep were not infested with Psoroptes mites and, thus, were not a likely source of mites occurring on bighorn sheep. We examined 34 additional mule <b>deer</b> <b>that</b> were sympatric with bighorn sheep and detected no clinical evidence of Psoroptes infestation, providing additional support for the conclusion of Singer et al.

50|$|Optimal Foraging Theory is a {{model for}} {{predicting}} animal behavior while looking for food or other resource, such as shelter or water.

For example, the model {{would be used to}} look at the browsing behavior of a deer while looking for food, as well as <b>that</b> <b>deer's</b> specific location and movement within the forested habitat and its interaction with other <b>deer</b> while in <b>that</b> habitat.|$|R

60|$|The gaucho also affirms <b>that</b> the <b>deer</b> cherishes a {{wonderful}} animosity against snakes; {{that it becomes}} greatly excited when it sees one, and proceeds at once to destroy it; they say, by running round and round it in a circle, emitting its violent smell in larger measure, until the snake dies of suffocation.

60|$|When I ran {{to examine}} the back trail more carefully, I found <b>that</b> the <b>deer</b> had passed {{the night in a}} dense thicket of evergreen, on a hilltop {{overlooking}} the road.

One might have passed along the road a score of times without noticing that game had crossed.
