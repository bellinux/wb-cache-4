500|$|Reviewing the premiere, Terri Schwartz of IGN {{praised the}} {{introduction}} of Ghost Rider and subsequent darker tone which [...] "will eventually allow [...] to sit more comfortably beside its corporate cousins over on Netflix", but did feel {{that there were some}} [...] "growing pains" [...] with the transition to more mature material. The A.V. Clubs Alex McCown-Levy called it [...] "a standard first episode back, in that it once again does a lot of table-setting, and not always in the most compelling manner". Levy felt that Ghost Rider's introduction was handled well for non-comic fans discovering the character with the show, but that the new positions of the series' main characters were more interesting and should have been focused on more. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said, [...] "I’m nervous for Season 4 overall, especially if said reinvention doesn’t goose the ratings like Marvel and ABC hope, but “The Ghost” is reason enough for some casual optimism." [...] He was positive about the new similarities to the darker series Daredevil, but felt that the series [...] "doesn’t have the firmest handle" [...] on Ghost Rider yet. Evan Valentine, writing for Collider.com, said that the series [...] "certainly benefits somewhat from taking a page from" [...] the Marvel Netflix series, highlighting the number of more mature elements in the episode's opening as [...] "a nice introduction <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> this may not exactly be the same show you’ve gotten to know over the years." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times extolled the film's {{ensemble}} voice {{talent and}} elaborate musical sequences, and declared Frozen was [...] "a welcome return to greatness for Walt Disney Animation Studios." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] grade and labeled it as a [...] "squarely enchanting fairy tale <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> how {{the definition of}} what's fresh in animation can shift." [...] Richard Corliss of Time stated that: [...] "It's great to see Disney returning to its roots and blooming anew: creating superior musical entertainment that draws on the Walt [...] tradition of animation splendor and the verve of Broadway present." [...] Richard Roeper wrote that the film was an [...] "absolute delight from start to finish." [...] Both Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune and Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the film's characters and musical sequences, which also drew comparisons to the theatrics found in Wicked. Emma Dibdin of Digital Spy awarded the film five out of five stars and called the film [...] "a new Disney classic" [...] and [...] "an exhilarating, joyous, human story that's as frequently laugh-out-loud funny as it is startling and daring and poignant. Hot {{on the heels of}} the 90th anniversary, it's impossible to imagine a more perfect celebration of everything Disney is at its best." [...] Frozen was also praised in Norwegian Sámi media as showcasing Sámi culture to a broad audience in a good way. Composer Frode Fjellheim was lauded by Norwegian Sámi President Aili Keskitalo for his contributions to the film, during the President's 2014 New Year's speech.|$|E
500|$|Evan Valentine, {{writing for}} Collider.com, gave the episode a [...] "good" [...] rating of 3 stars out of 5, {{saying that the}} series [...] "certainly {{benefits}} somewhat from taking a page from" [...] Daredevil and Jessica Jones, highlighting the number of more mature elements in the episode's opening as [...] "a nice introduction <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> this may not exactly be the same show you’ve gotten to know over the years." [...] Valentine called Robbie Reyes [...] "satisfactory" [...] and the Ghost Rider [...] "where things really shined"; [...] "ABC pretty much nail the look , and while he's obviously been tweaked to more accurately portray this new interpretation of the Spirit of Vengeance, he looks great in motion all the same ... his car has a particularly cool scene where it transforms mid air and lands in a fiery blast." [...] He called the Ghost Rider/Quake fight a highlight, and the latter's health issues [...] "an interesting twist". He concluded saying, [...] "the show still has all the flaws and strengths that [...] is known for ... if you're looking to rejoin your favorite agents for another solid romp with the added twist of throwing Ghost Rider into the mix, this one's for you." [...] Marc Buxton, also of Den of Geek, gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it [...] "a fun way {{to kick off the}} new season". He criticized the Ghost Rider transformation scene as [...] "way too CGI cartoony" [...] and negatively compared it to Grimm, but otherwise said that [...] "Ghost Rider feels right" [...] and much improved over the Nicolas Cage Ghost Rider films. He also criticized the opening shots of Johnson, calling them [...] "misogynistic" [...] and saying, [...] "Seriously Marvel, you’re better than that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Atkin's musical {{settings}} drew most {{of their}} inspiration from Tin Pan Alley, although in the above-mentioned Carnations on the Roof he set a somber description of a working class life to themes characteristic of Tamla Motown. [...] Often Atkin turned James' intentions upside down, as with The Last Hill <b>That</b> <b>Shows</b> <b>You</b> All The Valley, which James wrote as a dirge but which Atkin set to a thumping, angry rock beat. [...] The combination worked as James' mournful cataloguing of man's inhumanity to man became a cry of protest.|$|E
2500|$|Cage {{was born}} September 5, 1912, at Good Samaritan Hospital in {{downtown}} Los Angeles. His father, John Milton Cage, Sr. (1886–1964), was an inventor, and his mother, Lucretia ("Crete") Harvey (1885–1969), worked intermittently {{as a journalist}} for the Los Angeles Times. The family's roots were deeply American: in a 1976 interview, Cage mentioned that George Washington was assisted by an ancestor named John Cage in the task of surveying the Colony of Virginia. Cage described his mother as a woman with [...] "a sense of society" [...] who was [...] "never happy", while his father is perhaps best characterized by his inventions: sometimes idealistic, such as a diesel-fueled submarine that gave off exhaust bubbles, the senior Cage being uninterested in an undetectable submarine; others revolutionary and against the scientific norms, such as the [...] "electrostatic field theory" [...] of the universe. John Milton Sr. taught his son that [...] "if someone says 'can't' <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> what to do." [...] In 1944–45 Cage wrote two small character pieces dedicated to his parents: Crete and Dad. The latter is a short lively piece that ends abruptly, while [...] "Crete" [...] is a slightly longer, mostly melodic contrapuntal work.|$|E

If I'd gone slow and played a timid waiting-game, she'd have thought that before I married Millie, instead of afterwards. I give you my honest word, laddie, {{that there was a}} time, towards the middle of our acquaintance--after she had stopped mixing me up with the man who came to wind the clocks--when that woman ate out of my hand!

"Beginning with a {{critique}} of my own limbs, which she said, justly enough, were nothing to write home about, this girl went on to dissect my manners, morals, intellect, general physique, and method of eating asparagus with such acerbity {{that by the time}} she had finished the best you could say of Bertram was that, so far as was known, he had never actually committed murder or set fire to an orphan asylum. Subsequent investigation proved that she was engaged to the fellow with the legs and had had a slight disagreement with him the evening before on the subject of whether she should or should not have made an original call of two spades, having seven, but without the ace.

For at the close the King put up his hand to command silence, and so waited, with his hand up, till every sound was dead {{and it was as}} if one could almost the stillness, so profound it was. Then out of some remote corner of that vast place there rose a plaintive voice, and in tones most tender and sweet and rich came floating through that enchanted hush our poor old simple song [...] "L'Arbre Fee Bourlemont!" [...] and then Joan broke down and put her face in her hands and cried. Yes, you see, all in a moment the pomps and grandeurs dissolved away and she was a little child again herding her sheep with the tranquil pastures stretched about her, and war and wounds and blood and death and the mad frenzy and turmoil of battle a dream.

Some people would like to have every business tied down to a maximum turnover and so much a year profit. I dare say you've been hearing of these articles in the London Lion. Pretty stuff it is, too. This fuss about the little shopkeepers; that's a new racket. I've had all that row about the waitresses before, and the yarn about the Normandy eggs, and all that, but I don't see that you need go reading it against me, and bringing it up at the breakfast-table. A business is {{a business}}, it isn't a charity, and I'd like to know where you and I would be if we didn't run the concern on business lines.... Why, that London Lion fellow came to me with the first two of those articles before the thing began.

[...] "The fact is, the old man has always been more or less suspected of persistent Pélé worship. Beliefs like that don't die out in a single generation. But you needn't be afraid on that account that he'll do you any bodily harm now. Pélé cares nothing for unwilling victims. She takes those only who go to her willingly. You fell in of yourself, and therefore Kalaua wouldn't pull you out. To have done so would have been to incur the severest wrath of Pélé. But now that you've once got safe out again, every good old-fashioned heathen Hawaiian will hold to it as a cardinal article of faith, that you're absolutely inviolable. The goddess had you once in her power, and of her own free will she has let you go again. If she liked, she might have eaten you, but she let you go. <b>That</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> are one for whom she has a special concern and regard. The moment you got up in safety to the brink once more, the lava fell back. To Kalaua, that would be a certain sign and token that Pélé relinquished all claim upon your body. She may take some other victim, unawares, in your stead: but you yourself, the Hawaiians believe, are henceforth and for ever next door to invulnerable. You are Taboo to Pélé.|$|E
