25|$|It is, however, not trivial {{to compare}} the power density {{produced}} by different fusion fuel cycles. The case most favorable to p–11B relative to D-T fuel is a (hypothetical) confinement device that only works well at ion temperatures above about 400 keV, in which the reaction rate parameter v> is equal for the two fuels, and that runs with low electron temperature. p–11B does not require as long a confinement time because the energy of its charged products is <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>times</b> higher than that for D-T. However, relaxing these assumptions, for example by considering hot electrons, by allowing the D-T reaction to run at a lower temperature or by including {{the energy of the}} neutrons in the calculation shifts the power density advantage to D-T.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} credit {{financing}} was also tailored to UK wartime needs. The UK {{agreed to pay}} for defence expenditures {{over and above the}} amount that India had paid in peacetime (adjusted for inflation). However, their purchases were made entirely on credit accumulated in the Bank of England and not redeemable until after the war. At the same time, the Bank of India was permitted to treat those credits as assets against which it could print currency up to <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>times</b> more than the total debt incurred. India's money printing presses then began running overtime, printing the currency that paid for all these massive defence expenditures. The tremendous rise in nominal money supply spurred monetary inflation, reaching its peak in 1944–45. The accompanying rise in incomes and purchasing power fell disproportionately into the hands of industries in Calcutta (in particular, munitions industries).|$|E

25|$|Composition is {{calculated}} from three primary sources: albedo, surface spectrum, and density. The last {{can only be}} determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons {{has turned out to}} be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280km in diameter, and include 121 Hermione (268×186×183km), and 87 Sylvia (384×262×232km). Only half a dozen asteroids are larger than 87 Sylvia, though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed 511 Davida, the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>times</b> as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.|$|E
