Meanwhile, the area's high school had continued to grow until, along with the barangay schools at Tanyag, Iriron and Concepcion, it became a national high school (CNHS) by executive order of Aquino. Sison's successor, attorney Eric Labrador (who had briefly served during <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> unrest) returned to office in 1995 and continued to oversee construction until the 1998 election of Renato Paulino.

25|$|Meena Kumari was {{a patient}} of chronic {{insomnia}} {{and was on}} sleeping pills {{for a long time}} {{since the days of the}} telephoning conversations with Kamal Amrohi. During 1963, Dr. Saeed Timurza, her physician, then prescribed a small peg of brandy as a sleeping pill alternative and this was officially how she came into contact with the habit that was to kill her. Somehow this prescribed peg of brandy turned into heavy drinking after her separation from her husband. Meena Kumari and Kamal Amrohi never formally divorced, but separated in 1964. During <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> separation from her husband, Kumari's name was associated with Rahul, Gulzar, Dharmendra and Sawan Kumar Tak.|$|E

The result was Rice without Rain, a story centering on Jinda, a seventeen-year-old girl from the fictitious Maekung Village which was caught up in the political winds sweeping across the country when a group of university students from Bangkok arrived to encourage the landless farmers to take up a rent resistance movement. Set against the very same historical background as Ho had experienced herself, Jinda's realization that the peasant class was but pawns in the ongoing political tug-of-war and her journey to find her own path in life told the untold stories during <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> turmoil that shrouded Thailand.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{promises}} made to Londoners when {{they won the}} right to host the 2012 Olympic Games was that the Olympic Park would be a “blueprint for sustainable living.” However, residents of the allotments of Manor Road were relocated, due to the building of the Olympic stadium, and would later disagree that the Olympics had had any positive effect on their lives. Allotments, originally, were intended to provide low-income residents with a plot of land on which to grow their own food, thus receiving the dual health benefits of a supply of fresh food and outdoor work. Many of these sites were lost {{as a result of the}} Olympic venue construction, most notably the Manor Road site. Residents were promised that the allotments would be returned, and they eventually were. However, the soil quality would never be the same. Crops tended by allotment residents were the result of years of careful cultivation, and thus, <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> care and attention were destroyed by a bulldozer. Further, allotment residents were exposed to radioactive waste for five months prior to moving, during the excavation of the site for the Games. Other local residents, construction workers, and onsite archeologists faced similar exposures and risks.|$|E

500|$|Headbangers {{showed little}} {{interest}} in political and social problems, finding in each other's company, in the consumption of beer and in the music, the means to escape their bleak reality; for this reason they were often accused of nihilism or escapism. In contrast with punks, they loved musicianship and made idols of virtuoso guitarists and vocalists, viewing the live show as the full realisation of their status. The fans were very loyal to the music, {{to each other and}} to the bands with whom they shared origins and from whom they required coherence with their values, authenticity and continuous accessibility. To depart from this strict code meant being marked as a [...] "sell out" [...] or [...] "poseur" [...] and being somewhat excluded from the community. The lyrics of the song [...] "Denim and Leather" [...] by Saxon reflect precisely the condition of British metalheads in <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> great enthusiasm. Access to this male-dominated world for female musicians and fans was not easy, and only women who adapted to their male counterparts' standards and codes were accepted, as attested by Girlschool and Rock Goddess, the only notable all-female metal bands of that era.|$|E

Vicky Prior of the Metro described that there is [...] "no love lost" [...] between Babe and Stan, and speculated that Babe and Stan may have had an affair. Katy Brent-Stacey of the Daily Mirror said Babe's life was [...] "wasted" [...] because she spent it [...] "hoping that Stan would notice her". Miller (Daily Express) described Babe as being [...] "madly in love" [...] with Stan. All About Soap said that [...] "all <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> unrequited love [...] made Babe pretty bitter". Shelley (Daily Mail) was critical of Babe's feelings for Stan, writing, [...] " [...] only made worse by the scriptwriters' occasional, predictable, attempts at trying to evoke viewers' sympathy over her lovelorn feelings for her sister's husband Stan." [...] When Stan is diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, Babe is [...] "devastated" [...] at the prospect of losing him. Stan becomes engaged to Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) and when his health deteriorates, they decide to marry quickly. Babe attempts to ruin it by bringing Sylvie to see Stan, but they decide to marry nevertheless. Babe is delighted when Stan is physically unable to say his vows, but is devastated when he dies.

The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post 1940s areas.

When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls.

2500|$|However, Lithuania's {{economic}} transition {{left the}} country in a difficult financial situation, and LKF could hardly count on state funding. As a result, the team had to search for the financial supporters by themselves in order to play internationally. Šarūnas Marčiulionis had experience and contacts in the United States for being the first USSR player in the NBA, playing for the Golden State Warriors. Consequently, he, along with Donnie Nelson (son of Marčiulionis' then-coach Don Nelson), searched for financial supporters that could finance Lithuania's participation in the international games and the 1992 Summer Olympics. George Shirk wrote a story about this on the San Francisco Chronicle, and once American rock band Grateful Dead read the newspaper, they decided to help the team. Drummer Mickey Hart added that the story resonated with the bandmembers for being a [...] "a struggle for life, liberty and freedom." [...] The bandmembers donated $5,000 to Marčiulionis, and helped launch a tie-dyed jerseys trade that would feature Lithuania's national colors, and the iconic, trademarked 'Slam-Dunking Skeleton' created by N.Y. artist [...] The skeleton dunking a flaming basketball, nicknamed [...] "Skully", was the artist's interpretation of how the Lithuanian team rose from the ashes to victory. [...] The artist's profits would be passed onto the Lithuania national basketball team and a fund for Lithuanian children. The Lithuanians were favourable to the garish shirts because, according to Nelson, it was a great contrast to [...] "all <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> those Soviet colors, nothing but blues and grays". Arvydas Sabonis even said that [...] "My first impression of [...] was: Wow, this really is a free Lithuania". The skeleton, nicknamed [...] "Skully", was enshrined into the Basketball Hall of Fame, being the only cartoon character to be enshrined in any sports Hall of Fame.

40|$|Objective Following the {{licensure}} of 23 -valent {{pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine}} (23 vPPV) in 1989, a risk-group–only immunization {{policy was}} implemented in 1992 in England. The PPV programme was extended in 2003 to include all individuals 65 years and over. In England, this was phased in over 3 years. To ascertain {{the performance of the}} risk group policy in <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> age and over and provide a baseline to estimate the impact of the universal elderly programme. Methods Information was gathered on vaccine uptake for the period 1989 – 2003 in England from a national survey of general practitioners (GPs) through NHS primary care trusts (PCTs), the prescription cost analysis (PCA) system and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Results Between 1991 and 2003, 4. 5 million doses of PPV were prescribed. The GP survey found that by 2003, 29 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> and over <b>of</b> age and 36 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> age over had received PPV.
