5|$|In December 2000, {{a fourth}} {{passenger}} <b>terminal</b> was opened: the Domestic Express <b>Terminal,</b> located {{to the south}} of the main <b>terminal</b> building at a cost of $9 million. It was the first additional passenger <b>terminal</b> facility to be built at Melbourne Airport since 1971.|$|E
5|$|<b>Terminal</b> 2 handles all international, {{and limited}} domestic, flights out of Melbourne Airport, and was opened in 1970. The <b>terminal</b> has 20 gates with aerobridges. Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas (which {{includes}} two lounges in <b>Terminal</b> 2, a First lounge and a Business lounge/Qantas Club), Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand, Etihad Airways and Emirates all operate airline lounges in the <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Terminal</b> 2 {{opened in}} December 1991 as the Charter/International <b>Terminal,</b> serving all {{international}} flights and some domestic flights to the airport. It was {{located at the}} site of two previous terminals, one for PSA Airlines and the other for American Airlines. The PSA <b>terminal</b> was converted to an international <b>terminal</b> before both terminals were demolished to make room for a single <b>Terminal</b> 2. It had two stories and eight gates (T2-1 through T2-8), four of which could receive international flights. <b>Terminal</b> 2 closed upon the opening of <b>Terminal</b> 3, and it was demolished in early 2016.|$|E

5|$|<b>Terminal</b> 3 {{opened with}} the airport as the Ansett Australia <b>terminal,</b> {{but is now}} owned by Melbourne Airport. <b>Terminal</b> 3 is home to Virgin Australia. It has eleven parking bays served by single aerobridges and eight parking bays not {{equipped}} with aerobridges.|$|E
5|$|<b>Terminal</b> 4 – {{originally}} {{called the}} Domestic Express or South <b>Terminal</b> – {{is dedicated to}} budget airlines and is the first facility of its kind at a conventional airport in Australia. It was originally constructed for Virgin Blue (Virgin Australia) and Impulse Airlines. Virgin Blue eventually moved into <b>Terminal</b> 3 following the demise of Ansett. A$5million refit began in June 2007 {{along the lines of}} the budget <b>terminal</b> model at Singapore Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Lower landing and airport handling fees are charged to airlines due to the basic facilities, lack of jet bridges, and fewer amenities and retail outlets compared to a conventional <b>terminal.</b> However, the <b>terminal</b> is located next to the main <b>terminal</b> building, unlike in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The <b>terminal</b> was rebuilt by Tiger Airways Australia, which has used it as its main hub since it operated its first domestic flight on 23 November 2007.|$|E
5|$|The All Terminals loop, {{an airport}} <b>terminal</b> circulator, serves the six <b>terminal</b> {{stations}} (<b>Terminal</b> 1, <b>Terminal</b> 2, <b>Terminal</b> 4, <b>Terminal</b> 5, <b>Terminal</b> 7, and <b>Terminal</b> 8). It operates {{in the opposite}} direction as the Howard Beach and Jamaica branches, making a continuous clockwise loop around the terminals. Connections to the Q3, Q10 and B15 local buses are available at <b>Terminal</b> 5.|$|E
25|$|Logan International Airport has 102 gate {{positions}} total, {{divided among}} four <b>terminals,</b> A, B, C and E. All <b>terminals</b> are connected by pre-security shuttle buses {{and by the}} SL1 branch of the MBTA Silver Line BRT, {{as well as between}} <b>Terminals</b> A, B and E via pre-security moving walkways. Moving walkways also connect the <b>terminals</b> to a central parking garage designed for consolidated service between all four <b>terminals</b> and the garage itself. Massport ultimately plans to connect all <b>terminals</b> and gates post-security, thereby allowing for seamless connections between flights from different <b>terminals.</b> The concession program at the airport is developed, leased and managed by AirMall USA (formerly BAA USA) in <b>Terminals</b> B and E and Westfield Concession Management Inc. in <b>Terminals</b> A and C.|$|R

50|$|Zinc battery <b>terminals</b> are an {{environmentally}} friendly alternative to lead battery <b>terminals.</b> These types of battery <b>terminals</b> were {{designed as a}} result of environmental directives such as Proposition 65 and ROHS.

5|$|Airport {{security}} was introduced on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} <b>terminal</b> capacity and the <b>terminal</b> had to be expanded. Makeshift solutions were used, such as plywood boards to allocate people through the security check. In late 2004, the airport started planning an all-new <b>terminal</b> building, as the old <b>terminal</b> was deemed both too small and out of date. Construction of the NOK-115-million <b>terminal</b> started on 24 October 2006. As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based landing system, on 29 October 2007. The new <b>terminal</b> opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored indoors and included a new helicopter <b>terminal.</b> Thon Hotel Torghatten opened in October 2009 and an airport surveillance radar was installed in 2010, making Brønnøysund the first regional airport in Norway to have one.|$|E
5|$|Although {{described}} as a satellite <b>terminal,</b> the <b>terminal</b> building is connected by an above-ground corridor to <b>Terminal</b> 2. Departures {{take place on the}} lower deck (similar to the A380 boarding lounges currently in use at Gates 9 and 11), with arrivals streamed on to the first floor to connect with the current first floor arrivals deck. All gates including 18 and 20 are now handling passengers.|$|E

5|$|British Airways' {{main base}} is at London Heathrow Airport, {{but it also}} has a major {{presence}} at Gatwick Airport. It also has a base at London City Airport (LCY), where its subsidiary BA CityFlyer is the largest operator. BA had previously operated a significant hub at Manchester Airport. Manchester to New York (JFK) services were withdrawn; later all international services outside London ceased when the subsidiary BA Connect was sold. Passengers wishing to travel internationally with BA either to or from regional UK destinations must now transfer in London. Heathrow Airport is dominated by British Airways, which owns 40% of the slots available at the airport. The majority of BA services operate from <b>Terminal</b> 5, with the exception of some short-haul and mid-haul flights at <b>Terminal</b> 1 arising from the purchase of BMI and some short-haul flights at <b>Terminal</b> 3, owing to a lack of capacity at <b>Terminal</b> 5. With the imminent opening of the brand-new <b>Terminal</b> 2 in 2014, Star Alliance airlines will progressively be moving all their services into the new <b>terminal</b> and <b>Terminal</b> 1 will be closed for demolition in due course.
