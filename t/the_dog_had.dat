5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> {{been given}} a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been adequately anaesthetized. They said <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was}} no smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. <b>The</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E

25|$|The first combat {{action by}} the 9th Parachute Battalion, was in Operation Tonga, part of the Normandy landings. The battalion's primary {{objective}} was the Merville Gun Battery, which {{was in a position}} to threaten the British landings at Sword Beach. Although seriously understrength after a disastrous parachute drop, the battalion silenced the battery but was reduced in strength to 65 men. The battalion then attacked Le Plein capturing the Chateau St Côme. Being too weak to attempt their last objective the battalions dug in around le Plein. One of the battalion's casualties on 6 June was Paratroop dog Glen. <b>The</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been parachuted into Normandy with his handler and both were killed during the day's fighting. They are buried together in the Ranville War Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|I {{was often}} {{asked if he}} had cancer or AIDS. In fact at 67, he had diabetes, some rheumatism, the odd creaky joint, a healthy {{capacity}} to whinge and the usual symptoms connected with smoking and drinking. But by now the horses were gone and <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> died. He was eating less and drinking more. One night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning on the floor by his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage. We were to learn he had Korsakoff's syndrome (an alcohol-related condition) and we decided to keep it private.|$|E
25|$|East Asia: In 2002, a {{study of}} {{maternal}} mDNA indicated that the dog diverged from its ancestor in East Asia because there were more dog mDNA haplotypes found there than {{in other parts of}} the world, but this was rebutted because village dogs in Africa also show a similar haplotype diversity. In 2015, a whole genome analysis of modern dog and wolf sequences concluded that based on the genetic diversity of today's East Asian dogs, <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> originated in southern East Asia, followed by a migration of a subset of ancestral dogs 15,000 YBP towards the Middle East, Africa and Europe and reaching Europe 10,000 YBP. Then, one of these lineages migrated back to northern China and admixed with endemic Asian lineages before migrating to the Americas. A criticism of this proposal is that no dog remains date beyond 12,000 YBP in this region but date to 14,000 YBP in western Europe, however it is accepted that archaeological studies in the Far East are generally lagging behind those in Europe.|$|E

50|$|Although {{various other}} animals {{have been used}} to aid the hunter, such as ferrets, <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>has</b> assumed many very {{important}} uses to the hunter.The domestication of <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>has</b> led to a symbiotic relationship in which <b>the</b> <b>dog's</b> independence from humans is deferred. Though dogs can survive independently of humans, and in many cases do, as with feral dogs, where hunger is not a primary factor, the species tends to defer to human control in exchange for habitation, food and support.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>have</b> {{learned to}} cross the street with {{pedestrians}} and have been observed obeying traffic lights. Since <b>dogs</b> <b>have</b> dichromatic vision, researchers theorize that <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> recognize other cues, such as the shapes or positions of the changing signals.|$|R
500|$|The {{allegations}} of repeated use and inadequate anaesthesia represented prima facie {{violations of the}} Cruelty to Animals Act. In addition the diary said <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been killed by Henry Dale, an unlicensed research student, and that the students had laughed during the procedure; there were [...] "jokes and laughter everywhere" [...] in the lecture hall, it said.|$|E
500|$|Coleridge's barrister, John Lawson Walton, called Lind af Hageby and Schartau. They {{repeated}} {{they had}} been the first students to arrive and had been left alone with the dog for about two minutes. They had observed scars from the previous operations and an incision in the neck where two tubes had been placed. They had not smelled the anaesthetic and had not seen any apparatus delivering it. They said, Mason wrote, that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> arched his back and jerked his legs in what they regarded as an effort to escape. When the experiment began the dog continued to [...] "upheave its abdomen" [...] and tremble, they said, movements they regarded as [...] "violent and purposeful".|$|E
500|$|An early {{casualty}} of the mountain was the artist Charles Gough, who slipped and fell from Striding Edge in April 1805. Three months later a shepherd heard a dog barking near Red Tarn and went to investigate. He found Gough's skeleton, his hat split in two, and his dog still in attendance. Initial newspaper reports that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> survived by eating the remains of her dead master were quickly forgotten. Gough became regarded as a martyr to the romantic ideal, and his dog Foxie was celebrated for her attachment and fidelity to her long-dead master. William Wordsworth and Sir Walter Scott both wrote poems about the scene; Francis Danby and Edwin Landseer both painted it. A memorial stone to Gough was erected on Helvellyn in 1890 and quotes part of Wordsworth's poem [...] "Fidelity".|$|E

500|$|Through the 1890s, Cattle Dogs of Halls Heeler derivations {{were seen}} in the kennels of exhibiting Queensland dog breeders such as William Byrne of Booval, and these were a {{different}} population from those shown in New South Wales. Little Logic was bred in Rockdale, New South Wales, however Sydney exhibitors saw Little Logic {{for the first time}} after <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> been added to the Hillview kennels of Arch Bevis in Brisbane. The show records of Little Logic and his offspring created a demand in New South Wales for Queensland dogs. By the end of the 1950s, there were few Australian Cattle Dogs whelped that were not descendants of Little Logic and his best known son, Logic Return. The success and popularity of these dogs led to the growth of the nickname [...] "Queensland Heeler".|$|E
500|$|It {{was found}} {{the dog was}} with her the whole time. The dog was [...] "alive and frisky", which {{initially}} led investigators to believe {{she had been in}} the closet only a short time. The dog was first taken to a local veterinarians for study, but they concluded that it was possible that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> to be put down to examine his stomach contents. Dr. Robert Sauer, the veterinarian, stated that the survival of the dog for several days was consistent with the stamina of such an animal. On March 4, the dog was euthanized in order to allow veterinarians from the University of Pennsylvania to examine its stomach contents, and establish why the dog outlived Barker. Investigators wanted to know if the dog was without food or water since Barker's disappearance.|$|E

Lind af Hageby and Schartau testified that they had watched as the dog was brought into the lecture theatre, said they had not smelled or seen any apparatus that would deliver the A.C.E. mixture normally used as an anaesthetic. They testified that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>had</b> made movements they regarded as [...] "violent and purposeful."
