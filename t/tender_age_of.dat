500|$|The album {{received}} a positive critical response. James Hunter of The Village Voice called the album a [...] "pop masterpiece," [...] praising the singing, songwriting and {{decision to use}} live backing instruments. Chuck Taylor from Billboard said the album featured [...] "a decidedly mature acoustic pop/rock signature, belying the <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the act's two singers", and also gave favourable reviews of both the singles [...] "Everything" [...] and [...] "Don't". John Berge from Norwegian music website [...] gave the album five out of seven stars, praising the album's harmonies and saying it was guaranteed to be a hit with young people. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B-, favourably comparing the uptempo tracks to Hanson though stating M2M's vocal range could not handle the album's ballads.|$|E

40|$|In West Africa, {{the foliage}} of both wild and {{cultivated}} varieties of Amarnathus species is used widely as vegetable and as fodder for cattle. This widely cultivated vegetable is severely {{attacked by the}} snouted beetle, Gastreoclisus rhomboidalis. A comprehensive study on {{some aspects of the}} biology of G. rhomboidalis has been carried out. The full life cycle of the beetle (from copulation and oviposition through the various immature stages to the emergence of adult beetles) was investigated. It took on the average 40 days for the adult beetle to emerge from the day of oviposition. Studies on the feeding habit of the beetles revealed that the beetles fed heavily on the leaves and can inflict an enormous destruction on the host plant over a short period of time. Generally; the studies have been able to confirm that the larva and adult beetles are the most potent destroyers of the host plant. While the adult beetle fed heavily on the leaves and tender plant stem, the larva when hatched in the plant stem, destroyed the host plant (particularly duri ng the <b>tender</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> between 2 - 3 weeks) with its boring activities causing the plant to wilt and die...|$|R

But I cannot stop here. Influenced by the inborn feelings of my nature, and not being illuminated by a single ray of this new-sprung modern light, I confess to you, Sir, that the exalted rank of the persons suffering, and particularly the sex, the beauty, and the amiable qualities of the descendant of so many kings and emperors, with the <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> royal infants, insensible only through infancy and innocence of the cruel outrages to which their parents were exposed, instead of being a subject of exultation, adds not a little to my sensibility on that most melancholy occasion.|$|E

Resident in a city which arrogates to itself, not without justice, the title of the German Athens, his pupil availed herself of all those advantages which were offered to her by the instruction of the most skilful professors. Few persons were more accomplished than Henrietta Temple even at an early age; but her rare accomplishments were not her most remarkable characteristics. Nature, which had accorded to her that extraordinary beauty we have attempted to describe, had endowed her with great talents and a soul of sublime temper.|$|E

60|$|I was {{too young}} myself to take much part {{in the war of}} the revolution, though {{accident}} made me an eye-witness of some of its most important events, and that at the <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> fifteen. At twelve--the American intellect ever was and continues to be singularly precocious--I was sent to Nassau Hall, Princeton, to be educated, and I remained there until I finally got a degree, though it was not without several long and rude interruptions of my studies. Although so early sent to college, I did not actually graduate until I was nineteen, the troubled times requiring nearly twice as long a servitude to make a Bachelor of Arts of me as would have been necessary in the more halcyon days of peace. Thus I made a fragment of a campaign when only a sophomore, and another the first year I was junior. I say the first year, because I was obliged to pass two years in each of the two higher classes of the institution, in order {{to make up for lost}} time. A youth cannot very well be campaigning and studying Euclid in the academic bowers, at the same moment. Then I was so young, that a year, more or less, was of no great moment.|$|E

The <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the stripling, too, forbade the belief that he was unaccompanied. But he silently agreed with his laboring man that the capture would probably cause the attack, if any such were meditated, to be deferred. He therefore instructed his wife to withdraw into her chamber, while he took measures to defend the dwelling in the last emergency. Without giving any unnecessary alarm, a measure that would have produced less effect on an enemy without, than the imposing stillness which now reigned within the defences, he ordered two or three more of the stoutest of his dependants to be summoned to the palisadoes. A keen scrutiny was made into the state of all the different outlets of the place; muskets were carefully examined; charges were given to be watchful, and regular sentinels were stationed within the shadows of the buildings, at points where, unseen themselves, they could look out in safety upon the fields.|$|E

6000|$|Mr Frederic Harrison, however, {{thinks that}} neither [...] "the {{theology}} nor {{the philosophy of}} In Memoriam are new, original, with an independent force and depth of their own." [...] "They are exquisitely graceful re- statements of {{the theology of the}} Broad Churchman of the school of F. D.

[...] The piety of Maurice may be as illogical as that of Positivism is logical, and the philosophy of the Master of Balliol may be whatever Mr Harrison pleases to call it. But as Jowett's earliest work (except an essay on Etruscan religion) is of 1855, one does not see how it could influence Tennyson before 1844. And what had the Duke of Argyll written on these themes some years before 1844? The late Duke, to whom Mr Harrison refers in this connection, was born in 1823. His philosophic ideas, if they were to influence Tennyson's In Memoriam, must have been set forth by him at the <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> seventeen, or thereabouts. Mr Harrison's sentence is, [...] "But does In Memoriam teach anything, or transfigure any idea which was not about that time" [...] (the time of writing was mainly 1833-1840) [...] "common form with F.
