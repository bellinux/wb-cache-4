25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that gifted students are universally gifted {{in all areas of}} academics, and these misconceptions can have a variety of negative emotional effects on a gifted child. Unrealistically high expectations of academic success are often placed on gifted students by both parents and teachers. This pressure can cause gifted students to experience high levels of anxiety, to become perfectionists, and to develop a fear of failure. Gifted students come <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>themselves</b> and their identity through their giftedness, which can be problematic as their entire self-concept can be shaken when they do not live up to the unrealistically high expectations of others.|$|E

However, most did not psychologically accept their own aging as beginning at age 60 with “Hwan-Gap. ” They {{reported that they were}} “forced” to become old at that time, even though they did not yet qualify for old age benefits provided by the South Korean government. In addition, they did not consider others’ perceptions of them as “old” as a psychological obstacle <b>to</b> <b>defining</b> <b>themselves</b> as young.

Actress Christina Hendricks talked of being bullied as a goth in school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: [...] "Kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and kept telling me how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so I never felt pretty. I just always felt awkward".

2500|$|Some {{practitioners}} eschew {{the term}} [...] "Pagan" [...] altogether, choosing not <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>themselves</b> as such, but rather under the more specific {{name of their}} religion, like Heathen or Wiccan.

Some favor the term [...] "ethnic religion" [...] over [...] "Paganism" [...] for instance the World Pagan Congress, founded in 1998, soon renamed itself the European Congress of Ethnic Religions [...] enjoying that term's association with the Greek ethnos and the academic field of ethnology. Within linguistically Slavic areas of Europe, the term [...] "Native Faith" [...] is often favored as a synonym for Paganism, being rendered as Ridnovirstvo in Ukrainian, Rodnoverie in Russian, and Rodzimowierstwo in Polish. Alternately, many practitioners within these regions view [...] "Native Faith" [...] as a category that exists within modern Paganism but which does not encompass all Pagan religions.

2500|$|While Tyler herself {{does not}} {{like to think of}} her novels in terms of themes, {{numerous}} reviewers and scholars have noted the importance of family and marriage relationships to her characters and stories. Liesl Schillinger summarized: “Taken together, the distinct but overlapping worlds of her novels have formed a Sensurround literary record of the 20th century American family—or, at least, of the proud but troubled archetypal families that…interested her most." [...] Michiko Kakutani, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for The New York Times, has been reviewing Tyler novels for over 25 years. [...] She has frequently noted Tyler’s themes with regard to family and marriage. [...] Reviewing Noah's Compass, Kakutani states that “the central concern of most of this author’s characters has always been their need <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>themselves</b> in terms of family — {{the degree to which they}} see themselves as creatures shaped by genetics, childhood memories and parental and spousal expectations, and the degree to which they are driven to embrace independent identities of their own.”. This is an example of where Anne Tyler got some of her characteristics from, being able to be independent and get to know herself through her writing.|$|E
5000|$|In the US, {{there is}} similar {{resistance}} from minority groups <b>to</b> <b>defining</b> <b>themselves</b> {{by more than}} one race on census returns, or as multi-racial, as it is feared that this will fragment demographic groups, and lower the percentage of the population recorded as belonging to a particular race, with possible negative effects on government policies aimed at addressing the concerns of disdvantaged minority groups. As Bermuda's Blacks (whether perceived as a diverse, multi-racial group, or as homogenously Black African) have been in the majority for more than a century, but are still comparatively less well-off than White Bermudians, this fear may presumably also be the cause for the opposition to census reform in Bermuda. Large-scale West Indian immigration over the last century has also decreased the number of Black Bermudians who are multi-racial, and hardened attitudes. Most academic books on the subject emphasise the characteristic multi-racialism of Bermuda's Black population [...] (at least those who might be defined as ethnically Bermudian, as opposed to those resulting from recent immigration), and it has been pointed out in other publications [...] that, if those Black Bermudians who have White ancestry were numbered instead with the White population, the Black population of Bermuda would be negligible.|$|R
