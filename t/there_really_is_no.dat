There is {{a wide range of}} small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to airships– in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.|$|E

[...] Work began in 2006 and was estimated to take at least five years to complete. [...] The first section was completed in 2008 at a cost of $53million, stretching south from Airport Road (then Highway69) to a point south of the Highway881 intersection. [...] The Mariana Lakes Country Store near Mariana Lake was closed in September2008 {{to make way for the}} twinning. [...] It was the only service station between Wandering River and Fort McMurray, but Alberta Transportation had no other options due to the proximity of the lake and utilities. [...] The store's owner was reluctant to relinquish the property but acknowledged that upgrades to the dangerous highway were more important than the continued operation of the store. [...] "The twinning of the highway is far more important, and <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> other way for us to stay here," [...] she stated.

[...] Two days later, Jackson decided, despite the cost incurred, {{he would return to}} the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album; [...] "Jew me" [...] and [...] "Kike me" [...] would be substituted with [...] "do me" [...] and [...] "strike me". The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises partially drowning them out. He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some. Spike Lee claimed {{there was some kind of}} double standard in the music industry.

2500|$|Over the years, Lucas often {{exaggerated the}} amount of {{material}} he wrote for the series; much of the exagerations stemmed from the post‐1978 period when the series grew into a phenomenon. Michael Kaminski explained that the exaggerations were both a publicity and security measure, further rationalizing that since the series' story radically changed throughout the years, it was always Lucas' intention to change the original story retroactively because audiences would only view the material from his perspective. The exagerations created rumors of Lucas having plot outlines a sequel trilogy of (Episodes VII, VIII and IX), which would continue the story after 1983's Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Lucasfilm and George Lucas had [...] denied plans for a sequel trilogy for many years, insisting that Star Wars {{was meant to be}} a six-part series, and that no further films would be released after the conclusion of the prequel trilogy in 2005.
