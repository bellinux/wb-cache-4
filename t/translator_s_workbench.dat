40|$|This essay aims at {{the heart}} of biblical scholarship: translation. Its {{objective}} is to answer the question: What is at stake when a single biblical verse is translated? In doing so, the very premises of translation are analyzed in detail. The conclusions of this analysis will {{serve as the basis for}} a case study: the translation of a single biblical verse. Two factors motivate this work: The first factor aims at an ecclesiastical realm, seeking to prevent misuse of biblical texts on the basis of claiming the one right translation, through practically showing the dynamics within biblical texts and their translation. The second factor aims at the field of biblical studies: the significance of the translation process seems to be underestimated, leading to a situation where many of the preliminary conditions are kept in the dark. Through the critical examination of this fundamental part of biblical scholarship, an effort is made to revitalize the scholarly debate concerning the very core of translation. The essay starts by considering the challenges of biblical translation in general, where historical conceptualization of the <b>translator</b> <b>s</b> role will be examined. Here, the importance of decisions in the <b>translator</b> <b>s</b> work emerges as an important theme. A consideration of textual criticism, preparing the source texts for translations, shows that also decisions made by text critics must analyzed in the same way as the <b>translator</b> <b>s</b> decisions. Through a consideration of the development within textual criticism and its objectives, the hermeneutical significance of biblical manuscripts will be addressed. Especially one approach, addressing the self-definition of textual criticism through an analysis of the role that text variants play, will be examined thoroughly. An examination of historical conceptualizations of translation will provide the tools and language to construct an understanding of translation that addresses and solves many of the previous uncovered issues. The sentence everything is target culture is descriptive for the approach that is being developed here. This approach will be the basis for a final case study: A detailed translation opens up for a critical examination of the previous won insights. This last chapter shows that by translating a single verse – and by seriously engaging with questions about the translation process along the way – not only the entire understanding and construction of the source text (and everything connected to it) is put at stake, but also the fundamental understanding and construction of the concept of translation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I present the {{reasoning}} behind {{the development of a}} new end-to-end publishing system for academic writers. The story starts with investigating digital preservation of word processing documents. What file formats are suitable for long-term preservation of text? I believe that the answer is a high-quality structured XML format like DocBook XML or TEI. The next question is how do we get word processing documents into that format without incurring a prohibitive cost? Conversion is possible, but it requires human intervention at some point. It would be far too expensive to have archivists editing every document by hand on ingest, so how can we get authors to do the necessary work, particularly as most academics aren 2 ̆ 7 t at all interested in digital preservation of their work? The answer I propose is to offer them more than just an archiving solution. Instead of just getting preservation, they get a full end-to-end digital publishing solution, the digital scholar 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workbench,</b> tailored to their needs for document interoperability, collaboration and publication in multiple formats? oh, and they get preservation too...|$|R

50|$|When Commodore Matthew Perry came to Japan in 1854, Bettelheim went aboard {{his ship}} to meet him. As before, through his {{understanding}} of the language and culture, Bettelheim presented himself as uniquely qualified to present the Ryukyuan position on various matters to the Americans. Bettelheim clashed with various members of Perry's mission, particularly the Chinese-language <b>translator</b> <b>S.</b> Wells Williams, and with the Ryukyuan government in his efforts to aid the Americans; at one point he helped a number of Americans break into a schoolhouse in Tomari with the intention of making it into lodgings for the Americans; they were ultimately refused and expelled from the schoolhouse by local officials. He was, however, quite deferential to Perry and aimed to aid him however possible. Despite being disfavored by the local government, Perry was determined to use Bettelheim to serve the interests of the United States of America. Bettelheim was helpful to Perry as an advisor, representative and commercial agent.|$|R

Simultaneously he was translating literary articles and European poets for Tamil readers. His first poetry collection was Arindha Nirandharam அறிந்த நிரந்தரம் (1980). From this early imaginistic phase he moved to a complex metaphoric style in his second (வலி உணரும் மனிதர்கள்) and third collections (ஞாபகச் சிற்பம்). As a translator he has introduced many European poets, including Rilke, Holub, Cesar and Octavio Paz. He has translated and introduced to English speaking readers (from Tamil) a selection of poems from the mystic Siddhars.
