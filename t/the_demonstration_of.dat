5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E

5|$|In 1911 A.R.

Testing of this system continued intermittently until the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|The General Theory {{argues that}} demand, not supply, {{is the key}} {{variable}} governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, {{is defined by the}} sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party {{reported}} on the discovery of copernicium and acknowledged {{the discovery of the}} isotope 283Cn. This implied the de facto discovery of the livermorium-291 isotope, from the acknowledgment of the data relating to its granddaughter 283Cn, although the livermorium data was not absolutely critical for <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> copernicium's discovery. Also in 2009, confirmation from Berkeley and the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany came for the flerovium isotopes 286 to 289, immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 2000–2006. Whereas they found the earliest data (not involving 291Lv and 283Cn) inconclusive, the results of 2004–2006 were accepted as identification of livermorium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Leopold {{wanted to}} begin the tour as soon as possiblethe younger the {{children}} were, the more spectacular would be <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, {{as well as the}} great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|Like the British Army, Australia did {{not have}} a {{parachute}} operations capability at the outbreak of the Second World War; however, <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> the effectiveness of such forces by the Germans {{in the early stages of}} the conflict soon provided the impetus for their development. Efforts to raise an operational parachute capability in the Australian Army began in November 1942, with 40 volunteers being selected for initial training with the newly formed Paratroop Training Unit. The first descents were made at Tocumwal in New South Wales, with the initial parachute courses consisting of four jumps. By March 1943 enough personnel had been trained for the Army to consider forming a full parachute battalion. As a result, the 1st Parachute Battalion was raised at this time at RAAF Station Richmond near Sydney, New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{resignation}} from Vector in {{the wake}} of her discoveries and the Gnosis Terrorism, Shion allies with underground group Scientia to investigate. Her former co-worker Allen takes her place looking after KOS-MOS. Meanwhile, Canaan, Jr., Jin, chaos, MOMO and Ziggy are investigating a landmass that originated from Lost Jerusalem. They are attacked by Margulis, then the landmass is swallowed with the Elsa in an inverted pocket of hyperspace. Shion meanwhile visits Allen, and sees <b>the</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> two new weapons for fighting the Gnosis—T-elos, a battle robot meant to replace KOS-MOS; and Omega, a mech created from the Proto Omega's remains and piloted by Abel. After the test, T-elos' creator Roth Mantel informs Allen that KOS-MOS will be scrapped so development can focus on T-elos. As KOS-MOS's weaponry {{is the only way to}} break into the hyperspace pocket and save the Elsa, Shion leads the group into the facility and rescues KOS-MOS, guided at one point by Abel. During this time, Shion has frequent visions of the girl Nephilim, and has blackouts where she is contacted by U-DO. Events are also observed by Wilhelm, who is working with the Testaments to find both Abel and Abel's Ark.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{literature}} that I used and various documents from archives, this project sheds some historic and scientific light on Kosova of the period 1960 - 1970 and the Albania’s stance on the developments in Kosova during this period. With the activation of the national policy towards Kosova in the early 1960 s, Albania established an action strategy, which despite being ideologically based, was much stronger and more structured. This period evidenced a continuation of efforts to expose the Yugoslav discriminatory policy against Albanians. Enver Hoxha considered that by exposing the Yugoslav policy he would manage to diminish the image of Yugoslavia and thus to prevent the Yugoslav state from undertaking actions against Albanians. The demands of Albanians under Yugoslavia for a Republic of Kosova were also an issue that was analysed and studied in this project. The position of the Albanian state related to <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> 1968 and to the demand for a Republic of Kosova is analyzed based on the archive documents of the time. Following <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> 1968, <b>the</b> Yugoslavs addressed indirect accusations towards Albania stating that the external factor had a hand on these events. By the international community Albania {{was seen as a}} country that could have incited <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> 1968. <b>The</b> <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> 1968 {{had an impact on the}} relations with the US policy, which became more curious in their reflections. Albania did not manage to create and clearly state a consistent position on <b>the</b> <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> 1968 and <b>the</b> demands that were made, despite the huge propaganda it conducted in support of the rights of Albanians under Yugoslavia, although it seemed to be more reserved about the status of Kosova. The Albanian state policy concerning the patriotic national movement was not always consistent, as it became ideological, or even controversial in some cases. On the other hand, the concept of Kosova independence, with elements of a republic in the existing circumstances was dominating and the most preferred concept for the majority of Kosova Albanian...|$|R
