5|$|Plans for an {{expansion}} of <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> line to Hamar have been launched, but have not been incorporated into any specific plans. This suggestion would increase the length of <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> rail north of Oslo with —almost a doubling. The project {{may or may not}} incorporate a further high-speed line to Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|Linking the {{international}} platforms of Brussels-South railway station with <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> line, the viaduct separates Eurostar (and Thalys) from local services.|$|E
5|$|Henry Kolm went on {{to start}} Magplane Technology in the 1990s to develop the {{magnetic}} transportation technology that O'Neill had written about. In 2007, Magplane demonstrated a working magnetic pipeline system to transport phosphate ore in Florida. The system ran at a speed of 40mph (65km/h), far slower than <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> trains O'Neill envisioned.|$|E
50|$|Currently, <b>the</b> Beijing-Harbin <b>High-Speed</b> Railway {{is partly}} operational. It {{is made up}} of <b>the</b> Harbin-Dalian <b>High-Speed</b> Railway (operational), <b>the</b> Beijing-Shenyang <b>High-Speed</b> Railway (under construction), and <b>the</b> Panjin-Yingkou <b>High-Speed</b> Railway (operational).|$|R
50|$|The main {{route of}} <b>the</b> Beijing-Harbin <b>High-Speed</b> Railway begins as <b>the</b> Beijing-Shenyang <b>High-Speed</b> Railway to <b>the</b> city of Shenyang. At Shenyang, the main route {{continues}} {{as part of}} <b>the</b> Harbin-Dalian <b>High-Speed</b> Railway, which travels from Harbin to Dalian via Shenyang. The remaining section of <b>the</b> Harbin-Dalian <b>High-Speed</b> Railway between Shenyang and Dalian serves as a branch route to Dalian as well as Yingkou, {{which is one of}} the termini of <b>the</b> Panjin-Yingkou <b>High-Speed</b> Railway. Here <b>the</b> Panjin-Yingkou <b>High-Speed</b> Railway is a very short branch to the city of Panjin. At Panjin, the railway connects to <b>the</b> Qinhuangdao-Shenyang <b>High-Speed</b> Railway, which is part of the Beijing-Harbin Railway.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Qinhuangdao-Shenyang <b>High-Speed</b> Railway opened, {{becoming}} <b>the</b> first <b>high-speed</b> railway in China.|$|R
5|$|Thirty-two such modules {{were then}} stacked and wired {{together}} with a mass of twisted-pair wires into a single processor. The basic cycle time was 2.11ns, or 474MHz, allowing each processor to reach about 0.948 GFLOPS, and a 16 processor machine a theoretical 15.17 GFLOP. Key to the high performance was <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> access to main memory, which allowed each process to burst up to 8 GB/s.|$|E
5|$|According to routine testing {{performed}} by CNet, write operations to typical Hi-Speed hard drives can sustain rates of 25–30MB/s, while read operations are at 30–42MB/s; this is 70% {{of the total}} available bus bandwidth. For USB3.0, typical write speed is 70–90MB/s, while read speed is 90–110MB/s. Mask tests, also known as eye diagram tests, are {{used to determine the}} quality of a signal in the time domain. They are defined in the referenced document as part of the electrical test description for <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> (HS) mode at 480Mbit/s.|$|E
5|$|After World of Motion {{had closed}} on January 2, 1996, {{everything}} inside the ride building was removed. After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> test for Test Track. Work inside the building also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble {{the look of a}} test car that is used to go through multiple safety tests.|$|E
50|$|Kunming South Railway Station is <b>the</b> main <b>high-speed</b> rail {{station of}} the Kunming {{metropolitan}} area. The station, {{put into operation}} in December 2016 {{after five years of}} construction, is the western terminus of <b>the</b> Nanning-Kunming <b>High-Speed</b> Railway and <b>the</b> Shanghai-Kunming <b>High-Speed</b> Railway.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> California <b>High-Speed</b> Rail Authority (CHSRA) is a California {{state agency}} {{established}} pursuant to <b>the</b> California <b>High-Speed</b> Rail Act (S.B. 1420, Chapter 796 of the California Statutes of 1996) {{to develop and}} implement high-speed intercity rail service, such as <b>the</b> California <b>High-Speed</b> Rail project.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Ankara-Sivas <b>{{high-speed}}</b> railway (Ankara-Sivas yüksek hızlı demiryolu), is a 406 km long high-speed railway {{currently under}} construction in Turkey.

5|$|Following the {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> Gardermoen Line from Oslo, via Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, to Eidsvoll, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications started planning additional high-speed lines west and southeast of Oslo. The Asker and Follo Lines would allow express and regional trains to travel faster and more reliably to Drammen and Ski, leaving the old tracks for slower freight trains, and commuter trains making frequent stops. Construction of the Follo Line will, at the earliest, be completed in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Higher-speed rail (HrSR), {{also known}} as {{high-performance}} rail, higher-performance rail, or almost-high-speed rail, is a jargon used to describe inter-city passenger rail services that have top speeds of more than conventional rail but are not high enough to be called high-speed rail services. The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger efforts to create or expand <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> rail networks. Some countries use the term medium-speed rail, or semi-high speed rail instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1959 BOAC began {{shifting}} its Comets from transatlantic {{routes and}} released the Comet to associate companies, making the Comet 4's ascendancy as a premier airliner brief. Besides the 707 and DC-8, {{the introduction of}} the Vickers VC10 allowed competing aircraft to assume <b>the</b> <b>high-speed,</b> long-range passenger service role pioneered by the Comet. In 1960, as part of a government-backed consolidation of the British aerospace industry, de Havilland itself was acquired by Hawker Siddeley, within which it became a wholly owned division.|$|E
50|$|Shangrao Railway Station {{is served}} by three major {{railways}} passing through Shangrao: the Shanghai-Kunming Railway, <b>the</b> Shanghai-Kunming <b>High-Speed</b> Railway and <b>the</b> Hefei-Fuzhou <b>High-Speed</b> Railway.|$|R
5000|$|Kunming South Railway Station, {{opened at}} the end of 2016, is located in Chenggong District, many miles {{southeast}} from the historical city center. It is the western terminal of <b>the</b> Shanghai-Kunming <b>High-Speed</b> Railway and <b>the</b> Guangzhou-Nanning-Kunming <b>High-Speed</b> Railway, and has high-speed service to destinations along these lines and elsewhere on <b>the</b> nation's <b>high-speed</b> network.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity <b>High-Speed</b> Railway is {{also used}} by <b>the</b> {{majority}} of <b>high-speed</b> trains leaving Shanghai's terminals for Wuhan, Yichang, Chongqing, and Chengdu thus making it de facto a part of <b>the</b> Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu <b>High-Speed</b> Railway.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, Hong Kong {{hosted the}} 5th East Asian Games and nine {{national}} teams competed in it. The Games {{were the first}} and largest international multi-sport event ever organised and hosted by the city. Major infrastructure and tourist projects also began under Sir Tsang's second term, including the Ngong Ping Cable Car, Tian Tan Buddha and the West Kowloon Cultural District. However, the most controversial was <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> railway link connecting Hong Kong and neighbouring cities of mainland China; as of 2016, the project has suffered numerous delays, surging labour and material costs and dispute over immigration procedures.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton was quickest in Q2, just 0.012 seconds {{ahead of}} his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg. The Mercedes power unit proved its superiority on <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> Montreal track, with all remaining Mercedes-powered cars making it into Q3, leaving Kimi Räikkönen and the two Red Bull drivers to take the remaining three places. This {{was the first time}} in 2015 that Force India was able to get both cars into Q3 in qualifying, having last done so at the 2014 German Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>high-speed</b> freeway {{connection}} was completed {{with the opening}} of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932. The Pulaski Skyway ramp at its eastern terminus was eventually replaced with two long outside ramps that were dedicated for eastbound and westbound traffic from the cut in Bergen Hill just west of JohnF. Kennedy Boulevard. On September14, 1938, a direct ramp, known as the Tonnele Circle Viaduct, opened over Tonnele Circle to connect westbound traffic with southbound U.S.Route1/9 Truck, which quickly connects to Route7 that leads to Interstate280.|$|E
50|$|Completed in December 2009, {{the station}} has 11 {{platforms}} and 20 tracks. It serves <b>the</b> Beijing-Guangzhou <b>High-Speed</b> Railway, <b>the</b> Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu <b>High-Speed</b> Railway, and Zhengzhou/Jiujiang-bound passenger trains.|$|R
5000|$|Terminal 2 of the Hongqiao Airport (...) is {{immediately}} adjacent to Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station (...) , a major train hub served by <b>the</b> Beijing-Shanghai <b>High-Speed</b> Railway, <b>the</b> Shanghai-Hangzhou <b>High-Speed</b> Railway and <b>the</b> Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity <b>High-Speed</b> Railway. <b>The</b> airport's other terminal, Terminal 1 (...) , {{is across the}} airfield from Terminal 2.|$|R
50|$|It was rebuilt from 2002 to 2008 for the {{completion}} of <b>the</b> Nuremberg-Erfurt <b>high-speed</b> railway and <b>the</b> Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle <b>high-speed</b> railway and connects the Berlin-Munich and Frankfurt-Dresden long-distance routes.|$|R
5|$|The race result {{meant that}} Michael Schumacher still {{retained}} his {{lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, ahead of Coulthard. Race winner Ralf Schumacher, on 41 points, moved into the third place and Barrichello's second-place resulted in him being relegated to fourth. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, resulted in Ferrari extending their lead to be fifty-eight points in front. Williams retained third on 56 points, but were ten points closer to McLaren, with five races of the season remaining. This was the final Formula One event {{to be held at}} <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> configuration of the Hockenheimring circuit; the circuit was shortened by 1.5 miles and the new layout was used starting from the 2002 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. <b>The</b> <b>high-speed</b> tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E
5|$|The system's {{predecessors}} {{date back}} to the opening of the Trunk Line in 1854. By 1902, all the routes used by the present commuter rail had been taken into service. Electrification started in 1922, and Class 62 EMUs were introduced in 1931, followed by Class 65 units in 1936 and Class 67 in 1953. Electrification was completed in 1963. In 1980, the Drammen Line was connected {{to the rest of the}} system and all trains started operating to the new OsloS. <b>The</b> <b>high-speed</b> Gardermoen Line opened in 1998. In 2013, new Stadler FLIRT units were taken into traffic, and the Asker Line was completed just before. By 2018, the Follo Line is scheduled to open.|$|E
50|$|The nearest InterCityExpress stop is Limburg Süd {{station on}} <b>the</b> Cologne-Frankfurt <b>high-speed</b> rail line. Alternatively, Montabaur station on <b>the</b> same <b>high-speed</b> rail line may be reached on the Unterwesterwaldbahn.|$|R
5000|$|The Xuzhou East Railway Station (...) is a {{high-speed}} railway station in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. It serves by <b>the</b> Beijing-Shanghai <b>High-Speed</b> Railway and <b>the</b> Xuzhou-Lanzhou <b>High-Speed</b> Railway.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first French <b>high-speed</b> {{rail line}} opened in 1981, between Paris's and Lyon's suburbs. It {{was at that}} time <b>the</b> only <b>high-speed</b> rail line in Europe. As of July 2017, <b>the</b> French <b>high-speed</b> rail network {{comprises}} 2,647 km of Lignes à grande vitesse (LGV), and 670 km are under construction.|$|R
5|$|The “National Geographic” website chose {{travel by}} {{high speed rail}} in western Taiwan as the “Best Winter Trip 2013”. The first film to feature THSR {{prominently}} was the 2007 Taiwanese movie Summer's Tail, directed by Cheng Wen-Tang. A group of teenagers, {{one of whom is}} the son of a Japanese engineer working on <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> railway, hang out at a vacant lot under the elevated tracks of THSR in Liuying, Tainan. In Leg 10 of Season 12 of the internationally aired reality television game show The Amazing Race, which was watched by 11.65million Americans, competing teams travelled from Taipei to Taichung and back on the THSR.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> {{problem is the}} delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{technical}} developments, Ferrari upgraded their engine for their home race by using {{three of their}} development tokens while Mercedes spent all seven of their remaining engine tokens. As a result of this, Mercedes became the first team in 2015 to use all their tokens, with both Honda and Ferrari having four tokens remaining and Renault having twelve tokens left for later in the season. Because of these changes both Mercedes cars were on their third powerplants, whilst both Ferrari cars were on their fourth power units. Additionally, Toro Rosso, Red Bull and McLaren received grid penalties for exceeding their parts usage, forcing them {{to start at the}} back of the grid. McLaren went back to using their snub nose design, which they had replaced earlier in the season ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, in order to achieve better aerodynamics and lower drag for <b>the</b> <b>high-speed</b> Monza circuit.|$|E
50|$|As part of <b>the</b> new <b>high-speed</b> <b>the</b> Follo Line between Oslo and Ski, was {{previously}} considered {{as an intermediate}} station.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>high-speed</b> {{railroad}} to be {{built in}} Turkey will connect the county's largest conurbations of Ankara and İstanbul via Eskişehir, with a junction at Polatlı to <b>the</b> Ankara-Konya <b>high-speed</b> line.|$|R
25|$|In late 1998, <b>the</b> Hanover-Berlin <b>high-speed</b> {{rail line}} was opened as <b>the</b> third <b>high-speed</b> line in Germany, cutting travel time on line 10 (between Berlin and the Ruhr valley) by 2½ hours.|$|R
