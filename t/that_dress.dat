Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E

Among the Turks and Mongols, he was astonished at the freedom and respect enjoyed by women and remarked that on seeing a Turkish couple in a bazaar one might assume {{that the man was}} the woman's servant when he was in fact her husband. He also felt <b>that</b> <b>dress</b> customs in the Maldives, and some sub-Saharan regions in Africa were too revealing.|$|E
25|$|Incorporated in {{this new}} “natural” style was the {{importance}} of ease and comfort of one's dress. Not only was there a new emphasis on hygiene, but also clothing became much lighter and more able to be changed and washed frequently. Even upper class women began wearing cropped dresses as opposed to dresses with long trains or hoops that restricted them from leaving their homes. In a sense, women were influenced by male fashion, such as tailored waistcoats and jackets to emphasize women’s mobility. This new movement toward practicality of dress showed <b>that</b> <b>dress</b> became less {{of a way to}} solely categorize between classes or genders; dress was meant to suit one's personal daily routine. It was also during this time period that the fashion magazine and journal industry began to take off. They were most often monthly (often competing) periodicals that allowed men and women {{to keep up with the}} ever-changing styles.|$|E

She declared to the Canadian press, [...] "It was an unexpected success.

Duplicates also had to be made, for Maya Stojan and Wen's two stunt doubles. She explained that she [...] "decided to do a wrap dress so that [...] could easily dance. It already had a slit sort of built into it, so that gave her freedom of movement. [...] goal is always {{to make sure that}} the actors are comfortable in their costumes, that they can move freely and do their stunts, and that nothing is too restrictive. And that they also look amazing at the same time." [...] The dress also [...] "needed long sleeves so that [...] could have pads on underneath the dress for when she was fighting. And then of course she's got the crazy fight where she's fighting herself...she needed serious freedom of movement in <b>that</b> <b>dress,</b> so we built panels that had stretch, and put them in several areas on her arms and her sides, so that it moved with her as she punched...herself." ...|$|E

500|$|Brian, {{walking in}} drunk, notices that Stewie has resumed {{watching}} Jolly Farm Revue, after previously swearing off {{the show in}} [...] "Road to Europe". Remembering a story {{he had seen in}} the local newspaper, Brian tells Stewie about upcoming auditions for an American version of the show. Jumping at the opportunity, the two show up to the auditions, but quickly learn {{that there is only one}} female role remaining. Determined to win a spot on the show, Stewie decides to cross-dress as a woman, naming his new identity [...] "Karina Smirnoff". Beginning his audition, he starts by telling a completely fabricated story. Convincing the producers that he is telling a true tale, he wins the role. The next morning, on the first day of filming, Stewie as Karina introduces himself to the rest of the cast, and quickly falls in love with a female co-star named Julie. Another co-star, Randall, objects to the new role that Karina was cast to play, and takes Julie away from him to prevent their friendship. As they continue shooting, however, the two develop a friendly relationship, eventually deciding to hold a sleepover, where they become even closer. The next day, Julie professes her love for Karina by wishing that she was actually a boy, causing Stewie, as Karina, to come on to her. Julie insists that she is not a lesbian, so Stewie decides to unveil his true identity to the entire cast during a live taping of the show. Shocked that Karina was actually a boy, Julie's mother refuses to let her speak to him, with Stewie left to regret his decision to come out as a cross-dresser, and decides to go get ice cream with Brian, as he can no longer wear <b>that</b> <b>dress.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "She's a Mess" [...] is an uptempo electropop song. Originally called [...] "I'm a Mess", {{the group}} decided to retitle it due to {{concerns}} that the lyrics (such as [...] "Drinking bottle after bottle / I'm such a mess in <b>that</b> <b>dress</b> / I'm not impressed") encouraged binge drinking. However, Range stated that [...] "there are some lyrics that are quite cheeky but people shouldn't take them seriously." [...] During an interview for Digital Spy, Berrabah described the overall sound of Sweet 7, saying: [...] "It's quite an uptempo album {{with a lot of}} different sounds." [...] Berrabah cited [...] "She's a Mess" [...] as an example for this, which she said was [...] "just totally different from everything else." [...] Jon O'Brien of AllMusic wrote that the [...] "aptly named 'She's a Mess' is a chaotic attempt at a Clubland trance-pop floor-filler". Al Fox of the British Broadcasting Corporation called the song, along with the album's third single [...] "Wear My Kiss", a [...] "glimmer of brilliance" [...] and {{went on to say that}} it is saved by Berrabah's [...] "unashamed attitude". Christopher Lee of The Scotsman named it one of the better tracks on the album, although admitted that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded much different coming from any other girl band". Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote that [...] "sisterhood" [...] is being [...] "jettisoned entirely" [...] on the track, which he described as [...] "crass and misogynistic". Celina Murphy of Hot Press suggested that [...] "She's a Mess" [...] "might actually sound quite punchy" [...] if it was recorded by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Good for You" [...] is a torch {{song and}} a come-hither with themes of intensity, psychodrama, {{self-confidence}} and female self-empowerment, with Gomez singing the hook [...] "I just wanna {{look good for}} you, good for you", as a plea. According to the singer, the track [...] "reps women in a good way" [...] and [...] "does something to a woman when they look good". In an interview for People magazine, she stated: [...] "This song represents the confidence that I truly have inside of me, and I think it's the vulnerable side that I've expressed, but it's also the combination of just feeling myself". It was noted to showcase a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than in Gomez's previous releases. A number of the lyrics attribute syllables {{as a means of}} poetry, namely, [...] "leave this dress a mess on the floor" [...] and [...] "syncopate my skin to your heart beating". Gomez's lyrics specifically deal with pleasing and being the perfect complement for her significant other, by means of wearing skin-tight dresses and doing her [...] "hair up real, real nice". Gomez references the Greek myth of Midas and jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co in the lines [...] "Doing it up like Midas, mmm" [...] and [...] "I'm on marquise diamond / I'm a marquise diamond / Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm". Gomez's lyrics deal with pleasing her lover and being the perfect complement for him, seen in lyrics as [...] "Gonna wear <b>that</b> <b>dress</b> you like, skin-tight / Do my hair up real, real nice". The line [...] "You say I give it to you hard / So bad, so bad / Make you never wanna leave / I won't / I won't" [...] represents a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than Gomez's previous releases.|$|E
