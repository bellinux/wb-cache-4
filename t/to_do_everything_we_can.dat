2500|$|On 2 May, it was {{revealed}} that the British Government rejected a proposal by the Palestinian Authority to use force in a possible rescue attempt to free Johnston, due to worries about his safety in such a situation. Ismail Haniyeh also said that progress had been made in negotiations with Johnston's kidnappers, and the kidnappers had lowered their demands for his release. The same day, British Prime Minister Tony Blair was questioned in Parliament about British efforts to free the journalist. Lee Scott, a British MP, had called on Prime Minister Blair to use the time before he stepped down from office to try to free Johnston as well as Gilad Shalit. Blair told the House of Commons that there was [...] "no conceivable reason for him (Johnston) to be kept", and that the Government would [...] "continue <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to facilitate" [...] Johnston's release.

First, computers', thanks to (or because o) the {{indirect}} way of communicating “with” them, have not become yet the obvious and natural extension of human abilities - as TV set, radio or cars already have. It is probably because of the feeling, that they are, more or less, for specialists and that they require special knowledge or skills. In a way it is true, but surely it will change within a few years, when they become everyday tools of education at schools or just toys for children. Second, {{there is also the}} feeling or wish, that every computer is able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> want - from, lets say, writing a letter, washing the dishes to very complex things as, for example, designing architecture.

[...] As a compromise between having a live and virtual stage presence, the band's musicians played behind a giant cinema screen, which projected music videos and visuals to the crowd. Lead singer Damon Albarn later expressed discomfort at this setup, confessing that he [...] "was frustrated" [...] behind the screen. Later still, Albarn called the screens [...] "obtuse", believing the human element of the band necessitated a change. In a 2010 interview, Albarn voiced distaste at the concept of hiding collaborators behind a screen on the then-upcoming Escape to Plastic Beach Tour: [...] "I couldn't entertain the idea of putting Lou Reed or Bobby Womack behind a screen. I'm not that daft." [...] Gorillaz Live was ultimately the only tour to have the musicians silhouetted behind a screen.|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the challenges of effective emergency preparedness for, response to, and recovery from major emergencies, including catastrophic incidents. Effective emergency preparedness and response for major events requires the coordinated planning and actions of multiple players from multiple first responder disciplines, jurisdictions, and levels of government as well as nongovernmental entities. Effective emergency preparedness and response requires putting aside parochialism and working together prior to and after an emergency incident. September 11, 2001 fundamentally changed the context of emergency management preparedness in the United States, including federal involvement in preparedness and response. The biggest challenge in emergency preparedness is getting effective cooperation in planning, exercises, and capability assessment and building across first responder disciplines and intergovernmental lines. DHS has developed several policy documents designed to define the federal government's role in supporting state and local first responders in emergencies, implement a uniform incident command structure across the nation, and identify performance standards {{that can be used}} in assessing state and local first responder capabilities. Realistic exercises are a key component of testing and assessing emergency plans and first responder capabilities, and the Hurricane PAM planning exercise demonstrated their value. With regard to the status of emergency preparedness across the nation, we know relatively little about how states and localities (1) finance their efforts in this area, (2) have used their federal funds, and (3) are assessing the effectiveness with which they spend those funds. Katrina has raised a host of questions about the nation's readiness to respond effectively to catastrophic emergencies. Effective emergency preparedness is a task that is never done, but requires continuing commitment and leadership because circumstances change and continuing trade-offs because we will never have the funds <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> might like <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> ...|$|R
