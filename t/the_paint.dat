5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
50|$|Important {{painters}} given a sobriquet {{based on}} a name vase include for example <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Berlin A 34, <b>the</b> Nessos <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Andokides <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Antimenes <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Antiphon <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Bryn Mawr <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Pistoxenos <b>Painter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{restoring}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> began <b>the</b> same day. Following consultations with chemists, art restorers began washing {{the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> with water; they kept <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in <b>the</b> vertical position, and sprayed water at <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to prevent further degradation of <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Phiale <b>Painter</b> became <b>the</b> Achilles Painter's most {{prominent}} student after he assumed the Berlin Painter's workshop. Almost {{a dozen other}} recognizable painters passed through the Achilles Painter's workshop as well. Notable painters include <b>the</b> Westreenen <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Persephone <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Clio <b>Painter,</b> Loeb <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> Dwarf <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> Kleophon <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Sabouroff <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Munich 2335 all spent time at the workshop as well.|$|R
5|$|Etty {{had used}} {{experimental}} techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem {{made worse by}} the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in {{the archives of the}} Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century {{there were a number of}} unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> further.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{students}} from the Art Institute of Portland used stencils to advertise a concert for the Oregon Food Bank. The students believed they were using spray chalk, but after completion, they learned they were actually using spray paint. The students were told that even temporary markings count as graffiti, and the students offered to remove <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> and apologize to businesses affected. Criminal charges were not filed.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, the BBC TV {{programme}} Fake or Fortune investigated {{a copy of}} Dirck van Baburen's The Procuress {{owned by}} the Courtauld Institute. Opinion had been divided {{as to whether it}} was a 17th-century studio work or a van Meegeren fake. The programme used chemical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> to show that it contained bakelite and thus confirmed that the painting was a 20th-century fake.|$|E
50|$|Philippe Maestracci claims {{ownership}} of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> through inheritance through his grandfather. According to Maestracci, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{was taken from}} his grandfather, Jewish Parisian art dealer Oscar Stettiner, by the Nazis during the German occupation of France. In 1939, Oscar Stettiner left <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> behind in France ahead of the German occupation. The Nazis took administration over <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in 1941 and auctioned off <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in 1944. In 1946, Oscar Stettiner filed a claim to recover <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> but <b>the</b> French authorities were ultimately unable to track down <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was {{purchased}} from Turner by William Beckford in April 1800. Henry Jeffrey purchased <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in 1807, before {{selling it to}} Thomas Tutor. George Young acquired <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> by 1853, {{and it was at}} sale at Christies in London in 1866. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> {{was purchased}} by Earl Grosvenor in 1866 and stayed in his possession until at least 1871. In 1876, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was bought by Sir Francis Cook, where <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> stayed until 1951. It was sold to Sir Alexander Corda by the Cook family.

5000|$|The Varrese Painter's {{workshop}} also {{employed the}} Wolfenbüttel Painter; his influence {{has been noted}} {{not only on the}} predecessors of <b>the</b> Darius <b>Painter,</b> but also on <b>the</b> Ginosa <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Bari 12061, <b>the</b> Metope <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Louvre MNB 1148 and <b>the</b> Chamay <b>Painter.</b>|$|R
5|$|Interior {{scenes were}} filmed at <b>The</b> <b>Paint</b> Hall studio, in Belfast, {{including}} all the scenes set in the Red Keep and Winterfell. The exterior of the Stark and Lannister war camps were shot on location in the Castle Ward estate, {{near the village of}} Strangford. Audley's Castle in the estate doubled as the ruined remains of one of Moat Cailin's towers, seen when Catelyn and Rodrik join Robb's army.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the episode}} was shot on set at the Irish studios of <b>The</b> <b>Paint</b> Hall. The exteriors of the {{entrance}} of Vaes Dothrak were filmed in the Sandy Brae area, and for the confrontation between Eddard and Cersei {{taking place in the}} Red Keep's gardens (identified as a godswood in the novels) the production used the cloister of the St Dominic Monastery in Rabat, in Malta.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are more}} susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It {{is not difficult to}} monitor external corrosion, and repair <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E
50|$|Several vase {{painters}} had specialised in <b>painting</b> Siana cups. <b>The</b> {{most important}} {{among them was}} <b>the</b> C <b>Painter.</b> Others include <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Athens 553, <b>the</b> Heidelberg <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Boston CA, <b>the</b> Kassandra <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Sandal <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Civico <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Griffin-Bird <b>Painter.</b> At present, about 1,000 cups and fragments are known; a classification vital for their chronology and stylistic categorisation has been developed by Herman Brijder. A special type are so called Merrythought Cups, with a forked handle.|$|R
50|$|When Lincoln had <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{exhibited}} to <b>the</b> {{public in}} the East Room of the White House, Carpenter noted that the exhibition was thronged with visitors. An engraving of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was made by Alexander Hay Ritchie for mass reproduction. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was well received by critics, according to newspaper advertisements for those reproductions; also, many of the subjects in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> commented favorably. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> itself then toured the country.|$|R
5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was {{displayed}} {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After <b>the</b> war <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> has been {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to be shown. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was restored in 2007.|$|R
5|$|The {{interiors}} {{of the episode}} were filmed at <b>the</b> <b>Paint</b> Hall studios, close to Belfast. The area of the Castle Ward estate, also in Northern Ireland, was used to film on location the Stark and Lannister camps, the Crossing, and the battlefields of the Green Fork and the Whispering Woods.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or white lead pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 Radioactive decay series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> used to create the painting.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was {{engraved}} and {{was very}} popular. Tickets were sold to {{people who wanted to}} see <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> when it was exhibited in 1841. An 1846 engraving by William Greatbach of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> also sold well. It was proposed in 1852 to purchase <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> from <b>the</b> artist by public subscription, however this failed to achieve its goal probably due to the Duke's death in September 1852. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> remained unsold and passed down to Salter's heirs.|$|R
2500|$|Important {{painters}} of this period, roughly 480 to 425 BC, include <b>the</b> Providence <b>Painter,</b> Hermonax, and <b>the</b> Achilles <b>Painter,</b> all following <b>the</b> tradition of <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> Phiale <b>Painter,</b> probably a pupil of <b>the</b> Achilles <b>Painter,</b> is also important. New workshop traditions also developed. Notable {{examples include the}} so-called [...] "mannerists", most famously among them <b>the</b> Pan <b>Painter.</b> Another tradition was begun by <b>the</b> Niobid <b>Painter</b> and continued by Polygnotos, <b>the</b> Kleophon <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> Dinos <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> role of bowls decreased, although they were still produced in large numbers, e.g. by the workshop of <b>the</b> Penthesilea <b>Painter.</b>|$|R
5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). <b>The</b> <b>paint</b> was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E
5|$|Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art & Design {{served as}} the project's {{production}} manager. She created a pattern against the wall using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed <b>the</b> <b>paint,</b> completed the mural, and added a clear coating for protection. Painting the mural took about six weeks, and it was mostly finished by November 2013. Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14. The mural took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff {{determined}} that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting {{would soon be}} beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore {{the surface of the}} painting, and <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added {{to the back of the}} painting, and the three layers were glued together.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, the {{evacuation}} of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters {{on a number of}} occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition. Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the British and Australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor. Indeed, the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3 RAR, blistering <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the first}} season was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010, and the primary location was <b>the</b> <b>Paint</b> Hall Studios in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains (standing in for Vaes Dothrak), Castle Ward (Winterfell), Saintfield Estates (the Winterfell godswood), Tollymore Forest (outdoor scenes), Cairncastle (the execution site), the Magheramorne quarry (Castle Black) and Shane's Castle (the tourney grounds). Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, was also used in the original pilot episode for scenes at Winterfell. The producers initially considered filming the whole series in Scotland, but decided on Northern Ireland because {{of the availability of}} studio space.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes were}} made during the renovation. The {{vertical}} marquee which had marked the theatre's presence from 1926 to 1980, was removed, the orchestra pit and auditorium seating were rebuilt, the dressing rooms moved, and the technical systems updated. However, the furniture, fixtures and interior signage were retained. Even <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> was carefully restored to its original luster. The renovation made it suitable again for live performances and filled Seattle's need for a touring Broadway musical venue. Renovation work was completed without federal, state, or local funds.|$|E
