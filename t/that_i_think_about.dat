He'll whine at first, but he'll soon get over that.--You wonder <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> a dog just now, he added, {{with a kind of}} laugh.

60|$|Time flies. It seems but {{yesterday}} that I was a lad of sixteen on the fish patrol. Yet I know that I arrived this very morning from China, {{with a quick}} passage to my credit, and master of the barkentine Harvester. And I know that to-morrow morning I shall run over to Oakland to see Neil Partington {{and his wife and}} family, and later on up to Benicia to see Charley Le Grant and talk over old times. No; I shall not go to Benicia, now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. I expect to be a highly interested party to a wedding, shortly to take place. Her name is Alice Partington, and, since Charley has promised to be best man, he will have to come down to Oakland instead.|$|E

Nina raised herself, as she was standing, to her full height, and a smile of derision came upon her face. [...] "Oh, yes! I daresay you do not mind it," [...] said Madame Zamenoy. [...] "I daresay you can laugh now at all the pains of hell. Castaways such as you are always blind to their own danger; but your father, I hope, has not fallen so far as to care nothing for his religion, though he seems to have forgotten what is due to his family." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, {{it was no}} use {{to waste}} sense on her. Training--{{training}} is everything; training is all there is to a person. We speak of nature; it is folly; {{there is no such thing}} as nature; what we call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training. We have no thoughts of our own, no opinions of our own; they are transmitted to us, trained into us. All that is original in us, and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us, can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest being atoms contributed by, and inherited from, a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the Adam-clam or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed. And as for me, all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> in this plodding sad pilgrimage, this pathetic drift between the eternities, is to look out and humbly live a pure and high and blameless life, and save that one microscopic atom in me that is truly me: the rest may land in Sheol and welcome for all I care.|$|E

60|$|My dear Bailey--I {{will get}} over {{the first part of}} this (unsaid[31]) Letter as soon as possible, for it relates to the affairs of poor Cripps.--To a Man of your nature such a Letter as Haydon's must have been {{extremely}} cutting--What occasions the greater part of the World's Quarrels?--simply this--two Minds meet, and do not understand each other time enough to prevent any shock or surprise at the conduct of either party--As soon as I had known Haydon three days, I had got enough of his Character not to have been surprised at such a Letter as he has hurt you with. Nor, when I knew it, was it a principle with me to drop his acquaintance; although with you it would have been an imperious feeling. I wish you knew all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Genius and the Heart--and yet I think that you are thoroughly acquainted with my innermost breast in that respect, or you could not have known me even thus long, and still hold me worthy to be your dear Friend. In passing, however, I must say one thing that has pressed upon me lately, and increased my Humility and capability of submission--and that is this truth--Men of Genius are great as certain ethereal Chemicals operating on the Mass of neutral intellect--but they have not any individuality, any determined Character--I would call the top and head of those who have a proper self Men of Power.|$|E
6000|$|I am sure I don't {{know what}} they will think of me when I get back. It seems as if; over here, I had learned {{to come out with}} everything. I suppose they will think I am not sincere; but isn't it more sincere to come out with things than to conceal them? I have become very good friends with every one in the house--that is (you see, I am sincere), with almost every one. It is the most {{interesting}} circle I ever was in. There's a girl here, an American, that I don't like so much as the rest; but that is only because she won't let me. I should like to like her, ever so much, because she is most lovely and most attractive; but she doesn't seem to want to know me or to like me. She comes from New York, and she is remarkably pretty, with beautiful eyes and the most delicate features; she is also remarkably elegant--in this respect would bear comparison with any one I have seen over here. But it seems as if she didn't want to recognise me or associate with me; as if she wanted to make a difference between us. It is like people they call [...] "haughty" [...] in books. I have never seen any one like that before--any one that wanted to make a difference; and at first I was right down interested, she seemed to me so like a proud young lady in a novel. I kept saying to myself all day, [...] "haughty, haughty," [...] and I wished she would keep on so. But she did keep on; she kept on too long; and then I began to feel hurt. I couldn't think what I have done, and I can't think yet. It's as if she had got some idea about me, or had heard some one say something. If some girls should behave like that I shouldn't make any account of it; but this one is so refined, and looks as if she might be so interesting if I once got to know her, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it a good deal.

Prior to Beethoven, the quartet repertoire could be performed competently by good quality amateurs and by professionals with few rehearsals. Beethoven's quartets introduced many new technical difficulties that cannot be completely overcome without dedicated rehearsal. These difficulties include synchronized complex runs played by two or more instruments together, cross-rhythms and hemiolas, and difficult harmonies that require special attention to intonation. When Schuppanzigh complained to Beethoven about a particularly difficult passage, Beethoven is said to have remarked, [...] "Do you believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> your miserable fiddle when the muse strikes me?" ...|$|E
