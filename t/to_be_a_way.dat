5|$|A coda {{is a short}} {{pattern of}} 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations. They were once thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> by which {{individuals}} identified themselves, but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas, and the same codas are used by multiple individuals. However, each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks {{can be used to}} identify individuals. Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects. Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas. In breeding grounds, codas are almost entirely produced by adult females. Despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas, it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, {{little brown}} bats {{can be very}} active during {{the day in the}} spring months, where they can be heard loudly squeaking, {{shuffling}} position and seen hanging out the bottom of the bat house during all hours of the daytime. The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of sleep is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E

Another consequence of this is that much of their programme has been domestically developed, much like their nuclear weapons programme.

25|$|Another form {{of modern}} popular music {{that has been}} closely {{associated}} with cannabis smoking is reggae, a style of music that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and early 60s. Cannabis, or ganja, {{is believed to have}} been introduced to Jamaica in the mid-19th century by Indian immigrant labor and was primarily associated with Indian workers until it was appropriated by the Rastafari movement in the middle of the 20th century. The Rastafari considered cannabis smoking <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to come closer to God, or Jah, an association that was greatly popularized by reggae icons such as Bob Marley and Peter Tosh in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E

25|$|These precepts are not commandments and transgressions do not invite {{religious}} sanctions, {{but their}} {{power has been}} in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth. Killing in Buddhist belief leads to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk. Adultery, similarly, invites a rebirth as prostitute or in hell, depending on whether the partner was unmarried or married. Saving animals from slaughter for meat, is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth.|$|E
25|$|The key lies {{in strong}} {{institutions}} and cooperation. The Indus River Commission and the Indus Water Treaty survived two wars between India and Pakistan despite their hostility, {{proving to be}} a successful mechanism in resolving conflicts by providing a framework for consultation inspection and exchange of data. The Mekong Committee has also functioned since 1957 and survived the Vietnam War. In contrast, regional instability results when there is an absence of institutions to co-operate in regional collaboration, like Egypt's plan for a high dam on the Nile. However, there is currently no global institution in place for the management and management of trans-boundary water sources, and international co-operation has happened through ad hoc collaborations between agencies, like the Mekong Committee which was formed due to an alliance between UNICEF and the US Bureau of Reclamation. Formation of strong international institutions seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> forward – they fuel early intervention and management, preventing the costly dispute resolution process.|$|E
25|$|OBE was {{introduced}} to South Africa in the late 1990s by the post-apartheid government {{as part of its}} Curriculum 2005 program. , Initial support for the program derived from anti-apartheid education policies. The policy also gained support from the labor movements that borrowed ideas about competency-based education, and Vocational education from New Zealand and Australia, as well as the labor movement that critiqued the apartheid education system. With no strong alternative proposals, the idea of outcome-based education, and a national qualification framework, became the policy of the African National Congress government. This policy was believed to be a democratization of education, people would have a say in what they wanted the outcomes of education to be. It was also believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to increase education standards and increase the availability of education. The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) went into effect in 1997. In 2001 people realized that the intended effects were not being seen. By 2006 no proposals to change the system had been accepted by the government, causing a hiatus of the program. The program came to be viewed as a failure and a new curriculum improvement process was announced in 2010, slated to be implemented between 2012 and 2014.|$|E

In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain.

[...] Despite other colleagues' enthusiasm about the dancing, chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing, as CPDRC was undermanned. Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center's Operations Manual, Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen. [...] "As a jail officer, I got worried when I saw it", Rubio commented. The inmates were not fond of the idea either, pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison. Prisoners eventually agreed to dance, but admitted that the routines took awhile to master. [...] "It was difficult at first, but eventually we inmates got used to it", inmate Mario Benito revealed.

With the looming 25th anniversary of [...] in 1991, producer Harve Bennett revisited an idea Ralph Winter had for the fourth film: a prequel featuring young versions of Kirk and Spock at Starfleet Academy. The prequel was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of keeping the characters, if not the actors, in what was called [...] "Top Gun in outer space". Bennett and The Final Frontier writer David Loughery wrote a script entitled The Academy Years, where Dr. Leonard McCoy talks about how he met Kirk and Spock while addressing a group of Academy graduates. The script shows Kirk and Spock's upbringing, their meeting McCoy and Montgomery Scott at the Academy and defeating a villain before parting ways. The script would have established that George Kirk, James T. Kirk's father, was a pilot who went missing—presumed dead—during a warp experiment with Scott. The script is set before the [...] "enlightenment" [...] of the Federation; slavery and racism are common, with Spock being bullied because he is the only Vulcan student.
