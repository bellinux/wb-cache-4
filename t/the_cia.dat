5|$|Moreover, by compromising CIA methods, Ames {{enabled the}} KGB and its successor, the SVR, to filter feed {{material}} to <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> from 1986 to 1993. In 1987, KGB agent Aleksandr Zhomov offered to sell <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> intelligence {{on how the}} Soviets had detected and arrested the CIA's agents. The SE Division accepted Zhomov and assigned him the cryptonym GTPROLOGUE. Zhomov, who was actually a Soviet double agent assigned to protect Ames, furnished fake documents ascribing the CIA's agent losses to superior KGB surveillance and luck. He then told <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> that he would identify upcoming KGB plants, but only {{on the condition that}} <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> treat them as genuine, lest the KGB discover the leak and arrest him. The fake agents soon overwhelmed Moscow Station's resources, and Zhomov disappeared in July 1990 after receiving payment from the U.S. The spurious sources and the disinformation they provided reportedly convinced <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> that the 1985–1986 debacle was an anomaly, thus protecting Ames. Other genuine CIA agents were compromised by the Soviets, who used them to feed false intelligence back to the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Operation PBHISTORY was {{an effort}} by <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> to analyze {{documents}} from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup after the fact, in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union. Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed Soviet ties. <b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> also believed this would help it better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> had very little real information. A final motivation was that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment. The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz's personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> used {{surveillance}} {{photos and}} intelligence reports {{to determine the}} identities of the inhabitants of the Abbottabad compound to which the courier was traveling.

Smith reorganized <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> redefined its structure and its mission, and he gave it a new sense of purpose. He made <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> the arm of government primarily responsible for covert operations. He left <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> in 1953 to become an Under Secretary of State.

5|$|After Árbenz's resignation, {{his family}} {{remained}} for 73 {{days at the}} Mexican embassy in Guatemala City, which was crowded with almost 300 exiles. During this period, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> initiated {{a new set of}} operations against Árbenz, intended to discredit the former president and damage his reputation. <b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> obtained some of Árbenz's personal papers, and released parts of them after doctoring the documents. <b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> also promoted the notion that individuals in exile, such as Árbenz, should be prosecuted in Guatemala. When they were finally allowed to leave the country, Jacobo Árbenz was publicly humiliated at the airport when the authorities made the former president strip before the cameras, claiming that he was carrying jewelry he had bought for his wife, María Cristina Villanova, at Tiffany's in New York City, using funds from the presidency; no jewelry was found but the interrogation lasted for an hour. Through this entire period, coverage of Árbenz in the Guatemalan press was very negative, influenced largely by the CIA's campaign.|$|E

5|$|By 1949, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> {{claimed that}} Jevđević's {{intelligence}} material {{was being used}} by the Italian Ministry of Interior, the United States Counterintelligence Corps, British Forensic Science Service in Trieste, and French intelligence services in Rome and Paris. His intelligence correspondents included Đujić, who disseminated his intelligence reports to <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> Konstantin Fotić, the former Yugoslav ambassador to the United States, and Miro Didek, Croat politician Vladko Maček's self-styled intelligence representative in Rome. The intelligence reports were mostly collected from refugees fleeing Yugoslavia and arriving in Italy via Trieste and from émigré groups in Italy and Greece. By 1949, Jevđević claimed to have formed a large network of anti-communist propagandists in Italy and intelligence collection centres in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. <b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> believed that these claims were exaggerated, if not entirely fictitious. In 1951, Jevđević began printing an anti-communist, pro-Chetnik publication from an unidentified religious institution in Italy. Issues were regularly mailed to Yugoslav exiles and former Chetniks living in the United States, Canada, Australia and various European countries.|$|E
5|$|By early 1985, Reagan's anti-communist {{position}} {{had developed}} into a stance known as the new Reagan Doctrinewhich, in addition to containment, formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments. Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting Islamism in the majority-Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> encouraged anti-communist Pakistan's ISI to train Muslims {{from around the world}} to participate in the jihad against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas {{was given}} {{enough money to}} recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. <b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> {{established}} training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras and supplied them with weapons {{as well as several}} bombers. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was a fait accompli. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.|$|E

5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body of Lies, opined that <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> had become careless out of desperation.

The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of every document was to remain in Guatemala. Approximately half of the paper that had been gathered was incinerated. <b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> gave the highest priority to the documents seized from the PGT.|$|E
