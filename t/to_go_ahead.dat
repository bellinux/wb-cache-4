5|$|Chief Executive Donald Tsang {{said that}} being overzealous in saving the past may hurt Hong Kong's competitiveness, {{and called on}} activists {{to take a more}} {{balanced}} view toward economic growth and conservation. Soon after Tsang's re-election as Chief Executive, on 26 March, the Government pressed ahead with plans to dismantle and move the entire pier, piece by piece, enabling the reclamation <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|E
5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 6–10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was wavering {{and it looked}} doubtful {{that it would be}} carried out. When the Soviet Union shot down Flight 007, the U.S. was able to galvanize enough support at home and abroad to enable the deployment <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two months later, in November 1973 (just {{after the}} Yom Kippur War in October), the ANO hijacked KLM Flight 861, this time {{using the name}} Arab Nationalist Youth Organization.

In response, in March or July 1974, Arafat expelled Abu Nidal from Fatah.|$|E

5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, {{they built a}} narrow-gauge line {{on the north side}} of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> on New Don Pedro.|$|E

5|$|The British {{authorities}} in the area refused to support the raid, which they considered a breach of Spanish neutrality. Permission for the operation <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> eventually came from the Foreign Office in London. On 14 January 1942, while the ships' officers were attending a party arranged by an SOE agent, the commandos entered the port aboard two tugs, overpowered the ships' crews and sailed off with the ships, including the Italian merchant vessel Duchessa d'Aosta. The raid boosted SOE's reputation at a critical time and demonstrated its ability to plan and conduct secret operations no matter the political consequences.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan in December 1979 and threatened {{boycott of the}} 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow led organizers to consider again postponing the Canada Cup. While Eagleson initially favoured allowing the tournament <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> regardless of the political situation, he ultimately agreed that Hockey Canada should again postpone the Canada Cup after the Canadian Government joined the Olympic boycott. A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) would participate in such an event.|$|E

5|$|Troilus, however, {{after he}} had learned of his father's {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> and release Briseida and restore her to the Greeks, was overwhelmed and completely wracked by great grief, and almost entirely consumed by tears, anguished sighs, and laments, because he cherished her with the great fervour of youthful love and had been led by the excessive ardour of love into the intense longing of blazing passion. There was no one of his dear ones who could console him.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the closure}} of the tramway allowed {{planning}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> for a railway, the planning for the replacement railway line suffered various delays in the 1930s due to funding issues: the line's construction competed with a proposal to electrify the Illawarra Line to Waterfall, and there were disputes over {{the point at which the}} line would connect to the main line. Two early proposals to join the line at Como and north of Sutherland Station were rejected. Despite the delays, Parliament finally gave approval to the line on 2 March 1936, and a route with five new stations was surveyed that would connect with the main line at the southern side of Sutherland station. The new line was opened on 16 December 1939.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} June 2017 to extend Tonkin Highway north, past Ellenbrook {{and through the}} Swan Valley to Brand Highway and Great Northern Highway in Muchea. Interchanges are planned at {{junctions}} with Reid Highway, Hepburn Avenue and Beechboro Road North, Gnangara Road, The Promenade, Stock Road, Neaves road and Brand Highway and Great Northern Highway. The 3rd stage was originally planned to be a 2 lane single-carriageway road with at-grade intersections, with provision for upgrading in the future, but in the end, {{it was decided that}} the ultimate plan with a 4 lane dual-carriageway was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead.</b> The previously planned route of the PDNH, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park.

5|$|Despite {{having the}} better chances, York drew 0–0 {{at home with}} Cambridge United, before being beaten 3–1 away by Wrexham, in which Wilkinson scored a late {{consolation}} goal. The club made an attempt to re-sign former striker Clayton Donaldson on loan from Crewe Alexandra, but were told to make an inquiry four weeks later, due to him being injured. York's first double of the season came with a 2–0 away win over Woking, the goals coming from Wilkinson and McBreen. Iyseden Christie's loan spell at Kettering from Stevenage was to be terminated for a loan move to York <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead,</b> but this deal fell through. Walker revealed {{he was interested in}} signing striker Bruce Dyer, shortly after he played against York's reserve team for Bradford City.|$|E
5|$|In January 1801, in {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} the size of the French Mediterranean Fleet and to reinforce the beleaguered Egyptian garrison, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte ordered a squadron of seven ships of the line to sail from Brest on the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean under Rear-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume. The squadron made three unsuccessful attempts to reach Egypt, eventually retiring to Toulon in late July 1801. During the final effort, Ganteaume's squadron sailed from Toulon on 27 April 1801 with instructions to briefly secure local naval supremacy around Elba to allow a seabourne invasion <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead,</b> before travelling on into the Eastern Mediterranean. During these operations, Ganteaume discovered that several ships in his force were dangerously undermanned, and therefore decided to consolidate his crews and send three ships of the line, Formidable, Indomptable and Desaix, and the frigate Créole back to Toulon.|$|E
5|$|In the 77th minute, Keenor, Ferguson and Davies {{passed the}} ball among {{themselves}} before playing it wide to Thirlaway. Ferguson {{ran to the}} centre and the ball was crossed towards him.

It looked like Cardiff were about <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead,</b> however, a last minute tackle by Alfred Bower prevented Ernie Curtis from scoring, giving the Welsh team another corner. The ball was fired towards the goal mouth, and was shot into the goal from close range by Davies putting Cardiff ahead. The final two attacks of the game were both by Cardiff, with Russell saving a header by Ferguson and then Curtis firing the ball over the crossbar.|$|E
