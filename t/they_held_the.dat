5|$|After {{the decades}} of {{political}} disappointments, the February Revolution offered the Finnish Social Democrats momentum for power; <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> absolute majority in the Parliament. The conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists' might since 1899, with the climax in 1917 without the offsetting control of Russian administration; the Social Democrats had to be halted before {{they were able to}} markedly alter the power structure.|$|E

5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, {{it was clear}} that the race was close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans realized that if <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time since 2009, Alabama played Kentucky at Lexington, and in the game Alabama {{defeated}} the Wildcats 48–7. Although the Crimson Tide defense opened the game strong and forced Kentucky to punt after <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> Wildcats to a series of three-and-outs on their initial possessions, the Alabama offense did not see the same on-field success. After they were held to a punt on their first possession, fumbles by Kenyan Drake and T. J. Yeldon on the next two Crimson Tide possessions inside the Wildcats' 15-yard line kept the game scoreless.|$|E
5|$|Home met one of {{his future}} closest friends in 1867; the young Lord Adare (later the 4th Earl of Dunraven).

5|$|Moore and Helms {{would leave}} WCW briefly in 2001 to wrestle in NWA Wildside, where <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> Wildside Tag Team Championship for one day. Helms became {{the number one}} {{contender}} for the Cruiserweight Championship after winning a match at SuperBrawl Revenge, but was attacked by Karagias and Moore afterwards. Despite the attack, Helms {{would go on to}} defeat Guerrero for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship at Greed and was the reigning Cruiserweight Champion immediately before WCW was bought out by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Helms' contract with WCW was one of twenty-five that were included in WWF's purchase of WCW.|$|E

5|$|The Old Swiss Confederacy in the 17th {{century was}} a {{federation}} of thirteen largely independent cantons. The federation comprised rural cantons {{as well as}} city states that had expanded their territories into the countryside by political and military means {{at the cost of}} the previously ruling liege lords. The cities just took over the preexisting administrative structures. In these city cantons, the city councils ruled the countryside; <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> judicial rights and also appointed the district sheriffs (Landvögte).|$|E
