40|$|This paper investigates how syntax {{and focus}} {{interact}} in deriving <b>the</b> phonological <b>phrasing</b> of utterances in Xhosa, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa. Although {{the influence of}} syntax on phrasing is uncontroversial, a purely syntactic analysis cannot account for all the data reported for Xhosa by Jokweni (1995). Focus influences <b>the</b> <b>phrasing</b> in that it inserts a phonological phrase-boundary after the focused constituent. This generalization can account for the variation found in <b>the</b> <b>phrasing</b> of adverbials. <b>The</b> findings are dealt with in an OT-based framework following Truckenbrodt’s work on Chichewa (1995, 1999) which is extended to <b>the</b> <b>phrasing</b> of adjuncts. ...|$|R

5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial crises, {{and unemployment}} in the United States, which were viewed as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used {{as a form of}} rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. <b>The</b> <b>phrase</b> grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic {{properties}} of nominal Split Topicalization (ST) constructions in Standard and non-Standard German. <b>The</b> topic <b>phrase</b> denotes a property, and <b>the</b> MF <b>phrase</b> either modifies this property or picks out a specific entity. Semantically, <b>the</b> topic <b>phrase</b> will be analysed as a property-denoting expression which restricts the denotation of the verbal predicate, while <b>the</b> MF <b>phrase</b> is composed either via specify or restrict (cf. Chung and Ladusaw, 2003). Syntactically, the base position of <b>the</b> topic <b>phrase</b> is <b>the</b> (incorporating) verb, and <b>the</b> MF <b>phrase</b> is generated independently as the complement of the verb containing an empty pronoun. Since predicates introduce abstract discourse referents, <b>the</b> topic <b>phrase</b> can be resumed via "pro" in <b>the</b> MF <b>phrase...</b>|$|R

5|$|The source {{material}} {{comes from the}} works of three Roman historians, who were all born after the events of 52 AD. Suetonius (c.69–75 to after 130, probably writing around AD 121), and Cassius Dio (around 155–164 to after 229, probably writing 200–22) both wrote about the event and quoted <b>the</b> <b>phrase.</b> Tacitus (c.56–117, writing from around 98 to 117) mentions the event but does not quote <b>the</b> <b>phrase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on where}} it is used, <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> has had {{different}} emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as a prayer {{for the soul of}} the condemned. However, in later times, particularly in the United States, it has only been said as a result of legal tradition where the religious meaning and origin is not founded on belief.|$|E
5|$|Despite its popularization {{in later}} times, <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> is not {{recorded}} elsewhere in Roman history. Historians question {{whether it was}} ever used as a customary salute. It was more likely an isolated appeal by desperate captives and criminals condemned to die, and noted by Roman historians in part for the unusual mass reprieve granted by Claudius to the survivors.|$|E
