40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{security}} policies are based on access to and exchange of personal data, frequently with an international scope. While transatlantic measures generally include the EU as a single actor, {{the last two years}} have seen a proliferation of bilateral agreements between the US and individual EU member states. These agreements usually seek to extend abroad a range of specific, internal security measures. This chapter aims at studying the position of relevant actors and their capacity to increase their power or to quell resistance during the process of extra-territorialisation. This contribution assumes as a hypothesis that the set-up of security policies is readable as a ‘plateau’, a transversal field in which actors’ ability to shape new configurations of actors and fields is a key asset for enhancing their relevance. The research investigates this hypothesis further by taking as a case study the conclusion, in March 2008, of a <b>transatlantic</b> <b>agreement</b> on data exchange between Germany and the US. The text of the agreement mirrors the wording of existing European instruments and thus seems to offer an appropriate occasion to analyse the process of extra-territorialisation of security policies...|$|E

Using highly disaggregated 8 -digit import data in a theoretically grounded gravity model framework, we define an explicit measure of preferential tariff margins and use that to estimate sector-specific elasticities. From the methodological point of view, we show that the assessment of these policies’ impacts is very sensitive to the definition of the preferential tariff margin. An important by-product of our procedures is that they can be used to obtain estimates of trade elasticities of substitution, some of the most important parameters in the international trade empirical literature.

Right or wrong, there is little political appetite to include similar provisions into TTIP. At the time of writing, Washington also showed little appetite for a transatlantic or even multilateral investment court. In order to avoid losing support for the agreement as a whole, the parties now need to think about alternatives. This brief article proposes three solutions, which could be politically acceptable {{while at the same time}} offering meaningful investment protections.

The proposed paper intends to analyse two aspects of the likely implications which could be triggered by the future <b>transatlantic</b> <b>agreement.</b> First, the policy level of the analysis is focusing on the question of how the contracting parties will integrate the environmental concerns into the agreement and how these concerns could be reconciled with the standard trade concerns and principles. Second, the TTIP could also have a direct impact on the environmental regulation; for this reason, the paper will also focus on the regulatory level. The paper concludes that a carefully planned agreement will not constrain the policy leeway of the EU in the field of the environmental protection, however, the EU negotiators have to pay very close attention to choosing the right models, methods and formulations in the future text of the agreement...|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) and the United States are {{currently}} negotiating a free-trade agreement, the so-called Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). These negotiations {{have to be}} seen in perspective, since a number of other - bilateral and plurilateral - trade deals are being pursued at the same time. All these negotiations point to a worrisome aspect: the World Trade Organisation’s failure to come to a meaningful agreement in the Doha-round negotiations, in terms of market access, new rules and development. Like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), TTIP would stand out among the crowd of trade agreements because of the sheer volume of trade and investment flows across the Atlantic and the declared intention to boost regulatory cooperation and compatibility which is expected to bring the bulk of TTIP’s economic benefits. However, the prospect of concluding such a <b>transatlantic</b> <b>agreement</b> raises many concerns; the public in the European Union and the United States fears that TTIP could undermine existing levels of protection in areas such as health and the environment and impinge on either side’s “right to regulate”. Moreover, questions are being posed as to what TTIP would mean for the multilateral trading system and how it would affect third countries, especially developing countries. Against this backdrop, this article addresses the following issues in relation to TTIP: the vision underlying the negotiations; the European Commission’s negotiating mandate; the structure of the negotiations and their state of play; the Union’s competence for concluding TTIP and whether it is shared with EU Member States; and finally TTIP’s impact on the multilateral trading system and developing countries...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) have been the two protagonists among the industrialized actors in the United Nations (UN) climate change regime. Although the context for global {{policy-making}} has evolved considerably in recent times, {{with the rise of}} emerging economies like China and India, an EU-US entente remains of central importance to the successful conclusion of the post- 2012 climate regime negotiations. Where this year’s change of government in the US had sparked high hopes in Europe, the chances of really reaching a global deal on climate change have come to look rather slim shortly before the 15 th conference of the parties in Copenhagen. This paper argues that one significant cause for the very limited progress of global climate talks is a continued lack of <b>transatlantic</b> <b>agreement</b> on the main pillars of a future climate agreement, rooted in diverging interests, but also in deeply embedded cultural differences. Parting from a comparative analysis of the two parties’ positions on key issues in the negotiations, a European perspective is deliberately adopted to examine how the Union has tried to (reengage) the US in global climate politics over the past year and with what success. In a concluding section, the less successful elements of the EU’s current strategy will be highlighted to come to policy recommendations on how to forge a transatlantic response to the challenge of climate change in the medium to long term future. The recommendations are addressed, in the first place, to the relevant actors within the EU, but also to the US administration, which has recently tended to overly focus on its relations with China. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The 2005 World Summit was {{announced}} as a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity {{to reform the}} United Nations so as to provide it with the institutional and policy tools needed {{to meet the challenges}} and threats to peace and security in contemporary world. But the Summit was also meant to be a crucial test for the EU common foreign policy and for the state of transatlantic relations. As a matter of fact the success of any UN Reform could be hardly envisaged without the capacity of EU Member States to advance common and consensus-gathering positions and without bridging the gap between US and EU strategic visions on multilateralism and global governance. In order to discuss whether in New York an historic occasion has been seized or rather lost, a group of distinguished scholars and high level diplomats was convened in Florence at the joint invitation of IAI, EUI and UNICRI {{in the aftermath of the}} World Summit. This Working Paper reports the debate held at the international conference and offers a first assessment of the main outcomes of the Summit while drawing the future perspectives of the UN reform process. It is submitted that the Summit has fallen short of the historical UN reform the Secretary General had hoped for, but nonetheless it records some positive advancements. This is especially the case of those issues where a <b>transatlantic</b> <b>agreement</b> was reached, such as the decision to establish a Peace Building Commission for post-conflict reconstruction, the establishment of a Human Right Council and of a Democracy Fund to strengthen the countries’ capacity to implement the principles of democracy and the express endorsement of the new guiding concept of “responsibility to protect” the victims of severe violations of human rights. In other fields, achievements have to be measured against the ambiguity of the final text and room is left to further negotiations. For instance, the key concept of “human security”, which have been launched in the Report of the High Level Panel’s on Threats, Challenges and Changes (“A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility”), is endorsed but watered down to some very generic statement and a clear commitment to discuss further the notion in the General Assembly. Similarly, the historic decision to set up a new Human Right Council fails in addressing all the relevant features of the new organ (compositions, status, powers and relationship with existing organs and procedures) which are left to further negotiations in the General Assembly. A final evaluation remains therefore controversial. Lack of progress has to be recorded in core policy areas. In the field of development and environment the outcome document simply restates principles and commitments already affirmed. In the field of peace and security, no significant progresses were made in providing a global framework to combat terrorism nor specific commitments on disarmament and non-proliferation were assumed. In the highly-politicised issue of Security Council Reform, the division among EU member states did not help to reach a compromise solution. However, as a test for the EU capacity to act jointly and effectively on the international level, the World Summit has yielded positive results. The EU member States succeeded in putting their political weight behind a proactive attitude throughout the process, in pursuit of a number of clear objectives. On many issues, Europe may take the lead of the reform process, building on its own experience in promoting a lasting peace, protecting human rights and fostering development. Its commitment to an effective multilateralism attempts to promote a successful global governance without yielding to the temptation of unilateral drifts. No matter how determined and powerful, a single State or group of virtuous States cannot face the threats and challenges of a global world alone. In its endless opposition to unilateralism, multilateralism is mandated by the need for an effective global governance. For many, respect – and maybe with the exception of the field of global economic governance – the UN remains a viable and irreplaceable institution. In this regard, the foremost achievement of the World Summit is precisely the fact that all the members of the UN have restated the central role of the Organization in providing global governance and have committed themselves to strengthening its effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|To {{give the}} {{exchange}} {{of goods and services}} between the European Union (EU) and the United States (U. S.) new momentum the two parties are currently negotiating the <b>transatlantic</b> free trade <b>agreement</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The aim is to create the largest free trade area in the world. The agreement, once entered into force, will oblige EU countries and the U. S. to further liberalize their markets. The negotiations on TTIP include a chapter on Electronic Communications/ Telecommunications. The challenge therein will be securing commitments for market access to Electronic Communications services. At the same time, these commitments must reflect the legitimate need for consumer protection issues. The need to reduce Electronic Communications-related non-tariff barriers to trade between the Parties {{is due to the fact}} that these markets are heavily regulated. Without transnational rules as to regulations national governments can abuse these regulations to deter the market entry by new (foreign) suppliers. Thus the free trade agreement TTIP affects in many respects regulatory provisions on and access to Electronic Communications markets. The objective of this paper is therefore to examine to what extend the regulatory principles for Electronic Communications markets envisaged under TTIP will result in trade facilitation and regulatory convergence between the EU and the U. S. As to this question the result of the analysis is that the chapter on Electronic Communications will be an important step towards facilitating trade in Electronic Communications services. At the same time some regulatory convergence will take place, but this convergence will not lead to a (full) harmonization of regulations. Rather the norm, also after TTIP negotiations will have been concluded successfully, will be mutual recognition of different regulatory regimes. Different regulations being the optimal policy response in different market settings will continue to exist. Moreover, it is very unlikely that such regulatory principles for the Electronic Communications sector are a vehicle for a race to the bottom in levels of consumer protection...|$|R

Contrary to many conceptualizations, the eventual “excess” of data protection operates less against internal security than against the protection of privacy.

50|$|As EPP {{spokesperson}} in the WTO {{steering committee}} of the European Parliament, Rübig advocates for a sustainable removal of global trade barriers. In his view, developing countries can only {{break out of the}} poverty trap by opening their economies to international trade and investments, whereas protectionist measures have the opposite effect. In this context, free-trade should be accompanied by measures to improve infrastructure, a better education system for young people, as well as a well-functioning administrative and judicial system. Furthermore, Rübig argues in favour of giving companies the possibility to actively participate in dispute settlement procedures of the World Trade Organization, instead of only giving this possibility to national governments. Altogether, such a system would lead to a much higher degree of legal security in international trade.

The representatives of the intelligence services talked about the global security situation and warned against the high number of potential terrorists from the ranks of the so-called Islamic State. According to Clapper, 6,900 of the 38,000 ‘Islamic State’ fighters would hail from Western countries. He described that IS was using high-tech online methods for recruitment and propaganda purposes. Clapper warned against attacks by IS using chemical weapons, since they have access to some industrially produced chemical weapons and had already deployed them in the past. Clapper also stated that the infrastructure in Western industrial nations was threatened by future terrorist attacks. INTCEN Director Conrad referred in this context to the new risks associated with Big Data. The Intelligence Service officials agreed with the demand for an improved data exchange between their services.

40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is {{to assess the impact}} of {{currently}} negotiated TTIP <b>agreement</b> (<b>Transatlantic</b> Trade and Investment Partnership) on the use of hard coal in the EU and the US. Hard coal is the most important fuel in global electricity generation. This also applies to the United States, a leading manufacturer and exporter of this energy source.

Due to the fact that price has a major impact on the size of exports, the paper presents the estimated prices, including freight costs, of power coal for the analyzed scenarios. According to one scenario, the US and European prices will be equalized (including freight costs) by 2020, while from 2025 on the comparative advantage and competitiveness of the US hard coal will decrease. Taking into account the fact that the export of coal from the United States is free from customs duties, the acceptance of TIPP should not affect the currently existing trade between the two continents and the amount of exported coal.

The process of validation and registration of importers and Italian facilities (and European ones) requested by U. S. Administrative Authorities may be included in this “regulatory asymmetry”. At the same time it is now evident - in the light of recent changes in U. S. Food Law - a clear new centrality of the role of law that would seem to invert the traditional reading of the U.

Indeed, the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (FSMA), replacing and supplementing in many parts the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act of June 2, 2002 (known as “Bioterrorism Act”), has changed the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FDCA), setting a new approach to food safety, also in relation to imports, on a “preventative approach “ (and, perhaps, until to an “ moderate precautionary principle”), based on the criterion of “reasonable probability”, in place of the one of “credible evidence”, in the detection and control of health risks.

40|$|International {{regulation}} {{and control of}} WMD is not a United States - European Union bilateral issue, but it appears on the political agenda of the <b>transatlantic</b> relation and <b>agreements</b> or disagreements between the two have international consequences. Agreements signal joint action by {{an important part of}} the international community and, often, can inspire or encourage universal commitments as well as other international actions. Disagreements, however, block such joint action and, sometimes, impede international measures of universal (or at least collective) scope. Within this context, the purpose of this article is to analyze how these two major international actors, the United States (U. S.) and the European Union (E. U.), define their strategies and policies to deal with problems old and new-related to WMD. In fact, the U. S. approach to managing proliferation of WMD has undergone a remarkable evolution, if not a change, in the post-Cold War era. At the same time, it has been a period of remarkable changes for the European integration process, leading to the transformation of the European Communities (a specifically economic organization) into the E. U. (an obviously political entity). Although its policies and actions have long included much that is related to nonproliferation matters, the E. U. had not designed a general approach against WMD until two years ago. Three criteria will guide the comparison between the U. S. and the E. U. policies against WMD: scope, objectives and instruments. The two reference documents are 2 ̆ 2 The National Strategy to combat WMD 2 ̆ 2 adopted on December 2002, and 2 ̆ 2 The European Strategy against the proliferation of WMD, 2 ̆ 2 approved by the European Council on December 2003. The comparison should permit identification of the grounds for possible changes in the international regime of these kinds of weapons...|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} in 1970 and has both French and Swiss nationality. After {{completing}} an M.Phil in IR at Cambridge, Roth became the research assistant of Teddy or Edward Goldsmith, the renowned ecologist and founder of The Ecologist magazine. Goldsmith's writings and views were to have a main influence on Roth's work. In 1999 she became {{an editor of the}} The Ecologist magazine which was then run by Zac Goldsmith. While working there, Roth specialised on campaigns and social movements, regularly contributing with articles {{on a wide range of}} issues. In 2002 she moved to Romania to volunteer with grassroots groups working against destructive developments. Roth first worked with the Sighisoara Durabila NGO against a Dracula theme park planned in a natural reservation area situated in close vicinity to the UNESCO protected city of Sighisoara. Once the theme park was halted in May 2002, she moved to Rosia Montana to help develop a campaign against Europe's largest open-pit gold mine proposed by Rosia Montana Gold Corporation. This campaign, which Roth coordinated from 2002-2010, is known as the Save Rosia Montana movement and centres around the local opposition. In 2005 she received the Goldman Environmental Prize for her efforts to stop this development. In 2008, Roth initiated a Romanian NGO platform to ban the use of cyanide in mining. The campaign spilled over to Hungary and provoked a ban of cyanide-based mining at the 10th anniversary year of the Baia Mare cyanide accident. This precedent setting vote led to the formation an informal platform consisting of CEE and CIS-based NGOs campaigning for an EU-wide ban on cyanide based mining. In May 2010 the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted for such ban but to this day the European Commission for the Environment refuses to act on it; quoting unemployment generated by such ban. In 2011 Roth initiated a campaign for Rosia Montana to become a UNESCO protected World Heritage site. Over the years Roth has contributed to the work of several mining and related campaigns and assessments in the CEE region and beyond. Roth currently lives in Berlin where she developed campaigns for ARC2020, a European platform working on food & farming issues and the CAP reform. Since 2014 she has been working as campaign coordinator of the Stop TTIP self-organized European citizen's initiative, a European campaign fighting against the TTIP and CETA <b>transatlantic</b> free trade <b>agreements.</b> To this date Roth is still contributing to the 'Save Rosia Montana!' campaign.|$|R
5000|$|Former German Chancellor Schmidt said Europe was {{decreasing}} in importance. Schmidt {{stated that}} the consequences of global population growth were crucial for the continent's future. Europe will make up only seven {{percent of the world}} population in 2050, while in 1950 more than one in five people had lived in Europe. According to Schmidt, the Europeans overestimated their global significance. The former Chancellor critically regarded global urbanization, which leads to the [...] "big urban masses", who were [...] "easily led astray" [...] by the temptations of modern media. Schmidt called the [...] "power of the financial manager" [...] another threat which despite the recent financial crisis was unabated. The current European Union policy, Schmidt described as a future hazard: [...] "If the EU continues the way that it is, in ten years’ time NATO will still be there, but maybe not the EU." [...] David Miliband described a decline of classical foreign policy and attributed this {{to the fact that the}} electorate increasingly placed regional and national issues at the center of importance.No approaches were made towards the transatlantic conflict over NSA surveillance in Europe. The US Secretaries John Kerry and Chuck Hagel avoided any mention of this controversial subject. Instead Kerry advocated a [...] "transatlantic renaissance" [...] based on common values. Hagel emphasized the role of Europe as an [...] "indispensable partner" [...] of the United States. Both ministers campaigned for the <b>transatlantic</b> free trade <b>agreement</b> TTIP. US Senator John McCain added in relation to the NSA spying on allies as a 'credibility problem', which the American government had to deal with in order to regain lost trust. Significant criticism of the NSA spying was voiced by German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière. Throughout the discussion he called the carried out spying on German citizens [...] "exorbitantly" [...] and demanded a [...] "signal from the Americans to their closest partner in Europe". De Maizière declared that the political damage caused by these surveillance measures was higher than their security benefits. The Federal Minister of the Interior called the information provided by the American side completely inadequate. A possible no-spy agreement with the United States provided the Minister with no great expectations. Along Kerry and Hagel, de Maizière agreed with a continuation of negotiations on TTIP. The German MEP Elmar Brok predicted a defeat in the vote on the TTIP agreement in the European Parliament in the event that an examination and reappraisal of the NSA's activities would fail. Company representatives from Deutsche Telekom, Huawei and Microsoft demanded a binding international standard of Internet security. Thus, Deutsche Telekom CEO Timothy Höttges called for an international agreement of digital basic rights. Microsoft Vice President Matt Thomlinson announced the opening of the company's own transparency centers, including one in Brussels, where governments could check the source code of Microsoft products to insure that they contain no backdoors for US intelligence agencies.During the conference, the two Prime Ministers from Serbia and Kosovo, Ivica Dacic and Hashim Thaçi, came forward and discussed the rapprochement between the two countries, which in 2013 had led to the signing of the normalization Agreement, under the moderation of Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Both leaders reaffirmed their intention to seek solutions, [...] "that advance the two nations". Dacic called the convergence process as a [...] "tightrope walk" [...] and Thaci referred to resistors in the population that had to be overcome before the agreement.|$|R
40|$|International Trade Observatory and Relex Working Group. Department of Law, Working Group on EU External Relations. This e-book compiles {{the written}} {{contributions}} {{prepared by the}} speakers of an EUI conference titled ‘Global Europe: The New Generation of EU Preferential Trade Agreements’. The conference took place on May 14 - 15, 2012, on the EUI premises in San Domenico di Fiesole. It was organized by the EUI Working Group on EU External Relations Law, {{under the auspices of}} Professor Marise Cremona and Professor Petros Mavroidis, with generous support provided by the EUI’s Global Governance Programme and the Academy of European Law. The e-book is divided into four parts. In the introductory part, David Kleimann provides a perspective on the European Commission’s efforts to implement the ‘Global Europe’ strategy and outlines the domestic and external challenges that EU leaders face in this process. Part II is devoted to crosscutting issues that generally apply to contemporary PTAs. Against the background of the most recent wave of regional and inter-regional economic integration, Petros Mavroidis argues that the relevance of the WTO for international trade liberalization and rule making is fading. Patrick Messerlin, secondly, considers the various domestic motives for the negotiation of PTAs and identifies the actors that play important roles in the political economy processes associated with the negotiation and conclusion of PTAs. Jean-Pierre Chauffour and David Kleimann, third, examine key economic, institutional, and policy challenges that arise in the course of PTA implementation processes in developing countries and derive a number of recommendations that aim at more effective and development oriented PTA implementation. Part III then turns to several of topics that shed light on specific aspects of EU PTA negotiations and their domestic ratification. For starters, Adrian van den Hoven contends that the EU is now moving toward a PTA negotiation approach that is more than ever geared towards the achievement of reciprocity of mutual commitments with partner countries. Maria Joao Podgorny, secondly, reflects {{on the role of the}} European Parliament in the area of EU trade and investment policy and provides a perspective on the process of inter-institutional cooperation between Parliament, the European Commission, and the Council with regard to the ratification of EU PTAs. Elisabeth Roderburg, third, argues the case for deep transatlantic economic integration between the EU and the United States. Jakob Cornides, fourth, explains how and why the European Commission seeks to export EU intellectual property protection standards to third countries through plurilateral and bilateral trade agreements. In Part IV of this e-book, four authors devote particular attention to the question of how the European Union seeks to achieve non-commercial objectives through the negotiation of PTAs. Isabelle Ramdoo and Sanoussi Bilal provide a critical reflection on the EU’s approach to the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with African countries and assess the merits of this endeavour for the promotion of economic development and regional integration in Africa. Lorand Bartels, secondly, examines how the EU, by means of ‘human rights clauses’ and sustainable development chapters in its PTAs, implements its obligation to ensure that its external activities respect human rights and pursue the objective of promoting sustainable development. In a related contribution, Fabiano de Andrade Correa considers the extent to which EU trade agreements have increasingly included procedural and substantive sustainable development provisions in its PTAs. •	List of Contributors •	Part I – An Overview - 1 •	‘Global Europe’: Quo Vadis?, David Kleimann - 3 •	Part II – The Domestic Political Economy, PTA Implementation, and the WTO - 17 •	Gone with the Wind?
