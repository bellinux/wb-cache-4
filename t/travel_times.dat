The RUE model can be adopted to overcome the difficulty in predicting the flow pattern in a congested and unreliable road network. In this RUE model, both the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability are taken into account for drivers' route choices by introducing a concept of path preference index (PI) to quantify the attractiveness of each alternative path for travel between a particular origin-destination pair.

40|$|Summary The {{importance}} of mobility {{and technology in}} the current Information Age makes it interesting to investigate the interconnections between these aspects. The New Mobilities Paradigm underlines the interconnections between technology-supported virtual mobilities and corporeal mobilities, which encompasses the two important features of our current post-modern society; mobility and ICT. This vision is used to investigate the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use of Dutch travellers, the factors that can influence <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, the role of ICT in <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, the influence of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use on journey experience and the differences in these aspects between transport modes. Many policy makers {{in the field of}} transportation see <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> as a disutility and a cost to someone’s productive time, which means that they aim to minimise <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> But it is argued in the present study that <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> can be used to perform activities, which can give <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> a positive utility. The developments of mobile ICT have the potential to increase the productivity of travellers, which can enhance the positive utilities of <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> Previous studies have already looked into <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use and the positive utilities of <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> Several studies in the UK and a study in Japan have already investigated <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use and the role of ICT, but the Dutch context was not studied in this respect before. The <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> uses in cars and trains were investigated in previous studies, but more research was needed to gain more insights into <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use and some associated aspects. Busses and metros were not investigated before, and the differences between transport modes in <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use and the other investigated aspects could be important to study as well. This is why <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, the factors that can influence <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, the role of ICT, the influence of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use on journey experience and the differences in these aspects between transport modes are investigated among Dutch car, train, bus and metro travellers in the Rotterdam metropolitan area. Questionnaires and observations were used to collect empirical data, as the combination of asking questions and observing behaviour can give more complete information and can prevent problems with biased data outcomes. The results showed that travellers engaged in all sorts of activities while travelling. Many travellers were looking out of the window, using mobile phones, relaxing, talking to fellow travellers or listening to music during their journeys. Most respondents saw their <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use as time-out or relaxation, and many of the activities they performed were more for personal benefit than for productivity. More than three quarters of the respondents did not see their <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> as wasted or lost time, but indicated it as either productive or relaxing, which means that most travellers in the present study did seem to get some positive utilities from their <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> It was also found that available seating (in public transport), carrying equipment and using well-designed and high-quality vehicles, can positively influence <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use. But high degrees of crowding (in public transport) and noise were found to have negative influences on <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use. ICT was found to positively influence <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> productivity and journey experience, which indicates a positive role of ICT in <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use. <b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> use itself also had a positive influence on the perceived journey experiences of travellers, which again shows that most travellers got some sort of positive utility from their <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> by performing activities on the move. The data also showed clear differences between transport modes, as most <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> uses showed higher frequencies in public transport modes when compared to cars. Especially train users showed high frequencies in many <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> activities, and the role of ICT also seemed to be the most significant and positive in the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use on trains. The respondents perceived the train to be the best transport mode option in terms of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, while the metro was perceived quite negatively. The present study resulted in valuable new insights into <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use in the Dutch context, but also found that <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> is mainly used for relaxing activities. This was also concluded in previous studies on <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, but {{it can be argued that}} these non-productive activities also have important benefits for travellers. The results also showed that people perceive their <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> quite positively and that they often use their <b>time</b> invested in <b>travelling</b> in a useful way, which can lead to a more positive travel experience. And the fast developments of mobile ICT can help to increase productivity and <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use. Policy makers should stop treating <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> as a disutility and should promote <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use instead, as the potentials and positive utilities of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use are clearly shown in the present study...|$|R
30|$|Once the {{coefficients}} are estimated the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution can be fully described by random generation {{of a large}} number of samples.

From this figure it can be observed that SRSM probability distribution is uni-modal (having one maximum at 625  sec), asymmetrical and similarly follows the actual <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution. Whereas <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution obtained by MLR models are bimodal frequency curves having two peaks, one maximum at 625  s and the other maximum at 925  s. Even <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution estimated by MLR model by considering all the uncertainty parameters (Table  1) also follows bimodal frequency. From this it can be conclude that the MLR models are overestimating beyond the average actual <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> (783  s). It can also be concluded from the Fig.  5 that even if more uncertainty parameters are considered for modeling <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> MLR models are unable to follow the actual <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution. Further, from <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution it can be observed that <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> obtained by SRSM model is well distributed between <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> 542  s to 2, 302  s. Whereas MLR models estimated <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution varies between 493 to 1, 363  s. From this it can be concluded that MLR models are unable to map the worst case scenarios, this we can observe from tails of the probability distribution of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> (Fig.  5).|$|R

It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at the green light to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions.

5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase {{in direct proportion}} to improving <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> The study concluded that {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year Strategic Plan of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, electrification was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of electrification and its lower priority meant electrification would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from funds that had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that electrification instead should be the top priority to make the rail line more palatable to neighbors, citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for electrification of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to San Francisco International Airport may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The electrification of Caltrain was assigned a higher priority than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E
40|$|Paper revised from {{original}} submittal. Lyman and Bertini 2 Abstract. <b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> estimation is {{of increasing}} importance to travelers and transportation professionals alike as congestion worsens in major urban areas. In fact, {{the reliability of}} <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> estimates on a given corridor {{may be more important}} for travelers, shippers, and transport managers than the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> itself. This paper examines the uses of measured <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability indices for improving real-time transportation management and traveler information using archived ITS data. Beginning with a literature review of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability and its value as a congestion measure, a content analysis of twenty regional transportation plans from across the nation is then described. Results from the content analysis indicate that <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability is not currently used as a congestion measure, and that the most common measures of congestion were the volume-to-capacity ratio, vehicle hours of delay, and mean speed. Then, as a case study using data from Portland, Oregon, several reliability measures are tested including <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> 95 th percentile <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> index, buffer index, planning time index, and congestion frequency. The buffer index is used to prioritize freeway corridors according to <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability. Metropolitan planning organizations should use <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability in the following ways: 1) incorporate it as a system-wide goal; 2) evaluate roadway segments according to <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability measures; and 3) prioritize roadway segments using those measures...|$|R

And Double-bounded Dichotomous Choice among Contingent Valuation Method(CVM) was applied to survey the willingness-to-pay of drivers when <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability is improved. Finally the value of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability was estimated using the results of survey and logit model. The value of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability was estimated considering <b>travel</b> objectives, <b>time</b> constraint <b>travel</b> and non-time constraint travel. RESULTS: The value of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability of business trip is higher than that of non-business trip. The value of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability of <b>time</b> constraint <b>travel</b> is higher than that of non-time constraint travel. The value of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability in urban area is higher than that in rural area. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the proposed method in this study is more realistic and proper to estimate the value of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability because it reflects the situations of <b>time</b> constraint <b>travel</b> and non-time constraint travel...|$|R
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} {{penetration}} rate analysis and class identification studies that the Bluetooth has an average penetration rate of 5  % in Turkey conditions, and captures mainly 2 W and LMV, which are grouped as High Speed Vehicles (HSV) in this study. The <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> captured by Bluetooth is thus the average <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> of HSV. The <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> of slow moving vehicles must be estimated from the measured <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> in order to compute the complete stream <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
