40|$|The {{design studio}} plays {{a central role}} in how {{architecture}} students learn to become architects. Because of the particular kinds of knowledge involved in designing, and the corresponding ways of learning and teaching adopted in the design studio, interaction between the design studio and theoretical courses is not always straightforward, despite their mutual relevance. The present paper documents and reflects on an attempt at reinforcing the interaction between a particular design studio and a <b>theoretical</b> <b>course,</b> with special attention to inclusive design. Analysis of the students’ work for the design studio and the <b>theoretical</b> <b>course,</b> and feedback from other stakeholders involved, suggests that students who attended both demonstrated a more nuanced understanding of the issues addressed in the <b>theoretical</b> <b>course,</b> and a more responsive design process. While it would be vainly ambitious to claim that there was theory produced out of this one cross-course experiment, the analysis shows that the interaction between designing in the studio and theoretical reflection in the course raised interesting questions and triggered valuable insights, not only about inclusive design, but also about the nature of design in general. status: publishe...|$|E
