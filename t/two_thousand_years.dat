5|$|Copán was {{occupied}} {{for more than}} <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years,</b> from the Early Preclassic period to the Postclassic.

5|$|The History of Animals had a {{powerful}} influence on zoology for some <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years.</b> It {{continued to be a}} primary source of knowledge until in the sixteenth century zoologists including Conrad Gessner, all influenced by Aristotle, wrote their own studies of the subject.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with this}} method of {{reconstruction}} by analogy, we find the idea of myth and epics ... so when narrating the history of Christ, I did not reconstruct Christ such as he actually was. If I had reconstructed Christ's history as it actually was, I {{would not have made}} a religious film, since I am not a believer. I do not think Christ was God's son. I would have made a positivist or Marxist reconstruction if any, so at the best of cases, a life of one of the five or six thousands saints preaching at that moment in Palestine. However, I did not want to do that, I am not interested in profanations: that is just a fashion I loath, it is petit bourgeois. I want to consecrate things again, because that is possible, I want to re-mythologize them. I did not want to reconstruct the life of Christ as it really was, I wanted to make the history of Christ <b>two</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>years</b> of Christian version on, since it is the <b>two</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>years</b> of Christian history that have mythologized this biography, one that as such would have been virtually insignificant otherwise. My film is the life of Christ after <b>two</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>years</b> of stories on the life of Christ. That is what I had in mind.|$|R

5|$|Burial mounds {{in present-day}} Indian Mounds Park {{suggest that the}} area was {{originally}} inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> ago. From the early 17th century until 1837, the Mdewakanton Dakota, a tribe of the Sioux, lived near the mounds after fleeing their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe. They called the area I-mni-za ska dan ("little white rock") for its exposed white sandstone cliffs.|$|E

There, She {{fell in love with}} him, promising to give him the secret of immortality if he would kill Amenartas. He refused, and, enraged, She struck him down.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Constantinople (1453), the newly {{expanded}} Ottoman Empire welcomed European embassies in its capital, which in turn became the sources of plants from those regions to the east which traded with the empire. In the following century twenty times as many plants entered Europe along the Silk Road as had been transported in the previous <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years,</b> mainly as bulbs. Others were acquired primarily for their alleged medicinal value. Initially Italy benefited from this new knowledge, especially Venice, which traded extensively with the East. From there these new plants rapidly spread {{to the rest of}} Western Europe.|$|E

Origin Adamantius {{is known to have}} also used the asteriskos to mark missing Hebrew lines from his Hexapla. The asterisk evolved in shape over time, but its meaning as a symbol used to correct defects remained.|$|R
5000|$|Historical records, ancient carvings and {{decorative}} patterns on utensils show {{the origin of}} Chinese acrobatics more than <b>two</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>years</b> ago {{in the period of}} the Warring States. During the Quin and Han Dynasties (221 B.C. - 220 A.D.) acrobatic artistes developed a wide repertoire, and acrobatics was thus called [...] "the show of a hundred tricks." [...] It reached a high level as a performing art by the Han Dynasty.|$|R
5|$|Since {{classical}} {{times and}} possibly much earlier, hundreds of {{species of plants}} have provided drugs to treat {{a wide range of}} conditions. Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, written by 70 AD, listed some 600 medicinal plants and around 1000 drugs made from them, including substances known to be effective such as aconite, aloes, colocynth, colchicum, henbane, opium and squill. The book remained a standard reference for nearly <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years,</b> and was the basis of the European pharmacopoeia {{until the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The two {{official}} {{languages of}} the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Each language {{has produced a}} noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for over <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> and was possibly introduced during the Iron Age. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages respectively.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the site}} of the church, {{including}} {{the upper part of the}} sea defences there, is managed by English Heritage, and the village has all but disappeared. The present appearance of the cliff below the church, a grassy slope above a large stone apron, was the work of central government and was in place by April 1867. In 2000 the surviving fragments of an early medieval cross that once stood inside the old church were used to design a Millennium Cross to commemorate <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> of Christianity. This stands at the entrance to the car park and was commissioned by Canterbury City Council.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for some}} 17 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of Lesbos and the marine life in the island's lagoon at Pyrrha. This study made him the earliest natural historian whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years.</b> His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for about}} 20 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed and systematic observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of Lesbos, where he spent about two years, and the marine life in the seas around it, especially of the Pyrrha lagoon in the island's centre. This study made him the earliest scientist whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years.</b> He returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lycaeum, where he taught for the last dozen years of his life. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5000|$|The current {{usage of}} the term puts much less {{emphasis}} in missions and ecumenism. A number of historians have noted a twentieth-century [...] "global shift" [...] in Christianity, from a religion largely found in Europe and the Americas to one which {{is found in the}} global south. Hence, [...] "world Christianity" [...] has more recently been used to describe the diversity and the multiplicity of Christianity across its <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>year</b> history.|$|R

50|$|In {{relation}} to elective abortion, Pope John Paul II wrote about ensoulment in his 1995 encyclical letter Evangelium Vitae that:Throughout Christianity's <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>year</b> history, this same doctrine of condemning all direct abortions has been constantly {{taught by the}} Fathers of the Church and by her Pastors and Doctors. Even scientific and philosophical discussions about the precise moment of the infusion of the spiritual soul have never given rise to any hesitation about the moral condemnation of abortion.|$|R
5|$|Consistent {{accounts}} of Saruman's earlier history appear in Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings, {{first published in}} The Return of the King, and in the posthumously published The Silmarillion (1977) and Unfinished Tales (1980). All were written in the mid-1950s. Saruman, like Gandalf and Radagast the Brown, {{is one of five}} 'wizards', known as the Istari, who begin to arrive in Middle-earth circa <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings. They are Maiar, envoys of the godlike Valar sent to challenge Sauron by inspiring the people of Middle-earth rather than by direct conflict. Tolkien regarded them as being somewhat like incarnate angels. Saruman initially travels in the east; he is later appointed head of the White Council and eventually settles at Gondor's outpost of Isengard. Fifty years before The Lord of the Rings, after his studies reveal that the One Ring might be found in the river Anduin near Sauron's stronghold at Dol Guldur, he helps the White Council drive out Sauron in order to facilitate his search.|$|E
5|$|Refinement of sulfidic {{zinc ores}} {{produces}} {{large volumes of}} sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes {{per year in the}} 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20to1.|$|E
5|$|Since then, many {{scholars}} have operated under {{the belief that}} the Great Wall continually defended China's border against the steppe nomads for <b>two</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years.</b> For example, the 18th-century sinologist Joseph de Guignes assigned macrohistorical importance to such walls when he advanced the theory that the Qin construction forced the Xiongnu to migrate west to Europe and, becoming known as the Huns, ultimately contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. Some have attempted to make general statements regarding Chinese society and foreign policy based on the conception of a perennial Great Wall: Karl Marx took the Wall to represent the stagnation of the Chinese society and economy, Owen Lattimore supposed that the Great Wall demonstrated a need to divide the nomadic way of life from the agricultural communities of China, and John K. Fairbank posited that the Wall played a part in upholding the Sinocentric world order.|$|E
