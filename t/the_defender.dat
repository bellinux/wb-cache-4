5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. <b>The</b> <b>defender</b> has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead <b>the</b> <b>defender.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>defender</b> {{actively}} avoids or blocks {{an incoming}} attack {{executed by the}} training partner. <b>The</b> <b>defender</b> has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs with training partners of similar experience. This is normally the practice when both training partners are in the senior ranks.|$|E
50|$|The Secret Empire freed {{him again}} when <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> {{infiltrated}} <b>the</b> Secret Empire's HQ {{and he helped}} capture <b>the</b> <b>Defenders.</b> Even so, <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> escaped and overthrew the Secret Empire again.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>defenders</b> monitor contact. As soon as {{contact is}} taken, <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> {{try to make}} sure to take cover. If <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> are on dismount, they {{try to make sure}} cover is the closest and most secure cover possible. If <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> are mounted, they try to ensure all gunners reduce to [...] "Chin strap defilade" [...] where nothing is showing out of the vehicle but the chin and above. <b>The</b> <b>defenders</b> try to ensure the gunner has proper shielding.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Defenders</b> began play in 2012 as {{a member}} of the American Professional Football League. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Defenders</b> {{experienced}} immediate success, finishing the regular season with a 9-3 record, tied for second place with the Council Bluffs Express. However, <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> would get <b>the</b> #3 seed because of the Express holding the head-to-head tiebreaker. In the teams' first-round playoff game, <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> lost to <b>the</b> Express 37-32.|$|R
5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by <b>the</b> <b>defender,</b> the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E
5|$|Graham Cross {{holds the}} record for the most Leicester appearances, with <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> playing 599 games between 1960–1976, {{although}} Adam Black holds {{the record for}} the most appearances in the league with 528 between 1920–1935.|$|E

It concludes with <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> being overwhelmed, and not sure if they can defeat the Baller-Bots.|$|R
5000|$|He {{then became}} a {{recurring}} member of <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> in good standing. Alongside <b>the</b> <b>Defenders,</b> he battled <b>the</b> Six-Fingered Hand, and was taken to Hell by Satan.

5|$|It {{is easier}} to attack than to defend. A {{defending}} mistake can have bigger consequences than an attacking mistake. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> {{needs to be more}} precise, which in turn can lead to a time advantage for the attacker.|$|E
5|$|He came to play 15 league games {{during the}} spring season, helping the team reach the {{second place in the}} league. He was noted for six assists, which placed him third in the assist-table and which made him <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> with the most assists of the 2014–15 season – despite playing {{less than half of the}} games. Defensively Copenhagen only conceded goals in six games, with many experts {{claiming}} that he was one of the best players of the spring season.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{treatment}} of David I and the Scottish church usually emphasises David's pioneering {{role as the}} instrument of diocesan reorganisation and Norman penetration, beginning with the bishopric of Glasgow while David was Prince of the Cumbrians, and continuing further north after David acceded to the throne of Scotland. Focus too is usually given to his role as <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> of the Scottish church's independence from claims of overlordship by the Archbishop of York and the Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the San Francisco Giants renewed their PDC with <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> {{franchise}} until 2010.

5|$|In {{response}} to a Maronite priest's complaints about harassment by Shia Muslims against Christians, Shahin's men attacked and plundered Shia villages and travelers in Jubail and demanded that Shia villages convert to Christianity to avoid assault. The Shia residents of Jubail protested these assaults in June 1859. While Shahin's actions further frustrated the local elites, Christian, Muslim and Druze alike, his reputation as <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> of Christian rights was bolstered at the popular level.|$|E
5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} a person prepares a weapon in order to defend {{themselves}} against expected attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. <b>The</b> <b>defender</b> may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E
50|$|Eight years later, Astro and the Guardians of the Galaxy time-traveled to the 20th Century, and met <b>the</b> <b>Defenders.</b> <b>The</b> Guardians {{returned}} to 3015 A.D. with Starhawk and <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> to defeat a new Badoon invasion force.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first series}} was {{published}} for twelve issues from December 1971 until November 1973. [...] The lead story in Marvel Feature #1, by writer Roy Thomas and artist Ross Andru, featured the first team-up of the Hulk, Doctor Strange, and the Sub-Mariner as <b>the</b> <b>Defenders.</b> <b>The</b> issue included a new Dr. Strange solo tale. <b>The</b> <b>Defenders</b> continued as <b>the</b> stars of Marvel Feature {{for two more}} issues and then received their own self-titled series in August 1972, <b>The</b> <b>Defenders.</b> Marvel Feature #3 saw <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> battle Xemnu, a huge, furry, alien monster which had originally been named [...] "the Hulk".|$|R
60|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> {{rushed to}} meet him. Others, {{catching}} up their children, ran {{with their wives}} to <b>the</b> citadel. <b>The</b> <b>defenders</b> fought bravely, but were driven steadily up the hill by the Romans--who were now reinforced by the whole strength of the army, led by Vespasian. Quarter was neither asked nor given. <b>The</b> <b>defenders</b> contested every foot of the hill, until <b>the</b> last <b>defender</b> of Gamala, outside, the citadel had fallen.|$|R
5|$|The museum {{also has}} a large {{collection}} of antique books.

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} enquiries {{from other}} clubs, he stayed at Vicarage Road for pre-season, {{in the hope}} of regaining his match fitness. After proving that he had recovered, Gibbs was offered a short term contract at the club, which was eventually extended. Newly relegated Watford finished 13th of 24 teams in 1996–97. They conceded 38 goals in 46 league matches, the joint-best defensive record in the division. Gibbs missed just one of the club's 57 fixtures, scoring in a game against Brentford. <b>The</b> <b>defender</b> later noted the irony that having been released as an injury concern, he ended up playing more games the following season than any of his teammates.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Zara Yaqob also {{continued}} as <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> of the Patriarch of Alexandria. When he heard in 1441 {{of the destruction}} of the Egyptian monastery of Debre Mitmaq by Sultan Az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Jaqmaq, he called for a period of mourning, then sent a letter of strong protest to the Sultan. He reminded Jaqmaq that he had Muslim subjects whom he treated fairly, and warned that he had the power to divert the Nile, but refrained from doing so for the human suffering it would cause. Jaqmaq responded with gifts to appease Zara Yaqob's anger, but refused to rebuild the Coptic Churches he had destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly afterwards, Attuma briefly {{lost control}} of Atlantis and Namor {{returned}} to the throne, but Attuma regained the throne of Atlantis, when Namor was cursed as one of <b>the</b> <b>Defenders,</b> a curse which would transport Namor away whenever <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> were needed and leave Atlantis undefended. Attuma formed the group Deep Six, to defend Atlantis from Namor and <b>the</b> <b>Defenders.</b> (Attuma's [...] "Deep Six" [...] was named after the first Deep Six, a group of heroes who aided Namor, including Andromeda.) Though outnumbered, <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> outsmarted Attuma and Namor retook Atlantis.|$|R
5000|$|In case of {{termination}} of <b>the</b> <b>Defender's</b> powers, <b>the</b> new <b>Defender</b> shall be appointed {{within a month}} from the date of {{termination of}} the powers of <b>the</b> previous <b>Defender.</b>|$|R
50|$|Egghead {{equipped}} a NASA Space Station with {{an arsenal}} and reformed the Emissaries of Evil with Rhino, Solarr, and Cobalt Man (who Egghead had brainwashed into destroying <b>the</b> <b>Defenders).</b> Egghead then sent the Emissaries of Evil to attack <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> and obtain <b>the</b> Star of Capistan. Rhino and Solarr held their own against <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> {{and realized that}} they did not have the Star of Capistan. Upon returning to the space station, Rhino and Solarr were punished by Egghead, who then sent Cobalt Man to deal with <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> and use his nuclear powers so that Egghead can see <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> be destroyed. Cobalt Man was freed from the brainwashing by Clea and Red Guardian. Rhino and Solarr were defeated by Doctor Strange (who was possessed by the Star of Capistan and had become the Red Rajah). Egghead attempted to take on <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> on his own, but Cobalt Man turned against him by turning his powers on Egghead, where both of them were seemingly killed.|$|R
5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored <b>the</b> <b>defender.</b> With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Harding's general {{election}} opponent was Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan, who {{had risen to}} statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman Catholics in rural areas. In 1914, the start of World War I {{and the prospect of}} a Catholic senator from Ohio increased nativist sentiment. Propaganda sheets with names like The Menace and <b>The</b> <b>Defender</b> contained warnings that Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope Benedict XV through the Knights of Columbus to control Ohio. Harding did not attack Hogan (an old friend) on this or most other issues, but he did not denounce the nativist hatred for his opponent.|$|E
5|$|Immediately thereafter, Hickling was {{transferred}} to Malaya as its first parliamentary draftsman, and in that capacity he helped to prepare the Malayan (now Malaysian) constitution for that country's independence from Britain in 1957. Subsequently, as Commissioner of Law Revision he drafted the Internal Security Act of 1960, based on the Emergency Ordinance 1948 which had been enacted to provide the British colonial authorities with powers to tackle a communist insurgency. For his contributions to Malaya, Hickling was made a Companion of the Order of <b>the</b> <b>Defender</b> of the Realm (known in Malay as the Johan Mangku Negara or JMN) by the Malaysian head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, in 1960.|$|E
50|$|There was a {{dramatic}} change in Loos role, however, on 2 September 1629. Corneliszoon had been inept in his tactics in the conflict that had arisen between the mutineers and another group, <b>the</b> <b>defenders,</b> who had been holding out against them. On the pretext of negotiating, Corneliszoon, accompanied by Loos and four other henchmen, had arranged to meet with <b>the</b> <b>defenders.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> sprang a trap and tried to take Corneliszoon and his henchmen prisoner. Other mutineers nearby immediately prepared to attack, so <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> killed all their prisoners on the spot, apart from Corneliszoon, and Loos, who managed to escape.|$|R
50|$|As {{a member}} of the Squadron Supreme, Zarda became brainwashed by the Overmind. She battled <b>the</b> <b>Defenders,</b> but was cured. She then battled the Overmind and Null, the Living Darkness {{alongside}} <b>the</b> <b>Defenders.</b>|$|R
