In {{particular}} {{the interactions of}} peroxides with the ferric(met) species of hemoglobin generate two strong oxidants: ferryl iron and a protein-bound free radical. We studied the endogenous defences to this reactive chemistry in a rabbit model following 20 % exchange transfusion with cell free hemoglobin stabilized in tetrameric form (via crosslinking with bis(3, 5 -dibromosalicyl) fumarate). The <b>transfusate</b> contained 95 - oxyhemoglobin, 5 % methemoglobin and 25 {mu}M free iron. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the free iron in the <b>transfusate</b> was rendered redox inactive by rapid binding to transferrin. Methemoglobin was reduced to oxyhemoglobin by a slower process (t 1 / 2 } = 1 hour). No globin-bound free radicals were detected in the plasma. These redox defences could be fully attributed to a novel multifunctional role of plasma ascorbate in removing key precursors of oxidative damage. Ascorbate is able to effectively reduce plasma methemoglobin, ferryl hemoglobin and globin radicals. The ascorbyl free radicals formed are efficiently re-reduced by the erythrocyte membrane-bound reductase (which itself uses intraerythrocyte ascorbate as electron donor). As well as relating to the toxicity of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, these findings have implications for situations where heme proteins exist outside the protective cell environment e. g. hemolytic anemias, subarachnoid hemorraghe, rhabdomyolysis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Successful {{restoration}} of {{structure and function}} using autologous free fat grafts has remained elusive. Review of literature shows that various harvesting and preparation techniques have been suggested. The goal of these techniques is to obtain greater adipocyte cell survival and consequently more reliable clinical results. Materials and Methods: In our technique, a piece of mesh is kept {{at one end of}} the lipoaspiration syringe, which is then connected to the Suction pump. As one syringe fills, it is replaced by another one until the required amount of fat is obtained. Results: By using a polypropylene mesh in our technique, we can separate the <b>transfusate</b> from the harvested fat graft during harvesting itself. The fat graft thus obtained is dense and concentrated, with fewer impurities. Conclusion: Hence, we recommend our technique as a reliable method for extracting sterile emulsified fat in an economical way...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The {{beneficial}} effect of blood transfusion on kidney graft survival requires {{the presence of}} leukocytes in the <b>transfusate,</b> but a minimal dose has not been defined, nor has the role of individual leukocyte subsets been investigated. In the Netherlands, a standard pre-transplant blood transfusion consists of a buffy coat (BC) -depleted {{red blood cell concentrate}} (RBCC) containing a maximum of 1. 2 x 10 (9) residual leukocytes per unit. However, leukocyte subset composition is not standardized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using FACS analysis, this study compared the residual leukocyte composition of RBCCs produced by Compomat((R)) and Optipress((R)), two currently used top-bottom systems. RESULTS: While the total leukocyte content of the RBCCs was equivalent in both press types (0. 5 x 10 (9)), the percentage of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and monocytes) was significantly higher in the Compomat as compared with the Optipress system (p < 0. 0001), resulting in significantly higher numbers of transfused T cells, B cells, HLA-DR-positive cells, NK cells and stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: The leukocyte composition of a pre-transplant blood transfusion depends on the BC depletion method used; this might differentially affect the tolerizing or immunizing potential of a pre-transplant blood transfusio...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{preliminary}} report by Opelz et al. (1973 a) on the beneficial effect of blood transfusions, it has gradually become evident that blood transfusions do {{have such an}} effect on renal allograft survival. Nevertheless, some physicians are still reluctant to adopt a deliberate blood transfusion regimen for fear of sensitization. The development of cytotoxic antibodies may delay transplantation for an indefinite time for some patients. This possible danger of sensitization initially {{gave rise to the}} policy of avoiding blood transfusions in kidney transplant recipients and it took many years of study, experimentation and discussion before the present situation of general acceptance was established. With respect to the clinical application of a deliberate blood transfusion policy, several questions remain to be answered regarding the optimal number and the timing of transfusions, the antigenic composition of the <b>transfusate</b> and the influence of immunosuppressive therapy on the expression of the blood transfusion effect. The effect of blood transfusions on kidney graft survival has only been studied in recipients treated with azathioprine and prednisolone for postoperative immunosuppression. It still has to be investigated if a beneficial effect of pretransplant transfusions would be demonstrable without conventional immunosuppression or in combination with postoperative administration of the novel immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A was recently discovered in the Sandoz Laboratories during a screening program for antimycotics; its powerful immunosuppressive properties were described by Borel et al. (1976). It has been tested in a variety of experimental animal transplantation models. Preliminary data are available on its clinical effectiveness and side effects. Some of these side effects are serious and it is still too early to be sufficiently informed about the long-term effects of the drug. Further questions awaiting evaluation pertain to the optimal dose of the drug, its potency to prevent rejection in sensitized recipients, the possible interference with other modes of treatment, and the possibilities of conversion to other immunosuppressants. It was the objective of the present studies to elucidate the items mentioned above...|$|E
