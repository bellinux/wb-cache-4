5|$|Stonyhurst College is a coeducational Roman Catholic {{independent}} school, {{adhering to}} <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> tradition, on the Stonyhurst Estate, Lancashire, England. It occupies a Grade I listed building. The {{school has been}} fully co-educational since 1999.|$|E
5|$|The school {{combines}} {{an academic}} curriculum with extra-curricular pursuits. Roman Catholicism plays {{a central role}} in college life, with emphasis on both prayer and service, according to <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> philosophy.|$|E
5|$|After the {{establishment}} of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> mission in Bohol, Father Juan de Torres, SJ, moved to the community along the Loboc River in late 1596 to establish a second mission station. The first church, made of wood, was built {{by the people of}} the area on a site called Calvario, Sawang, near the location of the present-day church. It was dedicated under the patronage of Saint Michael the Archangel. Loboc officially became a Catholic parish in 1602. Due to pirate attacks on Baclayon and the strategic position of Loboc, the Jesuits chose Loboc to become the center of their mission. <b>The</b> <b>Jesuit</b> superior of Bohol later resided in Loboc until the Jesuits' expulsion in 1768. A boarding school for boys, the Seminario de los Indios, was established at Loboc in 1605.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> had a {{building}} in Egenhoven outside Heverlee. It was a country estate {{and served as a}} training college for <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Jesuits</b> also had premises which are now the Evangelical Theological Faculty in Heverlee. These two sites originally served as the philosophy and theological college for all <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> in Belgium. Plans were made in 1931 to have one college for <b>the</b> French-speaking <b>Jesuits</b> and another separate one for <b>the</b> Flemish-speaking <b>Jesuits.</b> In 1935, these plans had not materialised and when <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> created separate administrative units (or provinces) for <b>the</b> Flemish-speaking <b>Jesuits</b> and <b>the</b> French-speaking <b>Jesuits,</b> they both still shared the building.|$|R
50|$|That year, <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> fled <b>the</b> {{village and}} the diocesan priests {{took charge of}} the parish. They were in charge of the parish for almost 200 years, finally handing it over to <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> in 1949. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> have run <b>the</b> parish.|$|R
50|$|In September, 1610, the biting satire Anti-Coton, {{in which}} it is proved that <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> are guilty of {{parricide}} against Henri IV was followed by many pamphlets for and against <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits.</b> <b>The</b> Anti-Coton pamphlet attacked <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits,</b> and especially Father Coton, the confessor of Henry IV, of whose murder <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> had been accused by their enemies. Daurignac says (Hist. Soc. Jesus, vol. i., p. 295) that this pamphlet was attributed to Pierre Du Moulin, a Protestant minister of Charenton. This and other similar attacks on <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> had been circulated in Canada, and had prejudiced against them even many Catholics.|$|R
5|$|After the {{expulsion}} of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> order from Spanish territories in 1767, most Jesuit reductions in South America were abandoned and fell into ruins. The former Jesuit missions of Chiquitos are unique because these settlements and their associated culture have survived largely intact.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th {{century and}} {{onset of the}} early modern period, {{military}} alliances with the Portuguese Empire were made, <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> Catholic missionaries arrived, and prolonged warfare with Islamic foes including the Adal Sultanate and Ottoman Empire, {{as well as with}} the polytheistic Oromo people, threatened the security of the Ethiopian Empire. These contacts and conflicts inspired works of ethnography, by authors such as the monk and historian Bahrey, which were embedded into the existing historiographic tradition and encouraged a broader view in historical chronicles for Ethiopia's place in the world. <b>The</b> <b>Jesuit</b> missionaries Pedro Páez (1564–1622) and Manuel de Almeida (1580–1646) also composed a history of Ethiopia, but it remained in manuscript form among Jesuit priests of Portuguese India and was not published in the West until modern times.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{destroyed}} the original wooden church in 1638; {{it was later}} reconstructed by <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> priest Jose Sanchez. A larger church was built in 1670, {{on the site of}} the present day convent. The present coral stone church was finished in 1734. After the Jesuits were expelled from the country in May 1768, the Augustinian Recollects assumed the administration of the parish and the church that November.|$|E

50|$|After the {{suppression}} of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> on 21 July 1773, the Bishop of Quebec Jean-Olivier Briand allowed <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> to remain Quebec. However, the government refused to allow <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> to have any new members and would not allow any new French priests to come to Canada. This mean that <b>the</b> number of <b>Jesuits</b> reduced as their members died. <b>The</b> last Canadian <b>Jesuit,</b> Fr. Jean-Joseph Casot, died at Quebec in 1800.|$|R
50|$|The Ateneo de Tuguegarao was a Catholic {{college in}} Tuguegarao, Cagayan, Philippines {{run by the}} Society of Jesus. It was {{established}} in 1945 when <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> took over <b>the</b> administration of the diocesan secondary school, Cagayan Valley Atheneum. <b>The</b> <b>Jesuits</b> renamed <b>the</b> school Ateneo de Tuguegarao after taking control. Ateneo de Tuguegarao had a {{high school and college}} departments. It was the fifth Ateneo that <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> established in <b>the</b> Philippines. In 1962, the school was closed when <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> left Tuguegarao.|$|R
5|$|Joyce {{was born}} in 41 Brighton Square, Rathgar, Dublin, into a middle-class family on the way down. A {{brilliant}} student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run O'Connell School before excelling at <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> schools Clongowes and Belvedere, despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's alcoholism and unpredictable finances. He went on to attend University College Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund's {{father and}} uncle were Roman Catholic, {{but his mother}} was Calvinist. According to <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> Antonio Possevino, Sigismund {{demonstrated}} his devotion to Catholicism already {{at the age of}} seven. His mother mocked him for his piety, saying that he only wanted to secure his uncle's goodwill. Sigismund was especially hostile towards the Anti-Trinitarians in his youth. His mother died in early 1581.|$|E
5|$|The Church is also {{actively}} engaged in international aid and development through organisations such as Catholic Relief Services, Caritas International, Aid to the Church in Need, refugee advocacy groups such as <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> Refugee Service and community aid {{groups such as the}} Saint Vincent de Paul Society.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jesuits</b> were {{temporarily}} {{banished from}} France in 1594 after {{a man named}} Jean Châtel tried to assassinate the king of France, Henri IV. Under questioning, Châtel revealed {{that he had been}} educated by <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> of <b>the</b> Collège de Clermont. <b>The</b> <b>Jesuits</b> were accused of inspiring Châtel's attack. Two of his former teachers were exiled and a third was hanged. The Collège de Clermont was closed, and the building was confiscated. <b>The</b> <b>Jesuits</b> were banned from France, although this ban was quickly lifted.|$|R
50|$|Peter III was {{moderately}} friendly toward <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits,</b> who {{had been}} banished from Portugal and its overseas empire in 1759, largely {{at the behest of}} the Marquis of Pombal. Peter III had taken some of his early education from <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits,</b> explaining this. His affection had little effect; Pope Clement XIV ordered <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> suppressed across Europe in 1773.|$|R
50|$|By 1767, <b>Jesuit</b> missionaries on <b>the</b> Baja California Peninsula started {{establishing}} missions there. Later, rumors circulated that <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> had {{amassed a}} fortune and were becoming very powerful. As {{part of the}} nearly global suppression of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits,</b> King Carlos III ordered <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> expelled and deported to the Papal States on the Italian peninsula. Following the command of the king, the Viceroy of New Spain ordered the arrest and deportation of all Jesuits in missions. Portolá was charged with the expulsion of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits.</b> <b>The</b> missions were {{turned over to the}} Franciscans, and later to the Dominicans.|$|R
5|$|The Gunpowder Plot of 1605, {{in earlier}} centuries {{often called the}} Gunpowder Treason Plot or <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> Treason, was a failed {{assassination}} attempt against King James I of England and VI of Scotland {{by a group of}} provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{introduced}} the Latin script, {{which was used}} to record {{a large body of}} Aztec prose, poetry and mundane documentation such as testaments, administrative documents, legal letters, etc. In a matter of decades pictorial writing was completely replaced with the Latin alphabet. No standardized Latin orthography has been developed for Nahuatl, and no general consensus has arisen for the representation of many sounds in Nahuatl that are lacking in Spanish, such as long vowels and the glottal stop. The orthography most accurately representing the phonemes of Nahuatl was developed in the 17th century by <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> Horacio Carochi, building on the insights of another Jesuit, Antonio del Rincon. Carochi's orthography used two different diacritics: a macron to represent long vowels and a grave for the saltillo, and sometimes an acute accent for short vowels. This orthography did not achieve a wide following outside of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> community.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} Santa Ana de Velasco {{was the final}} World Heritage Site-inscribed mission to be established. It was founded by <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> priest Fr. Julian Knogler in 1755. The {{original}} native inhabitants of the missions were the Covareca and Curuminaca tribes. The mission church was designed after the expulsion of the Jesuits between 1770 and 1780 by an unknown architect and built entirely by the indigenous population. The complex, consisting of the church, bell tower, sacristy and a grassy plaza lined by houses, is considered {{to have the most}} fidelity to the original plan of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> reductions. Starting in 1989 and lasting until 2001, the mission underwent partial restoration through the efforts of Hans Roth and his team.|$|E
50|$|Jesuits were {{expelled}} 1618-1621 {{during the early}} stages of the Thirty Years' War, which was started in Prague by anti-Catholic and anti-Imperial Bohemians. By 1622 <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> had a predominant influence over the emperor. An Imperial decree of 19 September 1622 gave <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> supreme control over the entire school system of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. The last four professors at the Carolinum resigned and all of the Carolinum and nine colleges went to <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits.</b> <b>The</b> right of handing out degrees, of holding chancellorships and of appointing the secular professors was also granted to <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits.</b>|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> were {{expelled}} from Naples in 1767, the church {{passed to the}} Franciscan order. <b>The</b> <b>Jesuits</b> returned in 1821, only to be expelled again in 1848.|$|R
2500|$|Palafox laid formal {{complaints}} against <b>Jesuits</b> at Rome. <b>The</b> pope, however, refused to approve his censures, {{and all he}} could obtain was a brief from Pope Innocent X (on May 14, 1648), commanding <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> to respect <b>the</b> episcopal jurisdiction. On May 20, 1655, Palafox and <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> signed an accord, but disagreements continued. In the same year <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> succeeded in securing his transfer to the little see of Osma in Old Castile. [...] Although Palafox's ecclesiastical career went into eclipse, his writings against <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> were subsequently published in France and in the eighteenth century, his writings were used to strengthen the case for regalist authority resulting in the expulsion of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> from Spain and Spanish territories in 1767.|$|R
5|$|The {{order to}} build an {{aqueduct}} to carry water from springs in Dingli and Rabat to the capital was issued on 19 October 1596. That year, Grand Master Grand Master Martin Garzez brought in <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> Padre Giacomo to design the watercourse. His design was accepted and work was begun, but construction was suspended soon afterwards due to financial reasons.|$|E
5|$|The school owns paintings, {{including}} {{a portrait of}} Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and another of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> Henry Garnet. In the Stuart Parlour are portraits of Jacobites including James Francis Edward Stuart, and his sons Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart. There are also several original engravings by Rembrandt and Dürer, such as the 'Greater Passion' and the 'Car of Maximillian'.|$|E
5|$|Adam Driver as Francisco Garupe. Both Driver and Garfield {{went through}} a 7-day Jesuit silent prayer vigil {{arranged}} {{with the help of}} <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> scholar Martin to prepare them for their roles in the film. Garfield, in an interview with Stephen Colbert, stated that both actors felt emaciated in preparing for their roles and that Driver lost close to 50 pounds in preparation to play his role in the film.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jesuits,</b> however, were {{supporters}} of the dismissed governor. They had been working actively to shelter the Indians from the forced-labor demands of the colonists, and were therefore resented by the colonists. Reyes Balmaceda had supported <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits,</b> {{and it was that}} connection that led to the colonists' call for his removal. After Antequera consolidated his power, he expelled <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Boulanger {{was a young}} priest {{when the}} Society of Jesus was re-established in France. He joined <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> in 1823 and by 1842 he was made provincial of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> in France. In that same year he oversaw the {{reconstitution}} of <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> in Canada, <b>the</b> last <b>Jesuit</b> priest there, Jean-Joseph Casot, having died in 1800. Nine Jesuits were sent to Montreal, arriving on 31 May 1842 and marked a new beginning for the Society of Jesus in Canada.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jesuits</b> {{continued}} {{to manage the}} Church and established an endowment to provide ongoing support for the Parish. In 2009 <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> turned over management to the Archdioceses of Mobile.|$|R
5|$|After the Jesuits {{established}} the Christian community in Baclayon, {{they moved to}} Loboc and established a second Christian settlement in Bohol. The parish was established in 1602, and the present coral stone church was completed in 1734. Because of its strategic location, it {{became the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> mission in the Bohol area. In 1768, upon the expulsion of the Jesuits, the town was transferred to the Augustinian Recollects.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Garfield as Sebastião Rodrigues (based on Giuseppe Chiara, {{who later}} in the film {{goes by the name}} Okada San'emon). In interviews, Garfield has spoken of his {{extensive}} year-long preparation for the role with James Martin, a practicing Jesuit priest working in New York. Garfield detailed that the preparation with Martin included extensive research and immersion in <b>the</b> <b>Jesuit</b> lifestyle and frame of mind which was felt to be essential to the accuracy of the film by the producers. Garfield, who is of slight to medium frame, reported losing 40 pounds to play the role following the rules of abstention which were outlined to him by Martin.|$|E
5|$|Anna University of Technology Tirunelveli was {{established}} in 2007, offering a variety of engineering and technology courses for undergraduate and graduate students. Tirunelveli Medical College, Veterinary College and Research Institution and the Government College of Engineering, Tirunelveli are professional colleges operated {{by the government of}} Tamil Nadu. <b>The</b> <b>Jesuit</b> St. Xavier's College, and St. John's College (operated by the Church of South India diocese), MDT Hindu College, Sadakathulla Appa College and Sarah Tucker College are notable arts colleges.|$|E
50|$|Before World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> {{accepted}} <b>the</b> {{invitation of}} Most Rev. Alfredo Versosa, D.D., Bishop of Lipa, {{to open a}} high school in San Pablo. The Bishop donated to <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> <b>the</b> St. Francis Seminary buildings and the grounds adjoining it. War began before the school could open, and the war destroyed the buildings. But as soon as the war ended, <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> began to carry out their part of the agreement.|$|R
50|$|On July 30, 1859, a {{royal decree}} was issued {{allowing}} <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> to recover their Missions in Mindanao from <b>the</b> Recollects. <b>The</b> <b>Jesuits</b> finally returned to Basilan and Tetuan in 1862.|$|R
50|$|On 23 July 2005, <b>the</b> <b>Jesuits</b> {{handed over}} {{administration}} {{of the church to}} the Archdiocese of Southwark who continue to serve <b>the</b> parish. <b>The</b> <b>Jesuits</b> still live nearby and assist the parish.|$|R
