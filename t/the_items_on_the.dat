One of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> agenda was finding the closest hospital to the set, according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set, but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were sutured shut.|$|E

After some hesitation, Tchaikovsky agreed. As a condition for Tchaikovsky's engagement, the Russian Musical Society required a list of works {{that he planned to}} conduct.

He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer {{that he may have}} been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes {{a list of all the}} things he wants to do before death.|$|E

25|$|Lack of self-correction: {{scientific}} research programmes make mistakes, but {{they tend to}} reduce these errors over time.

The Taiwan Academy of Ecology evaluated the policies of both candidates Hsieh and Ma, and the secretary of its workstation in Taipei said that both candidates failed their expectations, but they had more hope for Hsieh than Ma because Ma's environmental concepts lack considerations of reality. In February 2008, several environmental groups created a list of commitments for the two candidates to sign. DPP candidate Frank Hsieh agreed to all <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list and signed it in March. Ma did not and emailed the group instead. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) criticized Ma for ignoring important issues and not having the guts to sign the commitments.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some games}} such as Second Life, in-game {{currency}} is not freely convertible with real world currency. Players may only buy specific in-game items (such as the Pilot License Extension (PLEX), a token worth 30 days of game time) from CCP with real-world currency. The player can then sell <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> in-game market for ISK (game currency). The reverse process, selling in-game currency or items for real-world money, is prohibited. The developers' reasoning for this policy, as related by a CCP representative at Fanfest 2010, is that free interchange of currency causes in-game banking to {{fall under the}} same regulatory domain as real-world banking. CCP would rather not place this restriction on in-game behavior, due both {{to the difficulty of}} regulatory enforcement and the desire to allow players to create illegitimate in-game banks or Ponzi schemes if they wish to do so.|$|E

500|$|The {{iconography}} is {{not overly}} labored, and Memling avoids extraneous symbolism.

2500|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Alcohol Dependence scale most {{positively}} related to their prenatal alcohol exposure includes [...] "blacking out". [...] Blackouts are alcohol-related amnesia, occurring when long term memory creation is impaired during a drinking episode, resulting in an inability to remember. The frequency of blackouts in young adults while drinking is strongly related to prenatal alcohol exposure; those exposed to alcohol as a fetus are more vulnerable to experiencing blackouts as an adult.Prenatal alcohol exposure {{can also lead to}} decreased problem solving skills and/or attention deficits. Attention deficits result in an inability to maintain focus on one task for a length of time, and being prone to distraction.|$|E
2500|$|Economist William A. Niskanen, {{a member}} of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers wrote that {{deregulation}} had the [...] "lowest priority" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Reagan agenda given that Reagan [...] "failed to sustain the momentum for deregulation initiated in the 1970s" [...] and that he [...] "added more trade barriers than any administration since Hoover." [...] By contrast, economist Milton Friedman has pointed {{to the number of}} pages added to the Federal Register each year as evidence of Reagan's anti-regulation presidency (the Register records the rules and regulations that federal agencies issue per year). The number of pages added to the Register each year declined sharply {{at the start of the}} Ronald Reagan presidency breaking a steady and sharp increase since 1960. The increase in the number of pages added per year resumed an upward, though less steep, trend after Reagan left office. In contrast, the number of pages being added each year increased under Ford, Carter, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and others. The number of pages in Federal Register is however criticized as an extremely crude measure of regulatory activity, because it can be easily manipulated (e.g. font sizes have been changed to keep page count low). The apparent contradiction between Niskanen's statements and Friedman's data may be resolved by seeing Niskanen as referring to statutory deregulation (laws passed by Congress) and Friedman to administrative deregulation (rules and regulations implemented by federal agencies).|$|E
