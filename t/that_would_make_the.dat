5|$|Bartley and ÓBriain {{conceived}} {{of the film}} after Bartley returned from documenting {{the aftermath of the}} 1999 Vargas mudslides for an Irish charity. Following a visit to Venezuela to determine the feasibility of a film project, the pair formed a production company and applied to Ireland's film board, Bord Scannán na hÉireann (BSÉ), for a development grant. At BSÉ's request, the filmmakers partnered with a more experienced producer and shot a short pilot to show to potential investors. Funding for the €200,000 production was provided by BSÉ and several European broadcasters. Bartley and ÓBriain shot more than 200hours of material; editing focused on identifying footage <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film entertaining and drive the plot. It was at this stage that the film's coverage narrowed to concentrate more on the coup attempt.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of canals and locks <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be inundated with water {{in order to create}} a navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a cofferdam upstream, creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY37B west of Massena.|$|E
5|$|Contradicting these claims, {{the medieval}} Annales Suecici Medii Aevi and the 13th century legend of Saint Botvid mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (Henricus scilicet Upsalensis) in 1129, {{participating}} in the consecration of the saint's newly built church. He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the Chronicon Roskildense written soon after his death and from Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from Sigtuna, the see of the early Uppland bishops before it was moved a few kilometers to its later location in Uppsala sometime before 1164. He is ignored in all Swedish bishop chronicles, unless he is the same Henry who was later redated to the 1150s. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> claim about him coming to Finland with King Eric a late innovation, where memory about a killed bishop in Uppsala sometime in the 12th century was reused in a new context.|$|E

5|$|In 1911 Emery {{classified}} the subgenera Myrmecia, Pristomyrmecia and Promyrmecia, {{based on}} {{the shape of the}} mandibles. Wheeler established the subgenus Halmamyrmecia, and the ants placed in it were characterised by their jumping behaviour. The taxon Wheeler described was not referred to in his later publications, and the genera Halmamyrmecia and Pristomyrmecia were synonymised by John Clark. At the same time, Clark reclassified the subgenus Promyrmecia as a full genus. He revised the whole subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1951, recognising 118 species and subspecies in Myrmecia and Promyrmecia; five species groups were assigned to Myrmecia and eight species groups to Promyrmecia. This revision was rejected by entomologist William Brown {{due to the lack of}} morphological evidence <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> two genera distinct from each other. Due to this, Brown would classify Promyrmecia as a synonym of Myrmecia in 1953. Clark's revision was the last major taxonomic study on the genus before 1991, and only a single species was described in the intervening years. In 2015, four new Myrmecia ants were described by Robert Taylor, all exclusive to Australia. Currently, 94 species are described in the genus, but as many as 130 species may exist.|$|E
5|$|The film, under Hancock's {{direction}} and Tristan's writing, had originally a different tone and premise than what {{would eventually be}} seen in the final film. The two had envisioned Amity as a sort of ghost-town when the film opened with several businesses shuttered and the island's overall economy in ruins due to the events seen in the first film. The new resort and condos built on the island by developer Len Peterson were to help celebrate its rebirth giving the island's economy a much needed boost. Tristan had borrowed a subplot from the original Jaws novel and from a discarded early draft of the first film, in which Amity officials were in debt to the Mafia. Both Mayor Vaughn and Len Peterson were anxious for the new island resort to be a success not only to revive Amity but to pay back loans from the Mob that helped build it, thus leading to Vaughn's and Peterson's ignoring of Brody's warning. Tristan and Hancock felt this treatment would lead to more character development <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> overall story that much more believable.|$|E

25|$|Because of the secretive {{nature of}} the messages, the {{cryptographic}} function employed by particular stations is not publicly known, except in one (or possibly two) cases. It is assumed that most stations use a one-time pad <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> contents of these number groups indistinguishable from randomly generated numbers or digits. In one confirmed case, West Germany did use a one-time pad for numbers transmissions.|$|E
25|$|Appliance {{designs in}} the early 1950s were often austere and functional, but from 1955 they became more {{colorful}} and diverse, so the housewife could demonstrate her good taste in selecting items <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> kitchen more welcoming and that would showcase the family's prosperity. By the late 1950s there was a return to cleaner designs without decorative moldings, with line and angle replacing rounded forms {{and a return to}} white or neutral colors.|$|E
25|$|The Freemont was {{originally}} available in LHD markets only, except the Netherlands.

25|$|On 7 September, a {{month after}} they had been {{scheduled}} to depart, the force sailed from Britain heading for the Bay of Biscay. It arrived off Rochefort on the 20 September, but due to heavy fog was unable to land for several days. Hawke and the naval officers were already extremely concerned about the worsening weather, fearing equinoctial gales <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> sea more and more dangerous as the autumn wore on.|$|E
25|$|Early {{transportation}} to Newport had relied mainly on rail, with trains from Albany arriving at Yaquina City, where passengers could board a ferryboat to Yaquina Bay. Optimism for Newport's early growth {{was based on}} the expectation that the railway would eventually reach Newport. It never did. In 1928, the Southern Pacific Railroad stopped service to Yaquina City. This may have put a temporary damper on the tourist business, but by 1930 highway projects were underway <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> area more accessible than ever.|$|E
25|$|The major flaw of {{this law}} was {{that it could be}} used only when the {{majority}} of municipal councils in a province petitioned for it. Since landowners usually controlled such councils, no province ever asked that the law be applied. Therefore, Quezon ordered that the act be mandatory in all Central Luzon provinces. However, contracts were good for only one year. By simply refusing to renew their contract, landlords were able to eject tenants. As a result, peasant organizations clamored in vain for a law <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> contract automatically renewable {{for as long as the}} tenants fulfilled their obligations.|$|E

25|$|The union {{also played}} a {{significant}} role within the CIO in lobbying for the strengthening of the Fair Employment Practices Commission, a federal agency established in 1941 to ensure that companies with government contracts did not discriminate {{on the basis of race}} or religion. When the FEPC was in danger of losing much of its power and being dismantled, UPWA introduced a successful resolution at the 1949 NAACP convention to hold an FEPC National Emergency Mobilization to push for legislation <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> FEPC permanent. But the advent of the Korean War led to the defeat of legislation. These policies were not accepted by all UWPA locals, however. Ten UPWA locals disaffiliated partly because of the parent union's stand on racial equality.|$|E
25|$|While {{stationed}} in Hawaii, Maitland sought {{permission from the}} Chief of the Air Service to organize a flight between Hawaii and the mainland. Not until December 1926, however, was he granted authorization. Others had also {{been working on the}} project, including 1st Lt. Albert F. Hegenberger, former Chief of the Instrument Branch at McCook Field. Hegenberger had overseen the development of a number of navigation instruments <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> trip feasible but like Maitland had also been transferred to Hawaii, where his repeated written requests for a transpacific flight were likewise refused. In 1926 Hegenberger returned to McCook, where he helped test a navigation system using signals from low-frequency radio beacons. The transpacific flight from California to Hawaii was then approved to demonstrate the difficult task of navigating to a small island using the beacons as a navigational aid.|$|E
25|$|The constructivists {{tried to}} create works <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> viewer an active viewer of the artwork. In this it had {{similarities}} with the Russian Formalists' theory of 'making strange', and accordingly their main theorist Viktor Shklovsky {{worked closely with the}} Constructivists, as did other formalists like the Arch Bishop. These theories were tested in theatre, particularly with the work of Vsevolod Meyerhold, who had established what he called 'October in the theatre'. Meyerhold developed a 'biomechanical' acting style, which was influenced both by the circus and by the 'scientific management' theories of Frederick Winslow Taylor. Meanwhile, the stage sets by the likes of Vesnin, Popova and Stepanova tested Constructivist spatial ideas in a public form. A more populist version of this was developed by Alexander Tairov, with stage sets by Aleksandra Ekster and the Stenberg brothers. These ideas would influence German directors like Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator, as well as the early Soviet cinema.|$|E

25|$|Also in 2009, the NCPC {{released}} its Monumental Core Framework Plan, {{a comprehensive plan}} for creating places and spaces around the National Mall to increase the availability of space for new museums and memorials while adding residences and retail features <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> city a more attractive {{place to live and}} work. The plan was adopted by the United States Commission of Fine Arts on March 19, 2009, and approved by the NCPC on April 2, 2009. The Monumental Core Framework Plan proposed adding a new visitor's center and memorial at Banneker Park, an intermodal transportation hub beneath Banneker Park, demolition of the Forrestal Building and its annex, and construction of apartment and office buildings along L'Enfant Promenade with retail and dining space at the street level to accommodate tourists and residents alike. The framework plan also proposed covering over I-395 between Banneker Park and L'Enfant Plaza, covering over the CSX railway tracks (which currently cut L'Enfant Plaza off from the Forrestal complex of buildings), re-establishing Maryland Avenue SW between 12th and 7th Streets SW (it currently does not exist there, due to the presence of the railroad tracks), and restoring the view of the U.S. Capitol building along Maryland Avenue SW.|$|E
500|$|After her {{departure}} from the adult film industry and transition to mainstream films, Lords got signed for a development deal with Capitol Records, but was later dropped due to disagreements {{between her and the}} label.

500|$|David Garrick's {{acceptance}} of Irene for production prompted Johnson to finish rewriting the play. Garrick changed the play's title to Mahomet and Irene, and requested changes <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> play more acceptable to {{his sense of}} theatrical style. Johnson was initially opposed to the changes and complained that Garrick [...] "wants me to make Mahomet run mad, {{that he may have}} an opportunity of tossing his hands and kicking his heels". Johnson's friend John Taylor resolved the dispute and Johnson ultimately carried out Garrick's suggestions, which included revising Irene's death scene so that she would be strangled onstage, instead of offstage as originally written.|$|E
