5|$|Throughout Lincoln, the QEW travels {{along the}} Lake Ontario {{shoreline}} through the Niagara Fruit Belt; numerous wineries line {{the south side}} of the freeway. Interchanges at Victoria Road (Regional Road24) and Ontario Street (Regional Road18) provide access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> of Vineland and Beamsville, respectively. The latter encroaches upon {{the south side of}} the QEW, interrupting the otherwise agricultural surroundings of the highway in Lincoln. Immediately east of the Bartlett Avenue interchange, the freeway enters Grimsby, where it becomes sandwiched between the Niagara Escarpment and Lake Ontario. The route passes under three overpasses that have remained unchanged since the highway was built: Maple Avenue, Ontario Street and Christie Street, all served by a single diamond interchange. South of the 50Point Conservation Area, the freeway exits Niagara Region and enters the city of Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} the freeway opened, traffic volumes along {{parallel}} roads like 44th, 56th and 68th streets dropped 40–50%. At the same time, roads with interchanges along the freeway saw increased traffic. Wilson Avenue experienced a 120% increase and sections of Byron Center Avenue jumped 100% in traffic levels a month after M-6 opened. Property values in the townships surrounding the freeway increased 11.3–12.4% by 2006 {{as a result of}} development attached to the freeway. Local officials credited the freeway for increased access to the area, driving housing starts as residents flocked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> for their schools and quality of life. In 2007, the Metro Health Village, a commercial development centered around the Byron Center Avenue exit and the hospital opened. Described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant, the village features restaurants, shops, offices and a hotel. Metro Health relocated from Grand Rapids to the location in Wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location. Since opening, even though the freeway was officially named for Paul Henry, the original South Beltline name is still in use.|$|E

5|$|East of San Diego, US 80 {{followed}} {{the path of}} El Cajon Boulevard through La Mesa and then onto Main Street near downtown El Cajon before heading towards the Mountain Springs grade. The route was realigned from Arnold Way onto Alpine Boulevard as it passed through Alpine and the Viejas Indian Reservation, before entering the Laguna Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest on the alignment used by I-8. At Laguna Junction, a cafe for travelers existed from 1916 until when the building was taken down to provide land for the interchange with I-8. A section of old US 80 — with the first few miles signed as SR 79 — continues to serve as access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> of Descanso, Guatay and Pine Valley; SR 79 intersected US 80 east of Descanso. At the time, the Ellis Wayside Rest provided a rest area for travelers; later, the state recognized it as a historic site. Exiting the national forest, US 80 continued in a southeasterly direction towards Live Oak Springs and Boulevard, intersecting with the eastern terminus of SR 94. US 80 then came close to the Mexican border as it curved around the Jacumba Mountains and into the hot spring town of Jacumba. East of there, US 80 passed by the Desert View Tower.|$|E

25|$|From its {{earliest}} days, {{a hallmark of}} the organization's local efforts was service <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> in which members reside.

50|$|Fundamentally, cost {{externalization}} {{occurs when}} a company transfers some of its moral responsibilities as costs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> directly or as degradation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> environment. For example, railroads and airlines transfer the cost of fuel, noise, and terminal infrastructure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community.</b> Airlines and auto manufacturers transfer the cost of degraded air quality <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> and <b>the</b> environment. By externalizing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> or <b>the</b> environment, many true costs become lost in analysis because the true cost is non-quantifiable and neither <b>the</b> <b>community</b> nor <b>the</b> environment have effective advocates <b>to</b> recoup <b>the</b> damages. A major modern theme in the relationship of business <b>to</b> society is <b>the</b> society's ability (or inability) to resist this kind of externalization. In its extreme, society collapses as business realizes its profits.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{considerable}} {{proportion of}} patients with personality disorder are discharged directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> from special (high-security) hospitals. AIMS: To examine whether patients with personality disorder discharged directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> {{are more likely to}} be re-convicted than those transferred to psychiatric hospitals of lesser security. METHOD: Re-conviction data for a five- to nine-year follow-up were collected for a four-year (1988 - 1991) special hospital discharge cohort {{of patients with}} personality disorder. RESULTS: Individuals discharged directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> were not significantly more likely to be re-convicted than those transferred to less secure psychiatric hospitals. However, patients discharged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> without formal conditions of supervision were more likely to be re-convicted than those discharged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> with conditions or those transferred to other psychiatric hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Formal supervision after discharge may be more important than actual destination in influencing the likelihood of re-conviction...|$|R
