5|$|During his {{backstage}} theatre job, Sellers began practising {{on a set}} {{of drums}} <b>that</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers's temperament and artistic skills. Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation.|$|E
5|$|The genus was {{formerly}} {{considered to be}} a large one with well over 100 species. However, molecular analysis of DNA sequences showed that the most species belonged in the family Psathyrellaceae, distinct from the type species <b>that</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Agaricaceae. It was given its current binomial name in 2001 as a result, as this and other species were moved to the new genus Coprinopsis.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses <b>that</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When {{they came to the}} nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
25|$|The Puerto Rico Sales and Use Tax (SUT, , IVU) is the {{combined}} sales and use tax applied to most sales in Puerto Rico.

Archaeologists have found pottery objects of the early Iron Age in Gjirokastër, which {{first appeared in the}} late Bronze Age in Pazhok, Elbasan County, and are found throughout Albania. The earliest recorded inhabitants of the area around Gjirokastër were the Greek-speaking tribe of the Chaonians, <b>that</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Epirote group.|$|E

He was sentenced to 15 years in prison on June 21, 2012 with credit for time served. He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison.|$|E

5|$|On 14 March 1471, Edward's army {{landed at}} Ravenspurn. Gathering more men as they went, the Yorkists moved inland towards York. Edward's march was unopposed at the {{beginning}} because he was moving through lands <b>that</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Percys, and the Earl of Northumberland was indebted to the Yorkist king {{for the return of}} his northern territory. Furthermore, Edward announced that he was returning only to claim his father's title of Duke of York and not to contest the English crown. The ruse was successful: Montagu, who was monitoring Edward's march, could not convince his men to move against the Yorkist king.|$|E
5|$|Roger {{travelled}} {{with the}} king, often accompanying {{him in the}} royal progresses around England. In late 1136 or 1137, Roger was with the king at a court called at Westminster which heard a complaint by the Holy Trinity Priory in London that Hasculf de Tany, the castellan of the Tower of London, had taken land <b>that</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> priory. In the end, the priory regained custody of their land. In March 1137 Roger was with the king right before the king sailed to Normandy, as the chancellor witnessed a charter of the king just prior to his departure. As chancellor, Roger was a witness on over 60 royal writs.|$|E

5|$|The Sumerian King List (SKL) records a dynasty of six kings from Mari enjoying hegemony {{between the}} dynasty of Adab and the dynasty of Kish. The {{names of the}} Mariote kings were damaged on the early copies of the list, and those kings were {{correlated}} with historical kings <b>that</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second city. However, an undamaged copy of the list that date to the old Babylonian period was discovered in Shubat-Enlil, and the names bears no resemblance {{to any of the}} historically attested monarchs of the second city, indicating that the compilers of the list had an older and probably a legendary dynasty in mind, that predate the second city.|$|E
5|$|As Caroline neared Batavia, Phoenix {{entered the}} well-defended harbour, making further pursuit impossible. However, Rainier then sighted a second frigate, {{lying at anchor}} in Batavia Roads, {{accompanied}} only by the 14-gun corvette William, the elusive brig Zee-Ploeg, and the 18-gun ship Patriot <b>that</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dutch East India Company. Prisoners from Zeerop identified this ship as the 36-gun Maria Riggersbergen under Captain Claas Jager. Although this force was significantly stronger than Caroline, and could call on the support of approximately 30 gunboats anchored closer inshore, Rainier immediately gave orders to advance on the Dutch frigate. In his preparations for battle, Rainier ordered that springs be placed on his anchor cables, giving his ship the ability to easily turn at anchor to face new threats once engaged with the Maria Riggersbergen.|$|E

His brother and his brother's girlfriend were said to have acted strangely after the disappearance, and the man's brother claimed he believed the knife had been used to kill Murray. Several days after the knife was given to Fred Murray, the man's brother allegedly scrapped his Volvo. Family members of the man who turned in the knife claimed he had made up the story in order to obtain reward money in the investigation, and that he had a history of drug use.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} least, archaeological {{evidence}} supports the claim in the Weilüe and Book of Liang that Roman merchants {{were active in}} Southeast Asia, if not the claim of their embassies arriving in China through Jiaozhi, the Chinese-controlled province of northern Vietnam. Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and his adopted son Marcus Aurelius {{have been found in}} Oc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City), a territory <b>that</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Funan bordering Jiaozhi. Suggestive of even earlier activity is a Republican-era Roman glass bowl unearthed from a Western Han tomb of Guangzhou (on the shores of the South China Sea) dated to the early 1st century BC, in addition to ancient Mediterranean goods found in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy wrote in his Antonine-era Geography that beyond the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula) was a port city called Kattigara discovered by a Greek sailor named Alexander, a site Ferdinand von Richthofen assumed was Chinese-controlled Hanoi, but given the archaeological evidence could have been Oc Eo. Roman coins have been found in China, but far less so than in India.|$|E
5|$|The Bajovići, {{having the}} slava (patron saint day) of St. Nicholas, {{with tens of}} houses in Bezuje, and one house in their {{original}} village of Rudinice (1971), have several versions of their origin: the first that they descend from a brother of Bajo Pivljanin; the second, from a villager called Čepur that took over Bajo Pivljanin's estate after the family left; the third, that the Bajovići who were really called Čepuri until 1887 descend from a branch of a family tree also including the Vračari and Taušani, {{closely related to the}} Gagovići, in line with their slava in common. Based on the presumed connection with Pivljanin, King Nikola I accepted member Đorđija Bajović into officer school. When S. Tomić did field research in Piva in 1912–13 and 1924, however, he recorded the Bajovići, called Čepuri in Gornje Rudinice with two houses, as hailing from Bajovo Polje and being direct descendants of Bajo Nikolić Pivljanin. Meanwhile, Tomić had recorded four or six houses of Bajovići in Bezuje <b>that</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vračari brotherhood, itself descending from the Gagovići brotherhood.|$|E
