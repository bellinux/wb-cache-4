Successful results were achieved and the reconstruction of the productive process was carried out. Second derivative profiles of IR spectra and μ-Raman analyses allowed defining the mineralogy of ceramic pastes, inferring the local provenance of raw materials and the low attention paid in their manufacturing. If good technological standards were achieved in the production of tableware, cooking ware shows colorimetric and mineralogical evidences of uncontrolled firing conditions, testifying a not-well standardized technological process...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliography. This {{dissertation}} {{sets up a}} standardised {{system for}} analysing mid-seventeenth to mid- nineteenth century Cape colonial ceramic assemblages and then applies it {{to a number of}} Dutch and British historical sites in the south-western Cape region of South Africa in order to trace patterns of change in the availability and use of domestic ceramics in the colony. The system accommodates the wide range of African, Asian and European ceramics used during the period of Dutch East India rule from 1652 to 1795, the following Transitional years when the Cape was governed for short periods by both the British and Dutch governments and the period from 1815 onwards when the Cape became a British Crown Colony. A systematic ceramic classificatory system was required to form a framework for the first stage of a proposed study of the role of Asian porcelain in the Cape during the 17 th and 18 th centuries. The resulting Cape Classificatory System has five sections. (i) <b>Ware</b> <b>Table,</b> a <b>ware</b> based classification, records ceramics by sherd count and minimum number of vessels, and acts as a check list for Cape colonial sites. (ii) Date Table provides the accepted dates of production and references for all ceramics excavated in the Cape. (iii) Form and Function Table lists excavated ceramics by vessel form within functional categories. (iv) The Site Catalogue accessions and references (where possible) all the ceramics in an assemblage. (v) A catalogue of previously unreferenced Asian market ware (coarse porcelain) excavated from 17 th to 19 th century colonial sites in the south-western Cape. Thirty ceramic assemblages from Cape colonial sites and four assemblages from shipwrecks in Cape waters were analysed or examined. The Cape Classificatory System was applied in full to the ceramics from four sites: the Granary, a late seventeenth century Dutch East India site; Elsenburg, an elite mid-eighteenth century farmstead; Sea Street, Cape Town, a town midden in use from {{the last quarter of the}} eighteenth century to ca. 1830; and a well in Barrack Street, Cape Town, that was open from ca. 1775 till the late nineteenth century. The results clearly demonstrated changes in ceramic availability, usage and discard in the Cape over a two hundred year period, differences in refuse disposal practices and the dependence of the colony on Asian porcelain, including Asian market coarse porcelain, during the late seventeenth century and eighteenth century...|$|R

The large amount of ceramic finds illustrates the typology in use in this area during the IV and V century AD. Analyses were focused on <b>table</b> and cooking <b>ware</b> productions. Archaeometric data were obtained using chemical and minero-petrographical methods (OM, XRD, XRF and SEM). Grain size measurements using Image Analyses on thin sections and a geochemical comparison with clayey deposits outcropping in the Campania region permitted the identification of the raw materials used for these pottery productions. XRD and SEM completed the data set, establishing the protocols used for pottery production in the Pompeii area during Late Roman period. The Via Lepanto site was part of an exchange network of markets with a periodic frequency, where locally produced and imported pottery was sold, indicating a flourishing network of exchanges spanning short, medium and long distances...|$|R

Na južnom platou gradine otvorene su dvije nove sonde koje su pružile obilje keramičke građe.

Trial {{excavations}} on Sveta Trojica Hillfort near Starigrad Paklenica {{continued in}} September 2015. Two new trenches were opened, {{both at the}} larger top plateau of the hillfort. Trench 10, measuring 5 x 5 m, was opened on the flat section directly along the south edge of the central hillfort plateau. Layer of earth with stones right under the shallow layer of humus contained a large quantity of mobile finds, almost exclusively coarse pottery of the so-called hillfort type, with some amphora fragments and very few pieces of imported <b>table</b> fine <b>ware,</b> which could suggest chronological differences {{in relation to the}} previously researched positions. Under that layer, another layer was discovered and interpreted as a floor. It consists of tightly compacted and flat earth, baked in places, which can be traced – despite damage due to erosion, that is, the rocks piled in the upper layer – across the whole trench area and whose structure and colour visibly differ from the aforementioned erosion layer. However, no accompanying structures were detected, so it is possible that what has been detected is {{the central part of the}} structure. Due to time constraints, research was suspended at that layer. Trench 11, which is smaller, was opened in the north and exhibits analogous stratigraphy with a layer of earth and rocks filling the irregular stone vein under the compacted layer...|$|R
40|$|African Red Slip <b>ware</b> is a <b>table</b> {{and cooking}} <b>ware</b> {{produced}} in numerous kilns in northern Africa {{from the first}} into the seventh century A. D. It was widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean and remained a popular item until the Arab invasion of the later seventh century A. D. The thesis sketches general trends in the functional composition of pottery assemblages in Roman North Africa from the first to the seventh century A. D. The approach to this research is multi-disciplinary, as it correlates archaeological data with socio-cultural studies, such as material culture theory. The data comes from the analysis and quantification of published material (Carthage and Rome) and from the author’s research (Leptiminus). The central research question focuses on how African Red Slip ware {{was used in the}} Roman period and investigates private consumption behaviour at the household level. The comparative study establishes variations within the data regarding the variables of fabric, form and date and highlights differences and similarities between the assemblages. The study of changes in the use of African Red Slip ware are used to study consumption patterns and the influence of Roman traditions on local cultural identity. The results reveal that the cultural consequences of acculturation in the Roman empire were less complex than expected. The adoption of Roman material culture influenced natives, {{while at the same time}} did not impair their native identity. African Red Slip ware is the result of a complex cultural fusion reflecting Roman and North African influences...|$|R
