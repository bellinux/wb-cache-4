Palmerston {{initially}} declined to buy {{the contents of the}} castle from his predecessor's estate on taking up the post, a practice which had become traditional for the Lords Warden, complaining about the high price being proposed. This raised <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> historical contents of the castle might be sold off at open auction; and some of Wellington's former belongings were therefore removed by his family for safekeeping.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

This paper first gives a general understanding {{of the types of}} OTC derivatives, explains their pre-crisis regulatory background and the role they played to the crisis and <b>the</b> hidden <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crisis revealed. Second, it explains the regulatory framework of clearing houses as central counterparties for OTC derivatives transactions and sets, in a comparative way, the relevant national regulations in the EU and the US. Third it examines <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> international initiative entails per se but also those deriving from the inconsistencies among the nationally adopted regulations. Finally, it proposes as solutions to these <b>risks</b> <b>the</b> international coordination of the national competent authorities, both in their capacity as regulators and as supervisors, and highlights the additional need for the coordination of substantive national laws...|$|R

5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was a sensible business decision, most highlighting <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle {{with the knowledge that}} fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

Mild scoliosis (less than 30 degrees deviation) may simply be monitored and treated with exercise. Moderately severe scoliosis (30â45 degrees) in a child who is still growing may require bracing. Severe curvatures that rapidly progresses may be treated surgically with spinal rod placement. Bracing may prevent a progressive curvature, but evidence for this is not very strong. In all cases, early intervention offers the best results.|$|E

50|$|The {{airports}} {{in the smaller}} enclaves of Daman and Diu had to be strategically oriented so as to respect Indian airspace and avoid any confrontations with the Indian authorities on take-off and landing. In 1957, the Indian government placed anti-aircraft guns just outside the air corridors and threatened to shoot down any planes violating the Indian airspace. The manoeuvres had to be precise and the pilots had to adhere to very strict routes. The margins of tolerance could not exceed by a mile.

25|$|The seller takes <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> buyer may {{default on}} the contract, depriving the seller of the {{expected}} revenue stream. More important, a seller normally limits its risk by buying offsetting protection from another partyâ that is, it hedges its exposure. If the original buyer drops out, the seller squares its position by either unwinding the hedge transaction or by selling a new CDS to a third party. Depending on market conditions, that may be {{at a lower price}} than the original CDS and may therefore involve a loss to the seller.|$|E

25|$|There are criticisms and {{controversy}} surrounding {{the decision to}} implement Gacaca courts. Human rights groups worry about the fairness since trials are held without lawyers which {{means that there is}} less protection for defendants than in conventional courts. In addition conventional trials have seen false accusations and intimidation of witnesses on both sides; issues of revenge have been raised as a concern. The acquittal rate has been 20 percent which suggests a large number of trials were not well-founded. Also because the trials are based on witnesses' testimonies, the length of time between the crime and trial heightens <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> witnesses' memories will be unreliable.|$|E
