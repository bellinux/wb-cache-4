40|$|Caesarean section (C-section) is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which one}} or more incisions are made through a mother's abdomen to deliver one or more babies. It is usually performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby's or mother's life at risk. A descriptive study was done in five maternity hospitals (Mahaweel General Hospital, AL-Zahrah Maternity Hospital, Eskandria General Hospital, Hashymia General Hospital, and Babylon Maternity and Children Teaching Hospital). The study was conducted on 15525 deliveries during first 6 months of 2013. The information was obtained from medical records and patient charts of these hospitals manually to record C-section percentage and their indications.

40|$|Abstract [...] Supporting on-demand {{access to}} large widely shared data, such as popular video objects, {{requires}} {{effective use of}} regional (proxy) servers that store some of the data close to the clients. The proxy caching problem is more complex {{in the context of}} continuous media files because of the need to consider bandwidth as well as storage constraints at the proxy servers, and because of the bandwidth sharing possibilities provided by recently proposed multicast delivery techniques. This paper develops new models fo determining optimal proxy cache content in such environments. Specifically, the models developed here provide insights for heterogeneous systems in which the proxy servers have differing client populations and server capabilities. The new results show that (1) in comparison to previous results for systems with homogeneous proxy workloads, it is even more often cost-effective to cache just the initial segments of many files, rather than the complete data for fewer of the most popular files, (2) to minimize <b>total</b> <b>delivery</b> cost, even in systems with quite strong heterogeneous features, it is often best for all proxy servers to store similar data, rather than to closely tailor each proxy cache content according to local client preferrences and server characteristics, (3) when minimizing <b>total</b> <b>delivery</b> cost, a (group of) regional server(s) with a distinct client workload can sometimes influence the data stored {{by the rest of the}} servers in unexpected ways, and (4) when minimizing the delivery cost for clients of an individual proxy server, the data to be stored at the proxy server may be quite different than the "socially optimal" set that would minimize <b>total</b> <b>delivery</b> cost to all clients.
