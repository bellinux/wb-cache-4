25|$|In reality, {{the most}} {{significant}} hazard is driving, which is made more dangerous by the severe weather. Adding still more to this hazard are the multiple distractions which can compete for a chaser's attention, such as driving, communicating with chase partners and others with a phone and/or radio, navigating, watching the sky, checking weather data, and shooting photos or video. Again here, prudence is key to minimizing the risk. Chasers ideally work to prevent the driver from multitasking either by chase partners covering the other aspects or by the driver pulling over to do <b>these</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> {{if he or she}} is chasing alone. Falling asleep while driving is a chase hazard, especially on long trips back. This also is exacerbated by nocturnal darkness and by the defatigating demands of driving through precipitation and on slick roads.|$|E
500|$|According to the project's lead {{programmer}} Ed Boon, Mortal Kombat II was [...] "intended to {{look different}} than the original MK" [...] and [...] "had everything we wanted to put into MK but {{did not have time}} for." [...] In 2012, Boon placed creating the game among his best Mortal Kombat memories, recalling: [...] "When we did Mortal Kombat II, we got new equipment and all that stuff, but it was funny because when we started working on Mortal Kombat II, the mania, the hysteria of the home versions of Mortal Kombat I was literally all around us. We were so busy working on the next one, going from seven characters to 12 and two Fatalities per character and all <b>these</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that that consumed every second." [...] Both the theme and art style of MKII were slightly darker than those of its predecessor, although a more vibrant color palette was employed and the new game had a much richer color depth than the previous game. A new feature was the use of multiple layers of parallax scrolling in the arcade version. The game was made to be less serious with the addition of humorous alternative finishing moves.

Thicke was unable to rejoin the cast for the shooting of the second season, opting instead to focus on his music. According to Thicke, [...] "Once the song started to take off, and all this momentum was happening, and [...] needed me for all eight weeks, I couldn't finish the album and promote the single and go over seas and do all <b>these</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> I wanted to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of the deleted scenes feature {{additional}} {{characters from}} the television series who ultimately did {{not appear in the}} finished film. Lynch has said that [...] "I had a limit on the running time of the picture. We shot many scenes that—for a regular feature—were too tangential to keep the main story progressing properly. We thought it might be good sometime to do a longer version with <b>these</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> in, {{because a lot of the}} characters that are missing in the finished movie had been filmed. They're part of the picture, they're just not necessary for the main story." [...] According to Lynch, had the film included these scenes, it [...] "wouldn't have been quite so dark. To me it obeyed the laws of Twin Peaks. But a little bit of the goofiness had to be removed." ...|$|E

There could be no priests, no specialized ministers of the one true God, because every man to the utmost measure of his capacity was bound to be God's priest and minister. Many things one may leave to specialists: surgery, detailed administration, chemistry, for example; but it is for every man to think his own philosophy and think out his own religion. One man may tell another, but no man may take charge of another. A man may avail himself of electrician or gardener or what not, but he must stand directly before God; he may suffer neither priest nor king. <b>These</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> are incidental, but God, the kingdom of God, is what he is for.|$|E
60|$|The central {{conception}} of this New Republicanism {{as it has}} shaped itself in my mind, lies in attaching pre-eminent importance to certain aspects of human life, and in subordinating systematically and always, all other considerations to these cardinal aspects. It begins with a {{way of looking at}} life. It insists upon that way, it will regard no human concern at all except in that way. And the way, putting the thing as compactly as possible, is to reject and set aside all abstract, refined, and intellectualized ideas as starting propositions, such ideas as Right, Liberty, Happiness, Duty or Beauty, and to hold fast to the assertion of the fundamental nature of life as a tissue and succession of births. <b>These</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> may be important, they may be profoundly important, but they are not primary.
