5|$|The exposed geology of the Bryce Canyon area in Utah shows {{a record}} of {{deposition}} that covers {{the last part of}} the Cretaceous Period and the first half of the Cenozoic era in that part of North America. The ancient depositional environment of the region around what is now Bryce Canyon National Park varied from the warm shallow sea (called the Cretaceous Seaway) in which the Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited to the cool streams and lakes that contributed sediment to the colorful Claron Formation <b>that</b> <b>dominates</b> the park's amphitheaters.|$|E

5|$|The central {{conflict}} in many Final Fantasy games {{focuses on a}} group of characters battling an evil, and sometimes ancient, antagonist <b>that</b> <b>dominates</b> the game's world. Stories frequently involve a sovereign state in rebellion, with the protagonists taking part in the rebellion. The heroes are often destined to defeat the evil, and occasionally gather {{as a direct result of}} the antagonist's malicious actions. Another staple of the series is the existence of two villains; the main villain is not always who it appears to be, as the primary antagonist may actually be subservient to another character or entity. The main antagonist introduced at the beginning of the game is not always the final enemy, and the characters must continue their quest beyond what appears to be the final fight.|$|E

30|$|Dominance rank For a given {{solution}} s, {{the dominance}} rank {{is defined by}} the number of solutions <b>that</b> <b>dominate</b> s, incremented by 1 [25]. Thereby, solutions of rank 1 are non-dominated solutions. As much as the number of solutions <b>that</b> <b>dominate</b> a solution s increases, its rank is worsened. The dominance rank was originally applied in the MOGA method (multiobjective genetic algorithm) [25].|$|R
