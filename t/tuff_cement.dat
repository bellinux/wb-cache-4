40|$|On {{the ground}} of {{precedent}} studies, chromium exchanged zeolite tuff was used as active addition {{in the manufacture of}} blenden cements. Their mechanical and chemical properties were investigated and were found to be very good, even better than those of Portland-zeolite <b>tuff</b> <b>cement,</b> taken as reference. A process, in which quarry dust, a very cheap by-product of the cutting of zeolite tuff, is intended to remove chromium from wastewaters and to be used as active addition to Portland clinker to prepare blended cements, is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{research}} work {{was to examine}} the effect of alkali-aggregate reaction on mechanical properties of mortars. There we prepared samples - mortar prisms. As a binder we used lime, lime with addition of <b>tuff,</b> <b>cement</b> and cement with fly ash. We also used two different types of aggregate, limestone and dolomite. All samples were first cured in adequate environmental conditions. Samples with lime binder were cured in the laboratory conditions for three months. Samples based on cement binder were cured for 28 days in water. After that samples were exposed to accelerated aging conditions, increased temperatures and/or NaOH solution, and reference conditions - deionized water with 20 °C. We measured mass and length change in predetermined time intervals up to three months. Compressive and flexural test were carried out in order to determine influence of type of carbonate aggregate on mechanical properties of mortars...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the plant}} colonization {{of the stone}} embankments along the Tiber River (the Lungotevere) in relation to changes of lithotype (travertine, <b>tuff,</b> <b>cement),</b> inclination (80 °, 60 °, 45 °), stone size, and exposure. The surveys of plant communities were carried out according to the phytosociological method and considering the variability of the ecological conditions. The vegetation {{data were analyzed using}} multivariate statistical analysis (cluster analysis) in order to highlight the affinity among the various groups of sampling areas. The ecological features of the vegetation, according to Ellenberg indicator values, were considered for the ecological interpretation. Results showed that many environmental factors interact in giving rise to a differential plant cover and species richness, but that some are more relevant than others, such as the lithotype nature, especially in relation to the differential stone porosity. Also, changes in inclination of the walls cause variations in plant colonization, {{especially in the case of}} travertine and less in the case of tuff, as a consequence of the differing porosity of these materials. The study also confirms the subordinate role of exposure with respect to other factors. "...|$|E

40|$|Vigorous {{hydrothermal}} activity interspersed by sequences of phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions occur at Whakaari (White Island volcano), New Zealand. Here, we investigate {{the influence of}} sample type (hydrothermally altered <b>cemented</b> ash <b>tuffs</b> and unconsolidated ash/lapilli) and fragmentation mechanism (steam flashing versus gas expansion) on fragmentation and ejection velocities {{as well as on}} particle-size and shape. Our rapid decompression experiments show that fragmentation and ejection speeds of two ash <b>tuffs,</b> <b>cemented</b> by alunite and amorphous opal, increase with increasing porosity and that both are significantly enhanced in the presence of steam flashing. Ejection speeds of unconsolidated samples are higher than ejection speeds of <b>cemented</b> <b>tuffs,</b> as less energy is consumed by fragmentation. Fragmentation dominated by steam flashing results in increased fragmentation energy and a higher proportion of fine particles. Particle shape analyses before and after fragmentation reveal that both steam flashing and pure gas expansion produce platy or bladed particles from fracturing parallel to the decompression front. Neither fragmentation mechanisms nor sample type show a significant influence on the shape. Our results emphasize that, under identical pressure and temperature conditions, eruptions accompanied by the process of liquid water flashing to steam are significantly more violent than those driven simply by gas expansion. Therefore, phase changes during decompression and cementation are both important considerations for hazard assessment and modeling of eruptions in hydrothermally active environments...|$|R
5000|$|The {{collective}} granary {{known as}} [...] "cenobio de Valerón" [...] {{is a complex}} system of caves on several levels: 298 compartments with surfaces between one and three square meters, distributed on 8 levels. Altogether with silos, rooms, caves and cavities, {{there are more than}} 350 storage places. They were excavated with stone and wood tools in the soft <b>tuff</b> - <b>cemented</b> volcanic tephra - in the north-west face of the mountain known nowadays as Mountain of the Galician (“ Montaña del Gallego ”). The easy defence of the site, the natural shelter offered by a natural arch in the mountain and the conditions of temperature and dampness were making it ideal for its use.|$|R
2500|$|The Augustan {{phase of}} the temple {{was made up of}} a podium under the columns and the cella walls, with its {{supporting}} parts made up of travertine blocks to carry the weight and the non-supporting parts merely of <b>tuff</b> blocks and <b>cement.</b> The remains of the podium wall surviving beneath the cloisters of Santa Maria in Campitelli - 13 metres long, over 4 high and over 2 thick - were assumed by Delbrück to be unquestionably a part of the original structure. [...] Frank, however, maintains that though the cappellaccio tuff core may belong to the original building, the rest (besides some concrete with an opus reticulatum facing, attributable to the 34 BC phase) belongs to the 179 BC restoration. [...] He argues this from the use in the remains' facing of tuff from Monte Verde, {{the southern end of the}} Janiculum Hill.|$|R
40|$|In {{planning}} of underground structures stability analysis of rock masses requires precise properties of fractured rocks. In this paper, an {{experimental study of}} rock-like materials by uniaxial compression tests is presented using {{a new type of}} high stiff loading machine. Four kinds of rocks were selected, namely, Oya-stone (green <b>tuff),</b> Kobe-tuff, <b>cement</b> mortar and marble stone. Three differrent loading procedures were employed, i. e., static loading, incrementally cyclic loading and cyclic loading in post-failure region (see Fig. 4). The machine used in these experiments has high stiffness about 312 ton/mm, and is capable of controlling either deformation or load of the specimen by mechanical action of the wedges under steel blocks installed in parallel with a specimen. This loading machine is very practical and efficient to obtain complete stress-strain curve of geologic materials. Main results are summarized as follows: (1) Obtained stress-strain curves are resolved into four characteristic regions due to the progress of fracturing, namely, intact, crack, fracture, and flow regions. The strains corresponding to each region are related to the strength, or the fablic of materials. (2) Tests of incrementally cyclic loading show that the envelop of unloading and reloading curve is coincident with the statical loading curve. (3) Relationship between plastic strain and total strain on incrementally cyclic loading are distributed by Weibull's probability. (4) Fatigue life under cyclic loading in post-failure region are influenced significantly by crypto-damage due to initial loading and applied stress level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Eight {{different}} types of acid tufts of the Eger Castle (Hungary) and two tufts from nearby quarries have been studied in detail. Mapping of wall sections reveals that tufts show weathering forms that re similar to common sedimentary rocks, such as limestones orsandstones. Different lithologies display various weathering features. On pumice-rich tuft ashlars relief due to selective weathering, weathering crusts, multiple flakes and scales occur, while crumbling is common on layered flow tufts. Conversely, <b>cemented</b> <b>tuff</b> types do not show deep weathering. Pore-size distribution rather than effective porosity controls the weathering susceptibility of tufts. Frequent larger micropores are the main causes of freeze-thaw-related weathering. Besides clays, newly formed gypsum and calcite are the weathering-related in ex minerals. Schmidt hammer rebound values mark the weathering process when quarry stones and ashlars of historic walls are compared. Volcanic tufts are best known from monuments of Anatolia (Caner-Saltik et al. 1994), the Easter Islands (Wendler et al. 1996) and even the Philippines (Patemo & Charola 2000). Great varieties of tufts are used in Europe, for example in Italy (Langella et al...|$|R
