5|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress had the authority <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> <b>restrictions</b> that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty. He noted that the intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the plain language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.|$|E

She also opposed tax cuts announced by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, instead stating she {{would like to see more}} funding for welfare. The party also campaigned on a platform of combating increased inequalities in society, and fighting global warming by supplying 45% of Denmark's energy from renewable sources by 2025.|$|E

The CRTC ultimately decided <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> <b>restrictions</b> on advertising as the funding mechanism. However, a CRTC statement issued in June 2008 indicated that as of that date, only 22 digital transmitters had been fully installed across the entire country, and expressed the regulator's concern that Canada's television broadcasters were not adequately preparing for the shift to digital broadcasting.|$|E

5000|$|In 1860, {{reforms in}} Russia and {{expansion}} of international cooperation led <b>to</b> legislation <b>relaxing</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{on the rights of}} foreigners that had existed before 1860.

2500|$|The {{financial}} {{relationship between}} the two areas improved on 1 May 2009 in a move described as [...] "a major milestone" [...] by The Times. The ROC's financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Commission, announced that Chinese investors would be permitted to invest in Taiwan's money markets {{for the first time since}} 1949. Investors can now apply to purchase Taiwan shares that do not exceed one tenth of the value of the firm’s total shares. The move came as part of a “step by step” movement which is supposed <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> <b>restrictions</b> on Chinese investment. Taipei economist Liang Chi-yuan, commented: “Taiwan's risk factor as a flash point has dropped significantly with its improved ties with Chinese. The Chinese would be hesitant about launching a war as their investment increases here.” China's biggest telecoms carrier, China Mobile, was the first company to avail of the new movement by spending $529 million on buying 12 percent of Far EasTone, the third largest telecoms operator in Taiwan.|$|E

The 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack, which led to Operation Sinai, occurred on 5 August 2012, when armed men ambushed an Egyptian military base in the Sinai Peninsula, killing 16 soldiers and stealing two armored cars, which they used to infiltrate into Israel. The attackers broke through the Kerem Shalom border crossing into Israel, {{where one of the}} vehicles exploded. They then engaged in firefight with soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces, during which six of the attackers were killed. Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi vowed to retake the Sinai Peninsula and declared three days of mourning.|$|R

This has since changed with a Sainsburys superstore opening in this retail park.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, the {{government}} announced it was considering amendment of several laws which impinge upon freedom of speech, including the controversial Internal Security Act (ISA), which {{has been used to}} detain numerous politicians and activists without trial. Home Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, accompanied by Inspector-General of Police Musa Hassan, Attorney General Abdul Gani Patail, Information, Communication, and Culture Minister Rais Yatim, and Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Nazri Aziz, told the press that the ISA, Police Act, Multimedia and Communications Act, the Restrictive Residence Ordinance, and the Emergency Ordinance would be reviewed with an eye <b>to</b> <b>relaxing</b> <b>restrictions</b> on freedom of speech. Rais also said that the Police Act would include provisions allowing peaceful assembly in certain designated places such as stadiums, without the need to obtain a permit from the police. The government plans to table amendments to these laws during the October sitting of Parliament, and pass them by December.|$|R

However, economic relations continued to flourish, {{and by the}} mid-1930s, Japan had become Australia's second largest export market after the United Kingdom. However, in 1936, Britain applied political pressure on Australia to curb the import of Japanese textiles, which were damaging the British textile market in Australia. Japan reacted to the new tariffs with trade barriers of its own. After both sides realized that the trade war was unproductive, an agreement was reached in 1937 <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> <b>restrictions.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{is enough}} {{evidence}} - if not overwhelming evidence - {{to indicate that}} Stalin and his lieutenants knew that the widespread famine in the USSR in 1932-33 hit Ukraine particularly hard, {{and that they were}} ready to see millions of Ukrainian peasants die as a result. They made no efforts to provide relief; they prevented the peasants from seeking food themselves in the cities or elsewhere in the USSR; and they refused <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> <b>restrictions</b> on grain deliveries until it was too late. Stalin's hostility to the Ukrainians and their attempts to maintain their form of [...] "home rule" [...] as well as his anger that Ukrainian peasants resisted collectivization fueled the killer famine.|$|E
50|$|Khrushchev denounced Stalin in {{his speech}} On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences, {{delivered}} at the closed session of the 20th Party Congress, behind closed doors, after midnight on 25 February 1956.

Then Khrushchev initiated a wave of rehabilitations that officially restored the reputations of many millions of innocent victims, who were killed or imprisoned in the Great Purge under Stalin. Further, tentative moves were made through official and unofficial channels <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> <b>restrictions</b> on freedom of speech that had been held over from the rule of Stalin.|$|E

The Amendment also contained measures to improve treatment and care for people dependent on drugs, opened up the processing of opium and concentrated poppy straw to the private sector, and strengthened provisions related to the forfeiture of property of persons arraigned on charges of drug trafficking. The Amendment also removed the NDPS Act's imposition of a mandatory death sentence {{in case of a}} repeat conviction for trafficking large quantities of drugs, giving courts the discretion to use the alternative sentence of 30 years imprisonment for repeat offences. However, the Amendment increased the punishment for [...] "small quantity" [...] offences from a maximum of 6 months to 1 year imprisonment.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{differences}} between Taiwan and mainland China, contact {{between the two sides}} of the Taiwan Strait has grown significantly over the past decade. The ROC has continued <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> <b>restrictions</b> on unofficial contacts with the PRC, and cross-Strait interaction has mushroomed. Since 1987, when the ban on travel to mainland China was lifted, Taiwan residents have made more than 10 million trips to mainland China. The ROC Bureau of Foreign Trade estimates that indirect trade with mainland China reached about US$61.639 billion, or 18% of the total trade of the ROC, in 2004. This indirect trade runs heavily in Taiwan's favor, providing another outlet for the island's booming economy. In an attempt to facilitate trade, in 1995 the Executive Yuan approved the construction of an offshore transshipment center at the port of Kaohsiung through which direct shipping with the mainland China would be permitted. In April 1997 the first sanctioned direct cross-Strait shipping began between selected mainland China ports and Kaohsiung for cargo being transshipped through Taiwan.|$|E
5000|$|NSA {{doctrine}} {{called for}} {{limiting the number}} of radios (250 at first, later 400) on a network with a common key, to limit the risk of key compromise.

NSA eventually had <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> this <b>restriction</b> for air ground communication since aircraft could go anywhere. Also ground forces used FM radios, while aircraft used AM, limiting secure cross communication to units equipped with compatible NESTOR-equipped radios.|$|R
