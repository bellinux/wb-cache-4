500|$|When Behan {{said he had}} {{disarmed}} them, Virgil {{attempted to}} avoid a fight. [...] "I had a walking stick in my left hand and my hand was on my six-shooter in my waist pants, and {{when he said he}} had disarmed them, I shoved it clean around <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> hip and changed my walking stick to my right hand." [...] Wyatt said I [...] "took my pistol, which I had in my hand, under my coat, and put it in my overcoat pocket." [...] The Earps walked further down Fremont street and came into full view of the Cowboys in the lot.|$|E
500|$|It did {{not take}} long for Smith to earn {{recognition}} in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season. The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out {{in the top of}} the fourth inning, Atlanta's Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the middle. Smith described the play by saying, [...] "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first." ...|$|E
500|$|... from Tech's end zone, Riegels {{was turned}} around and ran many yards in the wrong direction. Riegels told the Associated Press, [...] "I was running toward the sidelines when I picked up the ball... I started to turn <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> toward Tech's goal. Somebody shoved me and I bounded right off into a tackler. In {{pivoting}} {{to get away from}} him, I completely lost my bearings." [...] Teammate and quarterback Benny Lom chased Riegels, screaming at him to stop. Known for his speed, Lom finally caught up with Riegels at California's [...] line and tried to turn him around, but he was immediately rushed by a wave of Georgia Tech players, and tackled by Frank Waddey and Vance Maree at the [...] line. [...] The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone, but Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Tech a 2–0 lead.|$|E

[...] "Just now I am going to call upon an old friend--an ordinary young lady named Jinjur--who has promised <b>to</b> repaint <b>my</b> <b>left</b> ear for me. You may have noticed that the paint on <b>my</b> <b>left</b> ear has peeled off and faded, which affects my hearing on that side. Jinjur always fixes me up when I get weather-worn." ...|$|R

2500|$|In the post-fight {{interview}} Mayweather said, [...] "My last training day, I hurt my {{rotator cuff}} {{in my left}} shoulder, so I couldn't use my jab the way I want <b>to.</b> <b>My</b> <b>left</b> wasn't as strong as I wanted it to be, but I didn't want to have no excuses, you know, like other champions, you know, when they get hurt they won't even show up to the fight. I get hurt I keep fighting, you know, I want to bring the fans a victory".|$|E
2500|$|Pilot Robert White {{commented on}} his high {{altitude}} X-15 flights, [...] "My flights to 217,000 feet [...] and 314,750 feet [...] were very dramatic in revealing the Earth's curvature... at my highest altitude I could turn my head through a 180-degree arc and wow!— the Earth is really round. At my peak altitude I was roughly over the Arizona/California {{border in the}} area of Las Vegas, and this was how I described it: Looking <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> I felt I could spit into the Gulf of California; looking to my right I felt I could toss a dime into San Francisco Bay." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{initially}} stated by police that Menezes was shot {{five times in}} the head. Mark Whitby, a passenger on the train Menezes had run onto, said: 'one of [...] was carrying a black handgun—it looked like an automatic—He half tripped… they pushed him to the floor, bundled {{on top of him}} and unloaded five shots into him.' Another passenger, Dan Copeland, said: 'an officer jumped on the door <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> and screamed, [...] "Everybody out!" [...] People just froze in their seats cowering for a few seconds and then leapt up. As I turned out the door on to the platform, I heard four dull bangs.' Menezes's cousin Alex Pereira, who lived with him, asserted that Menezes had been shot from behind: 'I pushed my way into the morgue. [...] They wouldn't let me see him. His mouth was twisted by the wounds and it looked like he had been shot {{from the back of the}} neck.' Later reports confirmed that Jean Charles de Menezes was shot a total of eight times: seven times in the head and once in the shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|Down--certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated {{within three}} inches of my bosom! I {{struggled}} violently, furiously, <b>to</b> free <b>my</b> <b>left</b> arm. This was free {{only from the}} elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter, from the platter beside me, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mouth, with great effort, but no farther. Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum. I {{might as well have}} attempted to arrest an avalanche! ...|$|R

60|$|Raising {{her hand}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> lips I <b>left</b> her without a word, and resumed my watch. Again {{profound}} silence reigned around, broken only {{now and then}} by an irrepressible sob from Eve.|$|R
60|$|My first {{knowledge}} that I {{was on the}} wrong trail came when I heard the yells of the pursuing savages suddenly grow fainter and fainter far off <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "What," [...] said I, drawing {{my right}} hand, with the {{forefinger}} and thumb pressed together, nimbly from my right haunch <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> shoulder, [...] "you have condescended {{to resume the}} paternal arts to which you were first bred--long stitches, ha, Dick?" ...|$|E

60|$|Poor Violette, {{looking as}} miserable as her master, was led round and I was told <b>to</b> mount her. <b>My</b> <b>left</b> arm {{was tied with}} a thong which was {{fastened}} to the stirrup-iron of a sergeant of Dragoons.

5000|$|Last year {{my vision}} started {{clouding}} in my good eye so I hot-footed to London {{and got to}} see the one man who's been working near miracles at Moorfields. <b>To</b> <b>my</b> astonishment, he was prepared <b>to</b> tackle <b>my</b> defunct <b>left</b> eye {{on the grounds that it}} had been pretty useless for half a century therefore nothing would be lost if a lens implant operation went pear-shaped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop," [...] exclaimed Frank {{in a low}} voice; [...] "I've got no harm except <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> leg. It's broken, I think. There's no use {{of lifting}} me till you get a cab. I'll go {{straight}} home, if--" [...] He fainted as he spoke.|$|E

6000|$|In the {{dormitory}} that night Parsons had become heroic.

6000|$|... "Where's that prevaricatin' fishmonger?"

6000|$|Flick! {{something}} {{flew over}} my head. Flick! As I soared in mid-stride I saw a spear hit and quiver {{in one of}} the carcasses <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left.</b> Then, as I came down, one hit the ground before me, and I heard the remote chuzz! with which their things were fired. Flick, flick! for a moment it was a shower. They were volleying! ...|$|E
60|$|The next turn of {{the canyon}} brought me to its mouth, and before me I saw a narrow plain leading down to an ocean.

60|$|At first I {{thought that}} I {{was dead and}} lying in a tomb. Then by degrees I saw that I was in no tomb but in a darkened room that was {{familiar}} <b>to</b> me, <b>my</b> own room in Seti's palace at Tanis. It must be so, for there, near to the bed on which I lay, was my own chest filled with the manuscripts that I had brought from Memphis. I tried <b>to</b> lift <b>my</b> <b>left</b> hand, but could not, and looking down saw that the arm was bandaged like {{to that of a}} mummy, which made me think again that I must be dead, if the dead could suffer so much pain. I closed my eyes and thought or slept a while.|$|R
60|$|After this things grew very awful. Some fled, but {{the most}} stood and died where they were. Oddly enough during all this time I was never touched. Men fell <b>to</b> <b>my</b> right and <b>left</b> {{and in front of}} me; bullets and assegais whizzed past me, yet I {{remained}} quite unhurt. It was as though some Power protected me, which no doubt it did.|$|R

"W'en he said that, Bill, I do assure you, lad, that my {{experience}} in the ring seemed <b>to</b> fly into <b>my</b> knuckles, an' it was as much as ever I could do <b>to</b> keep <b>my</b> <b>left</b> off his nob and my right out of his breadbasket. But I restrained myself. If there's one thing I'm proud of, Bill, it's the wirtue o' self-restraint in the way o' business. I wheeled about, held up my nose, an' walked off wi' {{the air of a}} dook. You see, I didn't want for to have no more words wi' the gardener,--for why? because I'd seen all I wanted to see--d'ee see? But there was one--no, two--things I saw which it was as well I did see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My plan of {{procedure}} {{was a very}} simple one, and I had purposely made it so in order {{that it might be}} more easily remembered. I was well acquainted with the position of the opening by which I had entered. For several days I had studied carefully its relation to other points in the surrounding country. Starting from this opening, my plan was to proceed inward through the long corridor until I came to a transverse passage; to pass this until I reached another; to pass this also, and to go on until I came to a third; then I would turn <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> and proceed until I had passed two other transverse passages and reached a third; then I would again turn <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> and count the open tombs on my left hand. When I reached the third tomb I would stop. Thus there would be a series of three threes, and it was scarcely possible that I could forget that.|$|E

6000|$|Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit {{the road}} {{about me and}} showed the distant woods towards Addlestone. I felt a tug at the reins.
