5|$|The wreck is {{generally}} intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out off the ship. The vertical {{position of the}} wreck has inspired a new theory of her loss by nautical archaeologist Vello Mäss. He believes that Rusalka was taking on water forward, perhaps from a leak or <b>through</b> <b>ventilation</b> hatches and was bow-heavy when her captain {{decided to make a}} turn, possibly to return to Reval, and the ship capsized during the turn with her engines still running. Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom.|$|E
5|$|Mirror's Edge {{is set in}} a quasi-futuristic dystopian society, {{in which}} a network of 'runners', {{including}} the main character, Faith Connors, act as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional platform game, the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, <b>through</b> <b>ventilation</b> shafts, and otherwise within urban environments, negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by parkour. The game has a brightly colored style and differs from most previous first-person perspective video games in allowing for a greater freedom of movement with regard to its 3D environment. This allows for a wider range of actions—such as sliding under barriers, tumbling, wall-running, and shimmying across ledges; in having no heads-up display; and in allowing a range of vision which incorporated the legs, arms, and torso of the character as frequently visible elements on-screen.|$|E

500|$|The {{additional}} armour added {{during construction}} increased her draught by about [...] at deep load, which reduced her freeboard {{and made her}} very wet. At full speed, or in heavy seas, water would flow over the ship's quarterdeck and often entered the messdecks and living quarters <b>through</b> <b>ventilation</b> shafts. This characteristic earned her the nickname of [...] "the largest submarine in the Navy". The persistent dampness, coupled with the ship's poor ventilation, was blamed for {{the high incidence of}} tuberculosis aboard. The ship's complement varied widely over her career; in 1919, she was authorised 1433 men as a squadron flagship; in 1934, she had 81 officers and 1244 men aboard.|$|E
500|$|In Mirror's Edge, {{the player}} {{controls}} the protagonist, Faith, from a first-person perspective {{as she is}} challenged to navigate across a gleaming city by jumping between rooftops, running across walls, and gaining access to buildings <b>through</b> <b>ventilation</b> shafts. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the discipline of parkour. According to senior producer Owen O'Brien, Mirror's Edge aims to [...] "convey [...] strain and physical contact with the environment", {{with the goal of}} allowing a freedom of movement previously unseen in the first-person genre. In order to achieve this, camera movement pays more attention to character movement. For example, as Faith's speed builds up while running, {{the rate at which the}} camera bobs up and down increases as well. When a roll is executed, the camera spins with the character. Faith's arms, legs, and torso are prominent and their visibility is used to convey movement and momentum. The character's arms pump and the length of her steps increase with her gait, and her legs cycle and arms flail during long jumps.|$|E
500|$|During development, Rain World {{animations}} {{became popular}} {{on social media}} for their [...] "uncanny fluidity", which reviewers continued to praise at release. IGN described Slugcat's animations as beautiful and reactive to the angle and physics of movement, from clinging to poles to squeezing <b>through</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The reviewer said it was among the best aesthetics in a 2D game, with each screen showing abundant detail and meticulous craft. The graphics were more interesting than beautiful to Polygon reviewer, who also praised the limited color palette's role in distinguishing the Slugcat, prey, and enemies from the environment. While some journalists compared the game's aesthetic to that of Limbo, Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer felt that Rain World had {{more in common with}} [...] aesthetic: both featured similarly dark yet attractive worlds, scary yet fascinating characters, frequent inter-enemy conflict, and frustrating or masochistic controls. Oddworld, though, had more frequent saves. Rain World successfully depicted [...] "the cruel indifference of nature", according to GameSpot. Its imaginative and compelling landscapesurreal inhabitants in a bleak, alien atmosphererecalled the spirit of games like BioShock and Abzû, in which the reviewer was too attracted to the artistic detail to contemplate the credulity of the man-made environment.|$|E

40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} The {{increasing}} concerns regarding {{the management of}} indoor air quality have become an important issue for subway operators because most subway lines are underground and have poor ventilation. To maintain clean and fresh indoor air in cabins with low consump-tion of energy {{it is first necessary}} to quantify the components of the ventilation in the cabins divided into mechanical ventilation and natural ventilation. How-ever, there is no established method of, nor reliable data on, how much indoor air is exchanged <b>through</b> natural <b>ventilation</b> such as doors opening and closing. In this study, carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels were mea-sured in 6 lines of the Seoul Metropolitan Subways and a theoretical approach was made to estimate the indoor CO 2 levels <b>through</b> natural <b>ventilation</b> during the operation of cabins to calculate the natural ventilation rate. We considered CO 2 dilution factor during natural ventilation which indicates the exchange rate of indoor air with outdoor air. As the result of the study, the change in CO 2 level could be quantified and it was found that approx. 35 % of the indoor air was exchanged with outdoor air <b>through</b> natural <b>ventilation...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Intensive piggeries are {{generally}} large warehouse-like buildings or barns. [...] Indoor pig systems allow the pigs' conditions to be monitored, ensuring minimum fatalities and increased productivity. Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated. [...] Most domestic pig varieties {{are susceptible to}} sunburn and heat stress, and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves. Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death. [...] Maintaining a more specific temperature within the pig-tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth-to-feed ratio. [...] Indoor piggeries have allowed pig farming to be undertaken in countries or areas with unsuitable climate or soil for outdoor pig raising. [...] In an intensive operation, pigs will no longer need access to a wallow (mud), which is their natural cooling mechanism.

2500|$|The {{standard}} 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 {{was rated}} at [...] {{and designed to}} run on lower octane regular lead, low-lead or unleaded gasoline {{for the first time}} this year thanks to a General Motors-mandate that all engines be designed to run on such fuels in preparation for the catalytic converter equipped cars of 1975 and later years that absolutely required unleaded gasoline. Despite this, a few 1975 and 1976 Ninety Eights were released from this catalytic converter requirement in Canada and were given certification along with exemption from requiring unleaded gasoline. V8s were progressively detuned as production wore on in line with tighter emission standards. Trunk mounted louvers for the flow <b>through</b> <b>ventilation</b> system were only found on 1971 models (as in many other GM models of 1971). The louvers were moved to the doorjambs for 1972-1976 models.
