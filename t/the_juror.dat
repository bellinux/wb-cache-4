5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and <b>the</b> <b>juror</b> is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} fraught with irregularities. All three judges were pro-Goebel Democrats, {{and at one}} point <b>the</b> <b>juror</b> pool of 368 people was found to have only eight Republicans. Republican appeals courts {{overturned}} Powers' and Howard's convictions, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two convictions and a hung jury and Howard was tried and convicted twice more. Both men were pardoned in 1908 by Governor Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude <b>the</b> <b>juror.</b> The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E

With Darrow himself {{on the verge of being}} discredited, the defense's hope for a simple plea agreement ended. On December 1, 1911, the McNamara brothers changed their pleas to guilty, in open court. The plea bargain Darrow helped arrange earned John fifteen years and James life imprisonment. Despite sparing the brothers the death penalty, Darrow was accused by many in organized labor of selling the movement out.|$|E

According to [...] of Hong Kong's Basic Law, judicial courts may refer to decisions which are rendered by courts of other common law jurisdictions as precedents (England, Canada and Australia). Judges from these jurisdictions are permitted to sit as non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal.|$|E
500|$|In Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court of the United States {{held that}} a {{violation}} of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution occurs when prosecutors use peremptory challenges to exclude jurors on the basis of race. If a defendant alleges that a prosecutor challenged a prospective juror on the basis of that juror's race (a process known as a [...] "Batson challenge"), trial courts will conduct a three-part analysis of the peremptory challenge in question: [...] "irst, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking <b>the</b> <b>juror</b> in question; and third, in light of the partiesâ€™ submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination." [...] A court will only sustain a Batson challenge if all three elements of this test are satisfied. On appeal, a trial court's findings with respect to a Batson challenge will only be reversed if a trial court judge committed clear error. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that findings with respect to a prosecutor's explanation of the reasons for their use of peremptory challenges is [...] "entitled to 'great deference'".|$|E
2500|$|In a post-trial interview, one juror {{said that}} the defense {{provided}} a confusing checklist of events, e.g., that there were multiple locations of where the alleged punch occurred from the defense witnesses and that the defense witnesses were {{under the influence of}} alcohol at the time the alleged fight occurred. <b>The</b> <b>juror</b> also stated that Kyle's using a pseudonym for Ventura in the book was to keep it [...] "under wraps" [...] and that, if it were true, then <b>the</b> <b>juror</b> thought Kyle should have used Ventura's name. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>juror</b> found it compelling from photographs in the days after the alleged punch that Kyle, who was over 6 feet tall, over 200 pounds and in top physical shape, could punch Ventura, who was on blood-thinners, knock him to the ground, and not leave a facial mark.|$|E

The judge merely informed <b>the</b> <b>jurors</b> to reread <b>the</b> instruction. <b>The</b> <b>jurors</b> returned with a death penalty sentence. The Supreme Court held that these <b>jurors</b> likely understood <b>the</b> instructions and at most Weeks had shown a slight possibility that <b>the</b> <b>jurors</b> believed they were precluded from considering mitigating evidence. However, the results of a mock jury study conducted by the authors strongly suggest that the Supreme Court 2 Ì† 7 s conclusion was incorrect.
