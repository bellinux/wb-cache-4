40|$|Network {{security}} {{is becoming a}} very sensitive and important topic for equipment manufacturers and <b>network</b> operators. In <b>transparent</b> optical <b>networks,</b> {{security is}} even more complex since the optical signals are not regenerated as in opaque networks and, therefore, the faults and attacks at the physical layer {{are more difficult to}} detect and isolate without significantly affecting the overall network performance. In this paper we define Failure Management as the prevention, detection, and reaction against failures. Failures are defined as the interruptions of the normal functioning of the network and comprise faults (accidental interruptions) as well as attacks (intentional interruptions which can be performed by service disruption or eavesdropping). Our work deals with a solution to detection of failures in <b>transparent</b> <b>networks.</b> For this purpose we have extended a Fault Location algorithm 3 developed for opaque optical networks to be used in <b>transparent</b> <b>networks</b> and be able to also locate attacks. The proposed algorithm is called Transparent Failure Location Algorithm (TFLA). The first part of the extension is based on the study of other optical network elements such as Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (OADMs), Optical Cross-Connects (OXCs), wavelength converters, Optical Line Terminators, etc. The vulnerability of these elements depends on their architecture and/or fabrication technology and, therefore, different attacks can be considered. A classification of these components based on the masking and alarming properties is proposed.

Network availability is an important performance parameter for network operators, who are incorporating protection and restoration mechanisms in the network to achieve competitive advantages. This paper focuses on the reduction in Capital Expenditures (CapEx) expected from implementing sharing of backup resources in path-protected <b>transparent</b> <b>networks.</b> We dimension a nationwide network topology for different protection mechanisms using transparent and opaque architectures. We investigate the CapEx reductions obtained through protection sharing on a population of 1000 randomly generated biconnected planar topologies with 14 nodes. We show that the gain for <b>transparent</b> <b>networks</b> is heavily dependent on the offered load, with almost no relative gain for low load (no required parallel line systems).

The node CapEx reduction for high load (relative to the number of channels in a line system) is comparable to the CapEx reduction in opaque OTN systems. This is rather surprising as in OTN systems the number of transceivers and linecards {{and the size of the}} OTN switching matrix all decrease, while in <b>transparent</b> <b>networks</b> only the degree of the ROADM (number and size of WSSs in the node) decreases while the number of transponders remains the same...|$|R

In particular, signal quality monitoring is still a major complication in all-optical networks.

Optical network architectures can be characterized as opaque or all- optical (transparent) or as a compromise between opaque and <b>transparent</b> <b>networks.</b> <b>Transparent</b> (or all-optical) <b>network</b> architecture was proposed to reduce the associated cost of opaque <b>networks</b> [1].
