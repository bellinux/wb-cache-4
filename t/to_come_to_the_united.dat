5|$|Kevork Juskalian {{was among}} the {{earliest}} graduates of the Euphrates College in Kharpert, completing his studies around 1881. He served as a minor official of the local Turkish government in Mezire, a village near Kharpert. He was then invited {{to work in the}} Persian consulate in Mezire until he was recalled by the Turkish government to serve as supervisor of eleven villages in the region of Kharpert. Kevork Juskalian felt that there was no secure future for him in Ottoman Turkey and subsequently fled to the United States with his family, arriving at Ellis Island on November 15, 1887. Consequently, the Juskalian family became some of the first Armenians <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. Kevork found a job at the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in Worcester, Massachusetts. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Armenian Church of Our Savior on January 18, 1891.|$|E

In 1935 Julian and Pikl completed the total synthesis of physostigmine and confirmed the structural formula assigned to it. Robert Robinson of Oxford University in the U.K. had been the first to publish a synthesis of physostigmine, but Julian noticed that the melting point of Robinson's end product was wrong, indicating that he had not created it. When Julian completed his synthesis, the melting point matched the correct one for natural physostigmine from the calabar bean.|$|E

Prior to beginning of filming the character's name was changed to Sarah Walker.

Wise's agent then suggested that, since Wise owed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) a film under an old contract, Wise {{should take the}} project there. MGM agreed, but would only give Wise a $1 million budget. Wise knew he could not do the film at MGM's Culver City Studios (now the Sony Pictures Studios), so took it to England, as the Eady Levy gave tax breaks and financing to films made there {{as a way of}} subsidizing and promoting the British film industry. [...] Someone suggested to Wise that he approach MGM's Borehamwood Studios subsidiary. Wise had been asked <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom for a Royal Command Performance of West Side Story, and during the trip made the financing pitch to MGM Borehamwood. They offered a budget of $1.050 million. With the Eady Levy support, this allowed the film to go forward with production in the United Kingdom.|$|E

[...] He added that citizenship [...] "will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons" [...] —a comment which would later raise questions as to whether Congress had originally intended that U.S.-born children of foreign parents were to be included as citizens. [...] Responding to concerns expressed by Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania that liberalizing the right to citizenship might result in certain states being taken over by large populations of undesirable foreign immigrants, [...] John Conness of California predicted that the Chinese population in California would likely remain very small, in large part because Chinese immigrants almost always eventually returned to China, and also because very few Chinese women left their homeland <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

2500|$|One American who {{attempted}} to establish an American Buddhist movement was Dwight Goddard (1861–1939). Goddard was a Christian missionary to China {{when he first came}} in contact with Buddhism. In 1928, he spent a year living in a Zen monastery in Japan. In 1934, he founded [...] "The Followers of Buddha, an American Brotherhood," [...] with the goal of applying the traditional monastic structure of Buddhism more strictly than Senzaki and Sokei-an had previously. The group was largely unsuccessful, as no Americans were recruited to join as monks and attempts failed to attract a Chinese Chan (Zen) master <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. However, Goddard's efforts as an author and publisher bore considerable fruit: in 1930, he began publishing ZEN: A Buddhist Magazine. In 1932, he collaborated with D. T. Suzuki on a translation of the Lankavatara Sutra. That same year, he published the first edition of A Buddhist Bible," [...] an anthology of Buddhist scriptures focusing on those used in Chinese and Japanese Zen.|$|E
2500|$|Wearers of the zoot suits had {{different}} reasons for wearing them. Filipino men dressed in zoot suits sought to challenge their socioeconomic {{status in the}} United States. Instead of proving stereotypes true, Filipino men wanted {{to appeal to the}} masculinity portrayed by Hollywood stars in the 1920’s and 1930’s. Having multiple girlfriends and mistresses was common and even encouraged among these men. As mentioned earlier, Filipinos sent photographs of themselves donning suits to give the impression to their families back home that they were successful. These photographs encouraged other Filipino men <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States in order to fulfill the “American Dream”. Filipinos wore suits for numerous occasions, such as going out to the pool rooms, gambling houses, dance clubs, and night clubs with the intention of attracting women of other races and ethnicities such as Mexican-American women and Caucasian women. This often caused physical confrontations among Caucasian men. [...] Those who donned the zoot suit were seen as devious. Los Angeles public officials and social agencies look to combat the growing number of Mexican, Filipino, and African-American youths by instituting restrictive policies such as curfews and civic group activities.|$|E
2500|$|Filipinos {{have been}} in the territories that would become the United States since the 16th century. The {{earliest}} known arrival is that of [...] "Luzonians" [...] in Morro Bay, California on board the Manila-built galleon ship Nuestra Senora de Esperanza in 1587, when both the Philippines and California were colonies of the Spanish Empire. Romani people began emigrating to North America in colonial times, with small groups recorded in Virginia and French Louisiana. Larger-scale Roma emigration to the United States would follow subsequently. In 1635, an [...] "East Indian" [...] is listed in Jamestown, Virginia; preceding wider settlement of Indian immigrants on the East Coast in the 1790s and the West Coast in the 1800s. In 1763, Filipinos established the small settlement of Saint Malo, Louisiana, after fleeing mistreatment aboard Spanish ships. Since there were no Filipino women with them, these 'Manilamen', as they were known, married Cajun and Native American women. The first Japanese person <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, and stay any significant period of time was Nakahama Manjirō who reached the East Coast in 1841, and Joseph Heco became the first Japanese American naturalized US citizen in 1858.|$|E
