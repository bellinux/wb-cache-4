500|$|In January 2011, the Icelandic donor {{died and}} his penis was surgically removed {{so that it}} could be added to the museum's collection. The penectomy was not entirely {{successful}} and left the penis [...] "a greyish-brown, shrivelled mass". According to Sigurður, [...] "I should have stretched it and sewn it at the back to keep it in more or less a normal position". Instead, it [...] "went directly into the formaldehyde". Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður expressed confidence that [...] "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon." [...] Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved human penis is [...] "that it's very old, you know, a bit shrunken, and the male members [...] say 'oh, I hope mine will not look like <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> get old. Sigurður has considered donating his own penis to the museum when he dies but said that it depends on his wife: [...] "If she dies first, my specimen would go in here. If I die first, well I can't say. She might say no." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1990s, {{the stress}} of the {{constant}} filming and promotion of his films, as Van Damme explains, led him to develop a cocaine habit, on which he spent up to $10,000 a week, and consuming up to 10 grams per day by 1996. He was arrested for driving under the influence in 1999. Attempts at drug rehabilitation were unsuccessful, and he resorted to resolve his addiction via quitting cold turkey and exercise. In 1998, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In 2011, he discussed the condition on the British reality show , saying, [...] "Sometimes you're gonna like me, and sometimes you're gonna hate me. But what can I do? I'm not perfect... I'm an extreme bipolar, and I'm taking medication for <b>this...</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> was young, I was suffering those swing moods. In the morning, the sky was blue [...] going to school, and to me, the sky was black. I was so sad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Kobach's {{campaign}} treasurer, Tom Arpke, possessed campaign experience, {{losing a}} state senate race in 2008, winning a Salina City Council seat the next year, {{and a state}} House seat in 2010, he {{was found to have}} under-reported contributions by $35,000 and nearly $43,000 in expenditures in Kobach's 2010 campaign, resulting in a maximum $5,000 fine. Kobach complained that he was being discriminated against because former Republican Governor Bill Graves received a much smaller fine for similar violations. Kobach alleged, [...] "The only real distinction I can see is that I'm a conservative and he's a moderate." [...] The chair of the Kansas ethics commission said [...] "The commission does not condone lack of candor before the commission." [...] When he obtained convictions of Kansans for interstate voting irregularities in 2016, Kobach said, [...] "The fines are “exactly what I wanted to see in cases like <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> made the case before Kansas Legislature that this authority was needed ... A $5,000 fine is very significant, and hopefully something no one would want to have to pay”, he said.|$|E
