25|$|Marylanders might {{agree in}} {{principle}} that slavery {{could and should}} be abolished, but they were slow to achieve it statewide. Although the need for slaves had declined with the shift away from tobacco culture, and slaves were being sold to the Deep South, slavery was still too deeply embedded into Maryland society for the whites <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> voluntarily on a wide scale. Wealthy planters exercised considerable {{economic and political power}} in the state. Slavery did not end until after the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Cho {{made another}} miraculous comeback, {{this time in}} 1992 against his biggest rival Kobayashi Koichi in the Honinbo. Kobayashi had {{challenged}} for the Honinbo in 1990 and 1991, but Cho was too stubborn <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Cho had come back in both finals, being down 3 games to 1, but pulled back 3 wins to defend the Honinbo. In 1991, he was down 2 to 0 in 1990, then won 4 {{games in a row}} to defend once more. In 1992, it was even more unbelievable. Cho was losing 3 games to 0, but was so relentless, that he came back and won 4 straight games once more to take the Honinbo away from Kobayashi's grip. This certainly showed that Cho could come back from any deficit and win again.|$|E

He was unable to handle his duties at the Teachers Training College, and his position there was taken over by San Win. Min Naing also mentions that Ba Zaw became chairman of the Burma Art Club in 1933, adding that Ba Zaw was also forced to give up this position due to his stroke. Min Naing’s 1933 date for Ba Zaw’s selection as chairman of the BAC is at odds with the 1932 date (given by others) of the stroke which severely debilitated him.|$|E

Corysta refuses, and the Matres take the Phibian child away.|$|E

[...] "Tom Johnson's Quit" [...] was carried by newspapers in twenty states, {{thanks in part to}} the careful cultivation of his popularity. Riley became frustrated that despite his growing acclaim, he found it difficult to achieve financial success. In the early 1880s, in addition to his steady performing, Riley began producing many poems to increase his income. Half of his poems were written during the period.
