500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need you to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing {{the first and second}} verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E

Sam McPherson from TV Overmind graded the finale with an A, writing [...] "From a show {{known for its}} mindbending episodes came the most mindbending episode of all. 'The Day We Died'... not only reinvigorated the show's fantastic (but inevitably aging) premise, but gave the show a breath of life that has me waiting -- no, begging -- for the show's fourth season." [...] Though he wouldn't call the finale the best Fringe episode yet, McPherson referred to the season as {{the best of the}} three and [...] "probably the best season of television that's aired in recent years". Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker lauded the finale, commenting in his review's conclusion [...] "Consider about the whole arc of this season and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> wasn’t one of the most moving, thrilling, funny, inspiring chunks of television you’ve watched. The performances by Noble, Torv, and Jackson were extraordinarily adroit, never showy or merely clever. I was so glad that, by season’s end, Jackson/Peter had once again taken center-stage — a central importance — to a season that, by the nature of its design, needed to concentrate a lot on Walter(s) and Olivia(s)." ...|$|E
