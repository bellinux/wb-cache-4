As a result, large bronze images were created to be carried outside the temple to participate in daily rituals, processions, and temple festivals. The round lugs and holes found on the bases of many of these sculptures are for the poles that were used to carry the heavy images. The deities in bronze who participated in such festivities were sumptuously clothed and decorated with precious jewellery. Their every need and comfort were catered to by a battery of temple priests, musicians, cooks, devadasis, administrators and patrons. <b>The</b> <b>lay</b> <b>public</b> thronged the processional route to have a darshan and admired their beloved deity for the lavish depiction of the figure and the grand costumes and jewelry.|$|E

Method: Cross-sectional population-based random sample of 500 household residents over 18 years old participated in face-to-face interviews in São Paulo, which included a case vignette depicting AD and a structured questionnaire. Results: Public opinion rests firmly in <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> support system. Psychologists and self-help groups and close relatives were often rated as helpful. Many alternative treatments (such as vitamins, physical exercise, vacation) were often rated as helpful. Limited education, younger age and experience with psychiatric problems are associated with the 'medical' intervention model. Female sex and middle age are associated with 'alternative' interventions. Conclusion: Our results suggest that attitudes and belief systems have an important impact on help-seeking and treatment recommendations.

Although China is undergoing severe desertification, {{the perceptions of the}} local people toward their degraded environment and the related issues have so far not been actively solicited. This article, which is a supplement to Lee and Zhang's (2004, 2005) studies, seeks to further investigate <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> <b>public's</b> general environmental attitudes, perceptions of desertification, interpretations of land-degrading activities, and particularly their interrelations in severely desertified areas. Minqin County in Gansu Province, northern China, was chosen to be the study area. Data was collected via a questionnaire survey (n = 1138) administered in December 2002. Major findings were: (1) Most respondents had only weak altruistic environmental attitudes, with educational level to be a significant determinant. (2) Respondents' perceptions of desertification and interpretations of land-degrading activities were contingent on personal attributes, general environmental attitudes, and other conceptions related to desertification. It is recommended that the interrelations between the various aspects of the public's environmental perceptions should be thoroughly examined to facilitate their participation in environmental management. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

He makes no ostentatious display of this special knowledge, yet it is present, giving a firmness and accuracy to what would otherwise be too like mere arbitrary lyrics suggested by a painting, and not really dealing with it.

The present study used questionnaires to investigate <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> <b>public’s</b> knowledge of elasmobranch meat sold in a Brazilian city. Shoppers were surveyed at supermarkets in Curitiba, the largest city in southern Brazil. The study revealed that people do not link commercialized cação meat to sharks and rays (Elasmobranchii), {{with more than half}} of respondents who claimed to have already eaten cação did not think they had ever eaten shark or ray. The educational profile of interviewees suggests that this lack of knowledge may be even more common in other segments of Brazilian society. Therefore, we suggest that ecological information about elasmobranchs should be included in Brazilian elementary and high school curricula. Such a measure has the potential to modify behavior, create awareness, and stimulate responsibility throughout society, with the primary goal of reducing shark meat consumption and, ultimately, guaranteeing the long term conservation of marine resources. </p...|$|R
