5|$|According to {{historian}} David Armitage, <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence did {{prove to}} be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights.

5|$|After Congress {{approved}} the final wording of <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent {{a few blocks}} away to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution. Before long, <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> was read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the thirteen states. The first official public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8; public readings also took place on that day in Trenton, New Jersey and Easton, Pennsylvania. A German translation of <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> was published in Philadelphia by July 9.|$|E

5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the {{resolution}} of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of <b>the</b> <b>declaration.</b> Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the wording of <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.|$|E
5|$|In {{the broader}} Arab world, <b>the</b> <b>declaration</b> {{was seen as}} a {{betrayal}} of the British wartime understandings with the Arabs.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Declaration</b> became {{official}} when Congress {{voted for}} it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversial}} {{question of}} whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing stature of <b>the</b> <b>Declaration.</b> The first major public debate about slavery and <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> {{took place during the}} Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821. Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> indicated that the Founding Fathers of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country. Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina argued that <b>the</b> <b>Declaration</b> was {{not a part of the}} Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.|$|E

Since the states are free to choose what form they please one can find a great variety of the forms and wording of <b>the</b> <b>declarations.</b> According to <b>the</b> Statute the only formality required is that a declaration should be deposited to the UN Secretary General and the intention of the state clearly results from a <b>declaration.</b> <b>The</b> ICJ dealt in several cases with the problem of the entry into force of <b>the</b> <b>declarations</b> and according to the well-established practice of the Court the data of the entry into force of these instruments corresponds to their deposit to the Secretary General...|$|R

5000|$|Policy form - The definitions, {{insuring}} agreement, exclusions, {{and conditions}} are typically combined {{into a single}} integrated document called a policy form, coverage form, or coverage part.

Traditionally, policy forms have been so rigidly standardized {{that they have no}} blank spaces to be filled in. Instead, they always expressly refer to terms or amounts stated in <b>the</b> <b>declarations.</b> If <b>the</b> policy needs to be customized beyond what is possible with <b>the</b> <b>declarations,</b> then <b>the</b> underwriter attaches endorsements or riders.|$|R
