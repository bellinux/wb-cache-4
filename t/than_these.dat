Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and contemporary, and often ends up enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.|$|E

5|$|Herbivores, {{including}} wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela {{conservation area}} and migration {{corridor to the}} south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources <b>than</b> <b>these</b> outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the popular jazz and swing music listened to by mainstream America, {{there were a number}} of other genres that were popular among certain groups of people—e.g., minorities or rural audiences. Beginning in the 1920s and accelerating greatly in the 1940s, the blues began rapidly diversifying into a broad spectrum of new styles. These included an uptempo, energetic style called rhythm and blues (R), a merger of blues and Anglo-Celtic song called country music and the fusion of hymns and spirituals with blues structures called gospel music. Later <b>than</b> <b>these</b> other styles, in the 1940s, a blues, R and country fusion eventually called rock and roll developed, eventually coming to dominate American popular by the beginning of the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|It {{has already}} proven {{difficult}} {{to be recognized as}} having standing when a fix is not used for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice Hugo Black (Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge Abner Mikva (McClure v. Carter, 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)). Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other <b>than</b> <b>these</b> cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Atlantic Canada, the storm {{produced}} very high waves, flooding a ship near Sable Island and stranding another ship. Along the coast, the waves wrecked three small boats near Tiverton, Nova Scotia, as well as nine boats in Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador. In Nova Scotia, where the storm made landfall, precipitation reached 1.18 in (30mm), and 20,000 people in Pictou County were left without power. The storm also caused widespread power outages in Newfoundland from its high winds, which reached 68mph (110km/h) near St. Lawrence. There were at least 35 traffic accidents, one fatal, in Grand Falls-Windsor due to slick roads. Prior to the storm's formation, there was a record 4.4 in (116mm) of snowfall across Newfoundland. The storm caused no significant damage in Canada, other <b>than</b> <b>these</b> traffic accidents.|$|E

5|$|Other <b>than</b> <b>these</b> major European powers, {{the only}} others were the Italian city-states. Genoa and Venice were both {{enemies of the}} Ottomans, but also of each other. The Venetians {{considered}} sending their fleet up to attack the fortifications guarding the Dardanelles and the Bosporus, thereby relieving the city but the force was too small and arrived too late. The Ottomans would have overpowered any military assistance provided by one city, even one as large and powerful as the Venetian Republic. In any case some 2,000 mercenaries, mostly Italian under Giovanni Giustiniani Longo, arrived {{to assist in the}} defence of the city. The city's entire defence fell to these mercenaries and 5,000 militia soldiers raised from a city whose population had been seriously eroded by heavy taxation, plague and civil conflict. Though poorly trained, the defenders were well armed in many weapons, except for any cannons to match the Ottoman's own artillery.|$|E

5|$|The median {{lethal dose}} (LD50) for acute {{radiation}} exposure is about 4.5Sv. The committed effective dose equivalent 210Po is 0.51µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5µSv/Bq if inhaled. So a fatal 4.5Sv dose {{can be caused by}} ingesting , about 50 nanograms (ng), or inhaling , about 10ng. One gram of 210Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower <b>than</b> <b>these</b> estimates because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a {{median lethal dose}} of 210Po is , or 0.089 micrograms, still an extremely small amount. For comparison, one grain of table salt is about 0.06mg = 60 μg.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles left {{three sons}} by Archippe, {{daughter}} to Lysander of Alopece,—Archeptolis, Polyeuctus, and Cleophantus. Plato the philosopher mentions Cleophantus as a most excellent horseman, but otherwise insignificant person. And Themistocles had two sons older <b>than</b> <b>these</b> three, Neocles and Diocles. Neocles {{died when he}} was young by the bite of a horse, and Diocles was adopted by his grandfather, Lysander. Themistocles had many daughters, of whom Mnesiptolema, whom he had by a second marriage, was wife to Archeptolis, her brother by another mother, and became priestess of Cybele; Italia was married to Panthoides, of the island of Chios; Sybaris to Nicomedes the Athenian. After the death of Themistocles, his nephew, Phrasicles, went to Magnesia, and married, with her brothers' consent, another daughter, Nicomache, and took charge of her sister Asia, the youngest of all ten children.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, {{the core of a}} massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex <b>than</b> <b>these</b> two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.|$|E

5|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of meitnerium {{has not received}} much attention recently. Meitnerium {{is expected to be}} a noble metal. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium. The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in +, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the + cation, although + is expected to be more stable <b>than</b> <b>these</b> meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{deregulation}} process, {{which would}} {{eliminate the need for}} concessions for routes, was driven by Norway's application for membership of the EU. This was supported by the Labor Party and the right-winged Conservative Party and Progress Party. The plans from the EU indicated that international routes within EU should be deregulated from 1 January 1993, with Norway and Sweden joining from 1 July. Full, domestic liberalization should be performed by 1 April 1997. SAS and Braathens SAFE proposed a solution where only Norwegian airlines could compete until 1997, which was thought to efficiently hinder other airlines, rather <b>than</b> <b>these</b> two, until then. SAS announced its support for competition on 4 February 1993, while Braathens SAFE stated that it no longer was in favor of competition, despite having arguing for this for the whole of the company's history. The company stated that stability was needed and that competition would result in marginalized routes, that were being cross-subsidized, being closed. SAS stated that with competition, prices would fall 20–30%, and that SAS wanted to operate with a loss to force Braathens SAFE close services.|$|E
