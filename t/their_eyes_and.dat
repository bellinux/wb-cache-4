5|$|Sunglasses: The first {{sunglasses}} {{were invented}} in 12th century China when medieval Chinese magistrates wore smoke-colored lenses to conceal <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> feelings during trials while questioning the witnesses and accused. They were a crude slab of smoked quartz {{that was made}} {{to block out the}} light from the sun.|$|E
5|$|Millipede eyes {{consist of}} several simple flat-lensed ocelli {{arranged}} in a group or patch {{on each side of}} the head. These patches are also called ocular fields or ocellaria. Many species of millipedes, including the entire order Polydesmida and cave-dwelling millipedes such as Causeyella and Trichopetalum, had ancestors that could see but have subsequently lost <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> are blind.|$|E
5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. The downside is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes. These species can be distinguished from the cane toad {{by the absence of}} large parotoid glands behind <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.|$|E
5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} all passerines, the chicks are altricial; {{they are born}} blind and covered only by sparse tufts of brown down on their backs, {{shoulders}} and parts of wings. By four days they open <b>their</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, {{and the rest of}} the body on days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel and pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and the laughing kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.|$|E

5|$|Rodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and {{relatively}} underdeveloped) or precocial (mostly furred, {{eyes open and}} fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned. The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest {{a few days after}} they have opened <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> initially keep returning regularly. As they get older and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned.|$|E
5|$|There are two modern breeds of cocker spaniel, the English Cocker Spaniel and the American Cocker Spaniel. They were bred as gun dogs; to {{use their}} sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler in order to flush birds into the air to be shot, and to use <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to {{retrieve}} the bird with a soft mouth. The major differences between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller with a shorter back, a domed head and a shorter muzzle, while the English variety is taller with a narrower head and chest.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{nearly two}} to three months, {{following}} which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvark and porcupines. Kittens are born with <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> ears shut and the claws non-retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around {{the same time the}} kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them everyday. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.|$|E

60|$|Perseus, hearing {{them talk}} in this way, began really {{to think that}} the Gray Women knew nothing of the matter; and, as it grieved him to have put them to so much trouble, he was just on the point of {{restoring}} <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> asking pardon for his rudeness in snatching it away. But Quicksilver caught his hand.|$|R
5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths {{as long as their}} mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid {{on a bed of}} wood dust or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open <b>their</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days of age in the wild and up to 30days of age in captivity.|$|E
25|$|Anacondas live in swamps, marshes, and slow-moving streams, {{mainly in}} the {{tropical}} rainforests of the Amazon and Orinoco basins. They are cumbersome on land, but stealthy and sleek in the water. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> nasal openings are {{on top of their}} heads, allowing them to lie in wait for prey while remaining nearly completely submerged.|$|E

25|$|Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel {{said that}} there never were greater days of joy in Israel than the 15th of Av and Yom Kippur.

When Bodvild took her ring to him to be mended, he took the ring and seduced her, fathering a son and escaping on wings he made.|$|E
25|$|However, {{as far as}} {{the chiefs}} of Perak (who were not present) were {{concerned}} (with this agreement made between the British and Abdullah or the British's recognition of Abdullah as Sultan) - the issue of succession was settled three years earlier with the election of Sultan Ismail. To these Chiefs the British may have proclaimed Abdullah Sultan but his accession was not valid in <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> indeed in Malay eyes if he did not hold the (royal) regalia which was at that time in the hands of Sultan Ismail, all attempts at recovering these from him having failed.|$|E

25|$|Proprioception, the {{kinesthetic}} sense, {{provides the}} parietal cortex {{of the brain}} with information on the movement and relative positions of {{the parts of the}} body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.|$|E
25|$|In the Spiderwick universe, faeries usually remain {{invisible}} or disguised {{to human}} eyes, who {{are generally not}} aware of their presence. However, {{a small percentage of}} humans have the ability to see faeries, commonly called the 'Sight', acquired naturally (for example, by being the seventh son of a seventh son or having red hair) or artificially (by looking through a holed stone or possessing a four-leafed clover). In the series, the Grace children receive the Sight when the hobgoblin Hogsqueal spits in <b>their</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> the Vargas kids receive it when they are held under the water that a nixie had been soaking in.|$|E
25|$|The {{flattened}} {{bodies of}} stingrays {{allow them to}} effectively conceal themselves in their environments. Stingrays do this by agitating the sand and hiding beneath it. Because their eyes are {{on top of their}} bodies and their mouths on the undersides, stingrays cannot see their prey; instead, they use smell and electroreceptors (ampullae of Lorenzini) similar to those of sharks. Stingrays feed primarily on molluscs, crustaceans, and occasionally on small fish. Some stingrays' mouths contain two powerful, shell-crushing plates, while other species only have sucking mouthparts. Stingrays settle on the bottom while feeding, often leaving only <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> tails visible. Coral reefs are favorite feeding grounds and are usually shared with sharks during high tide.|$|E
