5|$|During the 1960s, Kennan criticized U.S. {{involvement}} in Vietnam, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> little vital {{interest in the}} region. Kennan believed that the USSR, Britain, Germany, Japan, and North America remained the areas of vital U.S. interests. During the 1970s and 1980s, he was a major critic of the renewed arms race as détente was ended.|$|E
50|$|The table below {{lists the}} five wars in which <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> {{formally}} declared war against eleven foreign nations. The only country against which <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> declared war {{more than once}} is Germany, against which <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> declared war twice (though a case could be made for Hungary as a successor state to Austria-Hungary).|$|R

5|$|Germany {{asserted}} that the United States was {{given the opportunity to}} view the other nations' tenders and lower their price accordingly. Germany also alleged that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> secured the deal by pledging to come to Argentina's defense should they become embroiled in a military conflict.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{had their}} own {{independent}} atomic-bomb programs and therefore the Japanese understood enough to know how very difficult building it would be. Therefore, many Japanese {{and in particular the}} military members of the government refused to believe <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> built an atomic bomb, and the Japanese military ordered their own independent tests to determine the cause of Hiroshima's destruction. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, argued that even if <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> made one, they could not have many more. American strategists, having anticipated a reaction like Toyoda's, planned to drop a second bomb shortly after the first, to convince the Japanese that the U.S. had a large supply.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Crown {{was unaware}} that, at the time, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> {{successfully}} infiltrated the island {{with a number}} of spies, among them Henry Howard Whitney, Henry Ward, George Bronson Brea, William Freeman, James Dewel, Frederick Ober and Edwin Emerson, Jr.|$|E
50|$|Direct-to-consumer {{pharmaceutical}} advertising (DTCPA) {{laws and}} regulations in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>have</b> gradually become more relaxed since they were first introduced in the 1960s.

5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged {{to abandon the}} derelict Yorktown and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> won a great victory, {{but he was still}} unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.|$|E
5|$|As it {{had been}} two decades since much silver was {{regularly}} deposited for striking into coins, the fact that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten. The gold standard {{was seen as the}} only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the United Kingdom (1816) and the German Empire (1871).|$|E

5|$|Brooks {{came into}} the 1984 Australian Championships as the favourite, {{but this time he}} was on the {{receiving}} end of a close result. He placed third in the 100m freestyle behind Mark Stockwell and Delany, missing individual selection by 0.05s. The trio was separated by a total of only 0.15s. Selected as a relay swimmer only, he went to Los Angeles hoping to win the 4100m freestyle relay, an event that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> always won.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the battle ended, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> moved enough forces onto the Korean Peninsula to roughly equal the number of attacking North Korean forces. For its delaying actions in and around Taejon, the 24th Infantry Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. The {{division}} went into reserve status while it rested and rebuilt, and the first unit of the division back into action, the 19th Infantry Regiment, moved {{to the front lines}} of the Pusan Perimeter on 1 August.|$|E
5|$|Clinton's November 2000 {{visit to}} Vietnam {{was the first}} by a U.S. {{president}} {{since the end of}} the Vietnam War. On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China. The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform. Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} stage of World War II, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as {{outlined}} in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people (most of whom were civilians) and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in the history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} their {{declaration of war}} on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the British War Cabinet began to consider the future of Palestine. By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of Britain's Allies and Associated Powers not fully engaged: <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> yet to suffer a casualty, and the Russians were distracted by internal upheaval. A stalemate in southern Palestine was broken by the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October 1917.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the Iran–Contra affair {{became a}} problem for the {{administration}} stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the Iran–Iraq War to fund the Contra rebels fighting against the government in Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress. The affair became a political scandal in the United States during the 1980s. The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.|$|E

5|$|In 2011 (the {{last year}} for which {{information}} is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than the country as a whole. While <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> 13.3% of its population over the age of 65, Phoenix's percentage stood significantly lower, at 8.1%. Phoenix's percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45–64 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%. This results in 73% of Phoenix's population being 44 or younger, as compared to the national percentage of 60.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, {{seven months}} after <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> entered World War II, Pan Royal made two roundtrips in transatlantic convoys between Boston and the United Kingdom via Halifax.

In mid November, Pan Royal sailed from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Casablanca, and returned in mid-January 1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} The Technology Edge, {{published}} in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan. He argued that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> to develop six industries to compete: microengineering, robotics, genetic engineering, magnetic flight, family aircraft, and space science. He also thought that industrial development {{was suffering from}} short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.|$|E
