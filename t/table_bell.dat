In the first apparatus of this kind which I used, the plate was simply a card of pasteboard, from which the machine took its name. This was cut out with a penknife, and after being covered with marble paper, a strip of white paper was pasted along the middle, with the inscription upon it. The wire c c and a similar one {{at the top of the}} plate, were passed through a perforation in the pasteboard, and then passed into the board. Instead of a pulley, the cord, which was a piece of twine, was passed through a little staple made of wire and driven into the board. The whole was made in one or two recesses in school, with such tools and materials as I could then command. The bell was a common <b>table</b> <b>bell,</b> with a wire passing through the handle. The whole was attached to such a piece of pine board as I could get on the occasion. This coarse contrivance was, for more than a year, the grand regulator of all the movements of the school.|$|E

Developer Nóra Fejtő {{said she wanted to}} make a game that doesn't get repeated, can be played by many and few, is simple, doesn't need much preparation and can be played many times. It featured six of the Beugró games, and the developers could use the [...] "screenplays" [...] of the show (so it contains many situations played at the shootings but never making it to air). The game contained 180 situation (30 for each type), a <b>table</b> <b>bell</b> (symbol of the show, used by the presenter) and cards for some of the game types. The game was sold out by December 2009 and was available again from February 2010. In May 2010 a new version was released with new situations: Beugró Újratöltve (Beugró Reloaded), and in September 2010 Beugró 2. which featured six new types of games.|$|E

5000|$|The Whitechapel Bell Foundry company {{dates back}} to 1570. The last {{premises}} at 32-34 Whitechapel Road, backing on to Plumbers Row, dates from 1670 and was formerly a coaching inn called [...] "The Artichoke" [...] which had been damaged in the Great Fire of London. The Artichoke ceased trading in 1738 and the following year the Whitechapel Bell Foundry moved into the premises. The foundry remained at the site until May 2017. It {{was one of only}} two bell foundries left in the UK and had been in continuous production for almost 450 years. The Master Founders (bell makers) of Aldgate and Whitechapel, however, {{can be traced back to}} 1420. The three bells manufacturer's mark can be seen on the bells and the three bells sign hung over the door of the Whitechapel site. According to previous owners Alan and Kathryn Hughes, the foundry had been a family-owned company throughout its history continuing when Alan Hughes's grandfather bought the company in 1904, until its sale to Westley group in 2017. The business has had to adapt throughout the centuries and in modern times, with new churches being built less frequently, produced handbells and doorbells. It responded to a surge in orders for <b>table</b> <b>bells,</b> following the popularity of the BBC period drama Downton Abbey, with a third of its sales going overseas. In 2013 the foundry launched an online shop selling house bells, musical instruments and personalised merchandise. The large bell business has been largely unaffected by periods of financial depression, partly owing to the fact that from enquiry to completion an order takes on average 11 years. During the second world war the foundry was used as a munitions production line where they made casings for the Ministry of War. [...] The foundry was particularly busy after the war, replacing bells lost or damaged by fire in bombing raids across London. Hughes said “Our business runs counter to the national economy. If the economy goes down and unemployment rises, we start to get busy. Last year was our busiest in thirty years, an increase of 27% on the previous year. Similarly, the nineteen twenties were very busy." [...] Hughes also tells a story of an order requested of his grandfather in the 1890s which his father quoted again for in the 1950s and he himself gave a quote for in the 1970s. The order was finally completed in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|Smith {{was born}} in 1886 in Price County (the same county as his park) to German immigrants. Beginning in his early teens, {{he worked as a}} lumberjack. In 1903 he homesteaded the {{property}} where the concrete park stands today. In addition to woods-work, Fred raised ginseng and Christmas trees on his farm. When his first house burned in 1921, he had the current house built. The house is fairly standard Craftsman style, except for the [...] "rock garden room," [...] in which Smith constructed a 23-foot brick trough with running water, mica-flecked fish pond, crosscut saw blades, and rock garden. Some time between 1922 and the 1940s he added a rock garden outside, with raised beds in various shapes. In 1936, he and local stonemasons Albert and John Raskie built the Rock Garden Tavern, where he entertained visitors with tall tales and musical performances where he jumped from table to <b>table</b> with <b>bells</b> on his legs, playing a mandolin or fiddle. He began creating the concrete sculptures after retiring in 1948, and gradually transformed the outdoor rock garden into the concrete park, until his stroke in 1964.|$|R

The losing team at the head table moves to the tail table; otherwise the winning team at each table advances to the next table, and {{one member of the}} losing team changes seat so that partners in one game are opponents in the next game. Play begins on the next game immediately without waiting for another signal. After 10 games, players total their tally sheets, to determine high score and low score for the tournament.|$|R

Raja <b>Bell</b> tried to come to Nash's aid, and was stopped by his teammates and referees. Horry was given a flagrant foul and was ejected. Bell also was given a technical foul for trying to get at Horry after the collision. The Suns won 104-98, evening the series at 2-2. Nash finished the game with 24 points and 15 assists.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1866 the Conservancy {{inspected}} works between Oxford and Windsor and in October {{settled a}} <b>table</b> of tolls. <b>Bell</b> Weir Lock had collapsed in June and was rebuilt the following year. In 1868 tolls {{were placed on}} {{three of the four}} locks then above Oxford - St John's, Buscot and Pinkhill Locks. Rushey Lock was omitted and there were no tolls on the weirs. This reflects the poor state of navigation above Oxford. [...] Some of the old locks {{on the rest of the}} river were still wooden pens and these were gradually renewed or replaced. Works completed in 1869 included the rebuilding of Romney Lock and the addition of a boat slide at Teddington. In 1870 Hambleden Lock and Benson Lock were rebuilt, followed by Day's Lock in 1871 and Godstow Lock in 1872. [...] In the 1870s it is recorded that Teddington weir collapsed twice causing enormous damage.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} was put, the sand glass was turned upon the <b>table,</b> the division <b>bells</b> were set ringing. Even at this moment, the ministerial whips believed that some were still wavering. A reference made by Mr. Parnell to harmonious communications {{in the previous}} summer with a tory minister, (M125) inclined them {{to vote for the}} bill. On the other hand, the prospect of going to an election without a tory opponent was no weak temptation to a weak man. A common impression was that the bill would be beaten by ten or fifteen. Others were sure that it would be twice as much as either figure. Some on the treasury bench, perhaps including the prime minister himself, hoped against hope that the hostile majority might not be more than five or six. It proved to be thirty. The numbers were 343 against 313. Ninety-three liberals voted against the bill. These with the two tellers were between one-third and one-fourth of the full liberal strength from Great Britain. So ended the first engagement in this long campaign. As I passed into his room at the House with Mr. Gladstone that night, he seemed {{for the first time to}} bend under the crushing weight of the burden that he had taken up.|$|R
6000|$|While the mermaids were {{examining}} and admiring their room, Cap'n Bill {{went to the}} Peony Room to {{see what}} it was like and found his quarters were very cozy and interesting. There were pictures on the wall, portraits of grave-looking porpoises, bashful seals, and smug and smiling walruses. Some of the wall panels were formed of mirrors and reflected clearly the interior of the room. Around the ceiling was a frieze of imitation peonies in silver, and the furniture was peony-shaped, the broad leaves being bent to form seats and couches. Beside a pretty dressing <b>table</b> hung a <b>bell</b> cord with a tassel at the end. Cap'n Bill did not know it was a bell cord, so he pulled it to see what would happen and was puzzled to find that nothing seemed to happen at all, the bell being too far away for him to hear it. Then he began looking at the treasures contained in this royal apartment, and was much pleased with a golden statue of a mermaid that resembled Princess Clia in feature. A silver flower vase upon a stand contained a bouquet of gorgeous peonies, [...] "as nat'ral as life," [...] said Cap'n Bill, although he saw plainly that they must be made of metal.|$|R
6000|$|We {{were all}} grievously {{disappointed}} {{that you were}} ill when we played Mr. Collins's [...] "Lighthouse" [...] at my house. If you had been well, I should have waited upon you with my humble petition that you would come and see it; {{and if you had}} come I think you would have cried, which would have charmed me. I hope to produce another play at home next Christmas, and if I can only persuade you to see it from a special arm-chair, and can only make you wretched, my satisfaction will be intense. May I tell you, to beguile a moment, of a little [...] "Tag," [...] or end of a piece, I saw in Paris this last winter, which struck me as the prettiest I had ever met with? The piece was not a new one, but a revival at the Vaudeville--"Les Mémoires du Diable." [...] Admirably constructed, very interesting, and extremely well played. The plot is, that a certain M. Robin has come into possession of the papers of a deceased lawyer, and finds some relating to the wrongful withholding of an estate from a certain baroness, and to certain other frauds (involving even the denial of the marriage to the deceased baron, and the tarnishing of his good name) which are so very wicked that he binds them up in a book and labels them [...] "Mémoires du Diable." [...] Armed with this knowledge he goes down to the desolate old château in the country--part of the wrested-away estate--from which the baroness and her daughter are going to be ejected. He informs the mother that he can right her and restore the property, but must have, as his reward, her daughter's hand in marriage. She replies: [...] "I cannot promise my daughter to a man of whom I know nothing. The gain would be an unspeakable happiness, but I resolutely decline the bargain." [...] The daughter, however, has observed all, and she comes forward and says: [...] "Do what you have promised my mother you can do, and I am yours." [...] Then the piece goes on to its development, in an admirable way, through the unmasking of all the hypocrites. Now, M. Robin, partly through his knowledge of the secret ways of the old château (derived from the lawyer's papers), and partly through his going to a masquerade as the devil--the better to explode what he knows on the hypocrites--is supposed by the servants at the château really to be the devil. At the opening of the last act he suddenly appears there before the young lady, and she screams, but, recovering and laughing, says: [...] "You are not really the ----?" [...] "Oh dear no!" [...] he replies, [...] "have no connection with him. But these people down here are so frightened and absurd! See this little toy on the table; I open it; here's a little bell. They have a notion that whenever this bell rings I shall appear. Very ignorant, is it not?" [...] "Very, indeed," [...] says she. [...] "Well," [...] says M. Robin, [...] "if you should want me very much to appear, try the bell, if only for a jest. Will you promise?" [...] Yes, she promises, and the play goes on. At last he has righted the baroness completely, and has only to hand her the last document, which proves her marriage and restores her good name. Then he says: [...] "Madame, in the progress of these endeavours I have learnt the happiness of doing good for its own sake. I made a necessary bargain with you; I release you from it. I have done what I undertook to do. I wish you and your amiable daughter all happiness. Adieu! I take my leave." [...] Bows himself out. People on the stage astonished. Audience astonished--incensed. The daughter is going to cry, when she looks at the box on the <b>table,</b> remembers the <b>bell,</b> runs to it and rings it, and he rushes back and takes her to his heart; upon which we all cry with pleasure, and then laugh heartily.|$|R
