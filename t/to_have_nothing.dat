5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} {{optimistic that the}} fourth {{installment}} might be released {{in the last quarter}} of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.|$|E

While not complete strangers, {{each of them}} comes from a different clique, and they seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> in common: the beautiful and pampered Claire Standish, the state champion wrestler Andrew Clark, the geekish intellect Brian Johnson, the introverted outcast Allison Reynolds, and the rebellious delinquent John Bender.|$|E

25|$|Johnstone's {{stance on}} {{conciliation}} probably {{led to his}} selection by North to form part of the peace commission sent to America in 1778 under Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle. Confident of success Johnstone attempted to sway influential Americans with the argument that reconciling with Britain was preferable to dependence on France. In his communications he made vague hints of rewards to those who helped secure this outcome, and was eventually accused of attempting to bribe American general Joseph Reed with 10,000 guineas. The charge was never proved, but the Continental Congress voted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> {{more to do with}} him, and Johnstone returned home in 1778, before the rest of the commissioners.|$|E
25|$|As {{time goes}} by, Babe feels {{increasingly}} guilty of holding Jamie {{back from his}} {{dream of becoming a}} doctor. Due to the terms of his great-aunt Phoebe's will, Jamie will have to leave Babe (now his fiancée) to acquire his inheritance. According to the terms of the will, Jamie will have {{to be the one to}} end the relationship; it has to be his choice <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with Babe. Babe hatches a scheme with Josh to convince Jamie that she and Josh are lovers. Jamie does not believe her and is heartbroken that Babe would not accept his word of Phoebe's will not being important to him if he has to give up Babe. Babe and Jamie end their romance due to her scheme.|$|E
25|$|The {{peace talks}} in Paris, the {{viability}} of South Vietnam, of its military and its government, {{and its effect on}} American disengagement, became the prime stories during this period for the news media. The reportage of the Tet/Khe Sanh period had been unique, and after it was over reportage settled back into its normal routines. According to Clarence Wyatt, the American disengagement was:like watching a film running backward. American troops were leaving, until there were only a handful of advisers left. The communists were once again on the advance, spreading their influence {{closer and closer to the}} major cities. The South Vietnamese military was once again on the defensive, and the leadership of the nation was isolated and increasingly paranoid... Nixon's goal, like Kennedy's, was for the press <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to report.|$|E

25|$|Caccini's {{character}} {{seems to}} have been less than perfectly honorable, as he was frequently motivated by envy and jealousy, not only in his professional life but for personal advancement with the Medici. On one occasion, he informed to the Grand Duke Francesco on two lovers in the Medici householdEleonora, the wife of Pietro de' Medici, who was having an illicit affair with Bernardino Antinoriand his informing led directly to Eleonora's murder by Pietro. His rivalry with both Emilio de' Cavalieri and Jacopo Peri {{seems to have}} been intense: he may have been the one who arranged for Cavalieri to be removed from his post as director of festivities for the wedding of Henry IV of France and Maria de' Medici in 1600 (an event which caused Cavalieri to leave Florence in fury), and he also seems to have rushed his own opera Euridice into print before Peri's opera on the same subject could be published, while simultaneously ordering his group of singers <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with Peri's production.|$|E
500|$|In 1892, Saint-Gaudens {{was asked}} to design the {{official}} medal of the [...] World Columbian Exposition in Chicago; it would be presented to prizewinning exhibitors. [...] The obverse of Saint-Gaudens's design, showing Columbus coming ashore, was noncontroversial; his reverse, which featured a torch-bearing naked youth carrying wreaths to crown the victors, was attacked by the censoring postal agent, Anthony Comstock, as obscene. [...] The exposition directors hastily withdrew the reverse design {{and replaced it with}} one created by Barber which, according to numismatic historian Walter Breen, was [...] "notable only for banality". [...] A furious Saint-Gaudens swore <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> {{more to do with the}} Mint or its employees, and for the next decade refused all commissions which might involve him with that bureau.|$|E

It reached No. 8 on Billboard's Top Christian albums chart, and peaked at No. 159 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it his first Billboard 200 album [...] It was produced by Brown Bannister, Ed Cash, and Christopher Stevens. West {{said in an interview}} that all of the album's songs had already been written and the title [...] "Something to Say" [...] had already been decided [...] "months before I found out that I was going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say." [...] The first radio single released from the album was [...] "You Are Everything". In March 2008, the song reached No. 1 on R's Christian AC chart.

On 21 March, with the press furore over the [...] "missing witness" [...] at its height, the party changed its stance. During a House of Commons debate, Wigg used parliamentary privilege to ask the Home Secretary to categorically deny the truth of rumours connecting [...] "a minister" [...] to Keeler, Rice-Davies and the Edgecombe shooting. He did not name Profumo, who was not in the House. Later in the debate Barbara Castle, the Labour MP for Blackburn, referred to the [...] "missing witness" [...] and hinted at a possible perversion of justice. The Home Secretary, Henry Brooke, refused to comment, adding that Wigg and Castle should [...] "seek other means of making these insinuations if they are prepared to substantiate them".|$|E
500|$|On 31 March 1945, Galland flew 12 {{operational}} jets to Munich {{to begin}} operations. On 5 April, he organised the interception of a USAAF raid. The Me 262s destroyed three B-17s. On 16 April Galland claimed two Martin B-26 Marauder bombers shot down. On 21 April, to his surprise, he was visited by Göring {{for the final}} time. Göring officially assigned Günther Lützow to him and confessed to Galland that his assertions about the Me 262 {{and the use of}} bomber pilots with experience as jet fighter pilots had been correct. He enquired about the progress of his unit with outspoken civility. As they parted, Göring said, [...] "I envy you Galland, for going into action. I wish I were a few years younger and less bulky. If I were, I would gladly put myself under your command. It would be marvelous <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to worry about but a good fight, like it was in the old days." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers gave Bedsitcom {{generally}} negative feedback. Some {{were critical}} of the storylines that had been devised by the writers, calling them unimaginative and clichéd. Others were {{critical of the}} premise of the show itself, describing it as [...] "deeply offensive and manipulative" [...] and [...] "morally reprehensible"—all three actors, particularly Jones, received criticism for their acting abilities. Frances Traynor of The Daily Record called the show [...] "about as funny as sharing a flat with that German cannibal" [...] and Paddy Sherman of The Liverpool Echo branded the show [...] "intensely irritating". Paul Hoggart of The Times called it [...] "a show that seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to recommend it whatsoever",—after watching the first episode, Charlie Catchpole of The Daily Star simply stated: [...] "It isn't funny." [...] Critics on Newsnight Review also spoke harshly about the programme, with Tom Paulin calling it [...] "a disgraceful piece of television" [...] and Jeanette Winterson describing it as [...] "incredibly dull".|$|E

500|$|Johann Peter Hebel {{was born}} on 10 May 1760 in Basel, where his parents were {{employed}} in a patrician household during the summer. He spent half of his childhood in Basel {{and the other half}} in the village of Hausen im Wiesental, where his father worked as a weaver during the winters. As he wrote in an autobiographical sketch, [...] "there I learned early on {{what it meant to be}} poor and rich... <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> and to have everything, to be happy with the happy people and to be sad with those who cried". Memories of both places had a deep influence on his literary work. Hebel's father, who had moved to southern Baden from the Hunsrück area, died of typhus early in 1761, as did his younger sister, who was only a few weeks old. Hebel went to primary school in Hausen in 1766, and in 1769 went on to the Latin school in Schopfheim, where his teacher was the theologian August Gottlieb Preuschen. During the summer months he went to a parish school in Basel, and later to the prestigious cathedral school (Gymnasium am Münsterplatz). His mother died when he was thirteen.|$|E
