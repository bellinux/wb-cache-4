5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
25|$|Flutie {{entered the}} USFL with much hype and fanfare. However, many began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right. In February 1985, Flutie made his USFL debut against the Orlando Renegades. His debut was not impressive, {{as his first}} two {{professional}} passes were intercepted by Renegades line backer Jeff Gabrielsen. The only two touchdowns that New Jersey scored came from turnovers by Orlando quarterback Jerry Golsteyn. By the time Flutie's debut was over, he completed only 7 of 18 passes, {{for a total of}} 174 yards, while running for 51 yards.|$|E

The only mention of God is featured during the breakdown of the song, which is absent in the radio edit.

[...] The next day they calculated their position at a disappointing 86°3'; Nansen confided in his diary that: [...] "I have become more and more convinced we ought to turn before time." [...] After making camp on 7 April Nansen scouted ahead on snowshoes looking for a path forward, but saw only [...] "a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon". He decided that they would go no further north, and would head for Cape Fligely in Franz Josef Land. Nansen recorded the latitude of their final northerly camp as 86°13.6′N, almost three degrees (169.6 nautical miles, or 314km) beyond Greely's previous Farthest North mark.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrasting}} Miles with Peter Parker, Bendis has depicted different {{conflicts and}} anxieties for the character. Right after acquiring his superhuman abilities from a spider bite {{at the home}} of his uncle, Aaron, whom Miles admires but he does not initially know is a career criminal, Miles' father, Jefferson, explains to Miles that before Miles was born, Jefferson and Aaron were thieves who spent time in prison, and that while Jefferson reformed when he got older, Aaron has not. According to Bendis, this gives Miles cause <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> traits that lead to criminal behavior are hardwired into his DNA, leading him to question whether he is essentially a good person or not, and what his future holds for him. These issues further haunt Miles after he becomes disillusioned with Aaron, and Aaron dies from an accidental explosion triggered during a battle between the two of them, saying, [...] "You are just like me" [...] to Miles before dying.|$|E

500|$|According to Cynthia Lennon, {{when the}} group walked past the Maharishi {{on the way to}} their taxis he looked [...] "very biblical and {{isolated}} in his faith". The Maharishi reportedly said, [...] "Wait, talk to me". After leaving the ashram, the taxis kept breaking down, leading the Beatles <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Maharishi had placed a curse on them. The car that the Lennons were in suffered a flat tyre and the driver left them, apparently to find a replacement tyre, but did not return for hours. After it grew dark the Lennons hitchhiked a ride to Delhi and took the first available flight back to London, during which John drunkenly recounted a litany of his numerous infidelities to Cynthia. The Harrisons were not ready to go home, so they travelled to other Indian cities and spent time with Ravi Shankar. Harrison said when he got dysentery he thought it might have been due to a spell cast by the Maharishi, but he recovered after Shankar gave him some amulets. Harrison later said he had never intended to stay for {{the second half of the}} course in Kashmir and that he thought Lennon wanted to get back to his relationship with Ono.|$|E
500|$|After {{ending his}} playing career for good, Motley asked Brown about a {{coaching}} {{job with the}} team. Brown, however, rejected his overtures, saying Motley should instead look for work at a steel mill – the very career football was his ticket out of. Unable to find coaching opportunities in the NFL, {{he worked as a}} whisky salesman in the early 1960s. He got occasional scouting assignments from the Browns, but as the Civil Rights Movement began to coalesce in 1965, he issued a statement saying he had been refused a permanent coaching position by the team numerous times. He applied for a coaching job in 1964, he wrote, and was told that there were no vacancies. The Browns then hired Bob Nussbaumer as an assistant. [...] "When I heard of the hiring of a new assistant, I began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> full reason {{is whether or not the}} time is ripe to hire a Negro coach in Cleveland on the professional level," [...] he wrote. Art Modell, the Browns' owner, responded by saying the team filled its coaching positions based on ability and experience, not race. [...] "We are represented by scouts at every major Negro school. And we now have 12 Negroes signed for the 1965 season," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{criticism}} of the game was its numerous technical glitches. Adam Diamond of Isthmus was {{not happy with the}} pathfinding, writing, [...] "I often found myself traveling solo through a dungeon, my companions spread out far behind me, leaving me vulnerable to attack. What's the point of having henchmen if they're not there to protect you?". [...] Some reviews compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to , a previous Obsidian game that had received similar complaints. The bugs were described as disruptive to gameplay and [...] "downright infuriating", and one reviewer encountered a [...] "showstopper bug" [...] in the initial retail version that prevented him from playing the game past a certain point. The bugs were said to negatively affect NPC AI, camera operation, and pathfinding. One review stated [...] "The launch–to–load time is fairly long so be prepared <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> game has crashed or is loading." [...] Obsidian was quick to release fixes for several bugs, but later reviews still described the glitches as a serious problem. 1UP.com's review, written two weeks after the game's release, stated [...] "But the sad truth is that NWN2 shipped in a pretty messy state, and even after a couple patches (as of this writing), the biggest problems remain." ...|$|E

500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
500|$|Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode [...] "was full of laughs {{but had a}} bit of a {{bittersweet}} aftertaste" [...] and had [...] "one hell of a cliffhanger" [...] ending. Rabin praised the Jim and Dwight teaming in the first episode, but said the plot line of Michael's lectures were predictable and [...] "promised more than it delivered". Rabin said the second episode [...] "wrapped up everything up nicely [...] delivered larfs aplenty"; he particularly enjoyed the subplot involving Angela's cats, {{and the fact that it}} [...] "left the door open for Holly's return". Will Leitch of New York magazine praised the cliffhanger ending of the first episode and said he was pleased the Holly character was still in the show's equation. Leitch also praised Ed Helms, who [...] "is nailing the right combination of ridiculous and sad-sack pathos", although he said he [...] " [...] nearly as inspired" [...] by the Jim and Dwight subplot. Leitch also enjoyed the second episode, particularly the [...] "legitimately sweet moment" [...] when Pam tells Michael that Holly still has feelings for him. Leitch was less praiseworthy of the Angela subplot involving her cats, and said the character [...] "appears to have officially gone batshit insane." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN criticized the first episode and said, [...] "I'm starting <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> show is showing signs of winding down." [...] Fickett said the idea of Michael giving awkward lecture tours felt old and familiar, so much so that [...] "I was convinced it was a repeat". He also said the Jim and Dwight idea was funny, but [...] "nothing the show hasn't tapped before". Likewise, Fickett described the second episode as [...] "average Office and feels overly familiar without really blazing any new ground." [...] He also said it was disappointing Holly did not appear, and that Angela felt like a [...] "caricature" [...] in her subplot.|$|E
500|$|The 1980s was {{a period}} of fast growth for the video game industry. [...] The shooter genre was enjoyed by gamers, who loved its fast paced action and high score boards that allowed them to compete with each other. [...] Influential shooters, such as R-Type and Radiant Silvergun, {{revolutionized}} the genre by introducing new elements to the gameplay. [...] Although not as innovative, Silpheed won critical acclaim and attracted a following by allowing players to customize their ships' weapons. [...] The popularity of shooters began to wane in the 1990s as gamers turned their attention to video games that featured the latest technology3D computer graphics. [...] Members of the industry believed the genre was about to fade into obscurity or already in the throes of its demise. [...] Project Sylpheeds announcement gave them pause and led them <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> new game would rejuvenate the genre. Project Sylpheed lets players fly starfighters and dogfight many enemies in the vastness of space; however, G4tv's reviewer, David Francis Smith, said that the game's designers had [...] "no idea how to create structured, intelligible action in such a big area." [...] Several of his colleagues agreed, finding the game flawed in the design of its missions. [...] They were disappointed that most missions, in the words of Xbox Worlds Michael Gapper, tasked them to [...] "fly, shoot, rearm, [...] shoot more" [...] endlessly. [...] Reviewers were also irked that they were not informed about the secondary objectives in a mission; the goals were only revealed after the reviewers had completed them unawares. [...] Further frustration arose from the fact that certain time limits were only displayed on nearing expiration. [...] Other reviewers had no qualms with these flaws, stating that the intense dogfights more than compensate such shortcomings; Game Informers Andrew Reiner wrote that the [...] "rewarding quick-trigger combat and thrill of overcoming the worst of odds makes Project Sylpheed a memorable play for gamers who daydream of galaxies far, far away." ...|$|E

It's hard not <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> filmmakers have some kind of subconscious agenda....They have made a film that will have the effect of inoculating audiences against the unique historical horror of Oradour—and implicitly rehabilitating the Nazis while making the British seem as evil as history's worst monsters....So it's no wonder that the British press sees this film as a kind of blood libel against the British people." ...|$|E
