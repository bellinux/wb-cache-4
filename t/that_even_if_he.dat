5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that {{the damage to the}} bear’s brain was so severe <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> reached {{the merits of the}} question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, Willkie {{returned}} to New York. When {{he went to}} the movies, he received a standing ovation, as he did when he went to see the play Life With Father. He resigned from C on July 8, 1940, confident <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E

50|$|Michael tells Irene {{that he and}} Mary {{are going}} to be married and that he's done with his life of crime. Irene says <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> honest {{for the rest of his}} life, someday his past will come out and Mary will then be the wife of a criminal. These words weigh on Michael and he realizes that, for her own sake, he cannot marry Mary.|$|R
5000|$|The {{crowd is}} {{agitated}} about {{a series of}} recent mysterious murders. The police calm the crowd. The goldsmith Cardillac enters the scene and the atmosphere becomes hushed. The Lady asks the Cavalier about the goldsmith Cardillac, and the Cavalier tells of the goldsmith and his priceless jewelry. The Lady promises the Cavalier a tryst <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can bring her Cardillac's most beautiful work.|$|R
5|$|As {{the reigning}} 200 m {{champion}} {{at both the}} World Youth and World Junior championships, Bolt hoped to take a clean sweep of the world 200 m championships in the Senior World Championships in Paris. He beat all comers at the 200 m in the World Championship trials. Bolt was pragmatic about his chances and noted <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{did not make the}} final, he would consider setting a personal best a success. However, he suffered a bout of conjunctivitis before the event, and it ruined his training schedule. Realising {{that he would not be}} in peak condition, the JAAA refused to let him participate in the finals, on the grounds that he was too young and inexperienced. Bolt was dismayed at missing out on the opportunity, but focused on getting himself in shape to gain a place on the Jamaican Olympic team instead. Even though he missed the World Championships, Bolt was awarded the IAAF Rising Star Award for the 2003 season on the strength of his junior record-equalling run.|$|E
5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|In the Poetic Edda poem Hárbarðsljóð, Meili {{receives}} a single mention; the god Thor declares <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were an outlaw, he would reveal {{his name and}} his homeland, for he {{is the son of}} Odin, the brother of Meili, and the father of Magni.|$|E
5000|$|Anyone who {{participates in}} {{football}} is counted in <b>that</b> sport, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> does not receive financial {{aid from the}} football program. An exception exists for players at non-scholarship FCS programs who receive aid in another sport.|$|R
6000|$|... "Silence, of course," [...] said Charlie. [...] "There's {{no fear of}} Bowker {{reading the}} {{advertisements}} through, he has far too much literary taste for <b>that,</b> and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did, he's not likely to stumble on this one. So let's be silent." ...|$|R

25|$|Many Sunnis, Ismaili and Zaidiyyah {{argue that}} the 11th Imam, of the Twelver Shia, Hassan al-Askari, {{did not have a}} son. Twelver Shias say his birth was concealed. Others argue <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had a son, Muhammad ibn al-Hassan could not live for over a {{thousand}} years.|$|E
25|$|Manoah {{asked the}} angel to stay {{so that they}} could serve him a meal. But the angel told Manoah <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> stayed, he would not eat, and if they wanted to make a burnt-offering, they should offer it to God. Manoah did not {{recognize}} that he was an angel, and asked him for his name so that when his prophecy proved true, they could honor him. But the angel asked why Manoah asked for his name, as it was hidden.|$|E
25|$|Disturbed at {{how easily}} {{the party is}} {{defeated}} in combat by Ravus, Gladiolus begins to question his ability to protect Noctis {{in his role as}} the King's Shield. Seeking the means to acquire greater power, he calls upon Cor Leonis to accompany him to the Tempering Grounds, a network of millennia-old caverns where generations of Crownsguard soldiers have sought to prove their strength against Gilgamesh, the Blademaster. Cor agrees, but warns Gladiolus that by venturing into the caverns he faces certain death and <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> survives, he may have nothing to show for it.|$|E
50|$|Nicholson's crew lost eight {{killed and}} 31 wounded; Watt {{suffered}} 13 killed and 79 wounded. Both badly battered, Trumbull and Watt separated and retired.Nicholson eagerly {{wanted to continue}} to pursue his adversary until his officers convinced him <b>that</b> — <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> managed to repair his only surviving mast — the condition of his crew would not permit another engagement.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} Mike <b>that</b> Sergeant Collard, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had started to}} wait for him at the house, would not keep up the vigil for more than half an hour. He would be safe now in trying for home again.|$|R
5000|$|In {{association}} football, {{the number}} 10 is traditionally {{worn by the}} team's advanced playmaker. This use has led to [...] "Number 10" [...] becoming a synonym for the player in <b>that</b> particular role, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> or she does not wear that number.|$|R
25|$|In {{the rest}} of the book Ehrlich {{discusses}} things which readers can do to help. This is focused primarily on changing public opinion to create pressure on politicians to enact the policies he suggests, which he believed were not politically possible in 1968. At {{the end of the book}} he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only be better off if it follows his prescriptions, so <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is incorrect it is the right course of action.|$|E
25|$|Ceballos {{then brought}} a section 1983 claim in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserting that his {{supervisors}} violated the First Amendment by retaliating against {{him for his}} memo. His supervisors claimed {{that there was no}} retaliation, that the changes in his job were instead dictated by legitimate staffing concerns, and that regardless, Ceballos’ memo was not constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment. The District Court granted their motion for summary judgment, concluding that because Ceballos wrote his memo pursuant to the duties of his employment, he was not entitled to First Amendment protection for the memo’s contents. In the alternative, it ruled <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had a protected speech right in this context, the right was not clearly established and so qualified immunity applied to his supervisors' actions.|$|E
500|$|Kurt (Chris Colfer) gives Rachel a make-over, {{ostensibly to}} help her attract Finn, but in reality {{attempting}} to sabotage her chances with him. Finn is unimpressed with Rachel's new look before telling her he remembered having the conversation with Kurt about what he liked in girls. Rachel confronts Kurt, stating <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{is in love with}} Finn, she will always have a better chance [...] "because [...] a girl". But Kurt tells her that they are both kidding themselves: Finn is in love with Quinn and nothing will change that.|$|E

5000|$|After confessing {{his love}} for Adriana to Tony, Artie muses that he'd {{have a better chance}} with her <b>if</b> <b>he</b> weren't bald.

2500|$|A {{large part}} of the {{promotion}} was its fundraising activities which raised thousands of dollars for various charities and high schools in the state. It was at one of the events that Shrader, a one-time champion high school wrestler for Woodlawn High, started a feud with Baltimore County school rival Owings Mills High School. On May 16, 1999, Shrader challenged the Owings Mills wrestling team, specifically its head coach Guy Pritzker and assistant Justin Ott, to a wrestling match later <b>that</b> <b>evening.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> and his partner Dino Devine won the match then they would be allowed to become OMHS's wrestling coaching staff for the 1999–2000 winter sports season. Earlier during the school week, Shrader [...] "invaded" [...] the cafeteria while Coach Pritzker was on lunch duty and [...] " [...] him around". The high school coaches ended up winning their match against Shrader and Devine. Shrader continued to appear at Owings High during the school season, however, the feud was cut short when he lost a [...] "loser-leaves-MCW" [...] match.|$|R
500|$|The {{medical staff}} were also worried, because a {{systemic}} illness with intestinal inflammation, such as colitis, {{is a common}} precursor to laminitis, a painful inflammation of the internal structures of the hoof. [...] The staff had been using cryotherapy on his lower legs as a precaution. Although his blood test results and protein levels began to stabilize, he nevertheless developed laminitis in three of his feet on September 4, ten days after {{he arrived at the}} center. The veterinarians treating Paynter put casts on his lower legs to support his feet. [...] Most experts believed <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> survived his racing days were over, and the Zayat family feared that euthanasia would be necessary.|$|E
500|$|Back at the hospital, Ashley {{gives birth}} to a girl, {{just in time for}} Mr. Gold to pick up his [...] "merchandise." [...] Emma tells Mr. Gold <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was to take the child away, he could face legal {{troubles}} that could cost him dearly. Mr. Gold then offers a deal for Emma in which he'll give up his questionable claim to the child and in return, Emma will owe him a favor. Emma agrees. After she leaves, Sean shows up to see his child, and they name the girl Alexandra. Later, Emma agrees to Graham's offer to become his deputy. While on the phone, it is revealed that the sheriff had just gotten out of the shower at his home, just moments after he had a presumed sexual tryst with Regina.|$|E
500|$|Milo says {{goodbye and}} drives {{back through the}} tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens {{the next day with}} plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, [...] "For Milo, who now knows the way." [...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> found a way back, he might not have time to go, for {{there is so much to}} do right where he is.|$|E
50|$|He {{claimed his}} {{conversation}} with Postiglione had been coerced and his statements not made freely. Nor had he properly waived his right to counsel at <b>that</b> point. And <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had, he added, the conversations were largely settlement negotiations and thus inadmissible under Tennessee's rules of evidence.|$|R
50|$|Sassetti {{is often}} figured in the {{ultimate}} decline of the Medici bank. An early sign of the decline was the near-failure of the Lyon branch because of its manager's venality, which Sassetti saved—but as general manager, {{he should have been}} suspicious of the high profits the branch manager responsible (Lionetto de' Rossi) reported and checked the books before events had come to such a pass, especially since he was a partner in <b>that</b> branch, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was not in the others.|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} have {{answered}} <b>that</b> exhaustively, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would, for his actions had been as contradictory as his emotions. He had feared even while he exulted, and exulted when plunged deep in fears. There had been quite a procession of Tommies all through the night; {{one of them had}} been a very miserable man, and the only thing he had been sure of was that he must be true to Grizel. But in so far as he did answer he told the truth.|$|R
500|$|At {{a status}} hearing on July 14 (which Hastert again did not attend), the parties updated the court on {{preparations}} for trial. At the hearing, Green again condemned leaks, stating in court: [...] "The indictment has effectively been amended by leaks from the government. It {{is now an}} 800-pound gorilla in this case. It has been injected in this case I think impermissibly. (The question is) whether I wrestle with that gorilla or I don't wrestle with that gorilla." [...] Green {{also said that the}} defense would file a motion to dismiss the indictment, possibly under seal. Judge Durkin [...] "cautioned <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> allows part or all of the motion to be hidden from the public, his ruling would be public and likely would disclose sealed portions of the motion." [...] At the same hearing, the prosecution said that they expected a trial to last about two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Timicin's {{analysis}} of the failed test turns up some promising options, but if he follows through with the Resolution, no one will have his experience and knowledge to carry on his work to save his world. [...] Concerned, Timicin requests asylum on the Enterprise {{so that he can}} renounce the Resolution and continue his research. [...] B'Tardat (Terrence E. McNally), the Science Minister on Kaelon II, is outraged after learning of Timicin's request for asylum, and he sends up two warships to ensure that the Enterprise does not leave the system with Timicin on board. As Picard orders the bridge crew to analyze the offensive capabilities of the Kaelonian ships, Timicin realizes that his situation is not as simple as he had hoped, for his home planet will not accept any further reports from him, and he is told <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> does find a solution, they will not accept it.|$|E
500|$|Although Spivey was {{not found}} guilty in the scandal, he found himself blackballed from the NBA after league {{president}} Maurice Podoloff banned all 32 players involved in the CCNY scandal for life. The Cincinnati Royals later tried to sign Spivey, but Podoloff refused to approve the contract. Spivey {{filed a lawsuit against}} the NBA and Podoloff in 1960, seeking more than $800,000 in damages. Afterward, he claimed that his rights under the Sherman Antitrust Act had been violated and sued the league in federal court, dropping his initial case. In response, Podoloff offered to settle with Spivey for $10,000, which he accepted. According to sportswriter Jim Murray, Spivey felt that {{he had no choice but}} to accept because the court schedule was so full <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had won his case, he would have been too old to be a viable NBA prospect in any case. Future Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall said that [...] "most people feel [...] would have been one of the top five centers of all-time had he had the chance to mature in the NBA." [...] Instead, Spivey spent his professional career playing for numerous minor league and barnstorming teams.|$|E

It swells up after games and it normally takes seven days to recover but having played on Monday night he's had less time than usual. He rarely trains, he mostly just goes to the gym to keep himself ticking over. But not running or anything like <b>that.</b> But <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> only plays 20 games a season, he's worth having because he's so good we have a much better chance of winning." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{court found}} that on Sunday, December 31, 1961, there were {{substantial}} limitations or restrictions on Hornung’s control over the Corvette. [...] At that time, the car was physically {{in the state of}} New York, and {{the editor in chief of}} Sport Magazine had neither keys nor title to the vehicle to give to Hornung to establish his possession. [...] Additionally, because December 31, 1961 was a Sunday, the dealership where the car was kept was closed, and Hornung could not have accessed it on <b>that</b> date <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted to.|$|R
