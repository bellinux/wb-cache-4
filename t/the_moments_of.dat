The parallelism with Kant's categories is obvious: quantity (unity, plurality, totality), quality (reality, negation, limitation), relation (substance, cause, community) and modality (possibility, existence, necessity).|$|E

A {{new method}} for {{estimating}} <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia of engine generator set was proposed in this paper, which {{was defined as}} Governor Sensitivity Test Method (GSTM). In this method, <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia of engine generator set was estimated by means of measure transient speed change of engine generator set when the engine load increases suddenly. In the present, {{there have been some}} methods for estimating <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia of engine, such as, Additional Mass Method, Running Down Test Method and Accelerating- Decelerating Method Under No Load. These methods for estimating <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia of engine generator set all have shortcomings on accuracy or operability. These shortcomings have been overcome by using the GSTM method proposed in this paper. It is easy to operate, and the factors affecting estimation errors are small.

An example <b>of</b> calculating <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia of an engine generator set using the GSTM method was presented.
