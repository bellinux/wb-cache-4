The annual budget of British Columbia's Office to Combat <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>Persons</b> (OCTIP) was reduced by $200,000 a few months later. OCTIP was Canada's only provincial government agency responsible for coordinating efforts to address human trafficking. The federal government held a round table to determine {{the contents of the}} NAP-CHT. Carleen McGuinty, child protection specialist for the Christian NGO World Vision Canada, said at the discussion that the NAP-CHT should focus on the needs of children and that the plan should not emphasize child sexual abuse to the exclusion of addressing child labour. Smith said that she was confident that Harper would have her review the plan before it was established. The government consulted ACT Alberta, The Salvation Army, and the AAMS {{in the development of the}} plan.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the international efforts to combat <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>persons,</b> slavery and forced labour from 1937 to 1957, phenomena we today recognize as contemporary slavery. It describes and analyzes the processes of the respective matters, culminating in three separate conventions; two conventions within the United Nations and one within the International Labour Organization. In chapter one I introduce the matters, {{and put them into}} an international and historical context, and discuss existing literature, methodology and sources. In chapter two I elaborate on the origins of the matters, and how they came to be matters of international concern. In chapter three I look at the process of <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> and what characterised it, starting within the League of Nations, and ending within the United Nations in 1949, with an emphasis {{on the role of the}} UK. Additionally, I look at the role of two NGOs. In chapter four I write about the processes of slavery and forced labour, the reasons for why these matters became a matter of international concern within the United Nations and the International Labour Organization. This chapter is also written with an emphasis on the UK. In chapter five I gather the matters, and look at similarities and differences with the processes. I have found that the heritage of the League of Nations was important for all these matters, the matter of <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> particular. Moreover, I have found that there were considerable challenges in dealing with these matters within the international governmental organizations. Moreover, the reasons for why these matters were brought up were generally due to national interests. The UK and the rest of the colonial powers was mostly concerned about securing the colonial application clause, and to avoid attention to the various existing practices in its colonies. Additionally, there was a tendency that governments focused on the legal abolition rather than de facto abolition of the matters of <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>persons,</b> slavery and forced labour. Lastly, the Cold War influenced the processes of all these matters different ways...|$|R
