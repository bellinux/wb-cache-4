5|$|In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, {{and other}} {{civil rights activists}} founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> and {{organizing}} power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests {{in the service of}} civil rights reform. One of the group's inspirations was the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King after he attended a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience. Other civil rights leaders involved in the SCLC with King included: James Bevel, Allen Johnson, Curtis W. Harris, Walter E. Fauntroy, C. T. Vivian, Andrew Young, The Freedom Singers, Charles Evers, Cleveland Robinson, Randolph Blackwell, Annie Bell Robinson Devine, Charles Kenzie Steele, Alfred Daniel Williams King, Benjamin Hooks, Aaron Henry and Bayard Rustin.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the lane closings, the Port Authority's {{chairman}} David Samson was the subject of media reports alleging ethical violations and conflicts of interest. It was alleged that Samson's law firm and their clients profited from dealings with the Port Authority and from projects involving New Jersey government financing or tax incentives. It was also reported that Christie benefited politically and his allies benefited financially during Samson's term as chairman. Patrick Foye, the Port Authority's executive director, asserted that Samson lacked <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> to run the agency.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> of Barre's {{government}} was gradually eroded, as many Somalis became disillusioned with life under military rule. By the mid-1980s, resistance movements supported by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung {{up across the}} country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative centre of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988. The bombardment was led by General Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan, Barre's son-in-law.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{concept of}} <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> {{facilitates}} {{a deeper understanding}} of the fluid interconnections that exist between what are seemingly separate spheres of women’s lives. Importantly, <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> highlights <b>the</b> way in which agency, power, culture and meaning impact on the daily experience of life. This paper examines the gendered notions of <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> that protect women’s political spaces and identity. For women under colonial rule, <b>the</b> use of <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> provided not only a sense of personal power but also a method of confronting powerful menfolk and undermining the colonial regime. In exploiting the power that came from being a wife, or a mother, or via links with the spirit world, women confronted those who impinged on their rights and livelihoods. In present-day Kenya, does <b>the</b> use of <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> contribute to women’s agency and challenge notions of identity...|$|R

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Seljuq Turks in the late 11th century, Damascus again became the capital of {{independent}} states. It was ruled by Abu Sa'id Taj ad-Dawla Tutush I starting in 1079 and he was succeeded by his son Abu Nasr Duqaq in 1095. The Seljuqs established a court in Damascus and a systematic reversal of Shia inroads in the city. The city also saw an expansion of religious life through private endowments financing religious institutions (madrasas) and hospitals (maristans). Damascus soon {{became one of the most}} important centres of propagating Islamic thought in the Muslim world. After Duqaq's death in 1104, his mentor (atabeg), Toghtekin, took control of Damascus and the Burid line of the Seljuq dynasty. Under Duqaq and Toghtekin, Damascus experienced stability, elevated status and a revived role in commerce. In addition, the city's Sunni majority enjoyed being a part of the larger Sunni framework effectively governed by various Turkic dynasties who in turn were under <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> of the Baghdad-based Abbasids.|$|E
500|$|Despite Douglas' demure appearance—she {{stood at}} [...] and weighed , {{and was always}} immaculately dressed in pearls, a floppy straw hat and gloves—she had {{an uncanny ability to}} get her point across. She was known for {{speaking}} in perfect, precise paragraphs, and was respected for her dedication and knowledge of her subjects; even her critics admitted her authority on the Everglades. Jeff Klinkenberg, a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times who interviewed and wrote several stories about Douglas, wrote of her, [...] "She had a tongue like a switchblade and <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> to embarrass bureaucrats and politicians and make things happen." [...] Douglas was known for haughtily dismissing reporters who had not read her books and asked uninformed questions.|$|E
500|$|Because Stowe saw {{motherhood}} as the [...] "ethical {{and structural}} model {{for all of}} American life" [...] and also believed that only women had <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> to save the United States from the demon of slavery, another major theme of Uncle Tom's Cabin is the moral power and sanctity of women. Through characters like Eliza, who escapes from slavery to save her young son (and eventually reunites her entire family), or Eva, who {{is seen as the}} [...] "ideal Christian", Stowe shows how she believed women could save those around them from even the worst injustices. While later critics have noted that Stowe's female characters are often domestic clichés instead of realistic women, Stowe's novel [...] "reaffirmed the importance of women's influence" [...] and helped pave the way for the women's rights movement in the following decades.|$|E

500|$|With the Tyler-Upshur secret {{annexation}} {{negotiations with}} Texas near consummation, Senator Robert J. Walker of Mississippi, a key Tyler ally, issued a widely distributed and highly influential letter, reproduced as a pamphlet, {{making the case}} for immediate annexation. In it, Walker argued that Texas could be acquired by Congress {{in a number of ways}} – all constitutional – and that <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> to do so was based on the precepts for territorial expansion established by Jefferson and Madison, and [...] promulgated as doctrine by Monroe in 1823. Senator Walker's polemic offered analysis on the significance of Texas with respect to slavery and race. He envisioned Texas as a corridor through which both free and enslaved African-Americans could be [...] "diffused" [...] southward in a gradual exodus that would ultimately supply labor to the Central American tropics, and in time, empty the United States of its slave population.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} less positive reviews as well. Rahul Gairola of PopMatters wrote that while [...] "the pilot lays the usual groundwork by showing how the characters' lives are intertwined, it also demonstrates immediately the sitcom's major drawback, that the stereotypical gay character is the stand-out comic figure." [...] A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times said [...] "there's something {{not quite right}} about this show's approach to homosexuality... It {{has everything to do}} with Will's attitude. It approaches asexual, his gayness appearing to exist solely as a device to give him <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> to repeatedly ridicule the mincing manner of his bandanna-wearing homosexual friend, Jack, without being labeled homophobic." [...] Suite101.com's Hana Lewis thought it was [...] "regrettable" [...] that the pilot's jokes revolved [...] "solely around gay stereotypes and sexual innuendo". Some reviewers were also skeptical about the future of the show. [...] One such review said, [...] "If Will & Grace can somehow survive a brutal time period opposite football and Ally McBeal, it could grow into a reasonably entertaining little [...] — that is, a series about a man and a woman who have no sexual interest in one another. But don't bet on it. If it's a doomed relationships viewers want, they'll probably opt for Ally." ...|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin is {{dominated}} by a single theme: the evil and immorality of slavery. While Stowe weaves other subthemes throughout her text, such as <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> of motherhood and the redeeming possibilities offered by Christianity, she emphasizes the connections between these and the horrors of slavery. Stowe sometimes changed the story's voice so she could give a [...] "homily" [...] on the destructive nature of slavery (such as when a white woman on the steamboat carrying Tom further south states, [...] "The most dreadful part of slavery, to my mind, is its outrages of feelings and affections—the separating of families, for example."). One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery [...] was how this [...] "peculiar institution" [...] forcibly separated families from each other. One of the subthemes presented in the novel is temperance. Stowe made it somewhat subtle {{and in some cases}} she weaved it into events that would also support the dominant theme. One example of this is when Augustine St. Clare is killed, he attempted to stop a brawl between two inebriated men in a cafe and was stabbed. One other example is the death of the slave woman Prue who was whipped to death for being drunk on a consistent basis; however, her reasons for doing so is due to the loss of her baby. In the opening of the novel, the fates of Eliza and her son are being discussed between slave owners over wine. Considering that Stowe intended this to be a subtheme, this scene could foreshadow future events that put alcohol in a bad light.|$|E

50|$|<b>Moral</b> <b>{{authority}}</b> is authority {{premised on}} principles, or fundamental truths, which {{are independent of}} written, or positive, laws.

These principles, which can be of metaphysical and/or religious nature, are considered normative for behavior, whether they are or are not also embodied in written laws, {{and even if the}} community is ignoring or violating them.
