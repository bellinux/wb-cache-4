5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E
5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> within the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway.

Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. This {{study was}} done to {{determine}} colonic <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> in healthy Italian adults. Materials and methods. Institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were obtained. Colonic segmental radiopaque markers were counted and <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> calculated in 36 healthy subjects studied using a technique involving daily radiopaque marker ingestion and single radiological visit, with oral administration of 8 – 10 ml of a thick barium paste as a colonic trace for the marker count. Two independent radiologists counted the marker twice. Observer agreement was assessed using comparison analysis. Results. There was very good observer agreement for the segmental marker counts. The upper limit for colonic <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> was: 45. 6 h in the colon as a whole, 31. 2 h in the right colon, 19. 2 h in the left colon and 16. 8 h in the rectosigmoid. Colonic <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> were not genderrelated. Conclusions. In healthy subjects, a barium trace affords optimal visibility of the different colonic segments, enabling accurate location of all markers and thus providing an anatomy-related, repeatable and reproducible fluoroscopic segmental marker count. We suggest that the reference values for normal colonic <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> could be adopted for Italian people irrespective of gender...|$|R

40|$|Nutrient {{transport}} and productivity teleconnections with the Southern Ocean are diagnosed in a data-assimilated circulation model coupled to a jointly optimized simple phosphorus cycling model. The North Atlantic has the strongest extratropical teleconnections with the Southern Ocean: phosphate (PO 4) last utilized in the Southern Ocean sustains 29 [*]±[*] 6 % of the subpolar and 14 [*]±[*] 6 % of the subtropical, new {{production in the}} North Atlantic. A PO 4  path-density diagnostic shows that these teleconnections are mediated by thermocline paths and reveals that most paths to anywhere north of 40 °S lie in the deep Pacific. Forcing nearly complete Southern-Ocean nutrient utilization increases {{the overall number of}} paths to anywhere north of 40 °S, but reduces the number of paths from the Pacific to the North Atlantic by trapping nutrients in return paths to the Southern Ocean. At the same time, the mean export-to-uptake <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> to anywhere north of 40 °S increase, while the mean <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> to the North Atlantic decrease. Correspondingly, the amount of North-Atlantic production sustained by Southern-Ocean export increases in spite of decreased total production in response to Southern-Ocean nutrient trapping.

This study examined the spatiotemporal relationships between time series of weekly monitored stream and groundwater N and C (assessed by NO 3 − and dissolved organic C [DOC]) in the forested Wüstebach catchment (Germany). In addition to traditional correlation analysis, we applied wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analysis to study variations in the correlation and lag time between the N and C time series for different <b>time</b> scales. Median <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> were used to connect hydrologic and water chemistry data. We defined three stream-water groups: (i) subsurface runoff dominated locations with strong seasonal fluctuations in concentrations, short <b>transit</b> <b>times,</b> and strong negative C/N correlations with short time lags, (ii) groundwater dominated locations, with weaker seasonal fluctuations, longer <b>transit</b> <b>times,</b> and weaker C/N correlations with lags of several months, and (iii) intermediate locations, with moderate seasonal fluctuations, moderate <b>transit</b> <b>times,</b> and strong C/N correlations with short <b>time</b> lags.

Complemented by <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> and the hydrochemical time series, WTC analysis allowed us to discriminate between different water sources (groundwater vs. subsurface runoff).

40|$|Peatlands are a {{distinctive}} and {{important component of}} many upland regions that commonly contain distinctive flora and fauna which {{are different from those}} of adjacent forests and grasslands. Peatlands also represent a significant long-term store of organic carbon. While their environmental importance has long since been recognised, water <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> within peatlands are not well understood. This study uses tritium (3 H) to estimate the mean <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> of water from peatlands and from adjacent gullies that contain eucalypt forests in the Victorian Alps (Australia). The 3 H activities of the peatland water range from 2. 7 to 3. 3 tritium units (TUs), which overlap the measured (2. 9 to 3. 0  TU) and expected (2. 8 to 3. 2  TU) average 3 H activities of rainfall in this region. Even accounting for seasonal recharge by rainfall with higher 3 H activities, the mean <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> of the peatland waters are <  6. 5  years and may be less than 2  years. Water from adjacent eucalypt forest streams has 3 H activities of 1. 6 to 2. 1  TU, implying much longer mean <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> of 5 to 29  years. Cation ∕ Cl and Si ∕ Cl ratios are higher in the eucalypt forest streams than the peatland waters and both of these water stores have higher cation ∕ Cl and Si ∕ Cl ratios than rainfall. The major ion geochemistry reflects the degree of silicate weathering in these catchments that is controlled by both <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> and aquifer lithology. The short <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> imply that, unlike the eucalypt forests, the peatlands do not represent a long-lived store of water for the local river systems. Additionally, the peatlands are susceptible to drying out during drought, which renders them vulnerable to damage by the periodic bushfires that occur in this region...|$|R

40|$|Methods for {{estimating}} mean <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> from {{chemical or}} isotopic tracers (such as Cl −, δ 18 O, or δ 2 H) commonly assume that catchments are stationary (i. e., time-invariant) and homogeneous. Real catchments are neither. In a companion paper, I showed that catchment mean <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> estimated from seasonal tracer cycles are highly vulnerable to aggregation error, exhibiting strong bias and large scatter in spatially heterogeneous catchments. I proposed the young water fraction, which is virtually immune to aggregation error under spatial heterogeneity, as a better measure of <b>transit</b> <b>times.</b> Here I extend this analysis by exploring how nonstationarity affects mean <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> and young water fractions estimated from seasonal tracer cycles, using benchmark tests {{based on a}} simple two-box model. The model exhibits complex nonstationary behavior, with striking volatility in tracer concentrations, young water fractions, and mean <b>transit</b> <b>times,</b> driven by rapid shifts in the mixing ratios of fluxes from {{the upper and lower}} boxes. The transit-time distribution in streamflow becomes increasingly skewed at higher discharges, with marked increases in the young water fraction and decreases in the mean water age, reflecting the increased dominance of the upper box at higher flows. This simple two-box model exhibits strong equifinality, which can be partly resolved by simple parameter transformations. However, <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> are primarily determined by residual storage, which cannot be constrained through hydrograph calibration and must instead be estimated by tracer behavior. Seasonal tracer cycles in the two-box model are very poor predictors of mean <b>transit</b> <b>times,</b> with typical errors of several hundred percent. However, the same tracer cycles predict time-averaged young water fractions (F yw) within a few percent, even in model catchments that are both nonstationary and spatially heterogeneous (although they may be biased by roughly 0. 1 – 0. 2 at sites where strong precipitation seasonality is correlated with precipitation tracer concentrations). Flow-weighted fits to the seasonal tracer cycles accurately predict the flow-weighted average F yw in streamflow, while unweighted fits to the seasonal tracer cycles accurately predict the unweighted average F yw. Young water fractions can also be estimated separately for individual flow regimes, again with a precision of a few percent, allowing direct determination of how shifts in a catchment's hydraulic regime alter the fraction of water reaching the stream by fast flowpaths. One can also estimate the chemical composition of idealized "young water" and "old water" end-members, using relationships between young water fractions and solute concentrations across different flow regimes. These results demonstrate that mean <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> cannot be estimated reliably from seasonal tracer cycles and that, by contrast, the young water fraction is a robust and useful metric of <b>transit</b> <b>times,</b> even in catchments that exhibit strong nonstationarity and heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|In surface hydrology, much {{attention}} is paid to the effects of changing water fluxes, however there is less of a focus on the effects of changing energy fluxes. These energy fluxes are an important driver of many hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration and snow sublimation/ablation. The hypothesis that varying energy fluxes are important to the hydrological features of a catchment is tested by an experiment that involves calculating mean <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> for a number of catchments that drain different aspects of a large dome located in the Valles Caldera, New Mexico, called Redondo Peak. These catchments have different orientations and therefore receive different amounts of solar radiation. There is a general correlation between mean <b>transit</b> <b>times,</b> as determined by lumped-parameter convolution, and aspect, suggesting that in the Valles Caldera, <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> might be affected by a variety of features that are influenced by exposure to solar radiation, such as slope steepness, vegetation patterns, and soil depth. To put these <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> into context, I also used a distributed physically-based model to simulate a number of factors simultaneously to determine how hydrological features are influenced by aspect. This modeling excercise has illuminated the aspect-dependence of hydrological features such as the timing and intensity of snowmelt and soil moisture patterns, and it has quantified differences in energy and water fluxes on different aspects.
