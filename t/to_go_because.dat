25|$|Motivation for the United States {{to engage}} the Soviet Union in a Space Race {{can be traced to}} the then {{on-going}} Cold War. Landing on the Moon was viewed as a national and technological accomplishment that would generate world-wide acclaim. But going to the Moon would be risky and expensive, as exemplified by President John F. Kennedy famously stating in a 1962 speech that the United States chose <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>because</b> it was hard.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen {{scored a}} third-place podium finish {{in his first}} race with McLaren, the 2002 Australian Grand Prix. Although McLaren {{suffered}} many engine failures in 2002, Räikkönen scored 24 points and four podiums, and held his own against teammate David Coulthard. Räikkönen came close to winning his first Grand Prix in France but went off track at the Adelaide hairpin {{with a handful of}} laps <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>because</b> of oil from the blown engine of Allan McNish's Toyota on the circuit. He finished the race second. He finished the season in sixth place, one place behind his team mate. Together they achieved a solid third place for McLaren in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

500|$|During the [...] {{crossover}} storyline, Anole appears {{prominently in}} the three issue tie-in series X-Men: Hellbound. [...] In it, he joins a team of X-Men in rescuing Magik from Limbo after she is sent there by Bastion's forces. [...] Cannonball chooses Anole for the mission to provide moral support for Pixie, whose teleportation ability they require to travel to Limbo. [...] Anole and Pixie are extremely reluctant to risk themselves for Magik, who they believe does not deserve to be saved, but decide <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>because</b> they are heroes. [...] In Limbo, Anole fends off demons and bickers with Cannonball; he also takes out his teammate Dazzler when she is corrupted by Limbo's influence. [...] In the end, Pixie and Anole somewhat resolve their issues with Magik and the team return home.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} the battle, Vellaiyammal pleads with Vellaiyathevan not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>because</b> the {{previous}} night she had a nightmare, which was full of evil omens. Ignoring her entreaties, Vellaiyathevan sets out, and is killed in the ensuing battle. Vellaiyammal, on learning of his death, kills the man who killed him, avenging her husband's death. She finds Vellaiyathevan's corpse and, overcome by grief, dies on it. Bannerman's troops attack Panchalankurichi with heavy artillery and Kattabomman's army suffers badly. Kattabomman is wounded in the neck, but is saved by his brother, Oomaithurai. Sensing that the fort cannot survive another cannon barrage, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai flee to the adjoining kingdom of Kovilpatti. Pillai, disguising himself as Kattabomman, misleads the British soldiers who are on Kattabomman's trail. From Kovilpatti, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai flee to Pudukkottai.

500|$|This episode {{featured}} {{a lot of}} character development {{that many of the}} actors had been waiting for. Lana's jealousy over Clark and Chloe going to the prom begins to come out; although Kristin Kreuk believes that Lana {{does not want to be}} jealous, and wants to be able to support Clark with his newfound feelings for Chloe. According to Eric Johnson, Whitney finally gets to show a side of himself that Johnson wishes the audience would have been able to see sooner, as Whitney gives Lana a private dance before the prom knowing that she will not be able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>because</b> he is leaving town. To add further depth to his character not previously seen, Millar and Gough decided to send Whitney off to war, instead of killing the character outright. The idea of sending Whitney off to war was something that came to Millar and Gough midway through the season. They knew they did not want to kill him, because they wanted the ability to bring him back at some point in the future, so they came up with this [...] "noble, heroic, send-off" [...] for the character. For Lex, this episode featured the moment when he finally began to contemplate what his life would be like if his father was no longer a part of it. As Rosenbaum sees it, the moment that Lex hesitates to free his father from the support beam that collapses on him is the moment that the audience gets to see a hint of the evil man they know Lex will one day become. This is a brief moment where Lex forgets who he is, and if he had let his father die he would have certainly made his [...] "turn to the dark side".|$|E
2500|$|Following the Brazilians' narrow 1–0 quarter-final {{win against}} Wales on June 19, 1958, Mel Hopkins (the fullback who faced him that game) {{described}} Garrincha as [...] "a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic. It {{was difficult to}} know which way he was going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>because</b> of his legs {{and because he was}} as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too." ...|$|E

In February 2002, Wakefield stated, [...] "What precipitated this crisis was the removal of the single vaccine, the removal of choice, and that is what has caused the furore—because the doctors, the gurus, are treating the public as though they are some kind of moronic mass who cannot make an informed decision for themselves." ...|$|E

It is in this context that I now need your appraisal of the situation. If the prognosis in your judgment is not hopeful, I would like your views on what action must be taken by the South Vietnamese Government and what steps our Government should take to lead the Vietnamese to that action.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{goals to}} one adrift by half {{time in the}} reverse fixture at Burton Swifts, Small Heath [...] "never looked likely to get on even terms" [...] as they lost 6–3. A {{friendly}} visit to Wolverhampton Wanderers on a slippery surface was ended with 15 minutes still <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>because</b> of rain and poor visibility, with Wanderers 2–0 ahead. Although a Small Heath team weakened by injury beat Lincoln City 4–0, the Birmingham Daily Post suggested that [...] "if the forwards would learn to understand each other's movements and play a collective game, {{instead of trying to}} shine individually, the result would be a great deal more beneficial" [...] to the club. They finished September in second place in the Alliance, behind Nottingham Forest, who had won all four of their matches.|$|E
2500|$|Vangelis {{was born}} 29 March 1943, in Agria, near Volos, Greece. Largely a self-taught musician, he {{reportedly}} began composing {{at the age}} of three. His earliest memory is [...] "playing piano, some percussion and whatever else that was available that made a noise. Right from the start, I was only interested in playing my own music". He refused to take traditional piano lessons, and throughout his career did not have substantial knowledge of reading or writing musical notation. When he was six, Vangelis's parents enrolled him at a specialist music school in Athens. He recalls [...] "I was lucky not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>because</b> music schools close doors rather than open them". He studied painting, an art he still practices, at the Athens School of Fine Arts. Vangelis {{said in an interview with}} Life, when asked about his lack of ability to read music: ...|$|E

2500|$|Model persuaded Jodl {{that the}} {{deadline}} was unrealistic, and on 2 December he and Westphal went to Berlin to argue their case with Hitler. Rundstedt refused <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>because,</b> he said, he hated listening to Hitler's monologues. This marked his effective abdication {{as a military}} leader: he was now only a figurehead, and apparently content to be so. After the war he disowned all responsibility for the offensive: [...] "If old von Moltke thought that I had planned that offensive he would have turned over in his grave." [...] Hitler arrived {{on the western front}} on 10 December to supervise the offensive, which was now set for 16 December. He gave orders directly to the army commanders, bypassing both Rundstedt and Model. Manteuffel said: [...] "The plan for the Ardennes offensive was drawn up completely by OKW and sent to us as a cut-and-dried Führer order." ...|$|E

Sportin' Life waltzes around selling [...] "happy dust", but soon incurs the wrath of Maria, who threatens him. ("I hates yo' struttin' style"). A fraudulent lawyer, Frazier, arrives and farcically divorces Bess from Crown. When he discovers Bess and Crown were not married, he raises his price from a dollar to a dollar and a half. Archdale, a white lawyer, enters and informs Porgy that Peter will soon be released. The bad omen of a buzzard flies over Catfish Row and Porgy demands that it leave now that he finally has found happiness. ("Buzzard keep on flyin' over".) ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 19, 1995, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was {{the target}} of a {{terrorist}} bombing that left 168 people dead. One of the people who died in the attack was Al Whicher, who had served on George H. W. Bush's Secret Security Detail. Bush called the man who served under her husband, [...] "a devoted husband and father." [...] The next day, April 20, 1995, the Bushes were scheduled to go to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Barbara was supposed to speak at a Junior League event in the noon and accompany her husband at the Salvation Army annual dinner. The Bushes debated whether or not they should continue with their plans due to the bombing, ultimately deciding <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>because</b> [...] "both groups help people in need." [...] On September 3, 1995, the Bushes went to Vietnam. This was [...] "unbelievable" [...] to Barbara because she [...] "never expected to set foot in what had been North Vietnam." [...] The Bushes first went to Hanoi and then to Ho Chi Minh City. The Bushes met with President Lê Đức Anh and party secretary Đỗ Mười. On September 28, 1995, the Bushes drove to Portland, Maine for the announcement of the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital. Bush said her life was being stretched, adding, [...] "Long after I am gone this hospital will be there with my name." [...] The Bushes visited the children there, and Mrs. Bush started to recall her daughter Robin after seeing them. The Bushes returned home early that month.|$|E

2500|$|The Dodgers {{lost their}} sixth {{straight}} game when Chris Johnson hit a three-run home run off Ted Lilly {{in the sixth}} inning for a 3–2 victory for the Houston Astros, in the opener of a four-game series. The Dodgers snapped the losing streak the following night when Jay Gibbons hit a two-run homer in the 11th inning to give the Dodgers a 4–2 victory. The Dodgers won again the next day, 6–3, the winning runs scoring on a throwing error by Brandon Lyon. Carlos Monasterios made an emergency start in {{the final game of}} the series after [...] Vicente Padilla was unable <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>because</b> of a recurring injury. However, Monasterios was unable {{to get out of the}} second inning as the Dodgers fell behind early. Jay Gibbons hit a three-run homer in the fourth to help bring the team close, but they lost 7–4. The Dodgers managed only one hit in the opening game of a three-game series at San Francisco, but still beat the Giants 1–0 thanks to Clayton Kershaw's first career complete game shutout. The next night, Chad Billingsley almost matched Kershaw, allowing only a broken-bat RBI single in seven innings, but the team lost 2–1 as Matt Cain pitched seven scoreless innings and the Dodgers were unable to score until Andre Ethier's two-out home run in the ninth. In the finale, Ted Lilly gave up two homers in 3 innings as the Dodgers were blown out 10–2. The only positive for the Dodgers in the game was that September callup Russ Mitchell recorded his first career hit, a home run to left field off of Giants starter Jonathan Sánchez in the 5th inning.|$|E
