Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{proposes a}} fast-convergence scheme to update metrics without loop in Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) networks. In OSPF networks, while {{updating}} the metrics {{to improve the}} routing performance, packets may be routed in a loop in transient states. This results in packet loss and inefficiency in network resources. To avoid transient loops, a conventional scheme gives priority to each router to update metrics. When the updated metrics include both larger and smaller values <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> update, it requires two updating processes, each of which contains either larger or smaller values. It takes time to converge to update all the metrics in the conventional scheme.

40|$|In {{this essay}} I have studied Aftonbladets {{portrayal}} of the Swedish businessman Jan Stenbeck and if the reporting changes before and after his death, and if so, in which ways. With help from a qualitative syntax analysis and a content analysis I studied my material about Stenbeck during the time period 2000 - 09 - 19 to 2004 - 09 - 19. In my quantitative analysis I studied 140 articles and in my syntax analysis I studied ten articles, five before and five after Stenbecks death. The theoretical perspectives that I applied in my study is Sigurd Allerns theory about tabloid papers novelty criteria and Adam Shehatas theory about Framing. Allerns theory describes what criteria the tabloid papers have on news and Shehatas theory about framing describes the political forces behind the news who wants to set their own agenda. The results from my quantitative study {{show that there is}} more sensational news about Stenbeck after his death rather <b>than</b> before. <b>The</b> news before his death was mostly about Stenbecks work. In the results from my qualitative analysis I found that the content among the articles after Stenbecks death were more negative <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>before</b> he’s death. This is partly due to the ideological standpoints that the authors of the articles take.

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} adaptive {{leadership in}} relation to personnel sickness absence (SA). In situational leadership, supervisors are effective if they adapt their leadership style appropriately to a given situation. Methods A managerial reorganization in a Dutch hospital with reassignment of supervisors provided the opportunity to compare SA in the same wards while {{under the leadership of}} different supervisors. Leadership effectiveness was measured with the Leader Effectiveness and Adaptability Description (LEAD). Personnel SA was retrieved from employer's records and cumulated at the individual level, distinguishing between short-term (1 - 7 day) and long-term (> 7 days) SA. Cumulated SA days and mean SA lengths before and after managerial reorganization were compared at the individual level by using non-parametric paired statistical analyses. Employer's costs to compensate sick-listed employees' salaries before and after reorganization were cumulated and compared at ward level by using non-parametric statistics. Results 6 wards (N = 403) retained the same supervisor, 6 wards (N = 504) were assigned more effective supervisors, and 4 wards (N = 184) got less effective supervisors <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>before</b> reorganization. Cumulated short-term SA days and lengths did not change with leadership effectiveness. Employees who got more effective supervisors had fewer long-term SA days and shorter long-term SA lengths than before reorganization. More effective supervisors saved an average of 21, 368 Euros per ward, particularly due to less long-term SA. Conclusions Long-term SA was shorter after employees got more effective supervisors. Adaptive supervisors can facilitate return to work and save SA costs by providing the right type of support to sick-listed employees. ...|$|R
