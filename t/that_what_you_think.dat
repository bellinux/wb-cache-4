2500|$|Giles and O'Keefe {{have been}} criticized for {{accuracy}} problems. Their videos include the oft-repeated conservative claim that ACORN is expected to get up to $8.5 billion in government funds. But that's a bold exaggeration, as it includes $3 billion in stimulus funds set aside for revitalization efforts nationwide, and $5.5 billion in federal community development grants.The more than $8 billion number was based on the false assumption that ACORN would apply for and win every project and grant in the country, and in fact ACORN did not apply for any of the stimulus funds. Leonnig also observed:the videos, in some cases, left out what I would call some exculpatory material ... for example, in one, a San Bernadino employee at ACORN explains {{that there is no way}} ACORN would support what the couple were proposing, and she asks if they are putting her on, candid-camera style.During a September 14 television appearance on FOX, O'Keefe appeared dressed in a fur coat, sunglasses, and holding a cane. The host announced: [...] " [...] is dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore to these ACORN offices up and down the eastern seaboard." [...] He asked, [...] "s <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a pimp looks like?" [...] O'Keefe answered yes. Within weeks, political journalist Mike Stark revealed that O'Keefe did not wear such clothing to the ACORN offices, but rather he wore subdued clothing and a tie, and in one instance posed as a candidate for Congress. Stark said, [...] "If they really wanted the truth out there, why do they need to edit these tapes in the first place? Why aren't the unedited videos already in the public domain?" ...|$|E

[...] She turned upon him smiling, and he {{perceived}} that in her New York version of a Parisian costume, with her lace hat of summer make and texture and the vivid parasol she twirled upon her shoulder, she {{was not only a}} very pretty girl, but a fashionable one. There was something touching in the fact, and a little bewildering. To the pretty girl, the fashionable girl, he could have answered with a joke, but the stricken intelligence had a claim to his seriousness. Now, especially, he noted what had from time to time urged itself upon his perception. If the broken ties which once bound her to the past were beginning to knit again, her recovery otherwise was not apparent. As she stood there her beauty had signally the distinction of fragility, the delicacy of shattered nerves in which there was yet no visible return to strength. A feeling, which had intimated itself before, a sense as of being {{in the presence of a}} disembodied spirit, possessed him, and brought, in its contradiction of an accepted theory, a suggestion that was destined to become conviction. He had always said to himself that there could be no persistence of personality, of character, of identity, of consciousness, except through memory; yet here, to the last implication of temperament, they all persisted. The soul that was passing in its integrity through time without the helps, the crutches, of remembrance by which his own personality supported itself, why should not it pass so through eternity without that loss of identity which was equivalent to annihilation? ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "National Anthem" [...] was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler in May 2012. It premiered on June 27, 2012.

Because when you say 'Kennedy,' that immediately evokes something, just like when I say 'It's a Romeo and Juliet story.'

Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than <b>that</b> ... <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> is going to happen is not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind {{despite the fact that she}} had moved on.|$|E

This one won the Caldecott and Greenaway Medals, from the American and British professional librarians respectively. The Caldecott annually recognizes the illustrator of the previous year's [...] "most distinguished American picture book for children". According to the award committee, [...] "With minute changes in eyes and the slightest displacement of seagrass, Klassen's masterful illustrations tell the story the narrator doesn't know." [...] The Greenaway recognizes [...] "distinguished illustration in a book for children", not necessarily a picture book. According to the British judges, [...] "The format and layout work perfectly to convey the underwater location with the movement of the action flowing with the water from left to right. ... The juxtaposition of text and image works with perfect comic timing. Amazing expression is conveyed by the eyes and dramatic tension by little bubbles." [...] The Greenaway is paired in a London announcement and presentation ceremony with the Carnegie Medal for children's literature, which recognized a controversially grim young-adult novel in 2014. According to the press release, [...] "both winners independently argued that children benefit from stories without happy endings." [...] Klassen said in his acceptance speech, [...] "Making a book, you're kind of going out on a limb in the belief <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of as a satisfying story is the same as what other people think of as a satisfying story. This doesn't mean everything in the story turns out alright for everybody, but you, as a storyteller, try and make sure it ends the way the story should end." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} three questions: (1) When {{deciding on}} whether to reward or punish someone, how does how you think others expect you to behave affect your decision? (2) Does it depend upon whether others expect you to reward them vs. punish them? (3) What is the interpretation of such a causal effect? We investigate these questions using a modification of the lost wallet trust game (Dufwenberg and Gneezy (2000)) that permits punishment. Like previous studies, we collect data on what second- movers think that first-movers expect them to do by directly eliciting the second-moversÕ expectations. Unlike previous studies, we ensure exogeneity of these expectations by instrumenting for them. The instrument is the expectations of neutral observers which are disclosed to second-movers prior to the elicitation of second-moversÕ expectations. We find <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> others expect you to do has a zero causal effect on both reward and punishment decisions. We also find {{that it is important}} to instrument for second-order expectations because they are endogenous. We interpret these findings in terms of models of guilt-aversion and intentional reciprocity. behavioral confirmation, guilt, intentions, reciprocity, reward, punishment...|$|E
40|$|There 2 ̆ 7 s {{a concept}} I find myself {{coming back to}} again and again— 2 ̆ 2 speciation. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s drawn from the {{vocabulary}} of evolutionary biology and means, roughly, {{the process by which}} new species arise. Speciation occurs when a species must adapt to new circumstances; the more new circumstances, the more new species. Thus one kind of Finch (to take a relevant example) becomes many kinds of Finches when those Finches are compelled to adapt to the circumstances presented by, say, a set of different Islands. To each Island its own Finch. The same process occurs in human history though we don 2 ̆ 7 t really have a name for it (though 2 ̆ 2 ethnogenesis 2 ̆ 2 comes close). When people of one culture spread to many different locales, their cultures 2 ̆ 2 speciate, 2 ̆ 2 that is, become adapted to those new locales and thereby differentiate from the 2 ̆ 2 parent 2 ̆ 2 culture. This process can be very striking in places places where lots of different locales (however defined) are packed into a tiny geographic area. So it is in the Caucasus. Its geography is remarkably diverse, the result being a plethora of what are (to continue the analogy) separate ecological islands. As people moved from island to island, they speciated: their cultures adapted to local conditions and differentiated. To each island its own culture. This is why the Caucasus, though small, is so remarkably complex: it presents huge variety in a small space. And it is this complexity, together {{with the fact that the}} Caucusus stands at the nexus of three major empires (the Persian, Turkish, and Russian), that make its story so complicated. There are just a lot of moving parts in the 2 ̆ 2 system. 2 ̆ 2 Happily, we have Charles King to help us make sense of it all. In The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus (Oxford, 2008), he draws together the many threads of Caucasian history into one rich, dense, though supple cloth. Much of the considerable beauty of this book is found precisely in Charles 2 ̆ 7 ability to weave many complicated themes into one easy-to-follow story, and all in artful but not arty prose. This is a book you can read. Charles also pays considerable attention to the imaginary Caucusus, that is, the one that lived in the heads of the Persian, Turkish, and Russia imperialists who dominated the place for centuries, and the one that, at least in my case, continues to lead and mislead today. Suffice it to say <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you know about the Caucusus, you probably don 2 ̆ 7 t. So I suggest you pick up this book and let Charles remove the scales from your eyes. It 2 ̆ 7 s an enjoyable experience...|$|E

That they should take up arms against these cruel tyrants, even if they had no chance of beating them, is what we all agree would be right and natural; but when the mob of Antwerp broke into the cathedral, and destroyed the altars and carvings, and tore up the vestments, and threw down the Manes and the saints, and then did the same in the other churches in the town and in the country round, they behaved worse than children, and showed themselves as intolerant and bigoted as the Spaniards themselves.
