5|$|Victoria was, however, less {{enthusiastic}} about fulfilling her public role. She avoided answering letters, put off visits to elderly relations whose company {{she did not}} enjoy, and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring. Victoria's inattention to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst. The young couple had loud, physical fights. The volatile Victoria shouted, threw tea trays, smashed china against the wall, and tossed anything that was handy at Ernst during their arguments. Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard-to-control stallion named Bogdan. While she was in Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II, Victoria's affection for Kirill was also rekindled. She enjoyed flirting {{with him at the}} balls and celebrations that marked the coronation.|$|E

The crew also <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> who knew Milk to shape their approach to the era.|$|E
25|$|One {{informant}} who {{was close}} to DeStefano described him as a highly emotional, temperamental individual, extremely egotistical and concerned with his personal appearance. The walls of his home were lined with mirrors and as DeStefano <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> he continually watched his reflection in those mirrors as he walked across the room. He was described as being of such a temperament {{that he could be}} crying at one moment and laughing the very next. DeStefano would often state if he had not been framed for rape at age 17, he would have been the president of the United States.|$|E

25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

A soldier who {{agreed with the}} coup {{although}} he said it wasn't democratic said [...] "I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> protesting against Thaksin Shinawatra who said they could do anything and would sacrifice their lives. If that happened—and officers had to suppress the chaos—the loss would be greater". He added, [...] "We have our own democracy. We are all under His Majesty the King and people still {{have faith in the}} monarch. The military has a duty to protect the country, the religion and the King." ...|$|E
2500|$|When some of {{the iconic}} hills were asphalted, cycling fans and {{organizers}} were alarmed by the disappearance of cobbles. Organizer Van Wijnendaele could no longer rely {{on many of the}} traditional roads as they were not difficult enough. His staff began searching for alleys and footpaths in maps and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> in bars who knew the local roads. [...] "It was either that or risk the race ending in a mass sprint, and that's the last thing organizers wanted," [...] said Van Laere. Most back roads {{happened to be in the}} low hills between Ronse and Geraardsbergen, the region that became the heart of the race.|$|E

2500|$|In 1961 and 1962, Finley <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> in Dallas-Fort Worth and a four-man group {{appeared}} before American League owners, but no formal motion was put forward {{to move the}} team to Texas. In January 1964, he signed an agreement to move the A's to Louisville, promising to change the team's name to the [...] "Kentucky Athletics". (Other names suggested for the team were the [...] "Louisville Sluggers" [...] and [...] "Kentucky Colonels", which would have allowed the team to keep the letters [...] "KC" [...] on their uniforms.) The owners turned it down by a 9-1 margin, with Finley being the only one voting in favor. Six weeks later, by the same 9–1 margin, the A.L. owners denied Finley's request to move the team to Oakland.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley saw {{the flag}} raising(s) as an {{insignificant}} event in a devastating battle. He rarely <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> {{about it and}} {{spent most of his life}} trying to escape the attention he drew from allegedly raising it. He stated once that he [...] "just happened to be there". He spoke to his wife once about the flag raising during their 47-year marriage. That was on their first date, and he seemed very uninterested with it during the conversation. His daughter Barbara said that “Reading a book on Iwo Jima at home would have been like reading a playgirl magazine…it would have been something I had to hide.” He told his children more than once that the only real heroes on Iwo Jima were those that did not survive.|$|E
2500|$|This {{interest}} in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge means {{you have to take the}} time to sit down and educate. When you are able to communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it makes all the difference. My gift happens to be singing. When you go to an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's what was so great about that program." ...|$|E

60|$|The Clyde part of {{the affair}} seemed very simple; as his party would of course have their own table Clyde would see his sister at every meal, and as Corona did not care to talk to him, and must talk to somebody, she would be {{compelled}} to talk to Clyde, and if she talked to Clyde {{and looked at him}} as she always did when she <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people,</b> he did not see how he could help being attracted by her, and when once that sort of thing began the Margery-field would be open to him.|$|E

60|$|We had {{a pretty}} dull time on that tug. There wasn't {{a great deal of}} talking, but there was lots of thinking, and not a very {{pleasant}} kind of thinking either. We stopped quite often and hailed small boats, and the captain <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> whenever he had a chance, but he never heard anything about any boats having run ashore on any of the islands, or having come into the inside passage, between any of them. We met a few sailing vessels, and toward the close of the afternoon we met a big steamer, something like northern river steamers. The captain said she ran between the St. John's River and Savannah, and always took the inside passage as far as she could. He said this as if it showed him to be in the right in taking the same passage, but I couldn't see that it proved anything. We were on a different business.|$|E
