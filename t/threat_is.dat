5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian {{adopted a}} policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian's Wall, which separated the Roman world from {{what was perceived as}} an ever-present barbarian <b>threat,</b> <b>is</b> the primary surviving monument of this effort.|$|E
5|$|Bohor reedbuck {{are active}} {{throughout}} the day, seeking cover during the daytime and grazing in the night. A {{large proportion of}} the whole day is spent on feeding and vigilance. They can easily camouflage in grasses and reeds, and hide themselves rather than running from danger. When threatened, they usually remain motionless or retreat slowly into cover for defense, but if the <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> close, they flee, whistling shrilly to alert the others. It hides from predators rather than forming herds in defense. Many predators, including lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, African wild dogs and Nile crocodiles, prey on the reedbuck.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E

5|$|The American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is also {{native to}} the region and has been {{designated}} as endangered since 1975. Unlike their relatives the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such as estuarine or marine coasts. Their most significant <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> disturbance by people. Too much contact with humans causes females to abandon their nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories and attempting to cross U.S. 1 and Card Sound Road in the Florida Keys. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000crocodiles in southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|The SSSI is {{economically}} {{important to}} the area because of the tourists it attracts for birdwatching and other outdoor activities, although sensitive wildlife sites are managed to avoid damage from {{the large numbers of}} visitors. Another <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> the encroachment of the sea on this soft coast. The Environment Agency considers that managed retreat {{is likely to be the}} long-term solution, and is working with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust to create new reserves inland to compensate for the loss of scarce habitats at the coast.|$|E
5|$|Where {{medicinal}} plants are harvested {{from the wild}} rather than cultivated, {{they are subject to}} both general and specific threats. General threats include climate change and habitat loss to development and agriculture. A specific <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> over-collection to meet rising demand for medicines. A case in point was the pressure on wild populations of the Pacific yew soon after news of taxol's effectiveness became public. The threats could be addressed by cultivation of some {{medicinal plants}}, or by a system of certification to make wild harvesting sustainable.|$|E

Our analysis surprisingly justifies the early timing of threats as suggested by Nash (1953). ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Threats</b> against psychiatrists <b>are</b> common, but {{existing}} {{studies on}} the subject lack descriptive information {{about the nature and}} resolution of the threat.

5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in one of}} Eorzea's {{three main}} states, the player {{character}} awakes to the Echo, a power granting them {{the ability to see}} the past. The Adventurers are initially involved in both conflicts within the nations provoked by the Garlean pretense, led by the Garlean Legatus Gaius Van Baelsar, and the Beastmen's attempts to summon their Primals and their consequent hoarding of crystal supplies. Eventually, a greater <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> {{brought to the attention of}} the nations by the Sharlayan scholar Louisoix Leveilleur: another Garlean Legatus named Nael Van Darnus is using arcane magic and technology to summon Dalamud, the planet's second moon, down on Eorzea to purge the Beastmen and Primals. With the aid of Garlean defector Cid nan Garlond, the Adventurers discover that Nael has set up a beacon for summoning Dalamud in the new fortress of Castrum Novum. While each nation makes individual attempts to storm the fortress, they are repelled. Faced with this, their leaders form a pact and unite the nations under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Riverhillsoft {{released}} the first fully 3D survival horror game, Doctor Hauzer, for the 3DO. Both the player {{character and the}} environment are rendered entirely in polygons, while allowing the player to switch the view between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and overhead view. In a departure from most other survival horror games before and after it, Doctor Hauzer lacks any enemies; the main <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house's traps and solve puzzles. It also uses background music that heightens tension and changes depending on the situation, {{and the sound of}} the player character's echoing footsteps can change depending on the surface; these would later be used in Resident Evil. The game is today considered a formative step in the creation of the survival horror genre, improving on Alone in the Dark.|$|E

5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E
5|$|One Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack! was {{produced}} by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by Gorō Taniguchi. Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> made to kill all the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are forced to fight Ganzack once more {{to prevent him from}} destroying the island.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} yellow {{stingray}} under Least Concern, citing its wide distribution and high abundance in certain regions. In addition, its small size implies relatively high productivity, {{which would make}} its population more resilient to fishing pressure. This species is not targeted commercially, but is probably taken incidentally by inshore fisheries throughout its range. It is also harvested for the home aquarium trade, being the most frequently available member of its family on the North American market. The extent of this trade {{has not yet been}} quantified. Another potential <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> habitat degradation, particularly to seagrass beds. No conservation measures have been enacted for this species.|$|E
40|$|Effective {{management}} of anthropogenic <b>threats</b> <b>is</b> key to sustaining biological diversity in protected areas. Types {{and distribution of}} threats to Bwindi ImpenetrableNationalPark,Ugandawere investigated to assess thePark’s status 12 {{years after it was}} upgraded from a forest reserve to a national park. Bwindi, like many tropical forested parks, is surrounded by dense human populations. <b>Threats</b> <b>were</b> quantified in 104 1 -km edge-interior transects set around the Park. The distribution of <b>threats</b> <b>was</b> patchy and was most common within 300 – 350 m of the edge. The commonest <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> harvesting of wood and poles. Other threats included occurrence of exotic species, degradation of adjacent habitat fragments and high impact of problem animals on some of the neighbouring communities. The fact that <b>threats</b> <b>were</b> primarily associated with the edges of the Park, when previously they were widespread throughout the Park, suggests that illegal resource harvesting has been reduced since the forest was upgraded to a national park. Park legislation, enforcement and related conservation efforts have been effective, and there should be increased effort to manage the people-park interface. Edge-based assessments appear to be useful for quantifying threats to protected areas and identifying areas in which they are concentrated...|$|R

5|$|The cheetah is {{threatened}} by habitat loss through agricultural and industrial expansion; moreover, the animal apparently requires a large area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. The cheetah appears to be less capable than the leopard of coexisting with humans. As such, human interference can disturb the activities, such as hunting and feeding, of cheetah. With 76% of their range consisting of unprotected land, the cheetah are often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock. However, cheetahs typically do not prefer livestock for prey. Game hunters may also try to harm cheetah as these carnivores can deprive them of valuable game. Roadkill can be another threat, especially in areas where roads have been constructed near the natural habitat or protected areas. Cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from Kalmand, Tūrān, and Bafq. The <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> posed by infectious diseases is minor, given the low population densities and hence the minimal chance of infection.|$|E

White refuses to allow Blue to join the ground forces that are being mobilised to locate Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Although still {{abundant}} at Cocos Island {{and other}} relatively pristine sites, grey reef sharks {{are susceptible to}} localized depletion due to their slow reproductive rate, specific habitat requirements, and tendency to stay within a certain area. The IUCN has assessed the grey reef shark as Near Threatened; this shark is taken by multispecies fisheries {{in many parts of}} its range and used for various products such as shark fin soup and fishmeal. Another <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> the continuing degradation of coral reefs from human development. There is evidence of substantial declines in some populations. Anderson et al. (1998) reported, in the Chagos Archipelago, grey reef shark numbers in 1996 had fallen to 14% of 1970s levels. Robbins et al. (2006) found grey reef shark populations in Great Barrier Reef fishing zones had declined by 97% compared to no-entry zones (boats are not allowed). In addition, no-take zones (boats are allowed but fishing is prohibited) had the same levels of depletion as fishing zones, illustrating the severe effect of poaching. Projections suggested the shark population would fall to 0.1% of pre-exploitation levels within 20 years without additional conservation measures. One possible avenue for conservation is ecotourism, as grey reef sharks are suitable for shark-watching ventures, and profitable diving sites now enjoy protection in many countries, such as the Maldives.|$|E
