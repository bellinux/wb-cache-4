2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by.</b> When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E

60|$|Last {{came the}} Western King, quite alone (save {{for the two}} Queens), bearing in his hand the vellum scroll, the record of his arbitration. This he {{proceeded}} to read, a polyglot copy of it having been already supplied to every Monarch, Ambassador, and official present. It was a long statement, but the occasion was so stupendous--so intense--that the <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> quickly. The cheering had ceased the moment the Arbitrator opened the scroll, and a veritable silence of the grave abounded.|$|E
60|$|After the mishap at {{the races}} {{on the ice}} the <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> swiftly until the Christmas holidays. Before going home for Christmas Dick called upon the Stanhopes and gave them the gifts he had purchased, over which they were much pleased. For Dick Dora had worked a pretty scarf, {{of which he was}} justly proud. Mrs. Stanhope had books for all the boys, {{something}} which was always to their liking. The Rovers did not forget the Lanings, nor were they forgotten by these old friends.|$|E

60|$|That fall Jim Blake {{sold his}} farm, {{and took his}} family to New Mexico. He had not been prospering in the valley, and things had gone from bad to worse. Pan did not get home in time to say good-by to Lucy--something that hurt in an indefinable way. He had not {{forgotten}} Lucy for in his mind {{she had become a}} steadfast factor in his home life. She left a little note of farewell, simple and loyal, hopeful, yet somehow stultified. Not so childish as former notes! <b>Time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> and Lucy might be growing up.|$|E
60|$|At any rate, the <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by,</b> {{the trip}} seemed short, {{and soon he}} was on the Georgetown field. It was lucky that he arrived early and got a seat {{in the middle of the}} grand-stand, for there was a throng in {{attendance}} when the players came on the diamond. The noisy bleachers, the merry laughter, the flashing colors, and especially the bright gowns and pretty faces of the girls gave Ken pleasurable consciousness of what it would mean to play before such a crowd. At Wayne he had pitched to empty seats. Remembering Worry's prophecy, however, he was content to wait.|$|E
60|$|After Ebony's dream {{had been}} {{thoroughly}} discussed {{in all its}} bearings, and viewed in every possible point of relation to their great sorrow, the council adjourned, as usual, to various duties about the flourishing little village, and Orlando went to lay the result before his mother, who, although she could not believe these deliberations would end in anything practical, found it impossible, nevertheless, to resist the influence of so much faith and strong hopefulness, so that she was somewhat comforted, as it were, in spite of herself. <b>Time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by,</b> and upwards of three years elapsed without anything happening at Ratinga Island to throw a single ray {{of light on the}} fate of the lost man.|$|E
25|$|The Vietnamese side {{also claims}} another kill {{to have taken}} place on 28 December 1972 by a MiG-21 from the 921st FR, this <b>time</b> <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> Vu Xuan Thieu. Thieu is said to have perished in the {{explosion}} of a B-52 hit by his own missiles, having approached the target too closely. In this case the Vietnamese version appears to be erroneous: while one MiG-21 kill was claimed by Phantoms that night (this may have been Thieu's MiG), no B-52s were lost to any cause on the date of the claimed kill.|$|R
5000|$|In The Secret Pulse of Time (2006), Klein {{explored}} the human capacity to perceive time. It describes most people's constant difficulties in dealing efficiently with {{time as a}} consequence of the brain's organisation: Awareness for time and the ability to follow one's plans are functions of highly evolved and vulnerable cognitive mechanisms. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a German national newspaper, characterized this book as 'a protest against the deeply unfair fact that memorable <b>time</b> <b>flies</b> <b>by</b> whereas unbearable <b>time</b> stumbles'.

60|$|There was not {{a moment}} to be lost, the <b>time</b> had <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> terribly fast, and terrible had been the effort to speak quietly and collectively when every pulse throbbed with {{excitement}} and impatience; but she had the secret at last.|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} two seamen, whom people soon found out, were named {{respectively}} Jo and Dick, wrought in the wright's workshop, and at {{all kinds of}} miscellaneous jobs; besides making frequent and sometimes long voyages in their boat to the neighbouring islands. As <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> things seemed to prosper with the merchant. The keel of a little schooner was laid. Father, and son, and seamen (as well as the native servant, who was called Jako) toiled at this vessel incessantly until she was finished--then, Henry was placed in command of her, Jo and Dick were appointed first and second mates, two or three natives completed the crew, {{and she went to}} sea under the somewhat peculiar name of the Avenger.|$|E
60|$|Such {{appearing}} to be the decision of him to whom all, in their present strait, looked up for counsel, no more was said on the subject. The whole party now broke up into groups: Arrowhead and his wife sitting apart under the bushes, conversing in a low tone, though the man spoke sternly, and the woman answered with the subdued mildness that marks the degraded condition of a savage's wife. Pathfinder and Cap occupied one canoe, chatting of their different adventures by sea and land; while Jasper and Mabel sat in the other, making greater progress in intimacy in a single hour than might have been effected under other circumstances in a twelvemonth. Notwithstanding their situation as regards the enemy, the <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> swiftly, and the young people, in particular, were astonished when Cap informed them how long they had been thus occupied.|$|E
60|$|Swiftly now, indeed, the <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> {{until it}} was the evening before the day {{appointed}} for the marriage. They were all assembled in the upper room at the Midshipman's, and had no fear of interruption; for there were no lodgers in the house now, and the Midshipman had it all to himself. They were grave and quiet in the prospect of to-morrow, but moderately cheerful too. Florence, with Walter close beside her, was finishing {{a little piece of}} work intended as a parting gift to the Captain. The Captain was playing cribbage with Mr Toots. Mr Toots was taking counsel as to his hand, of Susan Nipper. Miss Nipper was giving it, with all due secrecy and circumspection. Diogenes was listening, and occasionally breaking out into a gruff half-smothered fragment of a bark, of which he afterwards seemed half-ashamed, as if he doubted having any reason for it.|$|E
25|$|During November, Lee next {{starred in}} Pinocchio with Co-Star Park Shin-hye. He played the protagonist, Choi Dal-po. As a young boy, his entire family was {{destroyed}} because of false news media, who then get adopted {{in a rural}} area after being found lost at sea. <b>Time</b> <b>flies</b> <b>by</b> and Dal-po is now a first year reporter at a broadcasting company who struggles with the idea of justice and truth in a world where the facts are often hidden. Pinocchio was another hit, with a reported revenue of 6.2 billion won (US$5.62 million) for broadcasting rights in just one year.|$|R

She is forced to borrow money from a rowdy Raghava (Tilak), who wanted to marry her. Meera forges her husband's signature to get money from Raghava. <b>Time</b> <b>flies</b> <b>by</b> and Madhava becomes a sincere IAS officer targeting corrupt elements of the society. This brings him in direct conflict with Raghava, who wants to contest elections. It is payback time for Meera with consequences being too harsh for her to handle. How she faces everything and becomes a winner forms the rest of the story.|$|R
60|$|Lonely {{and seriously}} frightened now Gilda fell {{on her knees}} beside the bed. Clasping her hands she tried to pray. Surely God could not leave {{a young girl in}} such terrible perplexity, when her only sin had been an act of mercy. The candle on the bureau close by burnt low in its socket and its {{flickering}} light outlined her delicate profile and the soft tendrils of hair that escaped from beneath her coif. Her eyes were closed in the endeavour to concentrate her thoughts, and <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> swiftly while she tried to pray. She did not perceive that after awhile the Lord of Stoutenburg woke and that he remained {{for a long time in}} mute contemplation of the exquisite picture which she presented, clad all in white, with the string of pearls still round her throat, her hands clasped, her lips parted breathing a silent prayer.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by,</b> {{the king}} {{again and again}} begged the prince to ask some gift of him, and always {{received}} this same reply: 'I wish for your Majesty's welfare, what more can I desire?'One night there was a banquet, and cupbearers carried round gold and silver cups of sparkling wine, and singers with sweetest voices contended for the prize. The prince drank from the king's own cup, and when his head was hot with wine he took a lute {{from one of the}} musicians and placed himself on the carpet border and sang and sang till he witched away the sense of all who listened. Applause and compliments rang from every side. The king filled his cup and called the prince and gave it him and said: 'Name your wish! it is yours.' The prince drained off the wine and answered: 'O king of the world! learn and know that I have only one aim in life, and this is to know what the rose did to the cypress.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{for once}} Ellen seemed {{singularly}} unresponsive to this panorama of wildness and grandeur. Her ears were {{like those of}} a listening deer, and her eyes continually reverted to the open places along the Rim. At first, in her excitement, <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by.</b> Gradually, however, as the sun moved westward, she began to be restless. The soft thud of dropping pine cones, the rustling of squirrels up and down the shaggy-barked spruces, the cracking of weathered bits of rock, these caught her keen ears many times and brought her up erect and thrilling. Finally she heard a sound which resembled that of an unshod hoof on stone. Stealthily then she took her rifle and slipped back through the pine thicket to the spot she had chosen. The little pines were so close together that she had to crawl between their trunks. The ground was covered with a soft bed of pine needles, brown and fragrant. In her hurry she pricked her ungloved hand on a sharp pine cone and drew the blood. She sucked the tiny wound. [...] "Shore I'm wonderin' if that's a bad omen," [...] she muttered, darkly thoughtful. Then she resumed her sinuous approach {{to the edge of the}} thicket, and presently reached it.|$|E

50|$|In 1924, the Royal Aero Club {{organized}} a Light Aircraft Competition. £3000 was offered in prizes. An entry {{was made by}} Hawker Aircraft, which was a design by Sydney Camm, the Cygnet. Camm had joined Hawker the previous year. Two aircraft were built (G-EBMB and G-EBJH) and were entered in the competition, held in 1924 at Lympne Aerodrome, by T. O. M. Sopwith and Fred Sigrist. The aircraft were <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> Longton and Raynham and came in 4th and 3rd places respectively. In 1925, G-EBMB was entered again in the 100 mi (161 km) International Handicap Race, this <b>time</b> <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> George Bulman, who won at a speed of 75.6 mph (121.7 km/h).

60|$|Then {{he set off}} at a brisk trot and Joan fell in behind. She had a busy mind, {{and it was a}} sign of her preoccupation {{that she}} forgot to thank Roberts. Presently they struck into a valley, a narrow {{depression}} between the foothills and the ridges, and here they made faster time. The valley appeared miles long. Toward the middle of it Roberts called out to Joan, and, looking down, she saw they had come up with Jim's trail. Here Roberts put his mount to a canter, and at that gait they trailed Jim out of the valley and up a slope which appeared to be a pass into the mountains. <b>Time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> for Joan, because she was always peering ahead in the hope and expectation of seeing Jim off in the distance. But she had no glimpse of him. Now and then Roberts would glance around at the westering sun. The afternoon had far advanced. Joan began to worry about home. She had been so sure of coming up with Jim and returning early in the day that she had left no word as to her intentions. Probably by this time somebody was out looking for her.|$|E
60|$|Shefford {{waited so}} long for Fay's {{awakening}} that he believed it would never come, and, believing, had not the heart to force it upon her. Then there was a growing fear with him. What would Fay Larkin do when she awakened to the truth? Fay was indeed like that white and fragile lily which bloomed in the silent, lonely cañon, but the same nature that had created it had created her. Would she droop as the lily would in a furnace blast? More than that, he feared a sudden flashing into life of strength, power, passion, hate. She did not hate yet {{because she did not}} yet realize love. She was utterly innocent of any wrong having been done her. More and more he began to fear, and a foreboding grew upon him. He made up his mind to broach the subject of Surprise Valley and of escaping with Lassiter and Jane; still, every time he was with Fay the girl and her beauty and her love were so wonderful that he put off the ordeal till the next night. As <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> he excused his vacillation on the score that winter was not a good time to try to cross the desert. There was no grass for the mustangs, except in well-known valleys, and these he must shun. Spring would soon come. So the days passed, and he loved Fay more all the time, desperately living out to its limit the sweetness of every moment with her, and paying for his bliss in the increasing trouble that beset him when once away from her charm.|$|E
6000|$|A thrilling {{and graphic}} {{account of this}} wreck and rescue is given in the Reverend John Gilmore's book, [...] "Storm Warriors," [...] in which he tells us that while this {{exciting}} work was going on, the Aid lay head to wind, steaming half power, and holding her own against the storm, waiting for her lifeboat, but no lifeboat returned to her, and her gallant captain {{became more and more}} anxious as <b>time</b> <b>flew</b> <b>by.</b> Could it be possible that her sturdy little comrade, with whom she had gone out to battle in hundreds of gales, was overcome at last and destroyed! They signalled again and again, but got no reply. Then, as their fears increased, they began to cruise about as near to the dangerous shoals as they dared-- almost playing with death--as they eagerly sought for their consort. At last the conviction was forced upon them that the boat must have been stove by the wreck and swamped. In the midst of their gathering despair they caught sight of the lightship's bright beam, shining like a star of hope through the surrounding darkness. With a faint hope they made for the vessel and hailed her. [...] "Have you seen anything of the lifeboat?" [...] was the eager question. [...] "Nothing! nothing!" [...] was the sad reply. Back they went again to the place they had left, determined to cruise on, hoping against hope, till the night should pass away. Hour after hour they steamed hither and thither, with anxiously straining eyes. At last grey dawn appeared and the wreck became dimly visible. They made for it, and their worst fears were realised--the remnant of the brig's hull was there with ropes and wreckage tossing wildly round it--but no lifeboat! ...|$|E
