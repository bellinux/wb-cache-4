40|$|Bacillus subtilis {{transfer}} {{ribonucleic acid}} (tRNA) was analyzed for the occurrence of thionucleotides by in vivo labeling with 35 S and fractionation by methylated albumin kieselguhr column chromatography. Alkaline hydrolysates of tRNA were also examined by column chromatography and paper electrophoresis, and the amino acid-accepting ability of thionucleotide-containing tRNA was tested after iodine oxidation. The results showed that B. subtilis tRNA contains 4 -thiouridylate, a second nucleotide with properties similar to 2 -thiopyrimidine, and a third unidentified <b>thionucleotide.</b> The amino acid-accepting ability for serine, tyrosine, lysine, and glutamic acid was markedly inhibited after oxidation of the tRNA with iodine, suggesting the presence of thionucleotides in these tRNA species. This inhibition could be reversed by thiosulfate reduction. The iodine treatment totally inactivated all lysine tRNA species, partially inactivated the serine tRNA species, and {{did not affect the}} accepting ability for valine. A comparison of tRNA from cells in the log and stationary phases and from spores revealed similar iodine inactivation patterns in all cases. The <b>thionucleotide</b> content in B. subtilis tRNA differed from that in Escherichia coli, both in extent and in distribution. A possible function of the thionucleotides in tRNA is discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUVA {{accounts}} for about 95 % of the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches Earth and most likely contributes to human skin cancer risk. In contrast to UVB, which comprises the remaining 5 % and is absorbed by DNA nucleobases to cause direct photodamage, UVA damages DNA indirectly. It does this largely through its interactions with cellular chromophores that act as photosensitisers to generate reactive oxygen species. Exogenously supplied chemicals, including some widely-prescribed medicines, may also act as photosensitisers and these drugs are {{associated with an increased}} risk of sun-related cancer. Because they amplify the effects of UVA on cells, they provide a means to investigate the mechanisms and effects of UVA-induced photodamage. Here, we describe some of the major lesions induced by two groups of UVA photosensitisers, the DNA <b>thionucleotides</b> and the fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In <b>thionucleotides,</b> replacement of the oxygen atoms of canonical nucleobases by sulfur converts them into strong UVA chromophores that can be incorporated into DNA. The fluoroquinolones are also UVA chromophores. They are not incorporated into DNA and induce a different range of DNA damages. We also draw attention to the potentially important contribution of photochemical protein damage to the cellular effects of photosensitised UVA. Proteins targeted for oxidation damage include DNA repair factors and we suggest that UVA-mediated protein damage may contribute to sunlight-induced cancer risk...|$|R
40|$|A cysteine-requiring mutant of {{the parent}} strain Escherichia coli Hfr Cavalli (RCrel, Met−, λ) has been isolated. The mutant was {{selected}} by using replica plating after mutagenesis by N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The mutation {{appears to be in}} the gene for sulfite reductase, since the mutant could utilize sulfide but not sulfite as a sulfur source. The mutant was found to be RCrel with respect to both methionine and cysteine. During cysteine starvation, transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) deficient in 4 -thiouracil was produced, and in vivo studies indicate that this tRNA can accept sulfur groups {{to a greater extent than}} normal tRNA. Further, there were differences both in the rate and extent of amino acid acceptance between normal and sulfur-deficient tRNA. This suggests that <b>thionucleotides</b> are involved in at least one of the biological functions of the tRNA molecule...|$|R
40|$|Reactions of trans-dicyanodichloroaurate(III) trans-dibromodicyanoaurate(III), trans-diamminedichlorogold(III), cis-diammine(aqua) chloroplatinum(II), cis-ammineaqua-(cyclohexylamine) chloroplatinum(II), chloro(terpyridine) platinum(II) and chloro-(diethylenetriaminepalldium(II) with {{dimethyl}} sulfide, thionucleosides, <b>thionucleotides</b> and thione- and guanine-containing 17 -mer oligonucleotides {{have been}} investigated by use of conventional and high-pressure stopped-flow spectrophotometry and HPLC technique {{as a function of}} ionic strength, pH, temperature and pressure in aqueous solutions. The mechanism and rate of oxidation of dimethyl sulfide by gold(III) complexes depends on the concentration of free halide. High halide concentration leads to reduction of trans-dicyano(dimethylsulfide) halidegold(III) (halide = Cl or Br) through attack by free dimethyl sulfide on co-ordinated halide. Low halide concentration allows formation of trans-dicyanobisdimethylsulfidegold(III), which is reduced intermolecularly with assistance from a water molecule. Oxidation of the thioether is much more rapid at high chloride concentration, suggesting that the extra-cellular environment strongly favours this type of reaction in vivo. The use of DNA containing thiones in the form of 4 -thiouridine or 6 -thioinosine allowed for evaluation of the specific interaction of this site with metal complexes by UV/Vis detection technique. The nucleophilicity of both thiones was found to be better than that of guanine-N 7. The pH dependence for 2. 0 thiouridine > thioinosine > G-N 7, indicates a dependence on the distance from the phosphate backbone. The reaction profile for the platination of a single G-N 7 that is moved along the oligomer suggests an additional influence from electrostatic, polyelectrolyte-like accumulation of cations. Inspection of the activation parameters (enthalpy, entropy, volume) shows that the difference in reactivity between the monomers and oligomers is largely due to contributions from the activation entropies. For the latter type of reactions, the entropy values are substantially more positive, which is interpreted as a result of pre-association of the cationic metal complex onto the oligomer, and concomitant release of monovalent cations such as sodium and potassium from the surface. The similar type of reaction characteristics, here demonstrated for the cations with an inherent reactivity spanning 4 orders of magnitude, suggest a common reaction mechanism for these structural analogs of anticancer active Pt(II) complexes, where preassociation is followed by rapid reorganisation and/or migration of the metal reagent {{on the surface of the}} oligomer prior to the rate determining reaction...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new method, called enzymatic degrading subtraction (EDS), {{for the construction}} of subtractive libraries from PCR amplified cDNA. The novel features of this method are that i) the tester DNA is blocked by <b>thionucleotide</b> incorporation; ii) the rate of hybridization is accelerated by phenol-emulsion reassociation; and iii) the driver cDNA and hybrid molecules are enzymatically removed by digestion with exonucleases III and VII rather than by physical partitioning. We demonstrate the utility of EDS by constructing a subtractive library enriched for cDNAs expressed in adult but not in embryonic rat brains...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, the {{presence}} in {{transfer ribonucleic acid}} (tRNA) of the hydroxylated cytokinin ribosylzeatin [N 6 -(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methylbut- 2 -enyl) adenosine]was thought to be unique to higher plants. This extension of work from several laboratories indicates {{the presence}} of 2 -methylthioribosylzeatin in the tRNA of the plant-associated bacteria Rhizobium leguminosarum, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Corynebacterium fascians, but not in that of Erwinia amylovora. This cytokinin has the cis configuration, as is normally found in the tRNA's of plants. The tRNA <b>thionucleotide</b> patterns in these bacteria {{are different from those}} of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella typhimurium, which contain the unhydroxylated analogs of ribosylzeatin or 2 -methylthioribosylzeatin...|$|E
40|$|Transfer RNA sulfurtransferase {{activity}} was detected in 105, 000 x g supernatant preparations from rat liver {{and several other}} rat tissues. Sulfur is transferred from [35 S] cysteine to tRNA in a reaction which also requires ATP, Mg 2 +, and supernatant protein. While [35 S] beta-mercaptopyruvate {{appeared to be a}} substrate for this enzyme, the reaction product was sensitive to deacylation and the reaction was inhibited by [32 S] cysteine. Of the various nucleic acids tested, only tRNAs were effective sulfur acceptors, with rat liver tRNA being the poorest substrate. The [35 S] reaction product was sensitive to ribonuclease, cochromatographed with tRNA on methylated-albumin kieselguhr columns, and was converted to nucleotide material after alkaline hydrolysis. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the neutralized [35 S] nucleotide digest revealed a single <b>thionucleotide</b> peak. These studies demonstrate that tRNA sulfurtransferase is present in various rat tissues, and that the requirements of the liver enzyme {{are similar to those of}} bacterial enzymes...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the metabolism of 6 -mercaptopurine (6 -MP) in erythrocytes and tissues of rats after repeated administration of 6 -MP at two dose levels {{and to provide}} evidence that in vivo modulation of 6 -MP anabolism {{can be obtained by}} simultaneous treatment with ribavirin or hydroxyurea, two inhibitors of enzymes involved in the bioactivation of 6 -MP to the active 6 -thioguanine nucleotides (6 -TGN). METHODS: Rats were treated i. p. with 6 -MP at 12. 5 and 25 mg/kg daily for 12 days and erythrocyte, liver, and kidney levels of 6 -mercaptopurine nucleotides (6 -MPN) and 6 -TGN were investigated during the accumulation phase and for 50 days after the end of treatment. In combination studies, ribavirin at 75 and 100 mg/kg per day (for 6 -MP, 25 and 12. 5 mg/kg per day) or hydroxyurea at 200 mg/kg per day were given i. p. for 12 days. The measurements of <b>thionucleotide</b> levels in rat samples were performed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: The maximal concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 6 -MPN and 6 -TGN in erythrocytes and tissues increased significantly after the administration of 6 -MP at 25 mg/kg per day as compared with 12. 5 mg/kg per day. In particular, the Cmax and AUC of 6 -TGN in erythrocytes of rats treated with 6 -MP at 25 mg/kg per day were approximately 5 -fold higher than the 6 -TGN values observed following treatment at 12. 5 mg/kg per day. Moreover, 6 -TGN levels in erythrocytes were significantly higher than those of 6 -MPN (910. 9 +/- 53. 1 and 286. 8 +/- 23. 4 pmol/ 8 x 10 (8) cells for 6 -TGN and 6 -MPN, respectively, P < 0. 05) after treatment with 6 -MP at 25 mg/kg per day. The administration of ribavirin, an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, in association with 6 -MP increased the amount of 6 -MPN detected in erythrocytes and tissues while reducing 6 -TGN levels in samples. The production and accumulation of 6 -MPN and 6 -TGN were increased in erythrocytes and tissues by hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase. Finally, a significant correlation between <b>thionucleotide</b> concentrations and erythrocyte counts was observed. CONCLUSION: The overall results demonstrate that 6 -MP is actively metabolized in rats and that its biotransformation can be modulated by agents acting on enzymes of the purine metabolism, resulting in significant changes in erythrocyte and tissue levels of 6 -MPN and 6 -TGN. These findings provide evidence that the rat is a suitable model for investigation of the metabolism of 6 -MP and its possible pharmacologic modulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of DNA gyrase with ATP has been probed using {{a range of}} thiophosphate ATP analogs. ATP gammaS is not detectably hydrolyzed by gyrase but can support limited, probably catalytic, DNA supercoiling. ATP gammaS is a good inhibitor of both ATP hydrolysis and ATP-supported supercoiling. In contrast, both ATP alphaS(Rp) and ATP betaS(Rp) {{have been shown to}} be good substrates for the ATPase reaction of gyrase and to support catalytic DNA supercoiling. The corresponding Sp diastereoisomers do not support significant levels of supercoiling and are not readily hydrolyzed, but are shown to be reasonable inhibitors of gyrase. For ATP alphaS(Rp), the supercoiling and ATPase activities appear to be tightly coupled with the <b>thionucleotide</b> being apparently a better substrate than ATP in terms of both DNA supercoiling and nucleotide hydrolysis. In the case of ATP betaS(Rp), DNA supercoiling and nucleotide hydrolysis appear to be uncoupled in that ATP betaS(Rp) is almost as good a substrate as ATP for the ATPase reaction of both intact gyrase and the 43 kDa GyrB fragment, whereas it only supports slow DNA supercoiling; the mechanistic consequences of these observations are discussed in terms of a new model for energy coupling in gyrase. DNA gyrase has been shown to be capable of catalyzing DNA supercoiling in the presence of Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, and Mn 2 + but not Zn 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +, or Cd 2 +. The pronounced diastereoselectivity seen in both the DNA supercoiling and ATPase activity with ATP alphaS and ATP betaS together with evidence from the X-ray structure of the 43 kDa GyrB-ADPNP-Mg complex is consistent with metal ion coordination at both of these sites, and probably to the gamma-phosphoryl center during turnover. Thus, the absolute configuration of the catalytically active Mg 2 +-ATP complex is likely to involve coordination to the pro-S oxygens at both P alpha and P beta, leading to the alpha,beta,gamma-tridentate Mg-ATP complex with the lambda-exo configuration. 4172...|$|E
40|$|The Sp {{diastereoisomer}} of adenosine 5 '-O-(l-thiotriphosphate) (ATPaS) {{was found}} to be incorporated into RNA transcribed by T 7 RNA polymerase with an apparent KM similar to that for ATP; the Rp diastereoisomer was neither a substrate nor a competitive inhibitor. The configuration of the thiophosphodiester link in the RNA produced was analysed with stereospecific nucleases. Surprisingly, the nucleases exhibited reduced discrimination compared to their activity on dinucleotides. The results show that phosphorothioate linkages in T 7 RNA polymerase transcripts are in the Rp configuration. Thus, the transcription reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at phosphorus. In vitro transcription by T 7 RNA polymerase {{in the presence of a}} nucleoside 5 '-O-(1 -thiotriphosphate) has been used to prepare pre-mRNA analogues of the small intron of a rabbit ?-globin gene and flanking exon sequences. Incubation of transcripts prepared with ATPaS in a HeLa cell nuclear extract showed that the presence of the <b>thionucleotide</b> in a transcript inhibited splicing, but a novel product (termed E 2 *) was formed by cleavage three nucleotides upstream of the 3 ' splice site. This product was formed with the same kinetics as the intermediates of a normal splicing reaction, and its formation depended on the presence of ATP, Mg 2 +, and intact small nuclear RNAs U 1, U 2, and U 6. Hence, E 2 * formation would seem to be a splicing related phenomenon. However, E 2 * formation does not require all the components necessary for in vitro splicing. E 2 * formation was supported by S 100 extracts and mildly heat treated nuclear extracts, both of which were inactive in splicing. Retardation gel asssays and combined RNase T 1 digestion and immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that large spliceosome-like complexes did not form on transcripts prepared with ATPaS. Furthermore, neither the absence of a functional 5 ' splice site nor polypyrimidine tract sequence prevented E 2 * formation, despite both these sequences being required for splicing. In addition, a nuclease activity has been identified in HeLa nuclear extract which is dependent on intact small nuclear RNAs U 1 and U 2. This activity may be involved in E 2 * formation...|$|E
