5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, and mice.|$|E
5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} {{takes on a}} more agricultural character along US2. The highway passes through {{the edge of the}} community of Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding {{on the south side of}} the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community. Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over <b>to</b> <b>Bark</b> River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of Bark River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E
5|$|At {{the house}} of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in {{perfectly}} as they all share stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E

50|$|The line {{opened on}} 9 July 1894 between South Tottenham and Woodgrange Park where it joined the {{existing}} LTSR line <b>to</b> <b>Barking</b> and beyond. On the same date a curve was opened allowing East Ham {{to be served}} as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>Barking.</b> Trains did not terminate at South Tottenham but continued westwards to various destinations via the Tottenham & Hampstead Junction Railway, much as the Gospel Oak <b>to</b> <b>Barking</b> Line does today.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the plan to extend the Gospel Oak <b>to</b> <b>Barking</b> Line <b>to</b> <b>Barking</b> Riverside, there are also proposals to extend it further under the River Thames to a station in Thamesmead, and then on Abbey Wood {{to connect with the}} future Crossrail line.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} that the crossing could be integrated into the railway network, most likely by continuing the London Overground Gospel Oak <b>to</b> <b>Barking</b> Line extension <b>to</b> <b>Barking</b> Riverside, over/under the river via the new crossing, and connecting to national rail lines at Abbey Wood.|$|R
25|$|The now extinct Hare Indian dog of {{northern}} Canada {{was not known}} <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> in its native homeland, though puppies born in Europe learned how to imitate the barking of other dogs. When hurt or afraid, it howled like a wolf, and when curious, it made a sound described as a growl building up to a howl.|$|E
25|$|Dogs {{may show}} {{reserved}} and cautious guarding behaviors. They are kind, loving, and devoted to those they know. They are very loyal to their owners, and are rewarding dogs if treated well. Because the breed {{was developed to}} serve on the ranch, a job which includes being protective of its property, it is inclined <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> warnings about neighborhood activity.|$|E
25|$|Colorado’s {{forests are}} densely wooded, making them much more {{susceptible}} <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> beetle attack.

50|$|Barking Riverside is {{connected}} <b>to</b> <b>Barking,</b> Goodmayes, Ilford and Dagenham Dock {{and other places}} by the East London Transit bus rapid transit services EL1, EL2 and EL3. Planning regulations {{limit the number of}} homes to 1,200 until adequate public transport is provided. Initially, a Docklands Light Railway extension to Dagenham Dock was proposed to serve the area. This project was cancelled in 2008 and revived in 2009, but is without funding. It was announced as part of the 2014 United Kingdom budget that the Gospel Oak <b>to</b> <b>Barking</b> Line of the London Overground would be extended <b>to</b> <b>Barking</b> Riverside.|$|R
25|$|The devocalization {{procedure}} {{does not}} take away a dog's ability <b>to</b> <b>bark.</b> Dogs will normally bark {{just as much as}} before the procedure. After the procedure the sound will be softer, typically about half as loud as before, or less, and it is not as sharp or piercing. So while the procedure does not stop barking or silence the animal completely, it is effective in reducing the sound level and sharpness of the dog's bark.|$|E
25|$|When the {{children}} are terrified by a stray cat in the garden, the son kills it {{with a pair of}} pruning shears. Deciding {{to take advantage of the}} incident, the father shreds his clothes, covers himself in fake blood, and tells his children that their unseen brother was killed by a cat, the most dangerous creature. After he teaches them <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> on all fours to fend off cats, the family holds a memorial service for the brother.|$|E
25|$|Brown-headed nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) {{have been}} {{observed}} to methodically use bark pieces to remove other flakes of bark from a tree. The birds insert the bark piece underneath an attached bark scale, using it like a wedge and lever, to expose hiding insects. Occasionally, they reuse the same piece of bark several times and sometimes even fly short distances carrying the bark flake in their beak. The evolutionary origin of this tool use {{might be related to}} these birds frequently wedging seeds into cracks in the bark to hammer them open with their beak, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> coming off.|$|E

500|$|George Orwell {{had a very}} {{negative}} view. [...] "This evil book is now issued in pretty-pretty expurgated editions, but it is well worth reading in the original version. [...] It gives one {{some idea of the}} lengths to which child-discipline was sometimes carried. Mr. Fairchild, for instance, when he catches his children quarrelling, first thrashes them, reciting Dr. Watts's 'Let dogs delight <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> and bite' between blows of the cane, and then takes them to spend the afternoon beneath a gibbet where the rotting corpse of a murderer is hanging.".|$|E
500|$|The beagle has an even {{temper and}} gentle disposition. Described in several breed {{standards}} as [...] "merry", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this {{depends on the}} individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor guard dogs for this reason, although their tendency <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the Yorkshire Terrier, Cairn Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, West Highland White Terrier, and Fox Terrier.|$|E
500|$|Keela was a crime-scene-investigation (CSI) dog {{trained to}} give her handler, Martin Grime, a [...] "passive alert" [...] to the scent of human blood by placing her nose close to the spot, then {{freezing}} in that position. Eddie was an enhanced-victim-recovery dog (EVRD) who gave a [...] "bark alert" [...] to the scent of human cadavers, including shortly {{after the death of}} the subject, even if the remains were buried, incinerated or in water. He was trained <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> only in response to that scent and not for any other reason. The dogs arrived in Praia da Luz on 31 July, and were taken to two beaches, Robert Murat's house, and the Ocean Club apartments.|$|E

500|$|Reveille accompanies her handlers, {{members of}} the E-2 unit of the Corps of Cadets, everywhere, {{including}} classes. [...] It is a long-held tradition that if Reveille decides to sleep on a cadet's bed, that cadet is required {{to sleep on the}} floor. [...] In truth, however, this only applied to the early mascots who were allowed to freely roam the campus. [...] The contemporary mascots, certainly since the 1980s and likely earlier, are under the constant supervision of the Mascot Corporal and not allowed to freely roam about the cadet's quarters. [...] Another tradition is that if she chooses <b>to</b> <b>bark</b> in class, that session is cancelled. [...] Upon the death of a current or former mascot, a full military funeral is held at Kyle Field, which usually attracts several thousand mourners.|$|E
500|$|Polynesian peoples {{often did}} not {{recognize}} Canis Minor as a constellation, but they saw Procyon as significant and often named it; in the Tuamotu Archipelago it was known as Hiro, meaning [...] "twist as a thread of coconut fiber", and Kopu-nui-o-Hiro ("great paunch of Hiro"), which was either {{a name for the}} modern figure of Canis Minor or an alternative name for Procyon. Other names included Vena (after a goddess), on Mangaia and Puanga-hori (false Puanga, the name for Rigel), in New Zealand. In the Society Islands, Procyon was called Ana-tahua-vahine-o-toa-te-manava, literally [...] "Aster the priestess of brave heart", figuratively the [...] "pillar for elocution". The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia gave Procyon and Gomeisa the names Magum and Gurumana, describing them as humans who were transformed into gum trees in the dreamtime. Although their skin had turned <b>to</b> <b>bark,</b> they were able to speak with a human voice by rustling their leaves.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} outlets {{expressed}} disappointment at the penalty shoot-out, {{in particular the}} way that Martin Williams, who as a flanker who would not ordinarily take a kick at goal, had been to [...] "blame" [...] for Cardiff's loss. The Guardians Paul Rees expressed the opinion that asking forwards to take kicks at goal [...] "is demanding something not only unnatural but untried and it turned a rousing semi-final into a pantomime, an unnecessarily demeaning way of settling the issue." [...] Brendan Gallagher writing in The Daily Telegraph noted that {{only three or four}} players on a rugby team would kick the ball during a match in a meaningful way, and said it was [...] "ludicrous that a game should be decided by emphasising that particular skill". He also questioned what would have happened in the event the shoot-out continued and the game been decided between props Martin Castrogiovanni and Gethin Jenkins, both considered amongst the finest players in their position but never ordinarily being required to kick the ball at goal. Chris Hewett expressed similar views in The Independent, observing that Martyn Williams [...] "lost the game by failing to perform a task outside the skill-set of the majority of players" [...] and commenting that [...] "short of asking a cat <b>to</b> <b>bark,</b> {{it is hard to imagine}} anything more preposterous." ...|$|E
