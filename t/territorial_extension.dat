2500|$|These mercantile {{relations}} {{might have}} intensified from the 9th century onwards, when several gold and emerald mines {{were discovered in}} the east Sudanese desert. It is in that time that the Arab historian al-Yaqubi would describe Alodia for the first time. While short, he attests that 300 years after its first mention, Alodia was a large kingdom ("About two months journey"), with Soba as its capital. He also says that its power is above Makurias. After al-Yaqubi comes Ibn Hawqal, a traveller and historian of the later 10th century. He probably travelled through Alodia himself, therefore gathering his information firsthand. This allowed him to describe the kingdom in comparatively great detail, discussing its <b>territorial</b> <b>extension,</b> landscapes, economy, inhabitants and government. According to him, the current king was named Asabiyus (Probably the Arabic distortion of Eusebius), who inherited the throne from his uncle Astabanus (Stephanos) due to martilineal succession. Contemporary to Ibn Hawqal, there was also Ibn Sulaym al-Aswani, a Fatimid ambassador sent to Makuria, who would then travel to Alodia. While his original work had been lost, he was quoted by later historians like al Maqrizi. Like Hawqals report it is relatively detailed, focusing again on the geography, economy and habitants, while neglecting the political history. Interesting information which complement Hawqal are that Alodia was more extensive and powerful than Makuria, also having a larger army. It is also made clear that at his time, Soba was a prospering town with [...] "fine buildings, and extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens". After Al-Aswani there is a gap of several centuries. At least the names of two Alodian kings are preserved on Arabic letters discovered in Qasr Ibrim, dated to the 12th century: Basil and Paul.|$|E

40|$|In recent times, the {{influence}} of human behaviour on Earth's atmosphere is so significant to suggest {{the identification of the}} beginning of a distinct new geological Epoch, named with the term Anthropocene. It would be the last Epoch of the current Quaternary Period (starting 2. 58 million years ago), following the current Holocene Epoch (starting 11. 700 years ago). Anthropocene could also be read as a cultural concept, related to philosophy, literature and arts; a concept with which Humanities deal with complex questions about the relation between human beings, artefacts, nature and time. As a consequence, this relationship becomes relevant concerning the existing built environment. In fact, Contemporary Ruins (hereby meant as the dismissed, incomplete, and abandoned heritage built less than a century ago) are increasingly recognized as a growing phenomenon, both in terms of increasing numbers of reported case studies, and their rising <b>territorial</b> <b>extensions.</b> Moreover, in the past decades, dismissed buildings where easily reabsorbed through a process of re-functionalization, conversion of use, or physiologically assimilated by nature. Nowadays, these phenomena become visible. These tangible evidences of traumatic events, failures, and transformations, often remain as evident presences, because they are made up of new materials, built in contexts that don’t have the ability to re-metabolize them or because of their huge and growing territorial dimensions. Historically, Design represented the creative engine that generated tools, products, spaces, etc. It was an activity carried on only by few and skilled experts. Today, it seems assuming another direction, a more spread and expanded character. The so-called ‘diffuse design’ refers to design activities undertaken by a growing number of individuals. These actions often lead to large transformations, bringing about big social changes. Apparently, design could be seen as a shared attitude. This attitude is so widespread, expanded and shared that becomes part of the aforementioned cultural model that deals with the fundamental relationships between human beings, nature and time. Accordingly with the three topics outlined, we propose an exploratory paper with the aim to investigate the role of design attitude in the process of intervention on new fragile and complex territorial scenarios due to the growing dimensions of Contemporary Ruins. A critical reflection, supported by the cultural framework of Antropocene’s concept, in which natural elements and results of human activity become elements of the same scenario, complex as homogeneous, on which design actions can be activated, with the involvement of a new designing society...|$|R

The term shima, denoting ‘island’, is interesting in that it embodies a dual meaning- islands as geographical features and islands as small-scale social groups where cultural interactions are densely intermeshed. The Amami Islands of southwestern Japan are marked by their population’s deep attachment to their own shima, as enacted through various practices and performances of demarcation. Each shima is a work of <b>territorial</b> imagination, an <b>extension</b> of personhood and a ‘cultural landscape’.

40|$|A energia é considerada o motor do desenvolvimento sócio-econômico das sociedades industriais, pois está presente em todas as etapas de produção. Deste modo, a constante expectativa de falta de energia torna a projeção de políticas de desenvolvimento impraticáveis. O Brasil é um país que procura estar inserido na economia global e não pode perder competitividade pela falta de energia disponível, devido as vastas extensões territoriais e clima favorável à produção de diferentes tipos de combustíveis de origens renováveis, com destaque para o {{biodiesel}}, que fortalece o agronegócio, por criar um novo mercado para as oleaginosas, e diminui a dependência dos derivados de petróleo. Esta pesquisa teve como objetivo avaliar a cadeia produtiva do biodiesel, no estado do Rio Grande do Sul, localizado na Região Sul do Brasil, que está entre os principais estados produtores. O estudo teve como base o modelo Estrutura-Conduta-Desempenho (ECD), levando em consideração as transações que ocorrem entre os fornecedores de matéria-prima e produtores, e ainda as particularidades dos sistemas agroindustriais num ambiente sujeito aos choques externos. Para permitir uma melhor compreensão das informações coletadas durante a pesquisa de campo, foi utilizada a ferramenta de modelagem de informações Integration Definition Language 0 (IDEF 0), que serve de base para estruturar o ambiente analisado. Os resultados mostraram que a cadeia de produção do biodiesel é caracterizada como incipiente e fortemente ligada às ações do governo federal, resultando na ineficiência produtiva de todo o setor. O comércio de biodiesel é realizado mediante leilões públicos, com poucos compradores. As variáveis cruciais de disputa do mercado são preço e qualidade do produto (adequação às especificações). Existe grande expectativa quanto à abertura do processo de exportação. O principal gargalo para as firmas entrantes é a obtenção de matéria-prima em quantidade e especificações determinadas para manter a qualidade do produto final. Destaca-se ainda que apesar da alta competitividade do setor, proporcionada pelo mercado restrito, existe certo nível de cooperação e troca de informações entre as organizações, principalmente quando se trata de um problema comum ao setor como um todo. A cooperação é mais estreita e de forma mais participativa na relação entre as firmas e os fornecedores de matéria-prima, que é justificada pela necessidade de garantir a quantidade e a qualidade de insumos programada. Para isso, existem programas de auxílio técnico, de incentivo a culturas alternativas, buscando diversificar a matriz produtiva. Energy {{is considered}} the engine of socio-economic development of industrial society. It is present in all stages of production. Thus, the constant threat of lack of energy makes the projection of development policies impracticable. Brazil {{is a country that}} tries to be inserted in the global economy and it cannot lose competitiveness because of lack of available energy. It is a country with a vast <b>territorial</b> <b>extensions</b> and a favorable climate to the production of different types of renewable fuel sources, especially the biodiesel, which strengthens the agribusiness by creating a new market for oleaginous plants, and reduces dependence on petroleum derivatives. The objective of this research is to evaluate the productive chain of biodiesel, {{in the state of the}} Rio Grande do Sul, located in Southern Region of Brazil, it is located among the main producing states. The research was based on the model structureconduct-performance (SCP), taking in consideration the transactions that occur between suppliers of raw materials and producers, and still the peculiarities of the agro-industrial systems in an environment subject to the external shocks. To allow one better understanding of the information collected during field research, the tool of modeling of information Integration Definition Language 0 (IDEF 0) was used, it serves as the base to structure the analyzed environment. The results showed that the production of biodiesel is characterized as incipient and strong due to the actions of the federal government, what generates a series of market imperfections that, consequently, generate the productive inefficiency for sector. Its demand totally based on sales through public auctions, with few buyers. The crucial variables of dispute in the market are price and product quality (adequacy to the specifications). There are very expectations on the opening of the exportation market, as well as the release of the commercialization of the production really competitive levels and conditions. The main strain for the new firms is the raw material attainment in amount and the determined specifications to keep the quality of the final product. It became clear that despite the high competitiveness of the sector, in proportion to the limited market, there is certain level of cooperation and exchange of information among the organizations, mainly when it deals with a common problem to the sector as a whole. The cooperation is narrower and of active form among the firms and suppliers of raw material, that is justified by the necessity to guarantee the amount and the quality of materials programmed. For this, there are technical aid programs of incentive to alternative cultures, making an effort to diversify the productive matrix...|$|R
