5|$|In 1993, NSB test-ran an X2 {{train on}} the Randsfjord Line, and between 29 September and 21 December 1996, ran a unit in regular {{service on the}} Sørland Line. On 23 February 1995, NSB signed a {{contract}} to purchase 16 Class 71 trains for use on the Airport Express Train on the Gardermoen Line. The contract included two options, one for 16 trains for intercity traffic and one for 6 trains for regional traffic. The reason for using the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>train</b> as the Airport Express Train, was to reduce maintenance and operation costs through having a unified fleet. The options would only modify the trains slightly; they were primarily designed for the airport service and any optimization for intercity and tilting technology was secondary in the design process. The first option was taken out on 5 March 1997.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{highways}} or {{road networks}} where capacity is disaggregated into unlinked trips over individual route segments, railway capacity is fundamentally considered a network system. As a result, many components are {{causes and effects}} of system disruptions. Maintenance must acknowledge the vast array of a route's performance (<b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>train</b> service, origination/destination, seasonal impacts), line's capacity (length, terrain, number of tracks, types of train control), trains throughput (max speeds, acceleration/deceleration rates), and service features with shared passenger-freight tracks (sidings, terminal capacities, switching routes, and design type).|$|E

The children received all four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> simultaneously with different stimulus sets. Native– foreign intraverbal training presented the greatest difficulty with acquisition for both children. All <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> generated increases in correct responding on tests for emergent relations, and some emerged to criterion.
