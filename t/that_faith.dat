5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E
5|$|Yet both {{reflect an}} inseparable {{integrity}} and regard for accuracy and truth, {{expressed in terms}} both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day. Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the Historia, felt <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and {{that as a result}} miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and taught <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> is a precondition for baptism. He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism, teaching {{that it was not}} an essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.|$|E

5|$|Judah Philip Benjamin, QC (August 11, 1811 – May 6, 1884) was {{a lawyer}} and {{politician}} who was a United States Senator from Louisiana, a Cabinet officer of the Confederate States and, after his escape to the United Kingdom {{at the end of}} the American Civil War, an English barrister. Benjamin was the first Jew to be elected to the United States Senate who did not renounce the religion, and the first of <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> to hold a Cabinet position in North America.|$|E
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of success) is a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God for them, and <b>that</b> <b>faith,</b> positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics <b>that</b> <b>faith,</b> not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E

5|$|In 1907 {{the family}} split up; {{there was no}} divorce or formal separation, but the two elder boys, Christopher and Ambrose, {{remained}} with their father and Lydia left them, taking Ralph with her. The ostensible cause of the couple's separation was a row over Lydia's choice of wallpaper for her husband's study. According to John Miller's biography, whatever underlying causes {{there may have been}} are unknown. An earlier biographer, Garry O'Connor, speculates that Arthur Richardson might have been having an extramarital affair. There {{does not seem to have}} been a religious element, although Arthur was a dedicated Quaker, whose first two sons were brought up in <b>that</b> <b>faith,</b> whereas Lydia was a devout convert to Roman Catholicism, in which she raised Ralph. Mother and son had a variety of homes, the first of which was a bungalow converted from two railway carriages in Shoreham-by-Sea on the south coast of England.|$|E
5|$|Like her mother, Ellen Ewing Sherman was {{a devout}} Roman Catholic, and the Shermans' eight {{children}} were reared in <b>that</b> <b>faith.</b> In 1864, Ellen took up temporary residence in South Bend, Indiana, {{to have her}} young family educated at the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary's College. In 1874, with Sherman having become world-famous, their eldest child, Marie Ewing ("Minnie") Sherman, also had a politically prominent wedding, attended by President Ulysses S. Grant and commemorated by a generous gift from the Khedive of Egypt. (Eventually, one of Minnie's daughters married a grandson of Confederate general Lewis Addison Armistead.) Another of the Sherman daughters, Eleanor, was married to Alexander Montgomery Thackara at General Sherman's home in Washington, D.C., on May 5, 1880. To Sherman's great displeasure and sorrow, his oldest surviving son, Thomas Ewing Sherman, joined the religious order of the Jesuits in 1878 and was ordained as a priest in 1889.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{left office}} as {{governor}} in January 1896. In February, Harrison {{made it clear}} that he would not seek a third nomination. Hanna's operatives immediately organized Harrison's home state of Indiana for McKinley with a haste that the former president privately found unseemly. By early 1896, the Reed and Allison campaigns were beginning to form themselves, but they had little luck in Indiana. McKinley challenged his rivals everywhere except in states, such as Iowa, that he deemed had serious candidates like Senator Allison. The favorite son candidacies of Minnesota Senator Cushman K. Davis and former Nebraska senator Charles F. Manderson fell victim to the McKinley forces, well-financed by Hanna, who took their states away from them. McKinley was disliked by the American Protective Association, an anti-Catholic group angered that as governor he had appointed to office members of <b>that</b> <b>faith.</b> Their wide pamphleting caused Hanna to act against falsehoods that his candidate was a Catholic.|$|E

5|$|Muslims of Bombay elected Jinnah, though then {{absent in}} London, as their {{representative}} to the Central Legislative Assembly in October 1934. The British Parliament's Government of India Act 1935 gave considerable power to India's provinces, with a weak central parliament in New Delhi, which had no authority over such matters as foreign policy, defence, {{and much of the}} budget. Full power remained {{in the hands of the}} Viceroy, however, who could dissolve legislatures and rule by decree. The League reluctantly accepted the scheme, though expressing reservations about the weak parliament. The Congress was much better prepared for the provincial elections in 1937, and the League failed to win a majority even of the Muslim seats in any of the provinces where members of <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> held a majority. It did win a majority of the Muslim seats in Delhi, but could not form a government anywhere, though it was part of the ruling coalition in Bengal. The Congress and its allies formed the government even in the North-West Frontier Province (N.W.F.P.), where the League won no seats despite the fact that almost all residents were Muslim.|$|E
5|$|With {{some notable}} exceptions, Reformed Christians baptize infants who {{are born to}} believing parents. Reformed Christians do so {{on the basis of}} the {{continuity}} from the old covenant between God and Israel and the new covenant with the church, since infants were circumcised under the old covenant. They also see God's saving purpose in the new covenant as having to do with families as well as individuals. Because Reformed Christians believe baptism must be embraced by faith to have any benefit, they recognize <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> may come later in life rather than preceding baptism. Infants may also be said to possess a seed of faith which will come to fruition later, or baptism may be administered based on a promise of faith offered by their sponsors (usually their parents) which will be kept at a later age.|$|E
25|$|The elector {{authorised}} a visitation of the church, a power formerly {{exercised by}} bishops. At times, Luther's practical reforms {{fell short of}} his earlier radical pronouncements. For example, the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony (1528), drafted by Melanchthon with Luther's approval, stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins, despite Luther's position <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> alone ensures justification. The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise, and Luther condemned him for teaching <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> is separate from works. The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther's thought and practice.|$|E

25|$|Partial {{copies of}} a number of Coptic Bibles survive. A {{considerable}} number of apocryphal texts also survive in Coptic, most notably the Gnostic Nag Hammadi library.

25|$|Another view held by many Protestants is sola fide ("by faith alone"): <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> alone, {{apart from}} any action, is what {{achieves}} salvation, and that good works are merely evidence of <b>that</b> <b>faith.</b> Justification is generally {{seen as a}} discrete event that takes place once for all during one's lifetime, {{not the result of}} a transformation of character. However, most Protestants teach that a transformation of character naturally follows the salvation experience. Instead of distinguishing between mortal and venial sins, Protestants believe that one's faith dictates one's state of salvation and one's place in the afterlife. Those who have been saved by God are destined for heaven, while those have not been saved will be excluded from heaven. Accordingly, they reject any notion of a provisional or temporary afterlife state such as purgatory.|$|E
25|$|Paul's {{theology}} of the gospel accelerated {{the separation of the}} messianic sect of Christians from Judaism, a development contrary to Paul's own intent. He wrote <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> in Christ was alone decisive in salvation for Jews and Gentiles alike, making the schism between the followers of Christ and mainstream Jews inevitable and permanent.|$|E
25|$|Reformed theologians, {{along with}} other Protestants, believe {{salvation}} from punishment for sin is {{to be given to}} all those who have faith in Christ. Faith is not purely intellectual, but involves trust in God's promise to save. Protestants do not hold there to be any other requirement for salvation, but <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> alone is sufficient.|$|E
