25|$|A Commercial newsman's {{inspection}} <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> the Cotton Belt locomotive permanently {{on display}} {{on a site}} between Oakland and Townsend Parks revealed the old steam engine has been neglected by the city. When the railroad donated the engine to the city it did so with the stipulation that the locomotive would receive proper care. Not only had the engine been allowed to deteriorate through rust, {{the effects of the}} weather in non-metal portions and acts of vandalism, but the grounds have been allowed to grow up around the fenced-in area so that visitors must trudge through weeds to get an up-close look at the locomotive.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Britain {{to receive}} his medal from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 22 June 1915, O'Leary {{was given a}} grand {{reception}} attended by thousands of Londoners in Hyde Park on 10 July. He was also {{the subject of much}} patriotic writing, including a poem in the Daily Mail and the short play O'Flaherty V.C. by George Bernard Shaw. Tributes came from numerous prominent figures of the day, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who said that [...] "No writer in fiction would dare to fasten such an achievement on any of his characters, but the Irish have always had a reputation of being wonderful fighters, and Lance-Corporal Michael O’Leary is clearly one of them." [...] and Thomas Scanlan who said: [...] "I heard early <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> the great achievements of the Irish Guards. All Ireland is proud of O’Leary. He fully deserves the high honour that has been conferred upon him. Ireland is grateful to him." [...] His reception was repeated in Macroom when he visited Ireland, with crowds turning out to applaud him. Daniel O'Leary was interviewed in a local newspaper regarding his son's exploit but was reportedly unimpressed, commenting: [...] "I am surprised he didn't do more. I often laid out twenty men myself with a stick coming from Macroom Fair, and it is a bad trial of Mick that he could kill only eight, and he having a rifle and bayonet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jan 12, 2007: President Bush accused Iran in {{a speech}} <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> helping launch attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq. His remarks were {{followed}} by combative comments from his top war advisors, new moves by U.S. naval forces and a raid Thursday in the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil. The administration moved Friday 12 January to defuse concerns that it was planning or inviting a confrontation with Tehran. At a news conference, White House Press Secretary Tony Snow dismissed as an [...] "urban legend" [...] suggestions that the United States was preparing for another war. Similar denials were issued by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Marine Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E

6000|$|Gilbert Gildersleeve's heart gave a great bound within him, {{and then}} stood stock-still; but by an iron effort of will he {{suppressed}} all outer {{sign of his}} profound emotion.

60|$|During <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> waiting, Silveira with 4,000 men {{arrived at}} Chaves, and a meeting {{took place between}} him and Romana. Both had plans equally wild and impracticable, neither would give way, and as they were well aware that their forces would never act together, they decided to act {{independently}} against the French. At the end of eight days the news came that Soult, having made all his preparations, had left Orense on his march southward.|$|E
60|$|My {{thoughts}} were much saddened to-day by the news, which I received <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>of</b> {{the death of}} Mary Edmonson. It is not for her that I could weep; for she died as calmly and serenely as she lived, resigning her soul {{into the hands of}} her Savior. What I do weep for is, that under the flag of my country--and that country a Christian one--such a life as Mary's could have been lived, and so little said or done about it.|$|E
60|$|One thing, however, Beatrice learnt. Her {{father was}} going on the Monday to Hereford by an early train to attend a meeting of clergymen {{collected}} to discuss the tithe question. He was to return by the last train on the Tuesday night, that is, about midnight. Beatrice now discovered that Elizabeth proposed to accompany him. Evidently she wished to see {{as little as possible}} of her sister during <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> truce--possibly she was a little afraid of her. Even Elizabeth might have a conscience.|$|E

60|$|The {{house of}} her father's sister was a prison to Phyllis. She had quite {{recently}} undergone experience of its gloom; {{and when her}} father went on to direct her to pack what would be necessary for her to take, her heart died within her. In after years she never attempted to excuse her conduct during <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> agitation; but the result of her self-communing was that she decided {{to join in the}} scheme of her lover and his friend, and fly to the country which he had coloured with such lovely hues in her imagination. She always said that the one feature in his proposal which overcame her hesitation was the obvious purity and straightforwardness of his intentions. He showed himself to be so virtuous and kind; he treated her with a respect to which she had never before been accustomed; and she was braced to the obvious risks of the voyage by her confidence in him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] Edwards said. [...] "It will be {{a disgrace}} indeed {{to him and his}} {{officers}} if he does; but you know what the Indians are, better than I do, and you have heard Nat's opinion. You see, if Montcalm were to use force against the Indians, the whole of them would go off, and then there would be an end to any hope of the French beating the colonists in the long run. Montcalm daren't break with them. It's a horrible position for an officer and a gentleman to be placed in. Montcalm did manage to prevent the redskins from massacring the garrison of Oswego, but it was {{as much as he could}} do, and it will be ten times as difficult, now that their blood is up with <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> hard fighting, and the loss of many of their warriors. Anyhow, I am glad I am out of it, even if the bigwigs consider we had no right to leave the fort, and break us for it. I would rather lose my commission than run the risk of being massacred in cold blood." ...|$|E

60|$|Re-embarking in the periagua, we {{returned}} across the lake, and then mounted our horses. The whole of Chiloe {{took advantage of}} <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> unusually fine weather, to clear the ground by burning. In every direction volumes of smoke were curling upwards. Although the inhabitants were so assiduous in setting fire to {{every part of the}} wood, yet I did not see a single fire which they had succeeded in making extensive. We dined with our friend the commandant, and did not reach Castro till after dark. The next morning we started very early. After having ridden for some time, we obtained from the brow of a steep hill an extensive view (and it is a rare thing on this road) of the great forest. Over the horizon of trees, the volcano of Corcovado, and the great flat-topped one to the north, stood out in proud pre-eminence: scarcely another peak in the long range showed its snowy summit. I hope it will be long before I forget this farewell view of the magnificent Cordillera fronting Chiloe. At night we bivouacked under a cloudless sky, and the next morning reached S. Carlos. We arrived on the right day, for before evening heavy rain commenced.|$|E
