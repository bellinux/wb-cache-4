40|$|The {{integration}} of China into <b>the</b> world <b>oil</b> <b>market</b> {{is an important}} issue for at least two reasons. First, the influence of the country on <b>the</b> world <b>oil</b> <b>market</b> is dependent on the level of the integration. Second, integration into <b>the</b> world <b>oil</b> <b>market</b> means that China is opening itself up to potential disturbances in the world market and this leads to significant energy security concerns for the country. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate whether or not China is an integral part of <b>the</b> world <b>oil</b> <b>market.</b> By reviewing <b>the</b> relevant trade and pricing policies of the Chinese government as well as the behavior of <b>the</b> Chinese national <b>oil</b> companies, we find that China is actively engaging itself in <b>the</b> world <b>oil</b> <b>market.</b> Our time-series results show that <b>the</b> Chinese <b>oil</b> price is cointegrated with <b>the</b> major <b>oil</b> prices in <b>the</b> world and a high degree of co-movement between the prices is found.

2500|$|Several {{claims have}} been made implicating {{financial}} speculation as {{a major cause of}} the price increases. In May 2008 the transport chief for Germany's Social Democrats estimated that 25 percent of the rise to $135 a barrel {{had nothing to do with}} underlying supply and demand. Testimony was given to a U.S. Senate committee in May indicating that [...] "demand shock" [...] from [...] "institutional investors" [...] had increased by [...] over the previous five years, almost as much as the increased physical demand from China (...) [...] The influence of institutional investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, was also discussed in June 2008, when Lehman Brothers suggested that price increases were related to increases in exposure to commodities by such investors. It claimed that [...] "for every $100 million in new inflows, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, increased by 1.6%." [...] Also in May 2008, an article in The Economist pointed out that oil futures transactions on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), nearly mirrored the price of oil increases for a several-year period; however, the article conceded that the increased investment might be following rising prices, rather than causing them, and that the nickel commodity market had halved in value between May 2007 and May 2008 despite significant speculative interest. It also reminded readers that [...] "Investment can flood into <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>market</b> without driving up prices because speculators are not buying any actual crude... no oil is hoarded or somehow kept off the market," [...] and that prices of some commodities which are not openly traded have actually risen faster than oil prices. In June 2008, OPEC's Secretary General Abdallah Salem el-Badri stated that current world consumption of oil at 87 million bpd was far exceeded by the [...] "paper market" [...] for oil, which equaled about 1.36 billion bpd, or more than 15 times the actual market demand.|$|E

In order {{to analyze the}} reactions of different industries to oil price shocks, we focused on four fundamental industries: grains, metals, petrochemicals and oil fats. We separated <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> price shocks into two parts, positive and negative parts, to investigate how commodity <b>markets</b> react when <b>oil</b> prices go up and down. We further studied the extreme price movements, called jumps, existing in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>markets</b> and how jump behavior has affected China's commodity markets. Our results suggest that asymmetric effects of oil price shocks did exist in the four <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> negative <b>oil</b> price shocks had stronger influences on the four markets in China. The petrochemicals market suffered most from <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> price shocks, and the grains market was least sensitive to the shocks.

40|$|The role of speculators in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>markets</b> {{has been}} vastly {{investigated}} {{during the last}} few years. Several authors focused on the definition of speculation while others examined <b>the</b> relationship between <b>oil</b> prices and <b>the</b> behavior of trading actors. In this paper, we formulate a new theory able to describe "hedging needs" as well as the role of speculators in <b>the</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>market.</b> According to our model, the different strategies of producers and consumers aimed at defending themselves against abrupt oil price changes can be satisfied only if speculators play a very active role. Due to the rapid growth in shale <b>oil</b> production, <b>the</b> importance of speculation in ensuring an equilibrium in <b>the</b> US crude <b>oil</b> <b>market</b> has consequently grown noticeably. We estimate an econometric conditional Error Correction Model (ECM) applying Pesaran's bound tests, over the sample February 2000 November 2014, using WTI and CFTC data. Our theory is well supported by econometric evidence. In other words, our model is suitable to demonstrate how commercial operators act on the market. In addition, the increasing importance of future contracts (also known as financialisation of crude <b>oil</b> <b>market)</b> helps in reaching a level of prices close to the equilibrium one. Finally, we are able to find evidence of a positive impact of the action of speculators on <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>oil</b> <b>markets</b> as they help stabilizing prices...|$|R
