5|$|When William Worthington died in 1800, his brewery {{was one of}} {{the largest}} outside London. From 1866 a Worthington chemist, Horace Tabberer Brown, pioneered brewing science in the {{separation}} and cultivation of pure yeast strains, and from 1872 the company was the first in the world to systematically use a laboratory in the brewing process. The company merged with its major Burton rival Bass in 1927. Throughout the 1920s until the 1960s the brand, in bottled form, ranked alongside Bass and Guinness as one of only <b>three</b> <b>beers</b> with nationwide distribution. However, bottled beer sales declined as keg beer grew in popularity throughout the 1960s, and the Worthington brewery was closed in 1965. The beers continued to be brewed elsewhere, and Bass used the Worthington brand for its principal keg bitter offerings from the 1960s onward, first as Worthington E, then as Worthington Best Bitter from the 1980s, and Worthington Creamflow from the 1990s to the present.|$|E

6000|$|Mine was {{a little}} book about five by six inches called [...] "Herkimer's Handbook of Indispensable Information." [...] I may be wrong, but I {{think that was the}} {{greatest}} book that ever was written. I've got it to-day; and I can stump you or any man fifty times in five minutes with the information in it. Talk about Solomon or the New York /Tribune/! Herkimer had cases on both of 'em. That man must have put in fifty years and travelled a million miles to find out all that stuff. There was the population of all cities in it, and the way to tell a girl's age, and the number of teeth a camel has. It told you the longest tunnel in the world, the number of the stars, how long it takes for chicken pox to break out, what a lady's neck ought to measure, the veto powers of Governors, the dates of the Roman aqueducts, how many pounds of rice going without <b>three</b> <b>beers</b> a day would buy, the average annual temperature of Augusta, Maine, the quantity of seed required to plant an acre of carrots in drills, antidotes for poisons, the number of hairs on a blond lady's head, how to preserve eggs, the height of all the mountains in the world, and the dates of all wars and battles, and how to restore drowned persons, and sunstroke, and the number of tacks in a pound, and how to make dynamite and flowers and beds, and what to do before the doctor comes--and a hundred times as many things besides. If there was anything Herkimer didn't know I didn't miss it out of the book.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} gravity of a beer {{was the basis}} for determining taxation in both the UK and Ireland from 1880 until the late 20th century, and a legacy of that system remains in the largely arbitrary division of bitter into [...] "bitter", [...] "best bitter", and [...] "special bitter" [...] substyles. In continental Europe, the density of a beer in degrees Plato is sometimes used by a brewery to distinguish a particular beer produced in a line. For example, Rochefort Brewery produces <b>three</b> <b>beers,</b> all dissimilar in colour, flavour, and aroma; and sells them as Rochefort 6, Rochefort 8, and Rochefort 10, the numbers referring to the original gravities of the beers. Westvleteren Brewery, meanwhile, produces <b>three</b> <b>beers,</b> and calls them Blonde, 8, and 12.|$|E
