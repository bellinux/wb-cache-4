5|$|An inscribed stone listing <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> {{donated by}} the pharaoh for Abuwtiyuw's funeral was {{discovered}} by Egyptologist George A. Reisner in October 1935. It was apparently part of the spoil material incorporated into {{the structure of a}} SixthDynasty mastaba (pharaonic-era tomb) after the demolition of the funerary chapel belonging to Abuwtiyuw's owner, where the stone likely had originally been installed. The white limestone tablet measures 54.2×28.2×23.2cm (21.3×11.1×9.1in). The inscription is composed of ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated by vertical lines.|$|E
50|$|The donee {{must accept}} <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> {{in order for}} the {{property}} transfer to take place. However, because people generally accept gifts, acceptance will be presumed, so long as the donee does not expressly reject <b>the</b> <b>gift.</b> A rejection of <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> destroys <b>the</b> <b>gift,</b> so that a donee cannot revive a once-rejected gift by later accepting it. In order for such an acceptance to be effective, the donor would have to extend the offer of <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> again.|$|R

In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E

5|$|The myth's {{religious}} importance {{extended beyond}} the funerary sphere.

In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took {{on the role of}} Horus, <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> to the deity became the Eye of Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige died on 22 December 1060 and {{was buried}} at Peterborough, {{in what is}} now Peterborough Cathedral. After his death, he was honoured as a saint by the monks at Peterborough, {{although}} the cult {{does not seem to have}} spread far. His bones, along with those of his predecessor Ælfric Puttoc, were found in 1643. His reputation for sanctity and poverty was based on his actions, as he often traveled on foot, and spent much time preaching and giving alms. The Northumbrian Priests' Law which is usually attributed to Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York, might have been authored instead by Cynesige, or possibly Cynesige's predecessor Ælfric Puttoc. He gave gifts to Peterborough in his will, but <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> were taken by Queen Edith instead.|$|E

2500|$|Whether prophetic or not, however, Pentecostals are {{agreed that}} all public utterances in an unknown tongue must be {{interpreted}} {{in the language of}} the gathered Christians.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1956 the town came to {{national}} and worldwide attention, when Dr John Bodkin Adams, a general practitioner serving the town's wealthier patients, was arrested {{for the murder of}} an elderly widow.

Figures of up to 400 murders were reported in British and foreign newspapers, but after a controversial trial at the Old Bailey which gripped the nation for 17 days in March 1957, Adams was found not guilty. He was struck off for four years but resumed his practice in Eastbourne in 1961. According to Scotland Yard's archives, he is thought to have killed up to 163 patients in the Eastbourne area.|$|E

5|$|While parody {{sometimes}} {{served as}} {{a special kind of}} translation, some translations returned the compliment by providing a parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language. An extreme example was provided by the classicised French imitation by the Latin scholar John Roberts in 1875. In place of the plain English of Gray’s “And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave”, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cythère (All <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only the thinnest relation to the original.|$|E
5|$|Additional Native resentment {{resulted}} from Amherst's decision in February 1761 {{to cut back}} on <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> given to the Native Americans. Gift giving had been {{an integral part of the}} relationship between the French and the tribes of the pays d'en haut. Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier Vita, or Life, of Æthelthryth, which resembles the Vitae of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely. The work may have helped {{to increase the number of}} pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King Æthelred II (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift. The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the Liber would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation. The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the Liber.|$|E
