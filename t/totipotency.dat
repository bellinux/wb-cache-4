40|$|SummarySpecialized {{ribonucleoprotein}} organelles collectively {{known as}} germ granules {{are found in}} the germline cytoplasm from worms to humans [1]. In Drosophila, germ granules have been implicated in germline determination [2]. C.  elegans germ granules, known as P granules, {{do not appear to be}} required for primordial germ cell (PGC) determination [3], but their components are still needed for fertility [4 – 6]. One potential role for P granules is to maintain germline fate and <b>totipotency.</b> This is suggested by the loss of P granules from germ cells that transform into somatic cell types, e. g., in germlines lacking MEX- 3 and GLD- 1 or upon neuronal induction by CHE- 1 [7, 8]. However, it has not been established whether loss of P granules is the cause or effect of cell fate transformation. To test cause and effect, we severely compromised P granules by simultaneously knocking down factors that nucleate granule formation (PGL- 1 and PGL- 3) and promote their perinuclear localization (GLH- 1 and GLH- 4) [9] and investigated whether this causes germ cells to lose <b>totipotency</b> and initiate somatic reprogramming. We found that compromising P granules causes germ cells to express neuronal and muscle markers and send out neurite-like projections, suggesting that P granules maintain <b>totipotency</b> and germline identity by antagonizing somatic fate...|$|E
40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} is {{an example}} of induced cellular <b>totipotency,</b> where embryos develop from vegetative cells rather than from gamete fusion. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro by exposing explants to growth regulators and/or stress treatments. The BABY BOOM (BBM) and LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC 1) and LEC 2 transcription factors are key regulators of plant cell <b>totipotency,</b> as ectopic overexpression of either transcription factor induces somatic embryo formation from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings without exogenous growth regulators or stress treatments. Although LEC and BBM proteins regulate the same developmental process, it is not known whether they function in the same molecular pathway. We show that BBM transcriptionally regulates LEC 1 and LEC 2, as well as the two other LAFL genes, FUSCA 3 (FUS 3) and ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI 3). LEC 2 and ABI 3 quantitatively regulate BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis, while FUS 3 and LEC 1 are essential for this process. BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis is dose and context dependent, and the contextdependent phenotypes are associated with differential LAFL expression. We also uncover functional redundancy for somatic embryogenesis among other Arabidopsis BBM-like proteins and show that one of these proteins, PLETHORA 2, also regulates LAFL gene expression.

40|$|After {{fertilization}} terminally differentiated oocytes acquire <b>totipotency.</b> This {{property is}} maintained during early preimplantation development, but is lost around the late-preimplantation stage. The mechanism underlying acquisition {{and maintenance of}} the totipotent state remains largely unknown. Oocytes express the genes in their specific pattern during oogenesis. This pattern is drastically altered into zygote-specific one after fertilization and thereafter it is dynamically changed during preimplantation development. In general, gene expression is epigenetically regulated. When cells are divided, some epigenetic modifications are inherited from parental cells into daughter ones to maintain the gene expression pattern. This mechanism is called as "cell memory" and the epigenetic modifications inherited into the daughter cells {{are referred to as}} cell memory markers. As gene expression pattern is dynamically changed after fertilization, cell memory seems to be detrimental mechanisms for early preimplantation embryos to acquire and maintenance of <b>totipotency.</b> Therefore, I hypothesized that cell memory mechanisms might not function after fertilization. In this thesis, to understand the mechanism regulating the acquisition and maintenance of <b>totipotency</b> in the early preimplantation embryos, I examined the dynamic changes of Histone H 3 Lysine 79 dimethylation (H 3 K 79 me 2), a cell memory marker of the active genes, during oogenesis and preimplantation development, and then investigated the mechanisms that regulate H 3 K 79 me 2 during 1 - and 2 -cell stages. In Chapter 1, I show that H 3 K 79 me 2 was present during oocytes growth and maturation. However, it was eliminated just after fertilization and the H 3 K 79 hypomethylation state was sustained until 4 -cell stage. At the blastocyst stage H 3 K 79 me 2 increased. Therefore, it was possible that elimination of H 3 K 79 me 2 plays a role in acquisition of <b>totipotency.</b> To investigate the involvement of H 3 K 79 me 2 elimination in acquisition of <b>totipotency,</b> I examined H 3 K 79 me 2 in the somatic nuclei transplanted into enucleated unfertilized oocytes in which <b>totipotency</b> is acquired. H 3 K 79 me 2 was eliminated in the transplanted somatic nuclei soon after parthenogenetic activation. In contrast, the elimination of H 3 K 79 me 2 did not occur in the nuclei transplanted into the parthenogenetically activated embryos in which <b>totipotency</b> is not acquired. These results suggest that the erasing of H 3 K 79 me 2 is involved in the acquisition of <b>totipotency</b> after fertilization. In chapter 2, I examined the dynamics of Dot 1 L (Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1 like) which is thought to be sole H 3 K 79 methyltransferase to understand the mechanisms for maintenance of H 3 K 79 hypomethylation state during 1 - and 2 -cell stages. At 1 -cell stage, Dot 1 L was localized in the pronuclei. However ubiquitinated histone H 2 B (ubH 2 B), which is required for Dot 1 L-mediated H 3 K 79 methylation, was at a low level. On the other hand, at 2 -cell stage, although ubH 2 B was detected at a high level, Dot 1 L was exported from the nuclei by the mechanism involving its nuclear export domain 1 (NED 1) and 2 (NED 2). Thus, the absence of H 3 K 79 me 2 is maintained by different mechanisms during 1 - and 2 -cell stages. A Dot 1 L deletion mutant that lacks NED 1 and NED 2 (referred to as N 393 -NLS 1) is localized in nuclei at 2 -cell stage. Expression of N 393 -NLS 1 caused methylation of H 3 K 79 and developmental arrest at 2 -cell stage. These results suggest that 2 -cell stage-specific nuclear export of Dot 1 L is important for the maintenance of H 3 K 79 hypomethylation and the progression of preimplantation development. In conclusion, H 3 K 79 me 2 was eliminated after fertilization and sustained at a low level during 1 - and 2 -cell stage. These results suggest that <b>totipotency</b> is acquired by elimination of H 3 K 79 me 2 and maintained by the absence of H 3 K 79 me 2. 報告番号: 甲 28408; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(生命科学); 学位記番号: 博創域第 767 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科生命科学研究系先端生命科学専...|$|E
