The highway was paved as an [...] wide <b>tarred</b> <b>macadam</b> road from Elwood Avenue to Herring Run in 1910. The remainder of the road from Herring Run to Rossville was completed in concrete by 1921. In Cecil County, the Philadelphia Road was paved with a [...] wide macadam surface from the eastern town limit of North East to the western town limit of Elkton in 1913. The highway was paved in concrete from Perryville to Principio Creek and in macadam from there through Charlestown in 1914. The state road was paved in macadam from Charlestown to North East, including Cecil Avenue within the latter, in 1915. The section of the state road through Charlestown, which is now MD267, was bypassed with a concrete road that remained {{on the north side}} of the Pennsylvania Railroad by 1921.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} formed by Edgar Purnell Hooley as the <b>Tar</b> <b>Macadam</b> (Purnell Hooley's Patent) Syndicate Limited in 1903. The distinguishing {{feature of the}} new process was that it “tarred” cheap blast furnace slag, a steelworks by-product, rather than expensive roadstone and the Company entered into long term contracts with steelworks to ensure its supply.|$|R
50|$|The South of Ireland Asphalt Company (S.I.A.C.) {{was engaged}} in the {{surfacing}} of the Straight, and the concrete was hand laid. After {{the closure of the}} Muskerry Tram, the tracks were removed in 1935, and the area they occupied was then concreted, adding about 10 ft to the width of the road. In recent years, Cork Corporation has covered this section with <b>tar</b> <b>macadam,</b> but the section outside the city still has the original concrete, and the extra width of concrete laid after the tram tracks were removed. This can be seen {{on the south side of}} the road.|$|R
5000|$|Asphalt may be {{confused}} with coal tar, which is a visually similar black, thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal. During the early and mid-20th century, when town gas was produced, coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of coal <b>tar</b> to <b>macadam</b> roads led to the word [...] "tarmac", which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the La Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian oil sands, both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar. [...] "Pitch" [...] is another term sometimes informally used at times to refer to asphalt, as in Pitch Lake.|$|R
5000|$|By 1914, Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company {{had many}} {{contracts}} in hand, including 70,000 feet of asphalte roofing at HM Stationery Office; damp courses, floors and roofs at British American Tobacco Company's warehouse and W.H. Smith & Sons new printing works. Their expanding business necessitated moving to bigger premises, {{with their new}} offices at No. 3 Central Buildings, Westminster. [...] "They also entered another business - that of <b>tarred</b> slag <b>macadam</b> - under the title of Clarmac Roads, Ltd", with offices at the same address. Clarmac Roads was a subsidiary company promoted by Claridge's Asphalte Co to manufacture the materials and registered on 14 September 1914. With increasing motor traffic, the directors of Claridge's Asphalte Co {{thought there was a}} future for the construction of roads using the tar-bound macadam method, (now commonly known as tarmac) and invested a substantial amount of funds in the new company, borrowing money to do so. Two products resulted, namely Clarmac, and Clarphalte, with the former being manufactured by Clarmac Roads and the latter by Claridge's Patent Asphalte Co., although Clarmac was more widely used. Scott's Lane, Beckenham; Dorset Street, Marylebone; Lordswood Road, Birmingham; Hearsall Lane, Coventry; Valkyrie Avenue, Westcliff-on-Sea; and Lennard Road, Penge were photographed as [...] "some amongst many laid with 'Clarmac'" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{existing}} platform {{was one of}} two installed in 1892 replacing the 1873 originals which were on a slightly different alignment. Both the original platforms, and the 1892 replacements were half-height, but latter were raised to full height about 1904. It should be noted the platforms are not quite perpendicular to the alignment of the booking hall. In 1909 iron canopies were erected covering the circulating area west of the main station building and both platforms for the majority of their length. These suffered from corrosion in the secondary structural members latterly, and were demolished during the initial rationalisation of the site in 1979-80. At this time too the former Port Erin platforms were demolished {{to make way for a}} bus parking area. The Port Erin platforms were situated to the south of the surviving ones. The platforms had <b>tar</b> <b>macadam</b> surfacing with stone edging. The platform edges themselves were picked out with whitewash from 1940 onwards., Initially this was due to the blackout, but it was found to be so helpful that the custom has been maintained ever since. The platform is accessed by passengers via a gate at the station end installed in the early 1980s. For many years this was usually kept closed between trains, but at the present time, the gate is usually left open but with a sign saying [...] "Platform Closed" [...] placed in the entrance. During the railway's annual transport festivals the platforms are occasionally open to the public for limited periods. The platforms are currently unnumbered, but in former times the northern face was number 1 and 3, and the southern 2 and 4 to assist passengers and porters in finding the Peel and Ramsey portions of combined trains to and from these destinations. The end of the platform features two semaphore signals, installed in 2005 themselves replacing two colour light signals - mounted on the 1892 Dutton post of the former Peel starting signal - that replaced original semaphores in 1983. The 2005 replacements originate from the Festiniog Railway in Wales. The platform also features cast iron lamp standards installed in 1991 when the station was refurbished, going on to win an Ian Allen Heritage Award, returning the surviving platform to something close to its mid Edwardian state. Prior to 1909, the platforms featured similar lamp posts, though these were lit by gas rather than today's versions which are electrically lit. The sloped end of the platform was modified in more recent times so that one side now features a more gradual slope which leads to the signal box and workshop facilities by way of a concrete catwalk installed in 2001 for health and safety purposes, a further pathway being connected to the foot of the signal box steps.|$|R
