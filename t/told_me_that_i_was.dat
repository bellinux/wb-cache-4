25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several elaborate CGI scenes. The {{first scene}} with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they came to me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated. Not because I wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad." [...] Manners later called it one of his [...] "favorite scenes [...] ever directed" [...] and one of the [...] "best scenes [...] {{seen in a long time}} on television." ...|$|E
5000|$|When they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> (<b>that)</b> <b>I</b> won the contest, I cried, but I didn't faint. (compound-complex sentence) ...|$|R
60|$|One look at {{her face}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could trust her. I {{addressed}} myself again to Mr. Bruff.|$|R
60|$|Benjamin {{looked down}} again at his plate, with a rueful {{resignation}} which <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had carried my point.|$|R
500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E
2500|$|French {{has claimed}} that her {{self-confidence}} and self-belief stem from her father, {{who told her}} how beautiful she was each day. She stated, [...] "He taught me to value myself. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> beautiful and the most precious thing in his life." [...] He {{had a history of}} severe depression and attempted suicides but managed to conceal his illness from Dawn and her brother.|$|E
2500|$|His first movie, 12 Angry Men, was an auspicious {{beginning}} for Lumet. It {{was a critical}} success and established Lumet as a director skilled at adapting theatrical properties to motion pictures. For US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, seeing the film {{for the first time}} was a pivotal moment in her life, as she was at that time considering a career in law. [...] "It <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on the right path," [...] she said. Fully half of Lumet's complement of films have originated in the theater.|$|E
60|$|However, {{his opening}} remark <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been {{alarming}} myself unduly. It {{was of a}} pacific nature, and came as a great relief.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to live rightly, and be regular in {{attendance}} upon {{the services of}} the Church. And it <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must go to France." ...|$|R
5000|$|A typical Hal Roach joke is as follows: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a cult following, {{at least}} <b>I</b> think <b>that's</b> what he said".|$|R
2500|$|After she {{had arrived}} in the United States in 1989 with Panait, Comăneci stated, [...] "Constantin <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to live with his wife and {{children}} for a bit. I never questioned him." [...] Her arrival initially generated some negative press, however, {{as a result of the}} media's misrepresentation of her relationship with Panait. Comăneci later stated in her memoir that her response of [...] "so what?" [...] to a reporter's comment that Panait was married was due to her poor command of the English language at the time:Constantin had offered to help me defect, and I'd accepted. I assumed that his wife knew that he was going to help a handful of Romanians get out of the country and that I was one of them. But what people took from my answer was that I was a home-wrecker. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In hindsight, I understand that I'd made a very poor choice of words. Constantin had plans to become my personal manager upon our arrival in the United States. I didn't know that, but he promised to help me get settled, and I guess I just accepted his involvement in my future career as fair payment for the risks he'd taken. People died every day trying to defect.|$|E
60|$|Fost. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{the nearest}} the Papists of any, {{and that he}} would {{convince}} me of immediately.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your pardon, master," [...] said Martin. [...] "I {{know it was}} careless; {{my mother}} always <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> careless, but so was my father before me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My father {{reminded}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{twenty-one years}} old, last birthday--and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do as I liked. I understood him, and I left the house." ...|$|R
60|$|Fost. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{made people}} neglect their calling; and that God had {{commanded}} {{people to work}} six days, and serve Him on the seventh.|$|R
60|$|WISE MAN. Ah, now <b>I</b> know <b>that</b> you are Teigue the Fool. You have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am wise, and I {{have never}} seen an angel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{glad you}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the first. I {{should have thought}} you'd had {{a good deal of}} {{experience}} in flirtation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he {{answered}} passionately. [...] "You know that I am not. Do {{you remember when}} you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> good for nothing, that I lacked purpose?" ...|$|E
60|$|With renewed courage I felt my {{way before}} me, till {{my sense of}} touch <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at the screen behind which lay the stair to the Crypt.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was, sir. When she handled {{her silver}} ornament, she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might depend {{on her to}} forget nothing, and {{to be afraid of}} nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes!" [...] she answered; [...] "I {{remember}} you quite well! Your name is Philip, isn't it? You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might call you by it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} he will, Macumazahn, for this reason--he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should meet you and love you, and {{that you would be}} mixed up in my fortunes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think there}} are spirits in this place," [...] {{he said with a}} German oath. [...] "I could have sworn that {{something}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to die. Mount!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} last night," [...] said I, [...] "that she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{the only man}} in all this earth that she could ever bring herself to love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, smiling; [...] "my work's out yonder. I couldn't sit idle. I think Miss Gladwyne hit it {{when she}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one of the pioneers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} the time, Rachel," [...] I said, [...] "when {{you could have}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had offended you, in a worthier way than <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> beg your pardon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} glad to do so, at once. Mr. Ross has kindly <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am at liberty to resign my post, under him, as soon as I like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{might come}} to tea," [...] he {{reminded}} her. [...] "If you're expecting any one else, or I'm in the way at all, don't mind saying so, please!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have only}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{one of two}} good Americans," [...] said Cheyne, with a quiet smile which the girl found reassuring. [...] "Now, you don't want to send me away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is a case}} {{somewhere to}} be found," [...] he admitted. [...] "His Excellency <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to refuse you nothing, but he advises you to drink only the white wine until his return." ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{a glimpse}} of Jeeves as {{we went into the}} flat, sitting in his lair, and I wished I could have called to him to rally round. Something <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about to need him.|$|E
60|$|But when Hester {{returned}} {{and found out}} about Hugh she was very angry--and grieved, which hurt me far more. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had forgotten myself and that Hugh's visits must cease.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you are condemned? When you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should be}} your wife, and then told your father the same story, was I to think it all meant nothing! Have you deceived me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Amedroz {{knows all}} about it already, and has given me his consent. I asked him {{directly}} I had made up my own mind, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might go to you." ...|$|R
