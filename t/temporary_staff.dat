40|$|This paper {{examines}} the changing {{structure of the}} UK <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry. It argues that despite the research produced recently on the different non-standard employment contracts, such as fixed-term, part-time and temporary work, relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry as an industry in itself. In light of this perceived gap in the literature, this paper first separates out the evolution of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry in to three periods.

But subsequent revisions steadily expanded its range of application. Notably, the 1999 revision replaced the [...] "white list" [...] with a short [...] "black list" [...] of occupations where <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> remained restricted.

40|$|The <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> {{industry}} has experienced significant growth {{in recent decades}} across many countries and sectors. The particular characteristics of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry {{are influenced by the}} national institutional context in which they are embedded. This article presents empirical findings to investigate of the concept of a national <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry using two case studies, the UK and Germany. Through analysis of two national markets for <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> the article discusses the importance of investigating the wider institutional environment in which an industry is embedded, the interactions and interdependencies between the actors involved, and the relationships and activities through which an industry is co-created and constituted. Theoretically, this seeks to stress the importance of considering how institutional systems change, rather than focusing on characteristics used to categorise socio-economic systems. Empirically, this article reveals the features and developments of two national <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industries within Europe. This advances of our understanding of changes in the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry in two European settings, but also highlights the importance of considering geographically specific national varieties of economic systems as dynamic institutional ecologies...|$|R

40|$|During the 1990 s the UK <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> {{industry}} experienced almost unbroken year-on-year growth. Alongside this quantitative expansion {{the type}} of business performed by some UK <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies has begun to change, as some larger agencies have attempted {{to move out of}} the clerical and light industrial segments and into higher value-added markets. Other agencies have sought to add human resource services to their more-traditional recruitment and placement functions. All in all, the UK industry [...] the second largest in the world after the United States [...] has undergone widespread restructuring in the last decade. I argue that the recent growth in the UK industry constitutes a regularisation of flexible employment, as casual and fixed-term contracts are replaced by more formal arrangements involving a third party [...] the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agency. Drawing upon global and national data and forty semi-structured interviews with agency owners and managers in the United Kingdom, I analyse the multidimensional growth and restructuring of the UK <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry. I argue that as the UK industry 'matures' we are witnessing a degree of deepening in relations between <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies and client firms. More broadly, I argue that the growth of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry has conceptual implications for how economic geographers theorise 'the firm' and explore the globalisation of service activities. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper does three things. First it {{reviews the}} {{existing}} conceptual {{work on the}} expansionary strategies of producer services and argues that while illuminating it has paid insufficient attention to {{the implications of the}} internationalization/diversification of <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies, the effects of which are not limited to the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry but also bleed into a host of other manufacturing and service industries. Second, and in light of this, it profiles the internationalization and diversification strategies of leading <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies. It argues that while, on the one hand, the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry exhibits the characteristics of a classic producer service sector, on the other hand, its product [...] labour [...] distinguishes it in part from the likes of the accounting, advertising, and legal sectors. Its wider political-economic implications, in this case, are the ways in which agency strategies affect labour markets at a range of geographical scales, and how this is best understood. Third, and finally, the paper argues that the growth of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> is the result of, and a contributing factor to, the on-going restructuring of national and urban labour markets. In going about their business, <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies contribute, so the paper argues, to the neo-liberalization of national and urban economies, and in doing so create conditions favourable to their continued growth.

2500|$|It is {{important}} that those interested in a Chemistry degree understand the variety of roles available to them (on average), which vary depending on education and job experience. Those Chemists who hold a bachelor's degree are most commonly involved in positions related to either research assistance (working {{under the guidance of}} senior chemists in a research-oriented activity), or, alternatively, they may work on distinct (chemistry-related) aspects of a business/organization/enterprise, including aspects that involve quality control, quality assurance, manufacturing/production, formulation, inspection, method validation, visitation for troubleshooting of chemistry-related instruments, regulatory affairs, [...] "on-demand" [...] technical services, chemical analysis for non-research purposes (e.g. as a legal request, for testing purposes, or for government or non-profit agencies); chemists may also work in environmental evaluation & assessment. Other jobs/roles may include sales and marketing of chemical products and chemistry-related instruments, and/or technical writing. The more experience obtained, the more independence & leadership/management roles these chemists may perform in those organizations. Some chemists with relatively higher experience might change jobs or job position to become a manager of a chemistry-related enterprise, a supervisor, an entrepreneur or a chemistry consultant. Other chemists choose to combine their education and/or experience as a chemist with a distinct credential to provide different services (e.g. forensic chemists, chemistry-related software development, patent law specialists, environmental law firm staff, scientific news reporting staff, engineering design staff, etc.)... In comparison, Chemists who have obtained a Master of Science (M.S.) in Chemistry or in a very related discipline may find chemist roles that allow them to enjoy more independence, leadership and/or responsibility earlier in their careers (with less years of experience than those with a bachelor's degree as highest degree); Sometimes, M.S. chemists receive more complex tasks duties, in comparison with the roles/positions found by chemists with a bachelor's degree as their highest academic degree and with the same or close-to-same years of job experience. Although good chemists without a PhD. degree but with relatively many years of experience may be allowed some applied research positions, the general rule is that PhD. chemists are preferred for research positions and are typically the preferred choice for the highest administrative positions on big enterprises involved in Chemistry-related duties. Some positions, especially research oriented, will only allow those chemists who are PhD. holders. Jobs that involve intensive research and actively seek to lead the discovery of completely new chemical products under specifically assigned monetary funds & resources, or jobs that seek to develop new scientific theories, require a Ph.D. more often than not. Chemists with a PhD. as the highest academic degree are found typically on the R department of an enterprise, and can also hold university positionsΉ as professors. Some smaller colleges, [...] as well as Community Colleges, usually hire chemists with M.S. as professors too (and rarely, some universities who need part-time or temporary instructors, or <b>temporary</b> <b>staff),</b> but when the positions are scarce and the applicants are many, they might prefer PhD. holders instead.|$|E

40|$|Shifting {{the burden}} for {{unemployment}} insurance: business cycles, business strategies, and the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry The advent of labor flexibility—regarded as {{a hallmark of}} the New Economy—was widely heralded during the nearly decade-long economic expansion of the 1990 s for helping U. S. firms achieve competitive advantages. In labor markets, flexibility has been achieved via the proliferation of contingent staffing arrangements such as independent contracting, on-call workers, and especially employment through <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies. The phenomenal growth of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry (TSI) was one of the defining features of the 1990 s economic expansion, coming as it did {{on the heels of the}} 1980 s when the number of <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies operating in U.
