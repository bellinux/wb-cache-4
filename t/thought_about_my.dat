About studying acting full-time, he stated, [...] "It wasn't until I was 22 that I ever <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> hobby being something I {{could make a}} living out of. As a boy, I'd always {{had an interest in}} theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that. I found the courage to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'." [...] After completing [...] "The Journey", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera Neighbours but turned it down to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.|$|E

Liddle at first attributed {{some of the comments}} to opposition fans logging in under his name to embarrass him. He later admitted he had written some of the posts that were being criticised, including one in support of the BNP excluding Black and Asian people from the party.

I thought about me and my friends sitting around at slumber parties in the 90's, giddy even just THINKING about boys..... I thought about what Benny said and I listened to the song again, and I was like The Teenagers..... that's such a great word, Teenager. It is a very descriptive word; it packs a lot of emotion and imagery into three syllables..... I couldn't believe after all of our agonizing over 'youth' themes, that we had overlooked such an obvious one – the teenage condition." [...] The following week, Perry invited McKee, Luke, and Martin to write at her hometown of Santa Barbara, California. McKee tried to approach Luke about her idea, but he was upset {{about the amount of}} time he had spent working in the chorus, so he banned them from changing it.

He was plainly blind, for he tapped before him with a stick, and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge old tattered sea-cloak with a hood, that made him appear positively deformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure. He stopped a little from the inn, and, raising his voice in an odd sing-song, addressed the air in front of him:-- ...|$|R

Sordid and selfish as I knew it was, and as I tortured myself by knowing that it was, to let my mind run on my own distress so much, I was so devoted to Dora that I could not help it. I knew that it was base in me not to think more of my aunt, and less of myself; but, so far, selfishness was inseparable from Dora, and I could not put Dora on one side for any mortal creature.

30|$|The celebrity {{attitude}} scale (CAS; McCutcheon et al. 2002). The CAS is a 34 -item measure in which respondents {{are asked to}} indicate their attitude toward their favorite celebrity on a 5 -point scale (1  = Strongly disagree; 5  = Strongly agree). During an oral instruction about the questionnaires, {{participants were asked to}} select a same-sex living celebrity whose body/figure they liked and admired, similar to previous research (Maltby and Day 2011). Among Western samples, the scale has been found to have a three-factor structure comprising Entertainment-social (e.g., “Keeping up with news <b>about</b> <b>my</b> favorite celebrity is an entertaining pastime”), Intense-personal (e.g., “To know my favorite celebrity is to love him/her”), and Borderline-pathological (e.g., “I have frequent <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> favorite celebrity, even when I don’t want to”). Because previous studies with non-Western samples (e.g., Swami et al. 2012 b) showed that the three components of the CAS were highly correlated with one another, this study used an overall CAS score for data analysis. Cronbach’s coefficient alphas for the overall CAS were Korea = . 94 and US = . 93.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into six {{chapters}} covering my evolution as an artist. The introduction features the growth and awareness I have attained, spanning the past three years, since I arrived at graduate school. Chapter One discusses my approach {{to the character of}} Anna while Chapter Two focuses on my research of Aphasia and Astronomy as they relate to the script of Night Sky. Chapter Three explores the audition and rehearsal processes and the outcome of those processes as experienced in the performance. In Chapter Four, I reflect on the experience of Night Sky and examine ways I could have possibly made my performance better. Finally, Chapter Five exposes final <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> present state and future plans.
