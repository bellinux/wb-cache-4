5|$|Barkley gets {{a police}} permit to raid <b>the</b> <b>Buyers</b> Club, but {{can do nothing}} but give Woodroof a fine. In 1987, the FDA changes its {{regulations}} such that any unapproved drug is also illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with <b>the</b> <b>Buyers</b> Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists {{that she would have}} to be fired.|$|E
5|$|Salinger then accompanies Wexler to Istanbul, where Skarssen {{is buying}} the crucial {{components}} from their only other manufacturer. Salinger attempts {{to record the}} conversation {{so that he can}} obstruct the deal by proving to <b>the</b> <b>buyers</b> that the missiles will be useless, but he ultimately fails. Both Wexler and Skarssen are then killed by a hitman contracted by Enzo and Mario Calvini to avenge their father's murder by the bank. Salinger is left stunned, his investigation, pursuit, and determination to bring down the IBBC, have led him to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{works were}} not usually {{produced}} on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images {{that would be}} most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or <b>the</b> <b>buyers</b> could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in {{certain areas of the}} major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.|$|E

40|$|I {{illustrate}} the surprising strategic effects {{a lack of}} common knowledge can have in a simple example. I analyze a two-person bargaining game in which the seller makes a single take-it-or-leave-it offer. The seller knows everything except possibly what information <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> has. If it is common knowledge that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> knows <b>the</b> value of the object {{or if it is}} common knowledge that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> does not know the value, then <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> expected payoffis zero. However, if the seller does not know what <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> knows, then <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> may be able to obtain some of the gains from trade. In the exogenous information case, where there is a fixed probability q that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> is informed, if q is far enough from zero and one, <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> expected payoff is strictly positive. However, if the seller is almost sure of what <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> knows, <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> expected payoff is zero. Surprisingly, the endogenous information case, where, after seeing the seller's offer, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> decides whether or not to become informed, is quite different. If the cost of obtaining information is zero, we get the same outcome as it is common knowledge that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> is informed. However, if the cost of obtaining the information is small but strictly positive, <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> payoff is strictly positive. As the cost goes to zero, the limit of <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> payoff is strictly positive and may even be virtually all of the gains from trade. 2...|$|R
50|$|Realistically, {{at the end}} of {{the blanket}} order contract, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> would not buy at {{forecasted}} quantity as agreed in the contract say, 80% of the demand sent to <b>the</b> supplier. <b>The</b> <b>buyer</b> will also allow the supplier to sell the products in the contract to reduce the quantity. The supplier also has to talk and inform <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> <b>the</b> quantities of goods kept in order that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> could know <b>the</b> status of the stock. Before <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> issuing <b>the</b> purchase order to supplier, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> must ask <b>the</b> supplier first about stock availability to avoid the problem from no stock availability.|$|R
5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. <b>The</b> <b>buyers</b> were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney, and Saul Silberman, owner of the Randall Park race track. McBride had been called in 1950 {{to testify before the}} Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed his ties to mafia figures but did not result in any charges. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia may {{have played a role in}} his decision to get out of football.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of his fortune, however, came from moneylending. Up until their expulsion in 1290, the major moneylenders in England were Jews, who were not covered by Christian bans on usury. During the reign of Henry III, however, the Jews were taxed at extortionate rates, and many were forced to sell acquired debts at reduced prices. These debts were lucrative, because <b>the</b> <b>buyers</b> were not bound by the existing contract. They could demand higher rates, or sometimes even take forfeit in land. Stratton {{was one of the}} greater beneficiaries of the opportunities offered by trading in Jewish debts. From at least 1271 he was also associated with the Riccardi, a major Italian financier family.|$|E
5|$|After his death, {{the court}} ruled that Van Meegeren’s estate be {{auctioned}} and the proceeds from his property and the sale of his counterfeits be used to refund <b>the</b> <b>buyers</b> of his works and to pay income taxes on the sale of his paintings. Van Meegeren filed for bankruptcy in December 1945. On 5 and 6 September 1950, the furniture and other possessions in his Amsterdam house at Keizersgracht 321 were auctioned by order of the court, along with 738 other pieces of furniture and works of art, including numerous paintings by old and new masters from his private collection. The house was auctioned separately on 4 September, estimated to be worth 65,000 guilders. The proceeds of the sale together with the house amounted to 123,000 guilders. Van Meegeren’s unsigned The Last Supper I was bought for 2,300 guilders, while Jesus among the Doctors (which van Meegeren had painted while in detention) sold for 3,000 guilders (about $800 or about $7,000 today.) Today the painting hangs in a Johannesburg church. The sale of the entire estate amounted to 242,000 guilders ($60,000, or about $500,000 today).|$|E
50|$|In the {{simplest}} setting, the seller {{has a single}} item to sell (with zero cost), {{and there is a}} single potential <b>buyer.</b> <b>The</b> highest price that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> is willing to pay for the item is called the valuation of <b>the</b> <b>buyer.</b> <b>The</b> seller would like to set the price exactly at <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> valuation. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> seller does not know <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> valuation. In <b>the</b> Bayesian model, it is assumed that <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> valuation is a random variable drawn from a known probability distribution.|$|R

5|$|Following {{its premiere}} in early September at the Toronto International Film Festival, The Shawshank Redemption began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood {{tradition}} of visiting different theaters {{on opening night}} to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the Cinerama Dome, but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if <b>the</b> <b>buyers</b> {{did not like the}} film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund. While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the Los Angeles Times pushed crowds away. It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy Exit to Eden ($3 million), and just ahead of Quiz Show ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. The film closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. It was considered a box office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors' cuts.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers had interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors {{for the film}} and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. However, Woodroof did lose all his friends after they {{found out he was}} HIV-positive. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through <b>the</b> <b>buyers</b> club, led to a rethinking of his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people. Other people who knew him said that he did not harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. Also, while a rodeo enthusiast, he never rode any bulls himself. Although the film shows Woodroof diagnosed in 1985, he told Borten that a doctor had informed him he might have had the disease well before that; Woodroof believed that he may have been infected in 1981, something that was briefly alluded to in a flashback in the film.|$|E
5|$|To sustain this {{military}} machine and meet other state expenses, {{large amounts of}} revenue were necessary. Greater Poland had some natural resources used for trade, such as fur, hide, honey and wax, but those surely did not provide enough income. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Prague in Bohemia, a city built of stone, was the main center for the exchange of trading commodities {{in this part of}} Europe. From Kraków, the Slavic traders brought tin, salt, amber and whatever other products they had, most importantly slaves; Muslim, Jewish, Hungarian and other traders were <b>the</b> <b>buyers.</b> The Life of St. Adalbert, written {{at the end of the}} 10th century by John Canaparius, records the fate of many Christian slaves sold in Prague as the main curse of the time. Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th-century Gniezno Doors. It may well be that the territorial expansion financed itself by being the source of loot, of which the captured local people were the most valuable part. The scale of the human trade practice is arguable, however, because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near-gord settlements, where they could serve the victors in various capacities and thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state. Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and central Europe. The slave trade not insufficient to meet all revenue needs, the Piast state had to look for other options.|$|E
5000|$|A crossclaim is a {{pleading}} {{made against}} a party {{who is a}} co-defendant or co-plaintiff. A cross claim is against anyone who is [...] "on {{the same side of}} the lawsuit". An example of this is manufacturing company who ships their product through a 3rd party transportation company to <b>the</b> <b>buyer.</b> Upon <b>the</b> products being inspected by <b>the</b> <b>buyer,</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> finds that <b>the</b> product has been damaged in shipping and refuses to pay. If the manufacturer sued <b>the</b> <b>buyer,</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> would serve an answer with a denial that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> owed money to the manufacturer and a crossclaim to the shipping company to compensate for the damages.|$|R

40|$|When two sellers {{negotiate}} {{terms of}} trade with a common <b>buyer,</b> <b>the</b> order in which the negotiations occur can affect <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> payoff. This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> may have preferences over which seller to negotiate with first. We find that when the efficient outcome calls for <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> to purchase from only one seller, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> weakly prefers to negotiate first with the inefficient seller, and when the efficient outcome calls for <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> to purchase from both sellers, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> prefers to negotiate first with the seller that has less bargaining power, or offers a smaller stand-alone surplus, all else being equal. These conclusions hold whether or not penalty clauses are feasible. Â© 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{agricultural}} products that are sold in Sweden are imported because Sweden cannot meet the consumers agriculture products demand all year around. One problem that can occur and become problematic when trading across boarders is if there are errors in the delivered agricultural products. What must <b>the</b> Swedish <b>buyer</b> do, for example, make for it to be considered complained fault in the goods against the seller? Another problem in international trade is that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> may need to apply complaint rules they have not previously been in contact with since their domestic law is not always applicable to the contract. To avoid getting into this situation, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> should try to negotiate with the seller that the contracting parties shall use compensation claim rules that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> is familiar with, or which is even more advantageous than to the seller. This so that <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> is not likely to neglect their right to sanctions against the seller. Since there are many different compensations claim rules to choose from for a buyer, it will be investigated in this paper which of the complaint rules of KöpL, CISG and the DCFR that is most advantageous complaint claims for <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> regarding complaints of agricultural products. The paper will discuss and compare the complaint rules in KöpL, CISG and the DCFR about the risk of agriculture products, <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> duty, <b>the</b> <b>buyer’s</b> complaint period and the content and form of a message. With the help of discussion, it will appear that the KöpL has the most advantageous compensation claim rules for <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> when <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> is complaining about the delivered agricultural products to the seller. This because KöpL is most beneficial for <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> regarding when <b>the</b> risk of agricultural products shall be deemed to pass to <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> and <b>the</b> criterion concerning the content of <b>the</b> <b>buyer’s</b> complaint...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} the integrated inventory models with permissible delay in payment, in which customers' demand {{is sensitive to}} <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> price. <b>The</b> models consider the two-level trade credit policy in the vendor-buyer and buyer-customer relationships in supply chain management. A simple recursive solution procedure is proposed for the integrated models to determine <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> optimal pricing and production/order strategy. Although the total profit from <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> and vendor increases together, <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> share lessens. To compensate <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> loss due to the cooperative relationship, a negotiation system is presented in order to allocate the profit increase to <b>the</b> vendor and <b>buyer</b> to determine <b>the</b> pricing and production/order strategy. A numerical example and sensitivity analysis are provided to illustrate the proposed model.

30|$|The Card deal also {{demonstrates}} capability design approach. <b>The</b> <b>buyer</b> used <b>the</b> evaluation {{to identify}} opportunities to gain synergies with its existing wireless business. <b>The</b> <b>buyer</b> first investigated what resources and capabilities (<b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> called them “R&C”) they {{needed in the}} era of technological and market convergence. Next, they examined how much it would cost to acquire the resources and capabilities. If the cost was within the budget predetermined at the last period, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> would consider investing; otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> would wait. <b>The</b> <b>buyer</b> used such valuation processes to formulate investment targets, determine required resources, and settle on potential investment. This approach is similar to an exploration tool (March, 1991), while strikingly different from the use of standard financial models to evaluate investment opportunities with given cash flows and size. Instead, the valuation process formulates cash flow and investment size conditional on <b>the</b> <b>buyer’s</b> goals.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{integrated}} approach considering {{the view of}} both <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> and <b>the</b> vendor is discussed in this study.
