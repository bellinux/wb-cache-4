Two remaining bidders took the bid past £2 million; the winning bidder, an anonymous UK resident and fine art collector bidding by phone, paid a total of £2,330,468.75 including the buyer's premium and VAT. The outcome aroused controversy and prompted calls for the Treasure Act to be revised, though British Archaeology noted that {{the circumstances of the}} helmet's discovery may have resulted in it being outside the scope of even a revised act.

They purchased and maintained the rolling stock—6,000 locomotives were in operation in 1880, which averaged 51,600 passengers {{a year or}} 21,200 tons of freight. Much of the equipment was imported from Britain and therefore did not stimulate machinery makers. Although starting the whole system at once was politically expedient, it delayed completion, and forced even more reliance on <b>temporary</b> <b>exports</b> brought in from Britain. Financing was also a problem. The solution was a narrow base of funding through the Rothschilds and the closed circles of the Bourse in Paris, so France did not develop {{the same kind of}} national stock exchange that flourished in London and New York. The system did help modernize the parts of rural France it reached, but it did not help create local industrial centers. Critics such as Émile Zola complained that it never overcame the corruption of the political system, but rather contributed to it.|$|R

50|$|In {{the course}} of the Cole inquiry into {{allegations}} that AWB paid kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq for wheat shipments under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program, it was revealed that the WEA board, upon hearing of the allegations through media sources, asked AWB(I) to show them Iraq wheat sales contracts. The WEA had limited powers and resources, far below those of the Cole Inquiry, and its examination of material provided to it by AWB at that time failed to reveal information of concern. During the Inquiry the Grain Board of Iraq ceased to deal with AWB. This resulted in the establishment of the Wheat Australia consortium to export wheat to Iraq in 2006, with special approval from the WEA and Australian Government. The <b>temporary</b> wheat <b>export</b> arrangements allow other exporters to apply for consents to export in bulk.

50|$|In 1987, {{as part of}} a major {{programme}} of repairs and reordering, a massive white polished stone altar commissioned from the sculptor Henry Moore by churchwarden Peter Palumbo was installed in the centre of the church. Its unusual positioning required the authorisation of a rare judgment of the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved. Benjamin West's Devout men taking away the body of St Stephen, previously hung on the north interior wall, was put into storage following the reordering. This decision was controversial, as the initial removal of the painting was illegal. In 2013 the church was given permission to sell the painting to a foundation, despite opposition from the London Diocesan Advisory Committee for the Care of Churches, and by the Church of England's Church Buildings Council. Prior to the painting's export, a <b>temporary</b> <b>export</b> bar was placed on it to give it a last chance to stay in the UK. The foundation has since loaned it to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which has undertaken restoration work on the painting.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{literature}} on productive internationalisation (international fragmentation, global value chains, channel perspective, {{are some of}} the terms used to describe this more general phenomenon) has focused on strategies based on non equity inter firms relations, involving both single firms and local production systems. While equity-based forms of internationalisation have been amply analysed, {{there is a lack of}} information on the extension and characteristics of non equity-based forms. The intra-industry trade stemming from non equity relations has been studied with reference to different types of empirical evidence: some early efforts were based on the analysis of <b>temporary</b> import <b>export</b> flows; later contributions analysed bilateral trade flows, in the light of the sequence of the production phases, aggregated at the minimum geographical scale available. In this paper we propose a new methodology that extends the latter approach by considering micro data instead of aggregated information.
