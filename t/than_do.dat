40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the role of some key characteristics of teachers in the development of students' musical ability. Interviewing 257 children who differed in the extent of their instrumental mastery, we discovered that the most successful learners regarded their teachers differently from those children who ceased music study. The more successful learners rated their first teacher higher <b>than</b> <b>did</b> other learners on personal dimensions such as friendliness, and rated their current teacher higher <b>than</b> <b>did</b> other learners on task-oriented professional dimensions such as pushiness. Additionally, the highly successful learners studied, on average, with more teachers <b>than</b> <b>did</b> the other learners; these learners also generally received more individual instruction <b>than</b> <b>did</b> the children who eventually ceased lessons. These findings confirm the importance of matching teacher characteristics to the changing requirements of learners in enabling the development of high levels of musical expertise. © 1998 by Music Educators National Conference...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more <b>than</b> <b>do</b> men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women.

5|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the archaeal glycerol moiety is {{the mirror}} image of that found in other organisms. The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers. Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left-handed glove, enantiomers of one type generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the other. The archaeal phospholipids are built on a backbone of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an enantiomer of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the phospholipid backbone found in bacteria and eucaryotes. This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids <b>than</b> <b>do</b> bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, indicating an early split from the other two domains.|$|E
