5|$|In 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} ever {{recorded in the}} United States struck Anchorage and southern Alaska, cutting communications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. The quake was felt in Fairbanks, and it took 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle. When the connection was restored, the News-Miner sent the first reports of the earthquake <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. The quake also destroyed {{the offices of the}} Anchorage Times, the leading newspaper in that city. The News-Miner offered its press facilities to the Times, and the two papers shared a masthead as Anchorage recovered from the tremor.|$|E
5|$|In August 1649 {{a wooden}} {{staircase}} was built <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> {{wall of the}} tower and an open iron fire grate affixed to the top. Originally it was planned to burn coal in the lighthouse, but due to high transport costs of coal, wood was used instead.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Mongolian line, {{connecting}} Ulan-Ude on the Trans-Siberian with China's Erenhot via the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, both {{serves as}} a crucial link <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world for landlocked Mongolia, and the shortest connection between the Trans-Siberian Railway and Beijing. This line's capacity, however, is limited by its being single-track.|$|E

5|$|The data pins in the {{standard}} plugs are actually recessed in the plug compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> power pins. This permits the power pins to connect first, preventing data errors by allowing the device to power up first and then establish the data connection. Also, some devices operate in different modes {{depending on whether the}} data connection is made.|$|E
5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70Â° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{structure}} {{would have}} {{four or more}} central posts planted {{in the ground and}} connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.|$|E

5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of {{a few months in}} Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E
5|$|Besides these unique characteristics, Sampson {{pointed out}} {{additional}} differences with two very closely related forms. The frill spikes of Achelousaurus are more outwards oriented than the spikes of Einiosaurus, which are medially curved; the spikes of Achelousaurus are nevertheless less directed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> than the comparable spikes of Pachyrhinosaurus. Achelousaurus also differs from Pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss {{that does not}} reach the frontal bones at its rear. Apart from the skull, no features of the skeleton are known that distinguish Achelousaurus from {{other members of the}} Centrosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|British Army Captain Walker goes missing {{during an}} {{expedition}} and is believed dead ("Overture"). His widow, Mrs. Walker, {{gives birth to}} their son, Tommy ("It's a Boy"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an altercation as Tommy watches. Tommy's mother convinces him {{that he did not}} see or hear the incident and must never tell anyone about it; as a result, he becomes deaf, dumb, and blind <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world ("1921"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner psyche ("Amazing Journey/Sparks").|$|E

5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender of it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but {{did not have the}} close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E
5|$|Edge's first {{televised}} {{match was}} against Jose Estrada, Jr. of Los Boricuas, which ended prematurely by countout when Edge performed a somersault senton from the ring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> legitimately injuring Estrada's neck. In his first pay-per-view match at SummerSlam in August, {{he served as}} Sable's mystery tag team partner against Jacqueline and Marc Mero, and bodyslammed Sable onto Mero in a pinning position {{to pick up the}} win. At , Edge faced Owen Hart in a losing effort. On October 11, 1998's edition of Sunday Night Heat, Edge defeated Vader in singles competition and at WWF Capital Carnage, Edge faced Tiger Ali Singh in a losing effort.|$|E

Andy {{receives}} a library donation {{that includes a}} recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, earning a spell in solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias Randall Stephens.|$|E

5|$|Inmates were {{at times}} able to {{distribute}} {{information from the}} camp <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world via messages used in shortwave radio transmissions. The Polish government-in-exile in London first reported the gassing of prisoners on 21 July 1942. However, these reports were {{for a long time}} disregarded as exaggerated or unreliable by the Allied Powers, Germany's opponents in the West. Information regarding Auschwitz was also available to the Allies during the years 1940â43 by the accurate and frequent reports of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) Captain Witold Pilecki. Pilecki was the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz concentration camp, spending 945 days there. He gathered evidence of genocide and organized resistance structures known as ZwiÄzek Organizacji Wojskowej (ZOW) at the camp. His first report was smuggled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world in November 1940, through an inmate who was released from the camp. He eventually escaped on 27 April 1943, but his personal report of mass killings was dismissed as exaggeration by the Allies, as were his previous reports.|$|E

5|$|Its {{mixture of}} genres makes The General in His Labyrinth {{difficult}} to classify, and commentators disagree over where it {{lies on the}} scale between novel and historical account. GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez's insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elementsâsome dealing with BolÃ­var's most intimate momentsâcaused outrage in parts of Latin America when the book was released. Many prominent Latin American figures believed that the novel damaged the reputation {{of one of the}} region's most important historic figures and portrayed a negative image <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. Others saw The General in His Labyrinth as a tonic for Latin American culture and a challenge to the region to deal with its problems.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia's {{strategic}} position underwent {{a fundamental change}} in June 1975 when the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians continued use of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} can be {{described}} as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach and possesses a single opening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E
