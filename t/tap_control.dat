This paper presents a scalable voltage-mode transmitter which offers low static power dissipa-tion and adopts an impedance-modulated 2 -tap equalizer with analog <b>tap</b> <b>control,</b> thereby obviating driver segmentation and reducing pre-driver complexity and dynamic power. Topologies that allow for rapid power-up/down, including a replica-biased voltage regulator to power the output stages of multiple transmit channels and per-channel quadrature clock generation with injection-locked oscillators (ILO), enable fast power-state transi-tioning. Energy efficiency is further improved with capacitively driven low-swing global clock distribution and supply scaling at lower data rates, while output eye quality is maintained at low voltages with automatic phase calibration of the local ILO-gen-erated quarter-rate clocks. A prototype fabricated in a general purpose 65 nm CMOS process includes a 2 mm global clock distribution network and two transmitters that support an output swing range of 100 – 300 mV with up to 12 dB of equalization.

It has hydro-power capacity about 950 MW and thermal power capacity 725 MW. The average VAR consumption a day is 650 MVAR. Average power factor of {{the operation of the}} system is about 0. 95. Almost 80 % of the distribution of electrical power is done by CEB. The transmission network totally owned operated by CEB. The CEB transmission system consists of 220 k V and 132 kV network. It has 44 Grid Substation which convert 132 kV/ 33 kV for the distribution of the power to low voltage consumers. In this Grid Substation there is 109 132 kV/ 33 kV power transformer each having capacity of 31. 5 MVA. There are Breaker switch capacitors (BSC) bank installed at some places of these GSS. The total installed capacity of the shunt BSC bank is amount to 320 MV AR and yet another 70 MV AR planning to connect in the near future. In these GSS there are two systems to control 33 kV bus voltage at reference 33 kV level. One system varies the transformer tap position by controlling 33 kV voltage. We called this as. On-Load <b>Tap</b> <b>Control</b> of the transformer. For this to be done there is controller (AVR) which sends the command to OLTC to take appropriate action of increasing or decreasing the tap. On the other hand there is a BSC bank which allowed controlling the reactive power of the GSS. The main intentions of the use of capacitor banks is to give voltage support at the substation level, reduction of losses in power transformers and transmission lines, and to release the capacity constraints in transformers and lines. CEB uses power factor regulation for switching these capacitor banks for above purposes but no studies have been done to evaluate its suitability with transformer AVR. Even though these two controllers try to maintain VAR and Voltage (Q&V) of the GSS they are operating independently. Because of that We could not achieved maximum effect of these two system i:e., under optimization of the Voltage and Var. Some time we have observed that these two controllers are hunting with each other by doing the controlling. If we could coordinate these two controllers to make proper function we indirectly could save the number of tap operations of the transformer and that will help reducing costly maintenance of the OLTC. My main intention is to coordinate these two controllers to achieve above objects. I further try to develop a new system {{to take care of the}} both functions in one unit.

Previously we have been carry out integrated quantitative estimation of neuroendocrine, immune and metabolic responses to acute stress at male and female rats. The aim of this study is to compare the modulating effects of Bioactive Water Naftussya (BAWN) from layers Truskavets’ and Pomyarky on neuro-endocrine-immune complex and metabolism at rats exposed to acute stress. Materials and methods. The experiment is at white rats Wistar line. Rats were divided into intact and 5 test groups treated for seven days with <b>tap</b> (<b>control)</b> water, distilled water as well as table water "Truskavets’ka" and BAWN from Truskavets’ and Pomyarky layers. A day after the end of course animals test groups subjected to water immersion restraint stress. A day after stress determined HRV, endocrine, immune and metabolic parameters as well as gastric mucosa injuries and comparing them with parameters of intact animals. Results. BAWN both Truskavets’ and Pomyarky layers minimizes or obviates abnormal 15 parameters caused by stress, but does not affect the poststressory deviation of 7 parameters. On the other hand, BAWN causes deviation of 15 other parameters which little or do not change under stress. Distilled water and water "Truskavets’ka" affect some parameters the opposite way, other less favorable, but some more favorably than BAWN. Conclusion. BAWN both Truskavets’ and Pomyarky layers limit pathogenic effects of stress, and initiate or enhance its compensatory and sanogenic effects.

50|$|There is an optimum {{flow rate}} for each {{particular}} separation.

The flow rate of such a column can be increased by extending the fresh eluent filled column above the top of the stationary phase or decreased by the <b>tap</b> <b>controls.</b> Faster flow rates can be achieved by using a pump or by using compressed gas (e.g. air, nitrogen, or argon) to push the solvent through the column (flash column chromatography).|$|R
