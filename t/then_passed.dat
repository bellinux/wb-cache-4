The Commissioners began a programme of repairs to stabilise the ruin in its current state.|$|E
5|$|In 1348, William de Melton {{obtained}} King Edward III's {{permission to}} give his manor to William Edendon, Bishop of Winchester. The ownership of the manor of Bentworth was <b>then</b> <b>passed</b> by marriage to the Windsor family, who had been constables of Windsor Castle. The Bentworth Hall estate was evidently returned to the Melton family, because it is mentioned among their possessions in a document dated to 1362. It <b>then</b> <b>passed</b> to William's similar-named son, Sir William de Melton. Sir William's son, John de Melton, who inherited the house in 1399, was recorded as owner of the manor of Bentworth in 1431. He died in 1455, and was succeeded by his son until the latter's death in 1474, then finally his grandson John Melton.

5|$|Innis {{argued that}} {{a balance between the}} spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of Plato. This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was {{eventually}} upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing.
