50|$|Bloncourt {{was in the}} 1930s {{preoccupied with}} the danger of fascism and {{advocated}} a unified anti-fascist front of Socialist and Communists. He also wanted a unified front among non-fascist countries and approved the Franco-Soviet <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Mutual <b>Assistance</b> in May 1935.

Ecuador shares U.S. concern over increasing narcotrafficking and international terrorism and has energetically condemned terrorist actions, whether directed against government officials or private citizens. The government has maintained Ecuador virtually free of coca production {{since the mid-1980s}} and is working to combat money laundering and the transshipment of drugs and chemicals essential to the processing of cocaine.|$|R
25|$|Washington also {{established}} {{itself as the}} leader of continental defense through the creation of the Inter-American Defense Board in 1942 and the signing <b>of</b> the Inter-American <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Reciprocal <b>Assistance</b> in 1947. A parallel development was the founding in 1950 of the Centro de Altos Estudios Militares (CAEM, Center of High Military Studies) for the formation of officers in the major problems of the nation beyond those related to its military defense.|$|R
50|$|Turkey {{remained}} neutral {{until the}} final stages of World War II. In the initial stage of World War II, Turkey signed a <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>assistance</b> with Great Britain and France. But after the fall of France, the Turkish government tried to maintain an equal distance with both the Allies and the Axis. Following Germany's occupation of the Balkan states, upon which the Axis became neighbours with Turkey in Thrace and the eastern islands of the Aegean Sea, Turkey signed a <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Friendship and Non-Aggression with Germany on 18 June 1941.|$|R
50|$|In social policy, Barthou's time {{as prime}} {{minister}} saw {{the passage of a}} law in June 1913 aimed at safeguarding women workers before and after childbirth.He also held ministerial office thirteen other times. He served as Foreign Minister in 1934. He was the primary figure behind the Franco-Soviet <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Mutual <b>Assistance</b> <b>of</b> 1935, though it was signed by his successor, Pierre Laval. As a national World War I hero and a recognized author, Barthou was elected to the Académie française {{at the end of that}} war.|$|R
50|$|While {{condemning the}} {{terrorist}} attacks of 9/11 and providing considerable relief aid to the U.S. after Hurricane Katrina, the Mexican government, pursuing neutrality in international affairs, opted not to actively join the controversial War on Terror and the even more controversial Iraq War, instead being the first nation in history to formally and voluntarily leave the Inter-American <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Reciprocal <b>Assistance</b> in 2002, though Mexico later joined the U.S. in supporting military intervention in the Libyan Civil War.|$|R
50|$|After the war the HAF re-equipped with {{aircraft}} from United States Army Air Forces and Royal Canadian Air Force stocks {{including five}} Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and five Bell P-63 Kingcobras which were its first high performance fighters. Honduras ratified the Inter-American <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Reciprocal <b>Assistance</b> in 1947, {{and within the}} next 10 years the United States supplied new aircraft including 19 Vought F4U Corsair fighter bombers, several Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports, and six North American AT-6C armed- and six T-6G advanced trainers.|$|R
50|$|Marquette {{was then}} {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet and for almost nine years served as a unit of that fleet's amphibious force. She participated regularly in type, squadron, and amphibious exercises which ranged from Greenland to the Caribbean. Her activities also included periodic deployment with the 6th Fleet and, from 15 August to 21 September 1947, a Brazilian cruise with congressional observers for the Rio Conference embarked. This conference resulted in the signing <b>of</b> the Inter-American <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Reciprocal <b>Assistance</b> on 2 September.|$|R
50|$|Haiti {{became a}} party {{to a number of}} {{international}} agreements, including the Inter-American <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Reciprocal <b>Assistance</b> (the Rio <b>Treaty),</b> the Charter <b>of</b> the Organization of American States, and the earlier Act of Chapultepec (1945). The nation's security concerns regarding neighboring Cuba and the Dominican Republic have been viewed since World War II within the broader framework of United States strategic interests in the Caribbean. The fact that the FAd'H deployed relatively few of its units along the Dominican border, despite a history of conflicts with its neighbor, reflects Haiti's limited national security concerns.|$|R
5000|$|Following World War II, the {{beginning}} of the Cold War saw the Inter-American <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Reciprocal <b>Assistance</b> signed in Rio de Janeiro, which provided for [...] "Hemispheric defense" [...] and required signatory states to work to improve and coordinate their naval forces. Between 1949 and 1952, the FAS received sixteen TBM Avenger torpedo bombers, three SNJ Texan trainers, and twelve F6F Hellcat fighters. More, in 1952, the surface fleet received the destroyer escorts Uruguay (DE-1) and Artigas (DE-2) and, in 1953, the frigate Montevideo.|$|R
5000|$|In {{light of}} the {{developing}} Cold War and following the statement of the Truman Doctrine, the US wished to make those new anti-communist commitments permanent. The Inter-American <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Reciprocal <b>Assistance</b> {{was the first of}} many so-called 'mutual security agreements', and the formalization of the Act <b>of</b> Chapultepec. The <b>treaty</b> was adopted by the original signatories on 2 September 1947 in Rio de Janeiro (hence the colloquial name [...] "Rio Treaty"). It came into force on 3 December 1948 and was registered with the United Nations on 20 December 1948.|$|R
50|$|The Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{took place}} on 25 February 1948. Joseph Stalin soon tried to {{pressure}} Norway to sign a <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>assistance.</b> The coup also affected Norwegian interior politics. On 29 February 1948 Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen held the Kråkerøy Speech in which he denounced the Communist Party of Norway as possible supporters of a Czechoslovak-like coup d'état in Norway. The Communist Party supported the Czechoslovak coup d'état. Shortly after Gerhardsen's speech, at least 1,500 people demonstrated in Oslo against the coup. Norway joined the NATO in 1949.|$|R
50|$|Portugal openly {{refused to}} join the Continental System. In 1793, Portugal signed a <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>assistance</b> with Britain. After the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Tilsit of July 1807, Napoleon {{attempted}} to capture the Portuguese Fleet and the House of Braganza, and to occupy the Portuguese ports. He failed. King John VI of Portugal took his fleet and transferred the Portuguese Court to Brazil with a Royal Navy escort. The Portuguese population rose in revolt against the French invaders, {{with the help of}} the British Army under Arthur Wellesley, later 1st Duke of Wellington. Napoleon intervened, and the Peninsular War began in 1808. Napoleon also forced the Spanish royal family to resign their throne in favor of Napoleon's brother, Joseph.|$|R
40|$|In late May 1942, {{while the}} Soviet Union {{staggered}} from catastrophic defeats at Kharkov {{and in the}} Crimea, British and Soviet representatives met in London and signed a <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>assistance</b> that would lay {{the basis for the}} Grand Alliance. This thesis, based on the newly discovered material from Stalin 2 ̆ 7 s secret archives, argues that Anthony Eden, British Foreign Minister, far from the weak-willed appeaser caricatured by subsequent historians, was a shrewd, yet principled diplomat, who assessed the Soviets far more realistically than did his British counterparts. Moreover, Eden was a skilled and resourceful negotiator who drove a very hard bargain, and although the Soviets ultimately did achieve acceptance of their frontiers in Eastern Europe, they did this by force of arms and not with Eden 2 ̆ 7 s connivance. Any failures the British and Americans experienced in protecting Eastern Europe were failures that occurred later in the war. In the end, if the British appeased Stalin it resulted from their much weaker position in relation to the Soviets in 1944 and 1945, not because Eden took a soft line with the Soviets in May 1942. In May of 1942 Eden accomplished the goal set for him by the British and the Americans; he successfully upheld the principles of the Atlantic Charter while signing a <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>assistance</b> with the Soviet Union...|$|R
