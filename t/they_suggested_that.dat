5|$|In 2009, {{researchers}} {{hypothesized that}} smooth-edged holes {{found in the}} fossil jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as Albertosaurus were caused by a parasite similar to Trichomonas gallinae, which infects birds. <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other, and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{paleontology}} {{has often}} classified Archaeopteryx {{as the most}} primitive bird. It is not {{thought to be a}} true ancestor of modern birds, but rather, a close relative of that ancestor. Nonetheless, Archaeopteryx was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird. Several authors have done so. Lowe (1935) and Thulborn (1984) questioned whether Archaeopteryx truly was the first bird. <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Archaeopteryx was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that Avimimus was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than Archaeopteryx. Barsbold (1983) and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997) noted that many maniraptoran lineages are extremely birdlike, and <b>they</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.|$|E
5|$|In his 1918 {{revision}} of North American Oryzomys, Goldman considered O.nelsoni {{to be most}} {{closely related to the}} nearest mainland subspecies of O.couesi, O.couesi mexicanus. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales revised the Oryzomys of western Mexico and confirmed that O.nelsoni is a very distinct species. Their morphometrical analysis found some resemblance between the species and Oryzomys albiventer of interior mainland Mexico, and <b>they</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> although O.nelsoni likely represents an old, distinctive lineage, it may have derived from a common ancestor with O.albiventer.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys from Costa Rica have {{historically}} been referred to O.c.couesi, but Hanson and colleagues found that two specimens from Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre Mixto Maquenque, northeastern Costa Rica, differed as much from other O.couesi (11.93% Cytb sequence divergence) as O.couesi differed from the marsh rice rat (11.30%). <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> these animals represented a species distinct from O.couesi, but were unable to resolve the correct name for the species {{because they could not}} examine samples of dimidiatus or richmondi.|$|E

5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E
5|$|Despite these taxonomic changes, Indraloris {{remained}} {{known from}} only two specimens (the holotypes of Indraloris lulli and Sivanasua palaeindica) until 2005. Both of those specimens—an isolated first lower molar (m1) and a mandible (lower jaw) fragment with m1, respectively—come from Haritalyangar in the Nagri Formation. In 2005, however, American paleontologists Lawrence Flynn and Michèle Morgan described five teeth of Indraloris from fossil {{sites in the}} older Kamlial Formation as a second species in the genus, Indraloris kamlialensis. The species was named after the Kamlial Formation. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> two lower jaw fragments from the Kamlial Formation represented a third, larger species of Indraloris.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, David E. Hone and Thomas R. Holtz {{pointed out}} that (like other theropods) {{there was no reason}} to believe that the forelimbs of Baryonyx were able to pronate, and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for {{locomotion}} may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but if this was the norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or to reach some kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than submerging themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} Bristol's main {{shopping}} area should be {{moved away from}} the Castle Street and Wine Street area was first proposed to Bristol Corporation's Planning and Reconstruction Committee by the Multiple Traders' Federation (MTF), representing the larger retailers and chain-stores, in October 1943. <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the pre-war shopping area should be set aside as a civic area with perhaps a concert hall or similar building and an open space, and that the central shopping area should be moved to a less-constrained site. This suggestion formed part of the City Engineer's Master Plan of February 1944, which envisaged that the area would contain a limited number of buildings such as a conference hall, with underground parking for 2,000 cars. The removal of the shopping area was considered desirable because the fire that had destroyed so much of the area was in large part sustained by its congested nature, and in any case many of the chain-stores represented by the MTF wanted larger sites.|$|E
5|$|When Tipu issued {{his orders}} {{to seize the}} Christians, the British, who had entered into a treaty with him on 11 March 1784, were helpless.

The Portuguese, guardians of the Christian faith in Canara, intervened and requested Tipu not to imprison the priests. <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> he let the Christians live peacefully as his father Hyder Ali had done. But Tipu paid no heed to their request. Estimates suggest that about 7,000 people remained in hiding. Many were actively assisted by the Hindus whilst the few Christians in Canara who escaped Tipu's initial captivity fled to Coorg and Malabar, where they were protected by the native rulers.|$|E
5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri was {{discovered}} during {{a survey of}} the endoparasites of Florida marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) by John Kinsella from 1970 to 1972, and is one of several new parasite species in this study, which was done because there were no previous comprehensive studies of the endoparasites of the species. Together with Danny Pence, Kinsella described the worm in a 1987 paper as Capillaria forresteri; the specific name honors Donald J. Forrester of the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida. Kinsella and Pence described it as one of many species of Capillaria, a large and taxonomically difficult genus. <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> it may be closest to some other small species that live in the digestive systems of mammals, such as the very similar C.putorii, which is found in a variety of carnivorans in North America and Europe. In 1982, Moravec had placed Capillaria putorii and a number of related species in a separate genus, Aonchotheca, and in 1999 Pisanu and Bain transferred Capillaria forresteri and various other species to that genus from Capillaria. Thus, the species is now known as Aonchotheca forresteri.|$|E

5|$|Freshwater {{addition}} {{has been}} implicated by coupled ocean and atmosphere climate modeling (Ganopolski and Rahmstorf 2001), showing that both Heinrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger events may show hysteresis behaviour. This means that relatively minor changes in freshwater loading into the Nordic Seas, {{such as a}} 0.15 Sv increase or 0.03 Sv decrease, would suffice to cause profound shifts in global circulation (Rahmstorf et al. 2005). The results show that a Heinrich event does not cause a cooling around Greenland but further south, mostly in the subtropical Atlantic, a finding supported by most available paleoclimatic data. This idea was connected to D-O events by Maslin et al. (2001). <b>They</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> each ice sheet had its own conditions of stability, but that on melting, the influx of freshwater was enough to reconfigure ocean currents, and cause melting elsewhere. More specifically, D-O cold events, and their associated influx of meltwater, reduce {{the strength of the}} North Atlantic Deep Water current (NADW), weakening the northern-hemisphere circulation and therefore resulting in an increased transfer of heat polewards in the southern hemisphere. This warmer water results in melting of Antarctic ice, thereby reducing density stratification and the strength of the Antarctic Bottom Water current (AABW). This allows the NADW to return to its previous strength, driving northern hemisphere melting and another D-O cold event. Eventually, the accumulation of melting reaches a threshold, whereby it raises sea level enough to undercut the Laurentide ice sheet, thereby causing a Heinrich event and resetting the cycle.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Marion Archibald and Valerie Fenwick {{proposed}} an alternative hypothesis, {{based on the}} evidence of East Anglian coins and post-Conquest documents. Acknowledging that Beonna and Beornred were the same person, <b>they</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> after Ælfwald's death in 749, Æthelwald of Mercia installed Beornred/Beonna to rule northern East Anglia and Alberht (who probably belonged to the Wuffingas dynasty) to rule in the south. According to Archibald and Fenwick, after Æthelbald was murdered in 757, Beornred/Beonna became king of Mercia, during which his coinage was increased in East Anglia, perhaps to meet “military requirements”. Then, after a reign of only a few months, he was deposed by Offa and forced to flee from him back into East Anglia. Alberht, who had attempted to re-establish East Anglia as an independent kingdom and rule alone, and had succeeded for a short time, was deposed by Beornred/Beonna when he arrived as an exile in about 760. Soon afterwards, Offa asserted his authority over the East Angles in around 760-5 and removed Beonna.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the American ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman {{supported}} {{the idea that}} the early accounts were a solid basis for the Guadeloupe amazon's existence. They also reported a tibiotarsus bone found on the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, an island in the Guadeloupe region, which they found {{similar to that of the}} imperial amazon, but slightly shorter. Since Maria-Galante shares many modern bird species with Guadeloupe, <b>they</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the bone belonged to the Guadeloupe amazon, and assigned it to A. cf. violacea (which implies the classification is uncertain). In 2004, Patricia Ottens-Wainright and colleagues pointed out that the early descriptions of the Guadeloupe amazon did not clearly determine whether it was a unique species or the same species as the imperial amazon. Ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maíz, writing in 2008, felt that the Guadeloupe amazon was probably the same as the imperial amazon. In contrast the English ornithologist Julian P. Hume wrote in 2012 that though the amazon species of Guadeloupe and Martinique were based on accounts rather than physical remains, he found it likely they once existed, having been mentioned by trusted observers, and on zoogeographical grounds. In 2015, the ecologists Monica Gala and Arnaud Lenoble stated that an ulna bone from Maria-Galante, which had been assigned to the extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis) by Williams and Steadman in 2001 and to the imperial amazon by Olson and Maiz in 2008, instead belonged to the Guadeloupe amazon.|$|E
