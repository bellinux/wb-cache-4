25|$|Single-pass bore {{finishing}} is {{not well}} suited for blind holes because the tool has a tapered lead on it which prevents {{the bottom of the}} hole from being finished. The process can be performed on blind holes, but it requires an alternative <b>tool</b> <b>design</b> and suitable manufacturing conditions. A better alternative is ID grinding.|$|E
25|$|New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) are {{notable for}} their highly {{developed}} tool fabrication. They make angling tools of twigs and leaves trimmed into hooks, {{then use the}} hooks to pull insect larvae from tree holes. Tools are engineered according to task and apparently also to learned preference. Recent studies revealed abilities to solve complicated problems, which suggests high level of innovation of a complex nature. Other corvids that have been observed using tools include the American crow, blue jay and green jay. Diversity in <b>tool</b> <b>design</b> among corvids suggests cultural variation. Again, great apes are the only other animals known to use tools in such a fashion.|$|E
2500|$|Improvements in <b>tool</b> <b>design</b> {{have been}} shown to cause {{substantial}} improvements in productivity and quality. TWI has developed tools specifically designed to increase the penetration depth and thus increasing the plate thicknesses that can be successfully welded. An example is the [...] "whorl" [...] design that uses a tapered pin with re-entrant features or a variable pitch thread to improve the downwards flow of material. Additional designs include the Triflute and Trivex series. The Triflute design has a complex system of three tapering, threaded re-entrant flutes that appear to increase material movement around the tool. The Trivex tools use a simpler, non-cylindrical, pin and have been found to reduce the forces acting on the tool during welding.|$|E
