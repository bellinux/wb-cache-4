A constant inflow of migrants {{in recent years has}} fuelled population growth in Budapest. Productivity gains and the relatively large economically active share of the population explain why household incomes have increased in Budapest {{to a greater extent than}} in other parts of Hungary.

We draw on a dataset comprising 6, 063 Spanish municipalities with access to broadband services to examine the incumbents’ (Telefónica) deployment of fiber in the period 2010 - 13. We show that local loop unbundling competition had a strong positive impact on Telefónica’s fiber deployment, while bitstream competition had a negative effect. Moreover, the incumbent {{was more likely to}} invest in municipalities with a large presence of cable operators. We also consider how the municipalities’ sociodemographic characteristics affected the operator’s deployment decision. While market size and population density had a positive effect on investment, the level of unemployment and the percentage of elderly population had a negative impact...|$|R
40|$|The on-farm {{diversification}} toward multifunctional {{activities is}} perceived as central in the CAP policy reform and in Horizon 2020 strategies, because it strengthen <b>territorial</b> and social <b>cohesion</b> of the rural areas. While relations between farm-household diversification and rural economies are central into the process of multifunctionality and provision of public goods through agricultural activities, on-farm diversification activities could represent a relevant share of farm income. Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology literatures have developed models to explain the determinants of on-farm diversification. In this paper the determinants and the motivations to onfarm diversification toward activities different from crops and animal production are investigated The paper applies a count model to explain the amount of on-farm diversification alternatives that are applied in Tuscany farms. Results confirm that location to main touristic areas and closeness to urban markets are strong determinants of on-farm diversification. Results highlight also, a positive contribution of agricultural policies (both first pillar and second pillar policies) in determining diffusion of on-farm diversification activities...|$|R
