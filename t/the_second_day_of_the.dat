The assaults were unsuccessful, and resulted in heavy casualties for both sides.|$|E
5|$|Ninety {{percent or}} more of {{smallpox}} cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type. In this form of the disease, by <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rash the macules became raised papules. By the third or fourth day the papules filled with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles. This fluid became opaque and turbid within 24–48 hours, giving them the appearance of pustules; however, the so-called pustules were filled with tissue debris, not pus.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Lindwall and his {{elder brother}} Jack were spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Test of the 1932–33 Ashes series. The series saw the usage of the notorious Bodyline tactics by England's pace battery led by Harold Larwood under the {{captaincy}} of Douglas Jardine. Larwood, a small man like Lindwall, was less than six feet and intimidated opposition batsmen with express pace bowling, aiming short pitched bouncers at their upper body. Larwood also had a smooth, rhythmic run-up and a classical side-on action, something for which Lindwall became famous. The match was also remembered for Stan McCabe's much-celebrated 187 not out, aggressively resisting the Bodyline tactics as Australia fell to a heavy ten wicket defeat.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Jadar Chetniks were attacking Loznica, Račić's Cer {{detachment}} attacked the village of Bogatić in accordance with the Chetnik-Partisan agreement. The gendarmes had been reinforced by the 6th Company of the German 750th Infantry Regiment with artillery support. On <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack, the garrison was reinforced by the 7th Company of the 750th Infantry Regiment arriving from Sremska Mitrovica, and an additional platoon sent from Šabac. After two days fighting, Račić's Chetniks withdrew to Cer mountain with considerable losses, after which they marched to Loznica to join the Jadar Chetniks.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strike, {{which has}} spread to Buffland's rival city of Clearfield , the mood among the laborers has turned ugly. Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent, and aids Farnham's force in turning back assaults on the captain's house and on the Belding residence. Bott and Sleeny are {{captured}} by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman, and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes {{the wind out of}} the Buffland action, and soon most are back at work, though some agitators are dismissed.|$|E

5|$|In February 1915, Agamemnon {{was ordered}} to {{participate}} in the Dardanelles Campaign. She departed Portland on 9 February, and joined the British Dardanelles Squadron at Mudros 10 days later. That was <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening bombardment of the Ottoman Turkish forts guarding the entrance to the Dardanelles and the ship immediately joined the attack. She also took part in the subsequent bombardment of the inner forts later in February. Agamemnon was hit by seven 240-millimetre (9.4-inch) shells in ten minutes on 25 February and was holed above the waterline, suffering three dead.|$|E
5|$|Lord Harris {{expressed}} his {{view that the}} painting should show an action shot of a match at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury, and suggested that the bowler in the painting should be Kent's Colin Blythe. Kent had only played three matches at Canterbury during the 1906 season; of those {{it was decided that}} the subject of the painting would be Kent's match against Lancashire County Cricket Club. That match was part of the Canterbury Cricket Week, and Blythe had taken eight wickets, making it the most appropriate of the three fixtures to depict. Tayler decided that he would show <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match, at an hour prior to lunchtime.|$|E
5|$|Munnerlyn played {{high school}} {{football}} at Murphy High School in Mobile, Alabama, where he was named All-region three times. Following high school, he chose to play college football for the South Carolina Gamecocks after receiving scholarship offers from two other teams. As a freshman in 2006, he played in 11 games and recorded a season high five tackles in two. In 2007, Munnerlyn was both a nickel back and return specialist for the Gamecocks. Following the season, he was named All–Southeastern Conference (SEC). In 2008, he was elevated to starting cornerback while also returning kicks and punts. Against Kentucky, he returned a kickoff 84yards and a blocked field goal 81yards.

5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses {{would not be allowed to}} testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 1, 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near Mosan-ni to open {{the road to the}} 1st Battalion. On <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fighting}} at the pass, the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire. The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17:00 September 2. That evening, North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry, on Hill 209 north of the road and opposite 1st Battalion, driving one company from its position.|$|E
5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle, news {{reached the}} Allies that their lines of retreat {{were no longer}} threatened; they {{therefore}} resolved to maintain their position. They staged a hit-and-run attack on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them. On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, the Allies held on to their position, but suffered severe losses (half the Athenian fleet was damaged); nevertheless, the Allies inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet. That evening, the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E

5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament Paris Saint-Germain beat Valencia {{by three}} goals. The French club had made five {{changes to the}} side that lost against Arsenal, which worked to their favour as Amara Diané and David N'Gog each scored inside 30 minutes. Valencia {{struggled}} to match their opponents' intensity, though remained a threat with Fernando Morientes' arrival in the second half. The match was settled with five minutes remaining of normal time; Luyindula, on as a substitute, received a pass from Loris Arnaud which drew goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand out of his area and allowed the French striker to tap the ball into an empty net.|$|E
5|$|The 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment, {{also known}} as the Indiana Zouaves, under the command of Lew Wallace, was the first {{regiment}} organized in Indiana during the Civil War and the first one to march into battle. The 11th Indiana fought in the Battle of Fort Donelson, the Siege of Vicksburg, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Shiloh, and elsewhere. In 1861 the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment {{became one of the first}} Hoosier regiments to see action in the war. The 9th Indiana fought in many major battles, including the Battle of Shiloh, the Battle of Stones River, the Atlanta Campaign, and the Battle of Nashville, among others.|$|E
5|$|The German {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} of Poland were conceived under the codename Fall Weiss (Case White). This operation called for simultaneous attacks on Poland from three directions, the north, {{the west and the}} south, beginning at 04:45 on the early morning of 1 September 1939. On this morning Helmut Lent, with Kubisch as his wireless operator and rear gunner, escorted a formation of Heinkel 111 bombers of I. and III./Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG4) attacking the airfields at Krakow in support of the southern prong of the German attack. At 16:30 on 2 September 1939, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German attack, Lent took off in the direction of Łódź and claimed his first aerial-victory of the war, shooting down a PZL P.11.|$|E

Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for France 2, as they were caught in crossfire between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. The footage shows the pair crouching behind a concrete cylinder, the boy crying and the father waving, then a burst of gunfire and dust, after which the boy is seen slumped across his father's legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the Canadian Corps was {{to take control of}} the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. This would ensure that the southern flank could advance without suffering German enfilade fire. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The village of Thélus fell during <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack, as did the crest of the ridge, once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient against considerable German resistance. The final objective, a fortified knoll located outside the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April. The German forces then retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quarterfinals {{took place}} at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland.

Shamel Bratton of Virginia scored a career-high five goals. The victory marked the 300th of head coach Dom Starsia's career, and he became the third coach in Division I lacrosse history to win as many games. Virginia advanced to their fourth Final Four appearance in five seasons. With the quarterfinals elimination of both Maryland and Johns Hopkins, 2009 became only the third time since the NCAA tournament began that no team from the state participated in the Final Four.|$|E
