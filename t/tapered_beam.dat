40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Tapered</b> {{composite}} <b>beams</b> {{are increasingly}} being used in various engineering applica-tions such as helicopter yoke, robot arms, and turbine blades. In the present work, the buckling analysis of laminated <b>tapered</b> composite <b>beams</b> is conducted using a higher order finite element formulation. In tapered laminates, the material and geometric discontinuities at ply drop-off loca-tions lead to significant discontinuities in stress distributions. Higher order formulation ensures {{the continuity of the}} stress distribution through the thickness of a laminate as well as across the element interfaces, which is very important for the analysis of tapered laminates. In addition, higher order finite element formulation requires lesser number of elements in order to achieve reasonably accurate results in buckling analysis. The stiffness coefficients of the <b>tapered</b> laminated <b>beam</b> are determined in the present work based on the stress and strain transformations and the classical laminate theory.

40|$|<b>Tapered</b> {{composite}} <b>beams</b> {{are being}} used in various engineering applications such as helicopter yoke, robot arms and turbine blade in which the structure needs to be stiff at one location and flexible at another locations. Laminated <b>tapered</b> <b>beams</b> can be manufactured by terminating some plies at discrete locations. Different types of ply drop-off can be achieved depending on the application. Due to the variety of <b>tapered</b> composite <b>beams</b> {{and complexity of the}} analysis, no analytical solution is available at present and therefore finite element method has been used for the calculation of response. In the present thesis, the free vibration response and buckling of different types of <b>tapered</b> composite <b>beams</b> are analyzed first using conventional finite element formulation. Conventional finite element formulation requires a large number of elements to obtain acceptable results. In addition, continuity of curvature at element interfaces can not be guaranteed with the use of conventional formulation. As a result, stress distribution across the thickness is not continuous at element interfaces. In order to overcome these limitations, an advanced finite element formulation is developed in the present thesis for vibration and buckling analysis of <b>tapered</b> composite <b>beams</b> based on classical laminate theory and first-order shear deformation theory. The developed formulation is applied to the analysis of various types of <b>tapered</b> composite <b>beams.</b> The efficiency and accuracy of the developed formulation are established in comparison with available solutions, where applicable, {{as well as with the}} results obtained using conventional formulation.

40|$|Distributed {{parameter}} modeling {{offers a}} viable alternative to the finite element approach for modeling large flexible space structures. The introduction of the transfer matrix method into the continuum modeling process provides a very useful tool to facilitate the distributed parameter model applied to some more complex configurations. A uniform Timoshenko beam model for the estimation of the dynamic properties of beam-like structures has given comparable results.

This paper proposes a piecewise continuous Timoshenko beam model which is used for the dynamic analysis of tapered beam-like structures.
