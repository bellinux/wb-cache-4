5|$|In {{addition}} to his feature photographs, Grant {{was known for his}} work accompanying hard news stories. Grant photographed every U.S. president and vice president starting with Harry S. <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> through the administration of George H. W. Bush. He was present for the 1961 funeral for three-time House Speaker Sam Rayburn, where he captured former Presidents <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Kennedy, House Parliamentarian Clarence Cannon, and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson standing together.|$|E
5|$|Despite his failing health, Minton {{remained}} {{active in}} the Democratic Party. He was most concerned with President Eisenhower, who he believed was incompetent. He remained in regular correspondence with <b>Truman,</b> <b>and</b> the two met on several occasions at Democratic Party functions.|$|E
5|$|Griselio Torresola, Albizu Campos's bodyguard, {{was in the}} United States at {{the time}} of the Jayuya Uprising. Torresola and fellow {{nationalist}} Oscar Collazo, were to assassinate President Harry S. Truman. On November 1, 1950, they attacked the Blair House where Torresola and a policeman, Leslie Coffelt, lost their lives. Oscar Collazo was arrested and sentenced to death. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment by President <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> he eventually received a presidential pardon.|$|E

5|$|In Moscow, Kennan again {{felt that}} his {{opinions}} were being ignored by Harry S. <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> policymakers in Washington. Kennan tried repeatedly to persuade policymakers to abandon plans for {{cooperation with the}} Soviet government {{in favor of a}} sphere of influence policy in Europe to reduce the Soviets' power there. Kennan believed that a federation needed to be established in western Europe to counter Soviet influence in the region and to compete against the Soviet stronghold in eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{developed}} a strong rapport with union leaders and in 1946, President Harry S. <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> Kentucky Senator Alben Barkley {{asked him to}} accept an appointment to the newly created post of Undersecretary of Labor. In August 1946, Johnson took {{a leave of absence}} from Reynolds and accepted the appointment. He frequently attended President Truman's cabinet meetings due to the illness of Secretary Lewis B. Schwellenbach.|$|E
5|$|More broadly, one {{hallmark}} of the 1950s {{was the beginning of}} European integration—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.|$|E

5|$|Natascha McElhone as Sylvia playing Lauren Garland (Truman's college schoolmate): Sylvia {{was hired}} to play a {{background}} extra, a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. She became romantically involved with <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but {{was thrown out of}} the show before she could do so. She then becomes a protester against The Truman Show, urging Christof to release its lead.|$|E
5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E
5|$|Cooper is woken early by {{the sound}} of a raucous party in the Great Northern Hotel. He leaves to meet Truman, while Jerry Horne (David Patrick Kelly) meets his brother Benjamin (Richard Beymer) to discuss the new Icelandic investors in their {{property}} developments. Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) arrives, disoriented and wishing to return to work, but the Hornes send him home. Cooper, <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> Doctor Hayward (Warren Frost) discuss Johnson's bloodied shirt, learning that the blood is not Laura's but that of drug smuggler Jacques Renault.|$|E

5|$|Cooper, <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> Brennan visit a {{veterinarian}} connected to Gerard; they find twine there {{of the type}} used to bind Laura. They believe that the bird that clawed her body {{is one of the}} animals being treated there, and confiscate the practice's files in order to locate the owners of birds being treated there. They learn that the scratches have been caused by a myna, and that drug smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) owns one. They raid Renault's home, interrupting Briggs, who is planting Johnson's bloodied shirt. He flees, undetected; however, the shirt is recovered as evidence.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} its battle against censorship {{of art and}} literature. In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of Carl Jacob Kunz, who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of Irving Feiner who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> the American Legion. The ACLU lost the case of Joseph Beahharnais, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.|$|E
5|$|From 2001 to 2011, Duke has had {{the sixth}} highest number of Fulbright, Rhodes, <b>Truman,</b> <b>and</b> Goldwater {{scholarships}} in the nation among private universities. The University practices need-blind admissions and meets 100% of admitted students' demonstrated need. About 50 percent of all Duke students receive some form of financial aid, which includes need-based aid, athletic aid, and merit aid. The average need-based grant for the 2015–16 academic year was nearly $45,074. Roughly 60 merit-based scholarships are also offered, including the Angier B. Duke Memorial Scholarship, awarded for academic excellence. Other scholarships are geared toward students in North Carolina, African-American students, and high-achieving students requiring financial aid.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Truman {{was named}} Missouri's {{director}} for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the Civil Works Administration) {{at the request of}} Postmaster General James Farley. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{took his}} Senate seat in January 1935. As a {{freshman}}, {{he sat in}} the back row of the chamber next to fellow freshman Harry <b>Truman,</b> <b>and</b> the pair quickly became friends. Minton was made a member of a special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} wedding, <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> Jacobson opened a {{haberdashery}} together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt {{during the recession}} of 1921. Truman did not pay off {{the last of the}} debts from that venture until 1934, when he did so {{with the aid of a}} political supporter. Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel.|$|E

5|$|Cheney {{was born}} in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Marjorie Lorraine (née Dickey) and Richard Herbert Cheney. He is of {{predominantly}} English, as well as Welsh, Irish, and French Huguenot ancestry; Cheney's 8th great-grandfather, William Cheney, immigrated from England to Massachusetts in the 17th century. Although not a direct descendant, he is collaterally related to Benjamin Pierce Cheney (1815–1895), the early American expressman. Cheney is a very distant cousin of both Harry S. <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> Barack Obama; the three share a common ancestor in Mareen Duvall, a Huguenot who fled from France to England in the 17th century and later settled in Maryland. His father was a soil conservation agent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture {{and his mother was}} a softball star in the 1930s; Cheney was one of three children.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the {{practice}} of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers. In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly. He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951. Secretary of State Dean Acheson chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and Brussels in December 1950. Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley's elevation to the vice-presidency. Speculation was raised that Clements, who won Barkley's old seat in a special election in 1950, may have influenced <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> Acheson to make the appointments.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due {{consultation}} with his advisers, Truman declared {{that he would not}} approve of such an action, and the Joint Chiefs cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both <b>Truman</b> <b>and</b> MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|E
