Military training activities on the Yakima Training Center (YTC) increase the likelihood that knapweed will expand its range at YTC. This study, conducted in a major watershed at YTC, focused on: 1) how a variety of environmental variables influences knapweed distribution, 2) the use of Landsat Thematic Mapper (<b>TM)</b> <b>imagery</b> to map existing knapweed populations, and 3) the use of a logistic regression model and geographical information systems (GIS) to create a potential knapweed habitat map. Topographic and climatic factors had the greatest influence on knapweed distribution. Knapweed has a competitive advantage over those which may have some water stress due to increased temperatures (i. e., lower elevations and south slopes). Lower shrub density, greater percent bare ground, and lower percent perennial aerial cover also made for ideal knapweed habitat. Knapweed density decreased as slope steepness, pH, and percent rock cover increased. Using <b>TM</b> <b>imagery</b> to define existing knapweed populations was unsuccessful because most knapweed stands were less than 30 m X 30 m and had little effect on the TM image values.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{traditional}} {{method of}} application of remote sensing data for land cover mapping {{is the use of}} supervised classification and unsupervised classification. Decision tree, showing great advantages in remote sensing classification, is computationally fast, makes no statistical assumptions, and can handle data that are represented on different measurement scales. Decision tree classification has been successfully applied to many classification problems, but rarely applied to mapping of wetlands. In this study, decision tree was proposed to extract wetland from Landsat 5 /Thematic Mapper (<b>TM)</b> <b>imageries</b> in a wide area of Yinchuan plain. Tasseled Cap (TC) transformation was used to identity the different wetland types and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was computed to distinguish paddy wetland and lake wetland. Results from this analysis show that the decision tree has an outstanding performance compared with the supervised classification in maximum likelihood method. The overall accuracy of supervised classification is 64. 60 %, while that of decision tree classification was 83. 80 %.

The suggested approach firstly extracts the flood inundation areas using the ISODATA image-processing algorithm from four Landsat 5 <b>TM</b> <b>imageries.</b> Then, the ground elevations at the intersections of the extracted flood extent boundaries and the specified river cross sections are read from the digital elevation to estimate the elevation-discharge relationship. Lastly, the flood extent is generated based on the estimated elevation-discharge relationship. The methodology was tested over two river reaches in Indiana, United States. The estimated elevation-discharge relationship showed a good match with the correlation coefficients varying between 0. 82 and 0. 99. In addition, self-validation was also performed for the estimated spatial extent of the flood by comparing it to the waterbody extracted from the Landsat images used to develop the elevation-discharge relationship. The result indicated that the match between the estimated and the extracted flood extents was better with higher flood magnitude. We expect that the suggested methodology will help under-developed and developing countries to obtain flood maps, which have difficulties getting flood maps through traditional approaches based on computer modeling...|$|R

40|$|In {{the event}} of a natural or {{anthropogenic}} disturbance, environmental resource managers require a reliable tool to quickly assess the spatial extent of potential damage to the seagrass resource. The temporal availability of the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (<b>TM)</b> <b>imagery,</b> 16 - 20 days, provides a suitable option to detect and assess damage to the seagrass resource. In this study, remote sensing Landsat 5 <b>TM</b> <b>imagery</b> is used to map the spatial extent of the seagrass resource. Various classification techniques are applied to delineate the seagrass beds in Clearwater Harbor and St. Joseph Sound, FL. This study aims to determine the most appropriate seagrass habitat mapping technique by evaluating the accuracy and validity of the resultant classification maps. Field survey data and high resolution aerial photography are available to use as ground truth information. Seagrass habitat in the study area consists of seagrass species and rhizophytic algae; thus, the species assemblage is categorized as submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). Two supervised classification techniques, Maximum Likelihood and Mahalanobis Distance, are applied to extract the thematic features from the Landsat imagery. The Mahalanobis Distance classification (MDC) method achieves the highest overall accuracy (86 %) and validation accuracy (68 %) for the delineation of the presence/absence of SAV. The Maximum Likelihood classification (MLC) method achieves the highest overall accuracy (74 %) and validation accuracy (70 %) for the delineation of the estimated coverage of SAV for the classes of continuous and patchy seagrass habitat. The soft classification techniques, linear spectral unmixing (LSU) and artificial neural network (ANN), did not produce reasonable results for this particular study. The comparison of the MDC and MLC to the current Seagrass Aerial Photointerpretation (AP) project indicates that the classification of SAV from Landsat 5 <b>TM</b> <b>imagery</b> provides a map product with similar accuracy to the AP maps. These results support the application of remote sensing thematic feature extraction methods to analyze the spatial extent of the seagrass resource. While the remote sensing thematic feature extraction methods from Landsat 5 <b>TM</b> <b>imagery</b> are deemed adequate, the use of hyperspectral imagery and better spectral libraries may improve the identification and mapping accuracy of the seagrass resource...|$|E

The studied area (ca. 3 * 104 km 2) is the upper reaches of the Heihe River at the northeast edge of the Tibetan pla-teau, China. A set (105) of topsoil samples were analyzed for SOC. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models using Landsat <b>TM</b> <b>imagery</b> were built to predict SOC content, alone or with topography and climate covariates (temperature and precipitation). The best model, com-bining all covariates, was only marginally better than using only imagery. Imagery alone was sufficient to build a reasonable model; this was a bit better than only using topography and climate covariates. The Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient values of the imagery only model and the full model are very close, larger than the topography and climate vari-ables based model. In the full model, SOC was mainly explained by Landsat <b>TM</b> <b>imagery</b> (65 % relative importance), followed by climate variables (20 %) and topography (15 % of rel-ative importance). The good results from imagery are likely due to (1) the strong depen-dence of SOC on native vegetation intensity in this Alpine environment; (2) the strong correlation in this environment between imagery and environmental covariables, especially elevation (corresponding to temperature), precipitation, and slope aspect. We conclude that multispectral satellite data from Landsat TM images may be used to predict topsoil SOC with reasonable accuracy in Alpine regions, and perhaps other regions covered with natural vegetation, and that adding topography and climate covariables to the satellite data can improve the predictive accuracy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} Langat River basin which is {{experiencing}} fast pace land use changes and accelerated soil erosion associated with land clearing and earthwork activities. Land use changes detected from Landsat imageries from 1989 - 1999 show that urban expansion {{is the most}} active, i. e. recording an expansion of 180 % over that time period. The major land use reduction is the tropical dipterocarp rainforest located along the upper catchment of the Langat River and the mangrove forest found along Kuala Langat in the west. The 11 % decline in the trend of the forest over that decade is anticipated to contribute in the near future. Results from logistic regression on the casual factors of rapid land use changes are attributed to three significant variables namely transport accessibility, population dynamics and agriculture. The eroded material due to land use changes enters into the Langat River systems as suspended sediments and contributed as non point source of pollution. Some finer sediment is being discharged offshore forming sediment plumes at the river estuary. Sediment plumes detected by Landsat <b>TM</b> <b>imageries</b> were analysed. It is found that the dispersion was not extensive and generally the suspended solids existed at low concentration (varying from 10 - 50 mg/l).
