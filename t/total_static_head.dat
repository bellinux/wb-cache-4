40|$|Reading and {{understanding}} centrifugal pump curves {{is key to}} proper pump selection, and to their reliable and efficient operation. This Tech Brief examines how pump curves can provide data about a pump’s ability to produce flow against certain head, shows how to read a typical centrifugal pump curve, and provides information about pump efficiency and brake horsepower. Pumps are the workhorses of any drinking water distribution or wastewater collection system. They operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year getting water to homes and business, and removing wastewater from them. A correctly sized pump will work efficiently for many years, saving a system money and energy. An incorrectly sized pump can fail if it’s too small or result in unnecessary expense if it’s too big. Pump curves provide a way to see the correct size a pump should be for specific conditions. Pump Terminology Before discussing specific details, it helps to understand typical terms associated with pump curves: Impeller—the moving element in a pump that drives the liquid. Volute—the spiral-shaped casing surrounding a pump impeller that collects the liquid discharged by the impeller. Head—a measure of the pressure or force exerted by water expressed in feet. Centrifugal pump curves show pressure as head, which is the equivalent height of water with specific gravity = 1. Static Head—the vertical height difference {{from the surface of}} a water source to the centerline of the impeller. The vertical height difference from the centerline of the impeller to the discharge point is called discharge static head, while the vertical height difference {{from the surface of the}} water source to the discharge point is known as <b>total</b> <b>static</b> <b>head.</b> Download all of ou...|$|E

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} and kinetic properties {{associated with}} intrinsic uncoupling in a six-state {{model of a}} redox proton pump have been studied by computing the flow-force relations for different degrees of coupling. Analysis of these relations shows the regulatory influence of the thermodynamic forces on the extent and relative contributions of redox slip and proton slip. Inhibition has been introduced into the model in two different ways, corresponding to possible modes of action of experimental inhibitors. Experiments relating the rate of electron transfer to delta microH at <b>static</b> <b>head</b> upon progressive inhibition of the pumps have been simulated considering (1) the limiting case that the nonzero rate of electron transfer at <b>static</b> <b>head</b> is only due to intrinsic uncoupling (no leaks) and (2) the experimentally observed case that about 30 % of the nonzero rate of electron transfer at <b>static</b> <b>head</b> {{is due to a}} constant proton leakage conductance in parallel with the pumps, the rest being due to intrinsic uncoupling. The same simulations have been performed for experiments in which the rate of electron transfer is varied by varying the substrate concentration rather than by using an inhibitor. The corresponding experimental results obtained by measuring delta microH and the rate of electron transfer at different succinate concentrations in rat liver mitochondria are presented. Comparison between simulated behavior and experimental results leads to the general conclusion that the typical relationship between rate of electron transfer and delta microH found in mitochondria at <b>static</b> <b>head</b> could certainly be a manifestation of some degree of intrinsic uncoupling in the redox proton pumps.

40|$|Centrifugal {{devices such}} as pumps, fans, and {{compressors}} follow a general set of speed affinity laws: Q 2 = Q 1 *(N 2 /N 1) [Equation 1]; H 2 =H 1 *(N 2 /N 1) 2 [Equation 2]; P 2 =P 1 *(N 2 /N 1) 3 [Equation 3] where Q= flow rate, N = speed, H =head, and P = shaft power. The subscripts 1 and 2 represent two different speed conditions. In fluid systems {{where there is no}} <b>static</b> <b>head,</b> the system head, like the pump head, is proportional to the velocity, or flow rate, squared. As a result, the pump affinity laws also indicate how the pump and system will work together to define the operating point in such a system; in other words, the system flow rate is linear with pump speed. Stable control of system flow rate is easily achieved. In these all-frictional systems, the energy efficiency merits of using an adjustable speed drive (ASD) is apparent if one simply considers the effect of a 20 % reduction in speed: the flow rate drops by 20 %, but the pump input power drops almost in half. But not all fluid systems are all-frictional. In fact, some fluid systems are dominated by static, rather than frictional head. When there is <b>static</b> <b>head</b> in a fluid system, the system no longer follows the same rule that head is proportional to flow rate squared. Instead, there is a constant term (<b>static</b> <b>head),</b> to which is added a variable term (dynamic, or frictional) head. The operational response to a speed change in a system with <b>static</b> <b>head</b> is both system and device dependent, which means that both the system and the centrifugal device characteristic curves must be known to predict the result of a speed change. This interdependence between the pump and system is often overlooked in pump selection. Much work has been done historically in defining control characteristics of valves (the alternative, less energy efficient means of flow control). There is a need to develop a better awareness of the sometimes nonlinear behavior of pumps under ASD flow control. This paper explores the behavior of ASD-controlled pumps in systems with varying levels of <b>static</b> <b>head.</b> Some potential parametric and single value figures of merit for evaluating the suitability of pump, drive, and system combinations are discussed, and an important pump selection technique in adjustable speed applications is described...|$|R

40|$|Rotation of {{the eyes}} about the visual axis is known as ocular torsion. A lateral {{inclination}} (a "roll") of the head induces ocular torsion in the opposite direction, a response known as ocular counterrolling. For six subjects, we recorded the <b>static</b> (<b>head</b> still) and dynamic (head in oscillatory roll motion) ocular torsion in normal 1 g condition and also during the microgravity and hypergravity periods of parabolic flight, using the electromagnetic scleral search coil technique. With the head still, the direction and magnitude of torsion that occurred in response to microgravity and hypergravity differed substantially from one individual to another, {{but there was a}} significant difference in torsional magnitude between the microgravity and hypergravity periods, for all <b>static</b> <b>head</b> positions including the upright position. Under normal 1 g conditions, counterrolling compensated for about 16 % of (voluntary) <b>static</b> <b>head</b> roll, while dynamic counterroll was much larger, up to 36 % of head roll at 0. 55 Hz. With increasing frequency of head oscillation between 0. 33 Hz and 0. 55 Hz, the gain of counterrolling increased and there was no change in the phase relationship. The gain of dynamic counterroll (in response to voluntary head rolling) was not significantly less in hypogravity, suggesting that on the ground at these frequencies the contribution of gravity and gravity receptors to this reflex is redundant: this reflex is probably driven by the semicircular canals. In some subjects, the torsional displacement in microgravity is accompanied by micro-torsional oscillatory motion...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that a simple four-state {{membrane}} transport system can interact with an oscillating electric field to become an active transport system if there is charge translocation associated with conformational changes of the transporter and if affinities of the transporter for the ligand on {{the two sides of}} membrane are different. The relationship between the transport flux and both the frequency of the applied field and the concentration of ligand have been examined based on the following assumptions: the rate of the electroconformational change of the transporter is much greater than that of the ligand association/dissociation reaction, and the oscillating electric field has a large amplitude. It was found that the transport flux depends strongly on the frequency of the field and on the concentration of the ligand and it displays a window of broad bandwidth both on the frequency and the concentration axes. The maximum concentration gradient, or the <b>static</b> <b>head,</b> which can be supported by this mechanism is shown to be constant for field frequencies smaller than the rate of the electroconformational change. The <b>static</b> <b>head</b> value diminishes completely when the field frequency exceeds the rate of the conformational change. The presence of an optimal field frequency has been shown experimentally in several membrane enzyme systems. The theory was applied to the description of Rb and Na pumping in human erythrocytes stimulated by an AC field.

Unlined tunnels and underground powerhouses have been constructed starting from the end of World War I in 1919. From the valuable experience gained through the design, construction and operation of tunnels in the past 100 years in Norway, at the present the high head unlined pressure tunnels have been developed up to reach 1046 m hydrostatic head for Nye Tyin Hydropower Project. Nye Tyin Hydropower Project is a world record with its ultra-high-unlined tunnels/shafts and the project exploits fall between Torolmen and &# 197;rdal. Two turbines are installed with a capacity of 375 MW each and discharge 2 x 20 m 3 /s that is giving an annual production of 1398 GWh. The project geology is rather complex and predominantly overthrusted homogeneous dark gneisses, quartzite and mica schist, followed by a large unit of meta-arkose and conglomerate. The power station area and {{the lower part of the}} pressure tunnel are located in rocks consisting mainly of dark gneiss, gabbro, amphibolite and pyroxene-granulite. The main objective of this thesis is to carry out the possibility of the feasibility to develop ultra-high-unlined tunnel and shaft with even higher <b>static</b> <b>heads</b> for the exemplified Nye-Tyin HEP project. In this regards, different design principle and approaches has been used based on empirical, deterministic, numerical analyses and using other sources of design procedures and principles.

The minimum principal stress along the alignment of the unlined tunnel was calculated and compared with the water pressure intended inside the tunnel and finally factor of safety along the unlined pressure shaft has been evaluated with regards to hydraulic splitting and failure due to the increased experimental <b>static</b> <b>heads.</b> The ?First design criteria?, Norwegian rule of thumb, Snowy mountain criterion, design charts method based on FEM and finally verification using simulation of a model by two dimensional phase 2 software has been used to ensure safety against hydraulic fracturing and uplift.
