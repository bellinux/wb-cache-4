40|$|Some lizards {{have the}} ability of {{partially}} regenerate many tissues like nerve cells, part of the mandible, {{and parts of the}} limbs; and most of them can regenerate the tail. Tail autotomy followed by tail regeneration is a strategy widely used in lizards to escape from predators. In some cases tail breaks but it does not detaches completely from the body, leading to a regenerated tail with multiple tips. Here we report a young individual of Salvator merianae from central Argentina that presented six regenerated <b>tails</b> <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> a major injury in its tail...|$|R
40|$|AbstractZnO micro and {{nanostructures}} in {{the form}} of tripods, grains, arrows and wires have been grown at temperatures as low as 500 – 300 ∘C by a vapour transport method without catalysis and using a well selected value of the carrier gas flow. A transition state between grains and nanowires is reported being characterized by arrow-like structures which are constituted by a pyramidal head and a <b>tail</b> that is <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> the basal plane of the head. In order to understand the effect of growth conditions on the morphology of micro and nanostructures, an analysis of temperature and species concentration conditions has been carried out. In addition two different kinds of substrates have been used, namely quartz and c-sapphire...|$|R
5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long <b>tail</b> hair <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> the top of the tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|R

500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for {{something}} to make her <b>tail</b> <b>grow.</b> He tries to tell her that her tail is just right for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her <b>tail</b> <b>grow.</b> The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her <b>tail</b> to <b>grow</b> to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, because now she is smarter." ...|$|R

60|$|Leaving the Coliseum, we {{went and}} sat down in the {{vicinity}} of the Arch of Constantine, and J----- and R----- went in quest of lizards. J----- soon caught a large one with two tails; one, a sort of afterthought, or appendix, or corollary to the original <b>tail,</b> and <b>growing</b> out <b>from</b> it instead of from the body of the lizard. These reptiles are very abundant, and J----- has already brought home several, which make their escape and appear occasionally darting to and fro on the carpet. Since we have been here, J----- has taken up various pursuits in turn. First he voted himself to gathering snail-shells, of which there are many sorts; afterwards he had a fever for marbles, pieces of which he found on the banks of the Tiber, just on the edge of its muddy waters, and in the Palace of the Caesars, the Baths of Caracalla, and indeed wherever else his fancy led him; verde antique, rosso antico, porphyry, giallo antico, serpentine, sometimes fragments of bas-reliefs and mouldings, bits of mosaic, still firmly stuck together, on which the foot of a Caesar had perhaps once trodden; pieces of Roman glass, with the iridescence glowing on them; and all such things, of which the soil of Rome is full. It would not be difficult, from the spoil of his boyish rambles, to furnish what would be looked upon as a curious and valuable museum in America.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We studied nine {{populations of}} Salamandrina perspicillata {{for two to}} nine years and {{described}} the life history variation among these population. Despite experiencing similar climatic conditions, populations differed in mean body size: populations using still water bodies for oviposition were larger body-sized than those using brooks. One semi-natural pond was used by particularly small individuals and was probably recently colonised. The mean body size of ovipositing females varied from year to year. Measurements of individuals in successive years showed that the <b>tail</b> <b>grew</b> more than the trunk and this differential growth increased with age. Females did not oviposit every year and, within a given population, the number of ovipositing females varied widely from year to year...|$|R
