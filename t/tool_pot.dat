40|$|In {{this article}} we seek to build on efforts to apply the {{insights}} of social learning theory to interpret patterns of continuity and change in the archaeological record. This literature suggests that stable and often highly arbitrary material culture traditions {{are likely to be}} founded on our biologically-evolved capacity for imitation. However, it has recently been argued that the latter may be insufficient to explain the long-term maintenance of complex and difficult-to-master skills, such as those required to produce stone <b>tools,</b> <b>pots,</b> textiles and other cognitively opaque cultural forms. To ensure that these skills are accurately transferred to the next generation, adults must actively guide and control the learning activities of their children, a mode of transmission that can be labelled ‘pedagogy’. The importance of pedagogy has often been overlooked in the theoretical and empirical literature on craft learning, a fact that can probably be attributed to an unnecessarily narrow conception of teaching that equates it with explicit linguistic instruction. Using ethnographic data gathered from detailed case studies, we characterise pedagogy in the context of craft apprenticeships as involving the gradual scaffolding of skill in a novice through demonstration, intervention and collaboration. Although these processes cannot be directly observed in the archaeological record, they can sometimes be inferred through the detailed reconstruction of operational chains in past technologies. The evidence we present suggests that pedagogy has played an essential role in securing the faithful transmission of skills across generations, and should be regarded as the central mechanism through which long-term and stable material culture traditions are propagated and maintained...|$|R

This effort involved Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, Inc. /Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp. (Contractor), Sandia National Laboratories, and ten industrial Participants including four major aircraft and aerospace companies, three advanced materials companies, and three electron beam processing organizations. The technical objective of the CRADA was to synthesize and/or modify high performance, electron beam curable materials that meet specific end-use application requirements. There were six tasks in this CRADA including: Electron beam materials development; Electron beam database development; Economic analysis; Low-cost Electron Beam tooling development; Electron beam curing systems integration; and Demonstration articles/prototype structures development. The contractor managed, participated and integrated all the tasks, and optimized the project efforts through the coordination, exchange, and dissemination of information to the project participants. Members of the Contractor team were also the principal inventors on several electron beam related patents and a 1997 R and D 100 Award winner on Electron-Beam-Curable Cationic Epoxy Resins. The CRADA achieved a major breakthrough for the composites industry by having successfully developed high-performance electron beam curable cationic epoxy resins for use in composites, adhesives, <b>tooling</b> compounds, <b>potting</b> compounds, syntactic foams, etc. UCB Chemicals, the world`s largest supplier of radiation-curable polymers, has acquired a license to produce and sell these resins worldwide...|$|R

5000|$|Infections {{of seeds}} and roots are {{initiated}} {{by both the}} mycelia and spores of Py. ultimum. Two spore types are made, depending on the strain. Py. ultimum is a species complex that includes var. ultimum and var. sporangiiferum. [...] The major distinguishing feature is that sporangia and zoospores (swimming spores) are produced only rarely by Py. ultimum var. ultimum. Both species make oospores, which are thick-walled structures produced by sexual recombination. Both species are self-fertile (homothallic), which means that a single strain can mate with itself. In addition to oospores, Py. ultimum var. ultimum also makes hyphal swellings which germinate in a manner resembling sporangia to form plant-infecting hyphae. One important ecological difference between {{the different types of}} spores is that sporangia and zoospores are short-lived, while the thick-walled oospores can persist for years within soil, surviving even winter freezes. Mycelia and oospores in soil can infect seeds or roots. This leads to wilting, reduced yield, and ultimately plant death. Common signs of a Pythium infection include stunting of the plants, brown coloration of root-tips, and wilting of the plant during the warm part of the day. Management of disease is challenging but focuses on sanitation, fungicides, and biological control. Fungicides include mefenoxam, thiadiazole, etridiazole, propamocarb, dimethomorph, and phosphonates. Biological control agents include the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces griseoviridis, and the fungi Candida oleophila, Gliocladium catenulatum, Trichoderma harziamum, and Trichoderma virens. [...] Effective resistance in the plant host is generally not available. Sanitation is very important since the pathogen can be easily introduced into pasteurized soil or even soil-free potting mixes on dirty <b>tools</b> or <b>pots.</b> Especially in greenhouses, fungus gnats may also help move the pathogen from place to place.|$|R

40|$|Water {{scarcity}} {{associated with}} climate change particularly threatens {{the sustainability of}} viticulture in most cultivated, drought prone areas. Breeding grapevine for reduced water use and maintained production (that is high water-use efficiency) is therefore of major interest. This requires a comprehensive knowledge of the physiological impacts of drought which are the most influential on yield and quality. Special attention should be paid to those mechanisms involved in the regulation of water status in plant tissues as the primary parameter affected by drought. Transpiration rate, which has major influence on plant water status, together with water-use efficiency, therefore require special attention in breeding programs. To progress on the determinism of transpiration rate and water-use efficiency in grapevine, we used a F 1 progeny made of 188 genotypes from a cross between two widespread cultivars, Syrah and Grenache, well-known for their contrasted water use. We showed the benefits of combining quantitative genetics (for QTL detection) and physiological experiments to study this population both in the vineyard and on potted plants. On the one hand, we developed an original experimental design in the field coupled to geostatistical modelling {{to take into account}} the spatial variability of soil water status inherent to vineyard conditions. This helped to identify significant genetic variability for the traits of interest. On the other hand, we combined powerful phenotyping <b>tools</b> on <b>potted</b> plants (high-throughput platform and controlled chambers) to control water deficit conditions and improve QTL detection. First, we found evidence that a dual physiological mechanism controls the decline of leaf water status under drought with a key role for plant hydraulic conductance beside that of stomatal control of transpiration. Contrasted combination of these two controls may lead to more or less efficient maintenance of leaf water status in response to soil drying (i. e. iso- or an isohydric behaviour). An indirect role of abscisic acid on stomatal conductance was also identified, mediated by the downregulation of leaf hydraulic conductance, with a genetic variability which correlated with genetic variation in iso- or aniso-hydric behaviour. We then revealed wide genetic variations in nocturnal transpiration, which correlated with variations in whole plant water-use efficiency (WUE), and identified corresponding genetic and physiological determinants. Lastly, we showed some consistency between QTLs detected for daytime WUE in pots and in the vineyard. Beyond the potential interest of the QTLs detected in this study for breeding prospects, this work demonstrated the interest of quantitative genetics to shed light on ecophysiological and physiological processes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{documents}} how ancient state expansion affected {{local communities}} and how political changes were experienced by families living outside a state’s heartland. During the Middle Horizon (AD 600 - 1000) {{the site of}} Wari in the central highlands of Peru became a large city that dominated the Ayacucho region. Its distinctive architecture and polychrome pottery started to appear at villages and towns beyond Ayacucho, leading many scholars {{to believe that the}} Wari state conquered widely and established tight control over several provinces across Peru. Scholars have studied the Wari capital, its heartland, and large Wari sites outside the heartland, but rarely have they studied smaller, local settlements to see how and if local populations were affected by the expansion of the Wari into their regions. In the Cusco region of the southern highlands of Peru, research has focused on two large Wari installations, Pikillaqta and Huaro. My research takes a complementary “bottom-up” approach and examines the impact of Wari state expansion on the village of Ak’awillay. Ak’awillay was first occupied in the Late Formative and grew to become the largest village (10 ha) of the Xaquixaguana Plain during the Middle Horizon. The pre-Middle Horizon and Middle Horizon contexts that I excavated at Ak’awillay provide a unique opportunity to evaluate change through time and assess Wari impact and local responses to Wari expansion in the region. Results suggest that the presence of Wari colonists in Cusco had a minimal impact on the villagers of Ak’awillay. They only rarely procured Wari vessels and obsidian, and they continued to practice the same kinds of domestic and ritual activities as they had before, using similar <b>pots,</b> <b>tools,</b> and paraphernalia through time. Most of the changes seen at Ak’awillay occurred before the arrival of Wari colonists and included the increasing importance of chicha drinking and the procurement of new pottery and stone materials through regional exchange networks. I conclude that the Wari state did not tightly control the population of the Cusco region and that some communities continued to live as they had. Wari presence in Cusco is best characterized as a colony, not a province...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste tyres has become an increasing problem in many countries worldwide. It is a costly issue for the whole tyre manufacturing and automobile industry, while the environmental costs {{over the years have}} reached significant levels. Current government’s regulations which ban landfilling in some developed countries such as United Kingdom have sparked an increased interest in finding new ways to dispose of waste tyres in environmentally safe manner. First part of this thesis explores the current status of the industry and identifies the most promising technologies which could provide a suitable solution for safe {{disposal of}} tyres. Once identified, the technology with the biggest potential is screened through a series of experiments which will form a basis for further process development. Finally, an in-depth economic analysis will evaluate the commercial feasibility of newly developed process and identify key recommendations for further work. After careful consideration, the pyrolysis of waste tyres was chosen for further process development and experimental research. The main goal of this work was to develop a suitable process for safe disposal of tyres and develop a unique tool which will provide a guideline on the process conditions required in order to optimize the production of a specific product. This <b>tool,</b> known as <b>POT</b> (Product Optimization Table) will play major part in identifying key operating conditions required for optimizing the overall process economics. Key findings in this report concentrate on identifying best possible process conditions required to make the process as economically favorable as possible at current market conditions. This is achieved by completing a case study together with a number of different economic models and looking at what makes the particular model economically viable. The result of this economic analysis points out a few major limitations of waste tyre pyrolysis process and dwells deeper into finding the key causes for this. Key recommendations presented {{at the end of this}} report are aimed at tyre manufacturing industry as well as relevant government bodies. Federal governments of developed nations are to play a major role in promoting the commercialization of the waste tyre pyrolysis technology. It is clear that new technology such as pyrolysis which is characterized by high risk and minimal returns is going to struggle in today’s market. Implementing the recommendations given in this report is crucial in order to encourage significant investments into technology such as pyrolysis and aid the further development and commercialization in the near future...|$|R
6000|$|Another {{indirect}} verification {{is that we}} thus get a clear {{conception of}} Fetichism in general. Under the fetichistic mode of thought, surrounding objects and agents are regarded as having powers more or less definitely personal in their natures; and the current interpretation is, that human intelligence, in its early stages, is obliged to conceive of their powers under this form. I have myself hitherto accepted this interpretation; though always {{with a sense of}} dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction was, I think, well grounded. The theory is scarcely a theory properly so-called; but rather, a restatement in other words. Uncivilized men do habitually form anthropomorphic conceptions of surrounding things; and this observed general fact is transformed into the theory that at first they must so conceive them--a theory for which the psychological justification attempted, seems to me inadequate. From our present stand-point, it becomes manifest that Fetichism is not primary but secondary. What has been said above almost of itself shows this. Let us, however, follow out the steps of its genesis. Respecting the Tasmanians, Dr. Milligan says:--"The names of men and women were taken from natural objects and occurrences around, as, for instance, a kangaroo, a gum tree, snow, hail, thunder, the wind," [...] flowers in blossom, etc. Surrounding objects, then, giving origin to names of persons, and being, in the way shown, eventually mistaken for the actual progenitors of those who descend from persons nicknamed after them, it results that these surrounding objects come to be regarded as in some manner possessed of personalities like the human. He whose family tradition is that his ancestor was [...] "the Crab," [...] will conceive the crab as having a disguised inner power like his own; an alleged descent from [...] "the Palm-tree" [...] will entail belief in some kind of consciousness dwelling in the palm-tree. Hence, in proportion as the animals, plants, and inanimate objects or agents that originate names of persons, become numerous (which they will do in proportion as a tribe becomes large and the number of persons to be distinguished from one another increases), multitudinous things around will acquire imaginary personalities. And so it will happen that, as Mr. McLennan says of the Feejeeans, [...] "Vegetables and stones, nay, even <b>tools</b> and weapons, <b>pots</b> and canoes, have souls that are immortal, and that, like the souls of men, pass on at last to Mbulu, the abode of departed spirits." [...] Setting out, then, with a belief in the still-living other self of the dead ancestor, the alleged general cause of misapprehension affords us an intelligible origin of the fetichistic conception; and we are enabled to see how it tends to become a general, if not a universal, conception.|$|R
