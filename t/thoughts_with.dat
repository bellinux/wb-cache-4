25|$|According to Derkx, freethought {{serves to}} get one closer to the truth. To {{be able to think}} freely, freedom of expression, free inquiry, freedom of association, freedom of {{assembly}} and tolerance are essential. All relevant possibilites about how the world is and works or should work, may be considered, discussed, investigated and argued out, despite potential aversion one may have regarding certain ideas. In the end, true knowledge is not achieved by any individual alone, but by a free exchange of <b>thoughts</b> <b>with</b> others. All ideas may be proposed and also criticised, no single opinion may be excluded.|$|E

25|$|Students {{with special}} needs {{struggle}} not only with writing and reading acquisition, but with social and emotional development and confidence about their writing. Dialogue journals as an individualized means of private, mutual communication can provide students with support in handling emotions, conflicts, and frustrations. For students with limited writing confidence and proficiency, the opportunity to express ideas and <b>thoughts</b> <b>with</b> teacher elaboration and modeling, and without correction, {{has been shown to}} increase their time on task, writing length, and writing quality. Using a single-subject baseline and intervention design, Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, and Young explored the value of dialogue journals in developing a more supportive student-teacher relationship with emotionally and behaviorally challenged middle school students.|$|E
25|$|Outside his {{official}} duties, McCormick began the Arizona Miner with a Ramage press {{he had brought}} with him. The newspaper's first edition was printed on March 9, 1864, at Fort Whipple and began regular operations in Prescott on June 22, 1864. McCormick's control of the newspaper aided his political career by ensuring he could always receive favorable press coverage. The paper also provided a forum for McCormick to share his <b>thoughts</b> <b>with</b> the people of Arizona. In 1868, following the territorial capital's move to Tucson, McCormick sold his property in Prescott and purchased {{an interest in the}} Weekly Arizonian. His association with the Arizonian continued till October 1, 1870, when the paper's editor withdrew support for McCormick. McCormick's response was to repossess the paper's printing press and begin a new newspaper, the Arizona Citizen, on October 15, 1870.|$|E

It was written and produced by Madonna, Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid, with additional writing from MoZella and Toby Gad. Originally intended for a Valentine's Day 2015 release, the song was rush-released as the lead single from the album on December 20, 2014, by Interscope Records, after demos recorded for the album leaked on to the internet. An EDM and house track on which Madonna experimented with different musical genres, [...] "Living for Love" [...] contains instrumentation from percussion and piano by singer Alicia Keys, along with a gospel choir. Madonna composed the track as a break-up song, however she wanted to deviate and make the lyrics as uplifting in nature, talking about counteracting negative <b>thoughts</b> <b>with</b> positive responses.|$|E

[...] As a matter of due process, the ministers would have to be sworn in, but would agree to do so only if the defence witnesses spoke first.|$|E

He did not have any dialogue in the film and the actor's acting muscles were stretched as he had to use body language and facial expressions to convey his feelings and <b>thoughts,</b> <b>with</b> Vikram also applying the make up for the character himself.

His next release, the revenge drama Arul directed by Hari, garnered poor reviews and box office collections.|$|E
500|$|Pausch based {{the lecture}} on the generic [...] "Last Lecture" [...] given by some professors, and {{on the idea of}} imagining what one would say and what one would want their legacy to be if they could only have one last chance to share their {{knowledge}} with the world. Carnegie Mellon had previously had a lecture series titled the [...] "Last Lecture", but had renamed the series to [...] "Journeys", and had staff talk about their professional experiences. Pausch was offered the lecture around the time when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and had just received the news that he only had a few months left to live after his unsuccessful treatment for the tumors. Pausch nearly cancelled the lecture due to the terminal cancer, but discussed the issue with his wife and decided to take the one final chance to share his <b>thoughts</b> <b>with</b> the world. Pausch compared it to the final scene of The Natural, in which Roy Hobbs (the main character) overcomes injury and old age to hit one final home run.|$|E
500|$|Locke advises {{parents to}} {{carefully}} nurture their children's physical [...] "habits" [...] before pursuing their academic education. As many scholars have remarked, it is unsurprising that a trained physician, as Locke was, would begin Some <b>Thoughts</b> <b>with</b> {{a discussion of}} children's physical needs, yet this seemingly simple generic innovation {{has proven to be}} one of Locke's most enduring legacies—Western child-rearing manuals are still dominated by the topics of food and sleep. To convince parents that they must attend to the health of their children above all, Locke quotes from Juvenal's Satires—"a sound mind in a sound body." [...] Locke firmly believed that children should be exposed to harsh conditions while young to inure them to, for example, cold temperatures when they were older: [...] "Children [...] be not too warmly clad or covered, winter or summer" [...] (Locke's emphasis), he argues, because [...] "bodies will endure anything that from the beginning they are accustomed to." [...] Furthermore, to prevent a child from catching chills and colds, Locke suggests that [...] "his feet to be washed every day in cold water, and to have his shoes so thin that they might leak and let in water whenever he comes near it" [...] (Locke's emphasis). Locke posited that if children were accustomed to having sodden feet, a sudden shower that wet their feet would not cause them to catch a cold. Such advice (whether followed or not) was quite popular; it appears throughout John Newbery's children's books {{in the middle of the}} eighteenth century, for example, the first best-selling children's books in England. Locke also offers specific advice on topics ranging from bed linens to diet to sleeping regimens.|$|E

500|$|Peng {{participated in}} group {{meetings}} in the early portion of the conference, gaining consensus among his peers for criticizing the widespread practice of inaccurately reporting agricultural statistics, and emphasizing that [...] "everybody had a share of responsibility, including Comrade Mao Zedong". Peng bluntly criticized the hesitation of senior Party members to disagree with the Party leadership, implying that many Party leaders were cowardly for following orders that they knew {{were not in the}} best interests of the Chinese people. After gaining the consensus of several of his peers, Peng developed his opinions more systematically, but was hesitant to bring up the full range of his criticisms in public. Peng discussed his <b>thoughts</b> <b>with</b> several other senior Party leaders (notably the CCP Secretary of Hunan, Zhou Xiaozhou(周小舟)), and Peng's colleagues encouraged Peng to visit Mao privately in order to win Mao's support for a reversal of the policies of the Great Leap Forward. Peng visited Mao's quarters on the night of July 13, but found Mao asleep, and wrote Mao a [...] "letter of opinion" [...] articulating Peng's ideas instead. Peng delivered the letter to Mao on the morning of July 14, but Mao did not read the letter until July 17. Later on July 17 Mao had Peng's letter widely circulated among the other delegates at the conference. Peng did not intend his letter to be widely read and attempted to prevent its circulation, but was not successful. Most other senior leaders, including Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, supported Peng's position before Mao began to attack it, indicating that they shared Peng's views and that they did not see Peng's letter as an attack on the Chairman.|$|E
500|$|Sunset Overdrives {{gameplay}} {{was also}} commended by many reviewers. Prell compared the game favorably to Jet Grind Radio, Saints Row The Third, Infamous, and Ratchet & Clank. He singled out the traversal system, which {{he thought was}} fluid and well-executed. He added that the fast travel system was not useful in this game, since players can {{find a lot of}} fun by simply traveling between different locations in the game's world. He thought that all of the game's systems intertwined with each other, and ultimately made the game a complete and worthwhile experience. Reiner echoed similar thoughts, and considered getting around Sunset City fun for players. He added that the traversal system increased the game's replay value. However, he was disappointed by the game's occasionally repetitive mission design. Sliva and Brown shared similar <b>thoughts,</b> <b>with</b> the latter saying that the game featured too many fetch quests. Patterson disliked the game's traversal; he found that the system was frustrating at times. However, he thought that this problem [...] lessened as players unlocked new moves and skills. Gies felt overwhelmed by the traversal options. He added that Insomniac had successfully created a system that was accessible for ordinary players, while creating challenges {{for those who want to}} master the system. However, he noted the camera system may not able to track the movement of the character accurately. He further commended the game's world design, and described it as one of the most [...] "navigationally sophisticated" [...] worlds he had ever experienced in a game. [...] Bischoff considered the shooting mechanic [...] "loose", but thought that the problem was overshadowed by the game's forgiving aiming and steady difficulty curve. Lucas Sullivan also criticized the mechanic, calling it [...] "inconsistent".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Let There Be Love" [...] was premiered on Aguilera's {{official}} channel on YouTube on August 29, 2013.

It also featured guest appearances from Nicole Richie, Christina Milian, Chris Mann, Aguilera's son, Max Bratman, and her current boyfriend Matthew Rutler. The video begins with Aguilera' message, [...] "Hey everybody Chrisitina here just thanking you guys so much for filling my life and my heart with so much love continued throughout the years...
