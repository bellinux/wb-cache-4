40|$|Having large {{proportion}} of forests in mountainous terrain in Turkey, the <b>logging</b> <b>methods</b> that not only minimize operational costs but also minimize environmental damages should be determined in forest operations planning. In a case where necessary logging equipment and machines are available, ground slope {{is the most important}} factor in determining the <b>logging</b> <b>method.</b> For this reason, accurate, up to date, and precise ground slope data is very crucial in the success of forest operations planning. In recent years, high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) can be generated for forested areas by using Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS method and these DEMs can be used to develop precise slope maps. In this study, high-resolution DEM was developed by RTK-GPS method to generate precise slope map in a sample area.

40|$|Electronics {{have become}} a {{standard}} in agricultural equipment and the trend of “smarter” equipment is on the rise. To have “smarter” equipment, a working knowledge of {{the accuracy of the}} data being transmitted throughout that equipment is needed. The controller area network (CAN) bus is the current interface to machine operation data transmitted between electronic control units (ECUs). Because CAN bus has been around for nearly thirty years, numerous devices have been created for interfacing with the bus. Choosing a device can be a challenge, especially without knowing if there are differences between the <b>logging</b> <b>methods</b> for true data representation. By logging simultaneously with three different methods, data was analyzed to determine if excessive error existed between logged datasets. Additionally because many messages are calculated (e. g., not measured directly), determining the accuracy of those messages can be important for management decisions or research studies. One calculated CAN bus message that holds a great deal of value is the engine fuel rate, and because it is calculated rather than measured, excessive error may exist in the CAN bus value. A comparison between the calculated CAN bus fuel rate message and a physically measured fuel rate provided information on the message accuracy. The Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory (NTTL) has a certified fuel rate measuring system capable of ± 0. 5 % accuracy. Results showed that error between <b>logging</b> <b>methods</b> was quite low, however file size was an issue with some of the <b>logging</b> <b>methods.</b> Waveform file <b>logging</b> required only 6 % memory space compared to the frame <b>logging</b> <b>methods.</b> Fuel rate as recorded from the CAN bus resulted in a ± 5 % error from physically measured fuel rates. Error for higher fuel rates within the torque curve were closer to ± 1 %. These results indicated that the fuel rate given by the CAN bus can indeed be used for management or research purposes.

While both disturbances reduce SOL thickness relative to undisturbed forest sites, fire reduces SOL thickness to a greater degree than logging (Simard et al. 2001). In addition, differences in soil disturbance severity, whether caused by fire or logging, also result in differences in SOL thickness: stands experiencing high-severity soil burns have significantly thinner SOL than those experiencing low-severity soil burns and <b>logging</b> <b>methods</b> that severely disturb the SOL, such as clearcutting, have a greater potential to reduce SOL thickness than methods dedicated to soil protection such as careful logging (Lafleur et al. 2016).

30|$|Most {{carbonate}} reservoirs have {{complexity and}} heterogeneity {{as a result}} of their naturally fractured characteristic. These fractures have significant influence on the reservoir behavior and performance, such that they can produce complex paths for fluid movement, which impact reservoir characterization and production. Therefore, understanding fracture properties is very important (Roehl and Choduette 1985). Fractured zones can be detected both directly and indirectly using seismic sections, petrophysical logs, well tests, drilling mud loss history and core description (Thompson 2000; Nelson 2001; Martinez-Torres 2002; Dutta et al. 2007). Advanced <b>logging</b> <b>methods</b> for fracture analysis and detection, like the borehole acoustic televiewer, Formation Microscanner (FMS), Formation MicroImager (FMI) and Electric MicroImaging (EMI) are more accurate, but they naturally require higher cost and can only produce images at specific certain intervals.
