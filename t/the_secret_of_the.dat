5|$|The {{synopsis}} continues a plot {{begun in}} <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn.|$|E
5|$|Hergé also {{inserted}} {{references to}} previous {{stories in the}} narrative; he included the three models of the Unicorn, originally featured in <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn, in a background scene at Marlinspike Hall.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's next Adventure of Tintin {{would be}} <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn, serialised in Le Soir from June 1942. He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had {{introduced}} many elements {{from the work}} of Jules Verne into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure. <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in Red Rackham's Treasure, serialised in Le Soir from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of Professor Calculus being introduced to the series. Following Red Rackham's Treasure, Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled Dupont et Dupond, détectives ("Thomson and Thompson, Detectives"), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Black Island linked to Hergé's other Adventures in various ways; he {{connected}} the counterfeit {{money in the}} story to the counterfeit idol in The Broken Ear and the fake bunker in Tintin in the Land of the Soviets. He also connected Tintin's solving of the puzzle in the airman's jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn, and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or mort (death), it linked to Tintin's transmitting from the crypt of Marlinspike Hall in <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn.|$|E
5|$|Lundy {{island is}} {{prominently}} featured in John Bellairs' juvenile gothic mystery, <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Underground Room.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn was set {{entirely in}} Belgium {{and was the}} last Adventure to be set there until The Castafiore Emerald. It would also be Hergé's {{favourite}} story until Tintin in Tibet.|$|E
5|$|Hergé first {{devised the}} idea of sending Tintin {{on a mission to}} the Moon while he was working on Prisoners of the Sun (1949). His {{decision}} to move into the field of science fiction might have been influenced by his friendly rivalry with his colleague Edgar P. Jacobs, who had recently had success with his own science fiction comic, <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swordfish (1950–53). He decided {{that it would be a}} two-volume story arc, as had proved successful with his earlier arcs, <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn (1943) and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944), and The Seven Crystal Balls (1948) and Prisoners of the Sun. He had initially intended on beginning this story after the culmination of Prisoners of the Sun, but both his wife Germaine Remi and his close friend Marcel Dehaye convinced him to proceed with Land of Black Gold (1950), a story that he had previously left unfinished, instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the {{animation}} company Belvision Studios produced Hergé's Adventures of Tintin, {{a series of}} daily five-minute colour adaptations based upon Hergé's original comics. <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn was the fourth to be adapted in the second animated series; it was directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, a well-known cartoonist who was to become editor-in-chief of Tintin magazine.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, a music album called Vayuputras, an {{original}} soundtrack {{based on the}} Shiva Trilogy books, was released. The album {{is an extension of}} The Immortals of Meluha and <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nagas with special tracks inspired by important junctures like Shiva's dance and the war speech in the books. Artists like Sonu Nigam, Taufiq Qureshi, Palash Sen, Bickram Ghosh worked on the album. This was the first time ever that {{an original}} soundtrack was made for a book series.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{begins in}} a chamber {{containing}} the Bequest Globe, a device which the player has recently inherited. The Globe {{is a giant}} brass cylinder full of gears, fronted by a clock face made of sliding and rotating plates comprising twenty-two Roman numerals, which represent the Major Arcana, with the Jewish Kabbalah in its center. A voice welcomes the player and tells them the Globe is a gift, then explains that the player must unlock <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drowned god.|$|E
5|$|As with Hergé's two {{previous}} stories, <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, The Seven Crystal Balls {{was designed as}} part of a twofold story arc, to be concluded with the then yet unnamed Prisoners of the Sun. Hergé planned for the former story to outline a mystery, while the latter would see his characters undertake an expedition to solve it. His use of an ancient mummy's curse around which the narrative revolved was inspired by tales of a curse of the pharaohs which had been unearthed during the archaeologist Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb. This {{was not the first time}} that Hergé had been inspired by this tabloid story, having previously done so when authoring Cigars of the Pharaoh.|$|E

5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E
5|$|In Pondicherry, Aurobindo {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, {{after four years of}} secluded yoga, he started a monthly philosophical magazine called Arya. This ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, he revised some of these works before they were published in book form. Some of the book series derived out of this publication were The Life Divine, The Synthesis of Yoga, Essays on The Gita, <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Veda, Hymns to the Mystic Fire, The Upanishads, The Renaissance in India, War and Self-determination, The Human Cycle, The Ideal of Human Unity and The Future Poetry were published in this magazine.|$|E
5|$|In {{previous}} works, Hergé {{had drawn}} upon {{a variety of}} pictorial sources, such as newspaper clippings, from which to draw the scenes and characters; for <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources. In drawing {{many of the old}} vessels, Hergé initially consulted the then recently published L'Art et la Mer ("Art and the Sea") by Alexandre Berqueman. Seeking further accurate depictions of old naval vessels, Hergé consulted a friend of his, Gérard Liger-Belair, who owned a Brussels shop specialising in model ships. Liger-Belair produced plans of a 17th-century French fifty-gun warship for Hergé to copy; Le Brillant, which had been constructed in Le Havre in 1690 by the shipwright Salicon and then decorated by Jean Bérain the Elder.|$|E

After cunningly obtaining <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dacoits' cave, Kasim sentences Alibaba to death, falsely accusing him of attempted murder. Marziana pretends to heed Kasim's order. She declares that Alibaba has been unfaithful to her and he deserves this retribution.

A fight ensues between Alibaba and Kasim's thugs (during which Salima is accidentally killed), but Alibaba subdues them and escapes with his allies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nagas is {{the second}} novel of the Shiva trilogy series by the Indian author Amish Tripathi. The story {{takes place in the}} {{imaginary}} land of Meluha and narrates how the inhabitants of that land are saved from their wars by a nomad named Shiva. It begins from where its predecessor, The Immortals of Meluha, left off, with Shiva trying to save Sati from the invading Naga. Later Shiva takes his troop of soldiers and travels far east to the land of Branga, where he wishes to find a clue to reach the Naga people. Shiva also learns that Sati's first child is still alive, as well as her twin sister. His journey ultimately leads him to the Naga capital of Panchavati, where he finds a surprise waiting for him.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure {{were the}} first two Adventures of Tintin to be {{published}} in English-language translations for the British market. Published by Casterman, these two editions sold poorly and have since become rare collector's items. Both stories would be republished for the British market seven years later, this time by Methuen with new translations provided by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper. In the English translation, Sir Francis Haddock was described as serving the British monarch Charles II, in contrast to the original French version, in which he serves French king Louis XIV.|$|E
