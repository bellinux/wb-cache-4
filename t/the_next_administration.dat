5|$|Hayes {{declined}} to seek re-election in 1880, keeping his pledge {{that he would}} not run for a second term. He was gratified with the election of fellow Ohio Republican James A. Garfield to succeed him, and consulted with him on appointments for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>administration.</b> After Garfield's inauguration, Hayes and his family returned to Spiegel Grove. In 1881, he was elected a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He served as commander-in-chief (national president) of the Loyal Legion from 1888 until his death in 1893. Although he remained a loyal Republican, Hayes was not too disappointed in Grover Cleveland's election to the Presidency in 1884, approving of the New York Democrat's views on civil service reform. He was also pleased at the progress of the political career of William McKinley, his army comrade and political protégé.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the 2000s, {{the need}} for F-22s was debated due to rising costs {{and the lack of}} {{relevant}} adversaries. In 2006, Comptroller General of the United States David Walker found that [...] "the DoD has not demonstrated the need" [...] for more investment in the F-22, and further opposition to the program was expressed by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England, Senator John McCain, and Chairman of U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services Senator John Warner. The F-22 program lost influential supporters in 2008 after the forced resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force General T. Michael Moseley. Nevertheless, in 2008, Congress passed a defense spending bill funding the F-22's continued production and the Pentagon released $50million of the $140million for four additional aircraft, raising the total orders for production aircraft to 187 and leaving the program in the hands of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E

In this respect Chancellor Alistair Darling flew to Brussels to attend a meeting of European finance ministers. In London, Brown held meetings with Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, his deputy leader Harriet Harman, Secretary of State for Energy Ed Miliband and Tony Blair's former special adviser Alastair Campbell. Brown also sent an email to party activists in which he thanked them for their work during the election campaign. It concluded [...] "The past few days have seen us enter a political landscape not considered possible a few short weeks ago - with {{the outcome of the}} election leading to no single party able to form a majority government. My duty as prime minister has been to seek to resolve this situation." [...] Several senior Labour backbenchers, including MP George Howarth called on [...] Brown to step down.|$|E

Mullen responded, [...] "Congress, and not the military, is responsible for DADT." [...] Previously, during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2007, Mullen told lawmakers, [...] "I really think it is for the American people to come forward, really through this body, to both debate that policy and make changes, if that's appropriate." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'd love to have Congress make its own decisions" [...] with respect to considering repeal.|$|E
2500|$|During this {{transitional}} period, Moynihan {{maintained an}} academic affiliation {{as a fellow}} at Wesleyan University's Center for Advanced Studies from 1964 to 1967.

After commencing a second extended leave because of his public service in 1973, his line was transferred to the University's Department of Government, where he remained until 1977. From 1966 to 1969, he also held a secondary administrative appointment as director of the Harvard–MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies. With turmoil and riots in the United States, Moynihan, [...] "a national board member of ADA incensed at the radicalism of the current anti-war and Black Power movements", decided to [...] "call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives," [...] and wrote that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>administration</b> would {{have to be able to}} unite the nation again.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2008, {{following}} {{the rescue of}} 15 hostages by the Colombian military in Operation Jaque, the government tried made contact with the FARC, notably the organization's new leader Alfonso Cano, to offer them a [...] "dignified" [...] exit. Near the end of Uribe's term in January 2010, the then-High Commissioner for Peace, Frank Pearl, told U.S. Ambassador William Brownfield that he had opened channels of communication with the FARC to build confidence and prepare roadmaps for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>administration.</b> In February 2010, according to a US diplomatic cable, intermediaries were preparing a meeting between government and FARC officials in Sweden. Nevertheless, as per another US diplomatic cable from February 2009 published by Wikileaks, President Uribe expressed skepticism towards the idea of reaching a negotiated settlement with the FARC {{in a meeting with}} then-United States Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg. Uribe judged that the FARC [...] "would never negotiate as long as it enjoyed a safe haven in Venezuela coupled with a steady income from drug trafficking." [...] Indeed, Pearl's rapprochements with the FARC were abruptly interrupted by the FARC by the return of the human remains of colonel Julián Guevara, held hostage for 12 years, in April 2010.|$|E
60|$|Great statesmanship {{and great}} generalship {{have been more}} than once shown by the same man, and, {{naturally}} enough, because they both result from the same qualities of mind, an instant apprehension of the demand of the moment, and a self-confidence that can as instantly meet it, so that every energy of the man is gathered to one intense focus. It is the faculty of being a present man, instead of a prospective one; of being ready, instead of getting ready. Though we think great injustice has been done by the public to General McClellan's really high merits as an officer, yet it seems to us that those very merits show precisely the character of intellect to unfit him for the task just now demanded of a statesman. His capacity for organization may be conspicuous; but, be it what it may, {{it is one thing to}} bring order out of the confusion of mere inexperience, and quite another to retrieve it from a chaos of elements mutually hostile, which is the problem sure to present itself to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>administration.</b> This will constantly require precisely that judgment on the nail, and not to be drawn for at three days' sight, of which General McClellan has shown least.|$|E
