She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E

It's why I believe {{the right way to}} solve these very personal issues is to let people vote on them, don't have judges decide it, don't even have representative government decide it, let people vote on it in the states.

40|$|Abstract: This essay {{comments}} on Stuart Henry’s {{important contribution to}} our thinking about the administration of interdisciplinary programs. Though I quibble {{with a few of}} the arguments he makes in the last volume of Issues, I focus my remarks on adding to Henry’s suggested strategies for defending interdisciplinarity. I conclude with brief observations on the question of academic appointments and on teaching and learning. Stuart Henry has performed a valuable service to the interdisciplinary mission by clearly articulating the dangers faced by interdisciplinary programs. He is entirely correct in suggesting that we not be lulled into complacency by the fact that our enrollments are increasing in both absolute and relative terms. Interdisciplinary programs are particularly vulnerable in times of budgetary stringency. While the attendance and comments at our roundtable at the national 2005 AIS/AGLS conference suggest that his concerns resonate widely, I likely have a more Pollyannish outlook on the future than Henry. I also quibble with a few elements of Henry’s argument. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exceedingly careful with respect to arguments that interdisciplinar...|$|E

60|$|Now, {{looking at}} the {{question}} of {{what we want to do}} in this broad and general way, it appears to me that it is necessary for us, in the first place, to amend and improve our system of primary education in such a fashion as will make it a proper preparation for the business of life. In the second place, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> consider what measures may best be adopted for the development to its uttermost of that which may be called technical skill; and, in the third place, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> consider what other matters there are for us to attend to, what other arrangements <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be kept carefully in sight in order that, while pursuing these ends, we do not forget that which is the end of civil existence, I mean a stable social state without which all other measures are merely futile, and, in effect, modes of going faster to ruin.|$|R
