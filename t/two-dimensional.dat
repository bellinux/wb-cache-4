25|$|As with <b>two-dimensional</b> nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (2DNMR) spectroscopy, this technique spreads the spectrum in two dimensions and allows for the observation of cross peaks that contain information on the coupling between different modes. In contrast to 2DNMR, nonlinear <b>two-dimensional</b> infrared spectroscopy also involves the excitation to overtones. These excitations result in excited state absorption peaks located below the diagonal and cross peaks. In 2DNMR, two distinct techniques, COSY and NOESY, are frequently used. The cross peaks in the first {{are related to the}} scalar coupling, while in the latter they are related to the spin transfer between different nuclei. In nonlinear <b>two-dimensional</b> infrared spectroscopy, analogs have been drawn to these 2DNMR techniques. Nonlinear <b>two-dimensional</b> infrared spectroscopy with zero waiting time corresponds to COSY, and nonlinear <b>two-dimensional</b> infrared spectroscopy with finite waiting time allowing vibrational population transfer corresponds to NOESY. The COSY variant of nonlinear <b>two-dimensional</b> infrared spectroscopy has been used for determination of the secondary structure content of proteins.|$|E

25|$|Nonlinear <b>two-dimensional</b> {{infrared}} spectroscopy is the infrared version of correlation spectroscopy. Nonlinear <b>two-dimensional</b> {{infrared spectroscopy}} {{is a technique}} that has become available {{with the development of}} femtosecond infrared laser pulses. In this experiment, first a set of pump pulses is applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time during which the system is allowed to relax. The typical waiting time lasts from zero to several picoseconds, and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied, resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear <b>two-dimensional</b> infrared spectrum is a <b>two-dimensional</b> correlation plot of the frequency ω1 that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency ω3 excited by the probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes; because of its extremely fine time resolution, {{it can be used to}} monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale. It is still a largely unexplored technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.|$|E

25|$|Every Riemann {{surface is}} a <b>two-dimensional</b> real {{analytic}} manifold (i.e., a surface), but it contains more structure (specifically a complex structure) which {{is needed for}} the unambiguous definition of holomorphic functions. A <b>two-dimensional</b> real manifold {{can be turned into}} a Riemann surface (usually in several inequivalent ways) if and only if it is orientable and metrizable. So the sphere and torus admit complex structures, but the Möbius strip, Klein bottle and real projective plane do not.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the Coriolis force on {{ballistic}} trajectories {{should not be confused}} with the curvature of the paths of missiles, satellites, and similar objects when the paths are plotted on <b>two-dimensional</b> (flat) maps, such as the Mercator projection. The projections of the three-dimensional curved surface of the Earth to a <b>two-dimensional</b> surface (the map) necessarily results in distorted features. The apparent curvature of the path is a consequence of the sphericity of the Earth and would occur even in a non-rotating frame.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographic}} {{coordinate system}} uses the azimuth and {{elevation of the}} spherical coordinate system to express locations on Earth, calling them respectively longitude and latitude. Just as the <b>two-dimensional</b> Cartesian coordinate system is useful on the plane, a <b>two-dimensional</b> spherical coordinate system is useful {{on the surface of}} a sphere. In this system, the sphere is taken as a unit sphere, so the radius is unity and can generally be ignored. This simplification can also be very useful when dealing with objects such as rotational matrices.|$|E
