25|$|The CharlieCard {{can store}} value (keep a cash balance) {{and hold a}} {{combination}} of time-based passes which allow unlimited rides during a set period of time. Passengers use the plastic CharlieCard by tapping it against a target on a gate or a vehicle farebox.

The gate or farebox then either automatically debits the cost of the passenger's ride, or verifies that the card has a valid transfer or that the card has a pass that is valid for travel at the given time and location. Transit riders can add value or a monthly pass to their cards at machines located at MBTA stations and vehicles, MBTA ticket offices, retail sales terminals at select outlets and online.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} a digital wallet {{has been around for}} a few years. Sometimes <b>the</b> words “digital <b>wallet</b> ” and “smart wallet ” are used interchangeably. This is not the case in this thesis, however. <b>The</b> smart <b>wallet</b> is more than just an {{electronic}} payment card embed-ded into a smart phone; it truly performs all the functions of <b>the</b> traditional <b>wallet</b> but only in digital format. This thesis will discuss the main challenges and roadblocks that need to be addressed in order to build a successful smart wallet. It is noteworthy that the functionalities of <b>the</b> traditional <b>wallet</b> including <b>the</b> credit and debit cards, cash, driving license, and membership and identity cards can be found in <b>the</b> smart <b>wallet.</b> In addi-tion, <b>the</b> smart <b>wallet</b> also acts as a depository for promotional coupons and receipts enabling the user to take advantage of instantaneous marketing campaigns of all sorts, and it also meets the needs to return unused or unnecessary goods if needed. Further-more, <b>the</b> smart <b>wallet</b> enables <b>the</b> transfer of business cards to other digital <b>wallets</b> without hassle. <b>The</b> smart <b>wallet</b> is also secure due to the effective built-in security fea-tures.

25|$|CS:GO is not {{the first}} video game where players have traded, sold, or bought virtual in-game items, but the ease of {{accessing}} and transferring through the Steam Marketplace made it a successful virtual economy. However, with increased monetary values placed on some skins, the Steam Marketplace became infeasible. The Steam Marketplace only allows sales up to $400, with all transactions subject to a 15% fee collected by Valve. Trades and purchases via the Steam Marketplace required players to add funds to their Steam Wallets to purchase skins from others, with those funds being placed in <b>the</b> <b>Wallet</b> of the seller; such funds could not be taken out as real-world money, as otherwise Valve would be regulated as a bank. As the value of skins grew beyond these limits, new websites opened up that used the Steamworks application programming interface (API) to link players' inventory to these sites as to manage the trading of CS:GO skins while enabling these users to spend more and receive money through other online banking/payment sites like PayPal or using digital currency like Bitcoin, and bypassing Valve's transaction fee.|$|E

To persuade her to stay, Charlie brings pizza to a family of poor puppies and their mother, Flo, at the old abandoned church. While there, Anne-Marie becomes upset at Charlie for stealing <b>the</b> <b>wallet.</b> She goes to the attic and wishes to live with the couple in the future. After a nightmare in which he is sent to Hell for eternity, Charlie wakes up in the room, only to find Anne-Marie gone. The couple, Kate and Harold, welcome Anne-Marie into their home, serving waffles. While they privately discuss adopting her, Charlie arrives and tricks her into leaving with him. Walking home, Charlie is shot by Carface and Killer, but finds that he is unable to be harmed as long as he is wearing the watch. Anne-Marie and Charlie hide in an abandoned building, but the ground breaks and they fall into the lair of King Gator. He and Charlie strike a chord as kindred spirits and he lets them go, but Anne-Marie falls ill with pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|As the {{deadline}} nears, the LBA executives begin to panic and lash out, {{resulting in a}} contradictory sequence where Wolfe is fired and then rehired within a span of minutes. When all seems lost, however, an anonymous source sends copies of the answers {{to each of the}} contestants, thus voiding the contest and saving LBA. Although Archie, the LBA executives and the police suspect Wolfe of doing so, he insists that he was not responsible, and begins to suspect one of the advertising executives of at least stealing <b>the</b> <b>wallet,</b> if not murdering Dahlmann. After the letters are sent, Vernon Assa approaches Wolfe and attempts to unilaterally dismiss him from the case, but Wolfe refuses. His suspicions aroused, Wolfe summons the major players to his office and claims he will reveal the identity of the thief, and in doing so provide the police with vital information to help them identify the murderer. Before he can do so, however, Vernon Assa is poisoned with cyanide surreptitiously slipped into his drink and dies on the floor of Wolfe's office. Dahlmann's wallet is found in his pocket, suggesting that he was the thief and murderer.|$|E

25|$|Nero Wolfe is {{approached}} by corporate attorney Rudolf Hansen and his clients Oliver Burr, Vernon Assa and Patrick O'Garro, the chief executives of Manhattan advertising agency Lipton Burr Assa (LBA). The group want Wolfe {{to save them}} from embarrassment and ruin following the murder of Louis Dahlmann, an up-and-coming advertising executive with the firm. Dahlmann's wallet was also stolen, and inside were the final answers {{for a series of}} cryptic poetic riddles run as part of a promotional competition for Pour Amour, a brand of perfume designed by one of LBA's clients. The first prize of the competition is $500,000, and in a meeting with the final five contestants the night before his death Dahlmann had revealed that he kept the answers in his wallet, both of which lead the police to suspect one of the contestants. The executives, however, do not want Wolfe to investigate the murder but to find out whole stole <b>the</b> <b>wallet</b> before the contest deadline—midnight of the nineteenth of April, exactly one week later—in order to ensure the integrity of proceedings and restore their reputation. Despite tension between the advertising agency and Talbott Heery, owner of the company that produces Pour Amour, Wolfe agrees to their terms.|$|E
25|$|Infuriated at {{the murderer}} for killing {{someone who was}} enjoying his {{hospitality}} and skeptical of Assa's guilt, Wolfe determines to identify the true culprit. He, along with Archie and Saul Panzer, travels to the offices of LBA and inspects a display of products from their clients, discovering a bottle of cyanide that he suspects was used to murder Assa; this confirms in Wolfe's mind the guilt {{of one of the}} executives. Confronting Burr, O'Garro and Hansen, Wolfe lays out {{the facts of the case}} and accuses Burr of murdering both Dahlmann and Assa. Burr is the only man who had clear means and opportunity, and Wolfe speculates that he was driven to murder Dahlmann out of jealousy and fear over Dahlmann's skills eclipsing and threatening his position. Assa discovered <b>the</b> <b>wallet</b> that Burr stole from Dahlmann to cover his tracks, and Burr murdered him to silence him. When Burr tries to throw guilt on O'Garro, O'Garro reveals that Wolfe is correct. Burr is convicted of murder, but the remaining LBA executives challenge Wolfe's fee, arguing that as the thief and murderer Burr presumably exposed himself when he sent out the letters containing the final answers. In response, Wolfe reveals in confidence that he will be adding onto his bill the price of a used typewriter that has been disposed of in the East River, implying that he was in fact responsible for sending out the letters and saving them from humiliation after all.|$|E

500|$|The team, led by Joseph Giordano, cut off Reagan's [...] "thousand dollar" [...] {{custom-made}} suit {{to examine}} him, much to Reagan's anger. Military officers, {{including the one}} who carried the nuclear football, unsuccessfully tried to prevent FBI agents from confiscating the suit, Reagan's wallet, and other possessions as evidence; the Gold Codes card was in <b>the</b> <b>wallet,</b> and the FBI did not return it until two days later. The medical personnel found that Reagan's systolic blood pressure was 60 versus the normal 140, indicating {{that he was in}} shock, and knew that most 70-year-olds in the president's condition would not survive. Reagan was in excellent physical health, however, and also was shot by the [...]22 caliber instead of the larger [...]38 as was first feared. They treated him with intravenous fluids, oxygen, tetanus toxoid, and chest tubes, and surprised Parr—who still believed that he had cracked the president's rib—by finding the entrance gunshot wound. Brady and the wounded agent McCarthy were operated on near the president; when his wife arrived in the emergency room, Reagan remarked to her, [...] "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing boxer Jack Dempsey's line to his wife the night he was beaten by Gene Tunney. While intubated, he scribbled to a nurse, [...] "All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia", borrowing W. C. Fields' line. Although Reagan came close to death, the team's quick action—and Parr's decision to drive to the hospital instead of the White House—likely saved the president's life, and within 30 minutes Reagan left the emergency room for surgery with normal blood pressure.|$|E
