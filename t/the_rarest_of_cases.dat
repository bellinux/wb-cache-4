5000|$|Genetic conditions. Sometimes {{disability}} {{is caused}} by abnormal genes inherited from parents, errors when genes combine, or other reasons. The most prevalent genetic conditions include Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Fragile X syndrome (common among boys), neurofibromatosis, congenital hypothyroidism, Williams syndrome, phenylketonuria (PKU), and Prader-Willi syndrome. Other genetic conditions include Phelan-McDermid syndrome (22q13del), Mowat-Wilson syndrome, genetic ciliopathy, and Siderius type X-linked intellectual disability (...) as caused by mutations in the PHF8 gene (...) [...] In <b>the</b> <b>rarest</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> abnormalities with the X or Y chromosome may also cause disability. 48, XXXX and 49, XXXXX syndrome affect {{a small number of}} girls worldwide, while boys may be affected by 49, XXXXY, or 49, XYYYY. 47, XYY is not associated with significantly lowered IQ though affected individuals may have slightly lower IQs than non-affected siblings on average.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the use value of {{qualitative}} research findings to nurses in practice is questioned. More precisely {{it is argued}} that, insofar as action follows belief then, in all but <b>the</b> <b>rarest</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> the beliefs that nurses in practice can justifiably derive from or form {{on the basis of}} qualitative research findings do not sanction action {{in the world and the}} assumption, apparently widely held, that qualitative research can as evidence productively inform practice collapses. If qualitative research does not have a substantive action guiding potential then, in consequence, three conclusions are permitted. First, regarding the requirement that nurses ground actions on evidence, regulators should redraft methodologically neutral or permissive guidelines to specify the sorts of research evidence that can serve this function. Second, qualitative methodologies should receive less prominence in nurse education programmes. Third, qualitative researchers should make it clear that their work cannot inform practice. Alternatively, if this claim is advanced the process by which this is to be achieved should be explicitly stated...|$|E
40|$|Hi dear, how {{was your}} day?” In <b>the</b> <b>rarest</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> the responded would answer: “I {{had so much fun}} when {{entering}} the customer data into our Enterprise Systems. ” However, the usage of Enterprise Systems is nowadays for many employees a key element of their working activities. Therefore, their motivation to use these systems consistently is essential for organizations to ensure transparency and process accuracy. While today most software products have a high usability, they lack in positive user experiences such as fun. One trend having the potential to solve this issue is Gamification. Using mechanisms of traditional games such as achievements or rankings is successfully implemented in private applications such as social networks (e. g. Facebook) or online traveling portals (e. g. tripadvisor). These mechanisms motivate individuals to perform certain activities they would otherwise not do. Gabe Zichermann – a visionary of Gamification – explained this phenomenon as following: Games are the only force in the known universe that can get people to take actions against their self-interest, in a predictable way, without using force. The principle of Gamification and its potential in organizations is presented in this book chapter...|$|E

40|$|Writers on 18 th-century musical {{ornamentation}} {{have traditionally}} {{focused on the}} execution of notated ornaments, and on certain disputes arising from ambiguous and contradictory primary sources. Less {{attention has been given}} to the addition of ornaments where not prescribed by the composer. Such ornaments can be short, defined, patterns such as trills, turns, and mordents, or larger measured or unmeasured additions known as diminutions, divisions, or passaggi. Additions of this nature are only in <b>the</b> <b>rarest</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> compulsory. However, the practice of more or less spontaneous embellishment by the performer was so integral to pre- 19 th-century musical culture that this must have had a significant effect on composition. The scope of this thesis is loosely defined by its titular composers, covering the period between Georg Muffat‟s later publications {{in the last years of}} the 17 th century and G. P. Telemann‟s death in 1767. Both lived and worked in the German states, a region which had traditionally looked to Italian models of composition and performance. This period saw a flowering of German composition into its own unique and diverse genre which integrated aspects of various styles, most prominently Italian and French music. This thesis centres on stringed instruments, but is directly relevant to woodwind players. Many aspects are also transferrable to the keyboard and to vocal music; however, these musicians will find a large volume of more targeted research elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|While it is {{difficult}} to classify an athlete's participation in sport as solely an individual or a collective act, it is easy {{to make the case that}} there are both public and private dimensions to sport. Similarly, one can view the athletes competing in a sporting event from the reductionist perspective that sees them as individuals performing their own distinct roles, or from the collective perspective, which identifies them as a group seeking a common goal. However, an examination of athletes caught using performance-enhancing drugs and procedures banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that when it comes to doping in sport, the neater, simpler, and more convenient reductionist position often replaces the collective view and places the blame almost entirely on the individual athlete. Unquestionably, the athlete makes the final decision to deposit a banned substance in his or her body and is therefore causally responsible for failing a doping detection test. But, I will argue, causal responsibility is not an essential component of complicitous responsibility. Only in <b>the</b> <b>rarest</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> could an athlete research what drugs would be most effective, manufacture the performance-enhancing drugs, and make use of them without the assistance of his or her coaches, trainers, sports medicine advisors, therapists, or other support personnel. Hence, the relationships between the athlete who takes the banned substances and the people who make them available to the athlete are important. I argue that these people together form a collective and are complicitous to the act of doping, which should render them all socially and morally accountable for the act. Except in the most scandalous doping cases where an athlete's positive test result grabs the media's attention and the ensuing public outcry demands that all involved be held accountable, the professionals and ancillary workers who develop, produce, distribute, and condone the use of banned substances are overlooked in favour of blaming the athlete. The collective does not share the responsibility but instead places it entirely on the athlete. In this paper, I argue that the participatory intentions of the athlete's support personnel make them complicit to the act and therefore partially accountable for the doping offence. Drawing on Christopher Kutz and Margaret Gilbert's accounts of shared intentions and collective responsibility, I argue that the group members' participatory intentions warrant holding the entire group responsible. The implication of this view is that doping is a collective act, rather than an individual one, and anti-doping officials should focus more on the complicitous nature of doping. Přestože je obtížné označit atletovu účast ve sportu za výhradně individuální nebo kolektivní akt, je snadné obhájit, že sport má jak veřejný, tak i soukromý rozměr. Podobně lze nahlížet na atlety soupeřící při sportovní události z redukcionistického hlediska, které je považuje za jednotlivce plnící své vlastní odlišné role, nebo z hlediska kolektivního, které je označuje za skupinu snažící se naplnit společný cíl. Zkoumání atletů, kteří byli přistiženi při použití látek zvyšujících výkon a postupů zakázaných Světovou antidopingovou agenturou, však ukazuje, že v oblasti sportovního dopingu nahrazuje často jasnější, jednodušší a vhodnější redukcionistické hledisko kolektivní pohled a vinu přičítá téměř výhradně danému atletovi. Konečné rozhodnutí vpravit do svého těla zakázanou látku bezpochyby činí atlet, a ten je proto příčinně odpovědný za selhání při dopingové zkoušce. Tvrdím však, že příčinná odpovědnost není zásadní složkou společné odpovědnosti. Jen v těch nejvzácnějších případech dokáže atlet vyzkoumat, které látky budou nejúčinnější, sám látky zvyšující výkon vyrobit a použít je bez pomoci svých trenérů, instruktorů, poradců v oblasti sportovního lékařství, terapeutů či dalších podpůrných zaměstnanců. Z toho plyne, že důležité jsou vztahy mezi atletem, který zakázané látky použije, a lidmi, kteří je atletovi opatří. Tvrdím, že tito lidé společně vytvářejí kolektiv a nesou za doping společnou vinu. Z toho důvodu by se měli za tento čin společensky a morálně zodpovídat. Kromě těch nejskandálnějších případů dopingu, kdy atletův pozitivní výsledek zkoušky upoutá pozornost médií a kdy následný křik veřejnosti vyžaduje volat k odpovědnosti všechny zúčastněné, jsou profesionálové a pomocní zaměstnanci vyvíjející, vyrábějící, rozšiřující a umožňující použití zakázaných látek přehlíženi a vina je místo toho přičítána atletovi. Kolektiv nesdílí odpovědnost, ale namísto toho ji klade výhradně na atleta. V tomto příspěvku tvrdím, že úmyslná účast členů atletova podpůrného personálu je činí ve věci spoluvinnými a tudíž i částečně odpovědnými za porušení dopingových pravidel. Na základě materiálů Christophera Kutze a Margarety Gilbertové o společných úmyslech a kolektivní odpovědnosti tvrdím, že úmyslná účast členů skupiny opravňuje k tomu, abychom činili odpovědnou celou skupinu. Plyne z toho, že doping je spíše kolektivním než individuálním činem a že antidopingoví úředníci by se měli více zaměřit na otázky spoluviny při dopingu...|$|E
