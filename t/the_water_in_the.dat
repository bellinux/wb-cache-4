5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E
5|$|In medusae {{the only}} {{supporting}} structure is the mesoglea. Hydra and most sea anemones close their mouths {{when they are}} not feeding, and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> digestive cavity then acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as Tubularia use columns of water-filled cells for support. Sea pens stiffen the mesoglea with calcium carbonate s and tough fibrous proteins, rather like sponges.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood with the wax {{over a period of}} about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E

30|$|All deep <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Jurassic and the Upper Muschelkalk {{aquifers}} are {{saturated with}} respect to calcite and quartz, more or less saturated {{with respect to}} gypsum and anhydrite. They are slightly oversaturated with respect to dolomite. With respect to barite, <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Jurassic aquifer are slightly over- or undersaturated, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Muschelkalk aquifer, most waters seem to be slightly oversaturated (PHREEQE, Parkhurst and Appelo [1999]). Especially, <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Muschelkalk aquifer have a certain scaling potential if pumped and used in geothermal energy applications.|$|R
5|$|Cnidarian sexual {{reproduction}} often involves a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies) a larva swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally {{into a series}} of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have gonads in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor {{have so far}} {{been found in the}} Burgess Shale. These {{absences}} have been used to support the idea that the water near the sea-floor was anoxic. However {{it is possible that the}} water just above the sea-floor was oxygenated while <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sediment below it was anoxic, and also possible that there simply were no deep-burrowing animals in the Burgess Shale. Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far if at all. Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains of soft tissues. This suggests that the distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E

The second studied {{the effect of the}} gas environment around the orbiter using ultraviolet absorption measurements, as a precursor to ultraviolet equipment being designed for Spacelab 2. A third, sponsored by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun newspaper, tried to use water vapor in two tanks to create snow crystals. This was a second attempt at an experiment first flown on STS-6, which had had to be redesigned after <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tanks froze solid. The last was similar to an experiment flown on STS-3, and studied the ambient levels of atomic oxygen by measuring the rates at which small carbon and osmium wafers oxidized.|$|E

5|$|Further {{problems}} with the environment arose when a vast algal bloom appeared in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee in 1986, the same year cattails were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Scientists discovered that phosphorus, used as a fertilizer in the EAA, was flushed into canals and pumped back into the lake. When the lake drained, the phosphorus entered <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marshes, changing the nutrient levels. It kept periphyton from forming marl, one of two soils in the Everglades. The arrival of phosphorus allowed cattails to spread quickly. The cattails grew in dense mats—too thick for birds or alligators to nest in. It also dissolved oxygen in the peat, promoted algae, and prohibited growth of native invertebrates {{on the bottom of}} the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{notified}} Fegelein by telegram on 1 August {{that the}} numbers killed were far too low. A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, which called for all male Jews {{over the age of}} 14 to be killed. The women and children were to be driven into the swamps and drowned. Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> swamps was too shallow and some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical to drown the women and children, so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.|$|E
5|$|Monitor {{likewise}} did {{not survive}} the year. She was ordered to Beaufort, North Carolina, on Christmas Day, {{to take part in}} the blockade there. While she was being towed down the coast (under command of her fourth captain, Commander John P. Bankhead), the wind increased and with it the waves; with no high sides, the Monitor took on water. Soon <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hold gained on the pumps, and then put out the fires in her engines.

40|$|In {{this work}} an attempt {{is made to}} explain a case of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{circulation}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Aegean shelf based {{on a set of}} oceanographic and meteorological measurements.

It is shown that, although <b>the</b> mean horizontal <b>water</b> velocity is estimated at about 7 cm/sec providing a time period of <b>water</b> renewal of <b>the</b> bay at about 4 days, the geostrophic circulation of <b>the</b> wider area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Aegean, controlled by the geometry of the local area, accelerates <b>the</b> <b>water</b> movement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bay decreasing the time required for the renewal to less than one day...|$|R

In between the lines is a quay, designed to allow the delivery of supplies from the Thames, and the remains of the tracks from the narrow gauge railway built during the First World War. A sluice gate in the south-west corner managed <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moats, and allowed them to be drained completely should the surfaces begin to freeze over in winter and provide an advantage to any attackers.

5|$|The only grave {{goods were}} a pot found {{with the female}} adult body and partial remains of wicker, fur and linen with the other bodies. In the predynastic period bodies were usually buried naked and {{sometimes}} loosely wrapped. In such a burial, when the body is covered in warm sand, the environmental conditions mean that most of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body is quickly evaporated or drained away, meaning that the corpse is naturally dried and preserved. This method was widely used in the pre-dynastic Egyptian period, before artificial mummification was developed.
