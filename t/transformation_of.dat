50|$|These transformations are the analogues of the {{elementary}} row operations. <b>Transformations</b> <b>of</b> the first two kinds are analogous to row swaps, and cyclic row permutations. <b>Transformations</b> <b>of</b> the third kind correspond to scaling a row by an invertible scalar. <b>Transformations</b> <b>of</b> the fourth kind correspond to row additions.|$|R
50|$|Further, <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> {{projective}} space that preserve affine space (equivalently, that leave the hyperplane at infinity invariant as a set) yield <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> affine space. Conversely, any affine linear transformation extends uniquely to a projective linear transformation, so the affine {{group is a}} subgroup of the projective group.
