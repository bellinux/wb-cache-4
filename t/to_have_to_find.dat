25|$|For {{repayment}} of the Government loans, {{there was}} a proposal to create an 'asset pool' at the bank, of a size greater than the loans. The bidder would have issued bonds against this asset pool, with maturities set inline with the repayment. Proceeds from the bond issue would have also gone to the Government and the bank would have paid for a government guarantee for the bonds to trade in the market at or near prices of similar gilt-edged stocks. This would have replaced the original plan for the bidders <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their own investors to cover the first £15bn, which proved impossible, due to the credit crunch. The government would also continue to guarantee the Bank's liabilities, such as savers' deposits.|$|E

It grieves me much <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> fault with a clergyman--but {{especially}} {{so with a}} clergyman in your position." ...|$|E

50|$|Download-to-own {{movies are}} more {{convenient}} to watch, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and insert a DVD into your computer because {{once it is}} saved on the hard drive it can be viewed instantly. Movies are saved on the hard drive, typically in AVI format, and are compressed using MPEG-4 or DivX compression formats.Disadvantages to download-to-own movies are that they have generally large file sizes, usually from 600MB to over 1GB. They may {{take a long time}} to download, and will fill up a hard drive quickly. The movie may be accidentally deleted or lost through a hard drive crash, but with proper back up procedures, and the continuing drop in prices for larger hard drives becoming commonplace, these problems can be minimized.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 15th century all Maltese Muslims {{would be}} forced to convert <b>to</b> Christianity and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> ways <b>to</b> {{disguise}} their previous identities by Latinizing or adopting new surnames.|$|R

6000|$|HIGGINS. Mrs. Pearce? Oh, she's jolly {{glad to get}} so much {{taken off}} her hands; for before Eliza came, she had <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> things and remind me of my appointments. But she's got some silly bee in her bonnet about Eliza. She keeps saying [...] "You don't think, sir": doesn't she, Pick? ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} hardship in being an invalid {{is the fact}} that people come and see you and keep your spirits up. The Honorable Freddie Threepwood suffered extremely from this. His was not a gregarious nature and it fatigued his limited brain powers <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> conversation for his numerous visitors. All he wanted was to be left alone to read the adventures of Gridley Quayle, and when tired of doing that to lie on his {{back and look at the}} ceiling and think of nothing.|$|E
6000|$|But as {{the minutes}} passed by, as every {{quarter of an}} hour added itself to the {{quarters}} that were gone, and as the hours grew on, and the weakness of evening fell upon him, all his softness came back again. They had dined at six o'clock, and at seven he declared his purpose of strolling out by himself. On these summer evenings he would often take Mary with him; but he now told her, with a sort of apology, that he would rather go alone. [...] "Do," [...] she said, smiling up into his face; [...] "don't let me ever be in your way. Of course, a man does not always want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> conversation for a young lady." ...|$|E
25|$|In the end, {{the federal}} and Serbian {{authorities}} did not pursue the case, even after Serbia revoked Kosovo's self-rule in 1989, and no serious attempt appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been made <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Martinović's alleged attackers.|$|R
30|$|The NPPF gives generic {{policies}} and guidelines. The {{policies and}} guidelines’ indeterminacy in definitions, typologies and parameters doesn’t help <b>to</b> <b>have</b> comparable data, <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new quantitative OS standard based on POS and to define common policies between boroughs.|$|R
50|$|C.W. Alcock of Surrey {{originally}} intended to take the team, but finding himself unable <b>to</b> go <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a successor. Fortunately Lord Hawke took {{on the role of}} organising the tour. The team was weaker than he wished but the inclusion of Sammy Woods at the last hour considerably strengthed the bowling. Woods {{turned out to be the}} success of the tour, taking 76 wickets in the 8 matches at an average of 7, as well as scoring 260 runs.|$|R
60|$|The house-master {{sat down}} quietly on the vacant bed. He blew the candle out, and waited {{there in the}} semi-darkness, thinking. For years he and Wyatt had lived {{in a state of}} armed neutrality, broken by various small encounters. Lately, by silent but mutual agreement, they had kept out of each other's way as much as possible, and it had become rare for the house-master <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> fault officially with his step-son. But there had never been {{anything}} even remotely approaching friendship between them. Mr. Wain was not a man who inspired affection readily, least of all in those many years younger than himself. Nor did he easily grow fond of others. Wyatt he had regarded, from the moment when the threads of their lives became entangled, as a complete nuisance.|$|E

5000|$|Betty informs Daniel of Connor's {{scheme and}} Daniel isn't sure {{whether to go}} to the police, so they call Claire. No one's seen Connor in hours, or Wilhelmina either, but Claire has more bad news, [...] "As of noon, all of the Meade {{accounts}} have been cleared out. We're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that money, or this company is dead." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{returning}} <b>to</b> Paris, Bernard <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{out that}} Charlotte was meanwhile engaged to someone else.

50|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Lane {{created a}} website, Kid Critic to feature reviews by a kid, for kids and {{families}} about movies, books, activities, products, all from a youth perspective. The website encouraged kids <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a place <b>to</b> <b>find</b> interests as kids.|$|R
50|$|At Wat Phai Rong Wua, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{search the}} temple grounds amongst {{hundreds}} of Buddha statues {{for their next}} clue. The first two buses, however, will depart 20 minutes after they've arrive at the temple. Teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their clue within this time {{if they want to}} catch the same bus.|$|R
50|$|Invariably {{each level}} also {{contains}} various enemies. These enemies include Terminator carrots, Scouse sausages and sword-wielding spacemen. The enemies {{will attempt to}} hurt Putty in various ways. The attacks {{from some of the}} enemies will also hurt any bots that Putty is carrying at the time. If a bot is hurt four times it is killed, causing the player <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> another bot to absorb.|$|E
50|$|David Axworthy, who was {{appointed}} as the acting Chief Executive of the Curriculum Council in 2005, announced in July 2006 {{that he would not}} continue in the position. This followed widespread opposition to the introduction of the states ill conceived outcomes based education system into the school system that Axworthy was in charge of. As a result, the Council was going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> its fourth Chief in twelve months.|$|E
5000|$|Des Wainwright is the Head of Security at the museum. A former SAS {{man from}} Belfast, he {{nevertheless}} admits {{to having a}} [...] "horribly subservient streak". He is currently with [...] "the third Mrs. Wainwright" [...] and does not want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the fourth. The other staff refer to him as [...] "that mad bastard in Security" [...] although they say it with a certain affection.|$|E
50|$|Currently in Cambodia, {{there are}} professional, institutional, and {{governmental}} motivations for both {{teaching and learning}} English as a foreign language. Results from studies on Cambodia show {{that the ability to}} speak English is an important component required to transform the standard of life for the people of Cambodia. The {{reason for this is that}} the people who are able to communicate in English are ones that are more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> opportunities <b>to</b> <b>find</b> better occupations with higher pay, as it is used to communicate with international businesses and organizations.|$|R
40|$|Academic conference organisers {{do have a}} tough time. First they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{experts in}} a {{specific}} niche, then experts who can also deliver in English?

50|$|FBI Director James Comey cited {{a number}} of cases to support the need to decrypt smartphones. Incredibly, in none of the presumably {{carefully}} handpicked cases did the smartphone <b>have</b> anything <b>to</b> do with the identification or capture of the culprits, and FBI seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any strong cases supporting the need for smartphone decryption.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though her}} first day goes bad, Noriko soon finds {{that in order to}} get through a day filled with budget cuts and long days, she’s going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> some way to relieve stress. Eventually, Kayoko helps Noriko get over her sexual hang-ups in a session of lesbian love. In the end, Noriko and Yasuo {{discover}} a common ground and begin a romantic relationship. The series is in a way a mix of mecha-fights and sexual interaction between the main characters.|$|E
5000|$|O'Connor {{was dropped}} from Matador after Here With Me succeeded {{critically}} but not popularly. O'Connor felt burned out and discouraged, {{and went back}} to working odd jobs around New York, including bartending on Broadway. After she got back to recording, she decided to release the album I Want What You Want on her own label largely because {{she did not want to}} wait <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a record deal somewhere. [...] "I happen to have a record label, so I figured why not?" [...] she told NBCNewYork.com in October 2011.|$|E

I don’t know that it’s doing for me what it used to, in the sense that Jack’s sort of really {{represented}} a freedom from something. And a really free approach to creating things that now is certainly wrapped up in a whole lot of turmoil and tumult in a very difficult time in my life. And to acknowledge that, I certainly think at some point I’m going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to shake that loose.

500|$|Wainwright sees Æthelflæd as willingly {{accepting}} a subordinate {{role in a}} partnership with her brother and agreeing to his plan of unification of Wessex and Mercia under his rule. Wainwright argues that he probably sent his oldest son Æthelstan to be brought up in Mercia, to make him more acceptable to the Mercians as king; Æthelflæd does not appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> tried <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a husband for her daughter, who must have been nearly thirty by 918. In Wainwright's view, she was ignored in West Saxon sources for fear that recognition of her achievements would encourage Mercian separatism: ...|$|R

[...] The voters also voted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more studies <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an alternative site for the school.|$|R
30|$|The {{concentration}} of people, capital and production was fundamental {{in the development}} of industrialized countries in North America, Western Europe, and Northeast Asia. Because economic prosperity did not happen everywhere {{at the same time in}} those countries, people <b>had</b> <b>to</b> relocate <b>to</b> <b>find</b> economic opportunities and productive jobs. This concentration in turn stimulated further growth and rising living standards.|$|R

5000|$|Her {{independence}} regained and her self-confidence increasing, Bethany calmly confronts Lilah and packs up her things, {{striking out}} on her own. Lilah and Angel speak on the doorstep as Lilah reminds him {{that he is not}} invited in. In a last-ditch effort to stop Bethany from trusting Angel, Lilah reveals that Angel is a vampire - to which an unfazed Bethany merely replies; [...] "weird." [...] As Bethany walks away, Angel says to Lilah, [...] "It looks like you're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> someone else's brain to play with," [...] to which Lilah replies, [...] "Yeah, we have someone in mind." [...] Angel tells Lilah [...] "Goodnight," [...] and, while he's walking away, Lilah snidely mutters [...] "Sweet dreams." ...|$|E
5000|$|While in {{quarantine}} awaiting {{his prison}} assignment, Dawkins {{wrote down the}} first line of his short story [...] "County", inspired by his experience being incarcerated in the Kalamazoo County jail. Dawkins began writing in prison, explaining: [...] "A part of me realized, if I'm going to live through this, I'm going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a purpose." [...] He used an electric typewriter to write short stories and mailed them to his sister who submitted his work to literary magazines. A few of Dawkins' stories were published in less-well-known journals, and in 2016, a selection of his short stories eventually {{came to the attention of}} a literary agent who took Dawkins on as a client. Dawkins' stories were then sold to American publisher Scribner for a six-figure advance, with Dawkins' share going to an education fund for his children.|$|E
50|$|After Universal Studios {{chose not}} to renew her {{contract}} in 1959, Van Doren was now a free agent and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> struggle <b>to</b> <b>find</b> work. Some of her later movies were foreign and independent productions, which would do little to keep her image in the public's eye. Many of the productions were low-budget B movies with some having gained a cult following for their high camp value.|$|R
30|$|The most {{important}} factor affecting an optimization algorithm’s performance is its ability of “exploration” and “exploitation”. Exploration means {{the ability of a}} search algorithm to explore different areas of the search space <b>to</b> <b>have</b> high probability <b>to</b> <b>find</b> good optimum. Exploitation, on the other hand, means the ability to concentrate the search around a promising region to refine a candidate solution.|$|R
