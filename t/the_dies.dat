5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. <b>The</b> <b>dies</b> used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{solvent-based}} lubricants, such as {{diesel fuel}} and kerosene, were commonly used. These were good at releasing the part from <b>the</b> <b>dies,</b> {{but a small}} explosion occurred during each shot, {{which led to a}} build-up of carbon on the mold cavity walls. However, they were easier to apply evenly than water-based lubricants.|$|E
5|$|In 1816, the Prince Regent {{had first}} {{suggested}} a medal {{to be presented}} to allies and commanders from Waterloo. The Royal Academy proposed work by John Flaxman, one of its members, but Pistrucci, whose responsibility it was to engrave <b>the</b> <b>dies,</b> refused to copy another's work, and brought forth designs of his own. The Prince Regent and William Wellesley-Pole, Master of the Mint were impressed by Pistrucci's models, and he gained the commission.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{large-scale}} pellet mills: flat die mills and ring die mills. Flat die mills use a flat <b>die</b> with slots. <b>The</b> powder is {{introduced to the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and as <b>the</b> <b>die</b> rotates a roller presses the powder through the holes in <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> A cutter {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>die</b> cuts <b>the</b> exposed pellet free from <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> In <b>the</b> ring <b>die</b> there are radial slot throughout <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Powder is fed into the inside of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and spreaders evenly distribute the powder.

5|$|On March 12, Ashbrook {{submitted}} {{a report on}} behalf of his committee recommending passage of the bill once it had been amended to reduce the authorized mintage from 200,000 to 100,000 and to add a statement that the United States government would not be responsible for the cost of <b>the</b> <b>dies.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Shield nickel {{series has}} yielded {{a large number}} of varieties. Howard Spindel, a leading expert on Shield nickels, notes that Shield nickel dies {{produced}} far fewer coins than other coin dies, as <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> wore out so fast that the Mint was continually under great pressure to produce new ones. According to Spindel, many dies were hastily and carelessly produced, producing numerous minor varieties.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dies</b> are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ejector pin plate, which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E
50|$|In {{the deep}} drawing process, a blank of sheet metal (usually circular) {{is placed on}} <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> <b>The</b> <b>die</b> is fixed to the base. The metal blank is held in {{position}} on <b>the</b> <b>die</b> using blank holder. Mechanical force is applied {{on the part of}} the metal blank above <b>the</b> <b>die</b> cavity through a punch. As the punch force increases the metal flows from the flange region in to <b>the</b> <b>die</b> cavity.|$|R

5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> require draft for the proper ejection of the casting from <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.|$|R
5|$|The {{net result}} was that little work was done on the Waterloo Medal. In 1832, the Master of the Mint, Lord Auckland, noted that <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> had been long delayed. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, also complained about the delay, feeling the medal could be {{finished}} in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{analysis}} {{was the first}} done for any casting process. This was done by creating an electrical analog of the thermal system. A cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper. Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes. The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when pattern dimes and quarters were struck, {{but this was}} most likely in mid-November 1891. One variety each of pattern dime and quarter are known, whereas five different half dollars are extant; all known Barber coin patterns are in the National Numismatic Collection and none are in private hands. On December 11, Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid-January 1892 to allow <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> to be more thoroughly tested; Leech refused. The first Barber coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on January 2, 1892 at 9:00a.m. By {{the end of the}} day, all three denominations had been coined.|$|E
40|$|Wafer-level {{packaging}} (WLP) is a next-generation semiconductor packaging {{technology that}} is important for realizing high-performance and ultra-thin semiconductor devices. However, the molding process, which {{is a part of}} the WLP process, has various problems such as a high defect rate and low predictability. Among the various defect factors, <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift primarily determines the quality of the final product; therefore, predicting <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift is necessary to achieve high-yield production in WLP. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift caused by the flow drag force of the epoxy molding compound (EMC) is evaluated from <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift of a debonded molding wafer. Experimental and analytical methods were employed to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift occurring during each stage of the molding process and that resulting from the geometrical changes after the debonding process. <b>The</b> <b>die</b> shift caused by the EMC flow drag force is evaluated from <b>the</b> data on <b>die</b> movements due to thermal contraction/expansion and warpage. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift and variation in <b>the</b> <b>die</b> gap is determined through regression analysis in order to predict <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift due to the flow drag force. The results can be used for die realignment by predicting and compensating for <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift...|$|R
30|$|To {{make the}} samples of crude membrane, firstly, <b>the</b> <b>die</b> walls, {{surfaces}} of punch and <b>the</b> <b>die</b> are greased with Stark Oil. Secondly, the homogeneous mixture is poured into <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Then, 4 tons of pressure is gently applied on <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> After a few seconds, {{the pressure is}} slowly lowered and the crude membrane is removed from <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> It is to {{be noted that the}} pressure is slowly lowered to prevent incarnating the air mass among the particles, which causes some cracks on the samples.|$|R
40|$|A {{proposed}} die configuration {{is designed}} to effect the in-process compensation of the errors {{in the form of}} the extrudate which arise from the elasticity of <b>the</b> extrusion <b>dies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>die</b> is in <b>the</b> form of a truncated, conical-shell which is either on a plane or a spherical bearing surface, to enable it to deflect elastically, thereby changing the dimension of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> orifice. FE simulation of the work-material flow and <b>the</b> <b>die</b> deflection was conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed configuration. The deflection of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is a function of the extrusion force and the resulting reduction of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> orifice is in proportion to this force. The simulation enabled optimisation of the geometric parameters of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> with respect to component-form errors...|$|R
5|$|Barber {{finished}} hubs for {{the four}} coins in September 1883, and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent A. Loudon Snowden had two sets struck and sent to Preston in Washington. Snowden praised {{the beauty of the}} coins, and was happy that Barber had required less relief than needed on US coins of like value, since this meant the coins would be easier for the Mint to strike. Preston sent the coins to Spreckels in San Francisco, and authorized Philadelphia to make additional sets, both for its coin cabinet and for the director's office in Washington. Barber was instructed to make five sets of coining dies for each denomination, to be sent to the San Francisco Mint, with instructions that no coins were to be struck pending a final contract with Spreckels, and that <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> were to remain Hawaiian government property, to be turned over on request.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1794, {{engraver}} Robert Scot began preparing {{designs for}} the silver dollar. Scot's initial design depicted a bust of Liberty, while his reverse featured an eagle, both required by the 1792 Coinage Act. Scot's design closely followed his design for the cent, but with the Phrygian cap removed. Government officials later instructed Scot to include a wreath around the eagle and to move the denomination from the reverse face {{to the edge of}} the coin. After receiving approval, Scot began engraving the hubs for the new silver dollar. Extra care was taken during the engraving of this denomination, because the dollar would be the largest American coin, and would thus receive the most scrutiny from foreign nations. The lettering was executed by Frederick Geiger, who had worked as a typographer for various books and newspapers. After <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> were created, several copper test pieces were struck. Officials decided to add fifteen stars around the periphery, representing the fifteen states that had ratified the Constitution to that point, to the right-facing Liberty on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Linderman {{assumed the}} {{position}} of Director of the Mint and Pollock became Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint. In July 1873, production began on <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> needed to strike the coins. During this time, in a telegram to Pollock, Linderman asked that production of trade dollars be hastened because Mexico was preparing to issue another series of dollars with the older design popular in Asia, a design that was discontinued in 1866. The first trade dollars were struck during a ceremony held on July 11, 1873. Forty thousand pieces were issued in the first release, on July 14. The Carson City Mint received its first dies for the new coins on July 22, and those intended for the San Francisco Mint arrived shortly after. In total, 396,635 business strikes and 865 proof coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint {{during the first year}} of production. The Carson City and San Francisco mints struck 124,500 and 703,000 coins respectively.|$|E

50|$|When making working <b>dies,</b> <b>the</b> Mint {{has found}} that by using a lower amount of {{pressure}} in the hubbing press, they can prolong the life of <b>the</b> hubs and <b>dies</b> used. In between each hubbing, however, <b>the</b> <b>die</b> being made must be subjected to an annealing procedure to soften the steel, {{making it easier to}} force the hub's image into <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is being cold forged in the hubbing press, <b>the</b> <b>die's</b> steel work hardens making <b>the</b> hubbed <b>die</b> harder and stronger than in its original state (an advantage over engraving <b>the</b> <b>die).</b> If, when <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is subjected to another hubbing, it is not lined up exactly with the hub, the result is a secondary image, or doubling. This is called die doubling, and results in such spectacular coins as the famous 1955 doubled die cent.|$|R

5|$|Spreckels {{was already}} in {{correspondence}} with American authorities; in January 1883, the Director of the United States Mint, Horatio Burchard, had written to him explaining the laws under which the Mint could strike coins for foreign governments, and that although the coins could be struck at the San Francisco Mint, <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> for the coinage {{would have to be}} prepared at Philadelphia. He asked for sketches from Spreckels, who provided an obverse showing a full-face portrait of the king; this was submitted to Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber in Philadelphia, who rejected it as impractical. Barber recommended the king be shown in profile, and a suitable photograph was sent to him for use in preparing models of the proposed coins. Once the Mint received Spreckels' commission as agent, Acting Director Robert E. Preston wrote noting that the authorization called for 12 cent pieces, but that the Hawaiian law had called for coins identical in size, weight, and fineness to US coins, and there was no such denomination struck by the US Mint. He asked if ten-cent pieces were desired instead, but no answer was immediately forthcoming, and Barber finished preliminary designs, including the 12 cent piece.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E
5|$|The State of Illinois {{wanted a}} {{commemorative}} coin {{to be issued}} for the centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union. A bill that would accomplish this, H.R. 8764, was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on January 16, 1918 by that state's Loren E. Wheeler. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on March 5. Wheeler told the committee (of which {{he was not a}} member) that the coins were desired for distribution during the celebrations in Illinois. He had been to see Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker. Neither had any objection to the legislation, though McAdoo had explained that the problem with commemorative coins was that they did not sell as well as expected, and many were returned to the Mint for melting. After telling of his meeting with the officials, Wheeler explained to the committee that the coins would be purchased by the State Treasurer of Illinois and so there would be no returns. James L. Slayden of Texas asked what the cost to the federal government would be, but Wheeler did not know. Slayden asked what had been the cost for the 1916–1917 McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar, and Ohio's William A. Ashbrook, the chairman of the committee, said that the cost of <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> had been borne by the group purchasing the coins from the government; Ashbrook proposed amending the bill to make this clear this would be an expense to be paid by Illinois. Wheeler had no objection, and stated that to avoid returns, it might be best if the issue was limited to 100,000 coins rather than the 200,000 in the original bill. Ashbrook then asked if the coins were to be sold at a premium by the centennial committee, and Wheeler denied this, indicating that they were to be circulated like any other half dollar. This concluded the public hearing on the bill, with the committee to take further action in executive session.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of temperatures and stresses in <b>the</b> <b>die</b> during high {{pressure die casting}} are computed through commercially finite element software developed by Wincast team, Germany. The deformation of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> during its continual running is predicted under the conditions without and with air cooling. The simulated results show that <b>the</b> regions of <b>die,</b> which contact with the casting, is subjected to compressed stresses and the other regions of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> subjected to tensile stresses. Compressed stresses are changed steeply from tensile to compress on {{the boundary between the}} casting and the inner cavity walls, which will results in hot-fatigue in those regions of <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Setting cooling channel within <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is an efficient measure for eliminating hot-fatigue and prolonging life of <b>the</b> <b>die...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>die</b> drool phenomenon, {{occurring}} as {{a result}} of the viscoelastic behavior of polymer melts during the flow, was experimentally investigated for metallocene-based LLDPE on a specially designed annular extrusion <b>die</b> with <b>the</b> capability to control the stress state at the end of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> by <b>the</b> help of a specific type of cooling system. With the aim of understanding <b>the</b> <b>die</b> drool phenomenon in more detail, the flow at the end of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> was analyzed theoretically by the finite element method employing a modified White-Metzner model as the constitutive equation.

5|$|Two {{prototype}} dollars {{were struck}} at the Philadelphia Mint on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed. Striking such {{large pieces of}} tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier reducing lathe to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore {{at least some of}} the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief. This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in <b>the</b> <b>dies),</b> the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail. Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date. The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the San Francisco Mint) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to David Eisenhower (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of rotary swaging machine, the {{standard}} (also known as a tagging machine), and the butt swaging machine. A butt swaging machine works by having sets of wedges that close <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> onto the workpiece by inserting them between the annular rollers and <b>the</b> <b>dies,</b> normally {{by the use of}} a foot pedal. A butt swaging machine can allow a workpiece to be inserted without <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> closing on it, for example a three-foot workpiece can be inserted 12inches and then <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> closed, drawn through until 12inches remain and <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> are then released, the finished workpiece would then, for example, be four feet long but still of its initial diameter for a foot at each end.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of the rotary swager is the creeping spindle swaging machine where both the spindle and cage revolve in opposite directions, this prevents the production of fins between <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> where the material being swaged grows up the gap between <b>the</b> <b>dies.</b>|$|E
