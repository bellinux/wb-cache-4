30|$|The adopted {{sequential}} approach involves that <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> {{referred to}} a certain choice dimension are conditioned by <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> simulated through <b>the</b> sub-model at the upper level. In two cases <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> simulated by a certain sub-model also condition <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> simulated by <b>the</b> upper sub-model. This is shown in Fig.  1 by a discontinuous line of connecting arrows among the different models. In analytical terms, this reciprocal conditioning is represented by a specific variable introduced in the utility function of the alternatives of the model at the upper level, which considers <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> also made by the users at the lower level. Specifically, this link is introduced between the models for choosing the type and place of the activity, and <b>the</b> destination <b>choice</b> model, in reference to both the primary and secondary activities.|$|R

30|$|However, taking {{personal}} preferences {{into account}} need not imply responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> made in <b>the</b> care process or {{in everyday life}} in general. Responsibility can also {{be interpreted as a}} forward looking concept of taking action instead of a backward looking concept of blame and accountability for <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> made (Cappelen and Norheim 2005; Waller 2005). The patient benefits from active engagement in the treatment process and taking charge {{of his or her own}} health. However, focusing on the responsibility as being guilty of one’s situation or <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> made is not fruitful. It may even have a negative effect on healing and on the doctor-patient relationship (Waller 2005). With a take-charge interpretation of responsibility, the focus is on <b>the</b> <b>choices</b> available at <b>the</b> present and the ways in which choices enhancing health and wellbeing can be motivated in the future.|$|R
