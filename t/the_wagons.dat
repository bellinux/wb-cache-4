5|$|In 2010, Ruter {{decided to}} scrap {{all of the}} T2000 wagons, after only 16 years in operation, and ten of <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> were sold for NOK100,000 a piece to the {{recycling}} company Hellik Teigen at Hokksund. The two remaining wagons will be preserved and displayed at the Oslo Tramway Museum. Ruter stated that it would cost about NOK50 million {{to keep them in}} operation. Nevertheless, Ruter was in 2011 forced by the owner Oslo Vognselskap to keep renting <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> for 22 million NOK each year, even though they were not in operation. Oslo Vognselskap stated the reason behind this was the contract which lasted for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Near Wood River, Nebraska, {{a herd of}} bison {{caused the}} Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of <b>the</b> <b>wagons,</b> each {{handcart}} was required to take on an additional 100 pounds (45 kg) of flour.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers {{headed out to}} Sulfur Springs to deny that source of water to the Apaches. In the early light of day, Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding {{out of the mountains}} and attacked savagely. <b>The</b> <b>wagons</b> held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of <b>the</b> <b>wagons.</b> The warriors were met with rifle fire, as the teamsters circled <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able to avoid them.|$|E
25|$|Wooden wedges may {{be forced}} between the stage and the bottom edge of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> perimeter. Ideally, <b>the</b> wedges are driven under <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> to <b>the</b> extent that <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> is {{supported}} by the wedges instead of its casters. Wedges are typically used in pairs, on opposite sides of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> can't slip off the wedges.|$|R

5|$|Seeking to {{circumvent}} this obstacle, Pyrrhus sent {{a force of}} 2,000 Gauls and some picked Chaonians under the commander of his son Ptolemy {{to go around the}} trench. These troops found their path blocked by <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> which the Lacedaimonians had sunken into the soil. <b>The</b> <b>wagons</b> were planted so deeply that they hindered not only the Epiriote assault but also Spartan efforts to repel the foray. Eventually the Gauls managed to remove some of <b>the</b> <b>wagons,</b> giving them the opportunity to burst into the city. Acrotatus, seeing the danger, exploited a series of depressions in the terrain to lead a force of 300 men undetected against the Epiriote rear. This manoeuvre evoked panic amongst the Gauls who were compelled to abandon their attempt to enter the city and had to turn around to confront the attack to their rear. After a hard fought battle, the Epiriote flanking group was pushed back into the trench with heavy casualties inflicted upon them. The Spartans, elated by Arcotatus' leadership, told him to withdraw from the battle and return to Chilonis so as to beget more children like him for Sparta.|$|E

2500|$|A lift jack is {{fundamentally}} a lever that attaches to <b>the</b> scenery <b>wagon</b> platform with a hinge, with a caster mounted to {{the underside of}} the lever near the hinge. When no downward force is applied to the lever handle, <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> rests securely on the stage; this effectively locks <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> in place due to friction between <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> platform and <b>the</b> stage. When the lever handle is forced downward, however, the caster serves as a [...] to lift <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> slightly above <b>the</b> stage, thus enabling the unit to be rolled.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the fire was never fully explained. <b>The</b> <b>wagon</b> had {{previously}} been used to carry a load of bulk sulphur powder and although {{it would have been}} cleaned in between loads, the possibility remained that some of the powder remained. Although <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> was sheeted, <b>the</b> theory advanced was that a cinder from the engine had landed in <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> and had ignited some sulphur which in turn set alight the wooden body of <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b>|$|R

5|$|At Devil's Gate {{the rescue}} party {{unloaded}} the baggage carried in <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon {{companies that had}} been following the Martin Company so <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> {{could be used to}} transport the weakest emigrants. A small group led by Daniel Webster Jones remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. On November 4 the company had to cross the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 90 to 120 feet (27 to 37 m) wide. The stream was clogged with floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days at Martin's Cove, a few miles west of Devil's Gate.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter, {{seeking a}} more {{defensive}} posture closer to Beaver Creek, advanced {{for a short}} period then circled the supply wagons in a defensible area. This was possible because his mounted troopers fought a mobile delaying action. On his command, Carpenter's men rushed inside at the gallop. They dismounted and took up a defensive firing line at the gap between <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> they had just entered.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Hungarian {{mathematician}} Pál Turán {{was forced}} {{to work in a}} brick factory, pushing wagon loads of bricks from kilns to storage sites. The factory had tracks from each kiln to each storage site, and <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> were harder to push at the points where tracks crossed each other. Turán was inspired by this situation to ask how the factory might be redesigned to minimize the number of crossings between these tracks.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Conestoga <b>wagon</b> {{was built}} with its floor curved upward {{to prevent the}} {{contents}} from tipping and shifting. Including its tongue, <b>the</b> average Conestoga <b>wagon</b> was 18 feet (5.4 m) long, 11 feet (3.3 m) high, and 4 feet (1.2 m) in width. It could carry up to 12000 lb of cargo. The seams {{in the body of}} <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> were stuffed with tar to protect them from leaking while crossing rivers. Also for protection against bad weather, stretched across <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> was a tough white canvas cover. The frame and suspension were made of wood, and the wheels were often iron rimmed for greater durability. Water barrels were built on the side of <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> toolboxes held tools needed for repair, and a feed box on the back of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> was used to feed the horses. <b>The</b> early freight <b>wagon</b> was not intended to be ridden upon. <b>The</b> <b>wagon</b> had a brake handle on the left side between the two wheels and a teamster either walked beside <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> or could ride standing (and could sit for a rough ride) on a pull-out board, called a lazy board, that provided access to the brake handle. The left horse near <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> was referred to as the wheel horse and was sometimes ridden. <b>The</b> Conestoga <b>wagon</b> began <b>the</b> custom of [...] "driving" [...] on the right-hand side of the road.|$|R

5|$|On July 3, 1863, {{reports of}} a slow moving Confederate wagon train in the {{vicinity}} of Fairfield, Pennsylvania, attracted the attention of newly commissioned Union Brigadier General Wesley Merritt of the Reserve Brigade, First Division, Cavalry Corps.

5|$|The Spanish vanguard {{was driven}} {{off by the}} English at the first charge, but the Spanish pikemen under Captains Pedro Manrique and Manuel de Vega, from Francisco Arias de Bobadilla's and Juan del Águila's tercios, formed the {{defenders}} into squadron formation and kept the way open for <b>the</b> <b>wagons.</b> As the carters fled {{at the beginning of}} the fight, the Spanish arquebusiers had to take their places and brought <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> towards Zutphen. Stanley's pikemen charged upon the Spanish squadron, but they were repelled at the push of pike. As the fight approached Zutphen and Francisco Verdugo noticed the musketry fire, he ordered a wagon to be loaded with powder and bullets and sent it to the Spanish arquebusiers. The English cavalry, in the meantime, charged over the Spanish pikes on one of its flanks. Though they succeeded in breaking the two or three foremost ranks, Essex's men could not penetrate further. Twice more the English charged upon the squadron, but they were as well repelled.|$|E
5|$|Calthrop {{constructed}} {{the line for}} £35,944, £11,000 less than the original estimate. He had Kitson & Co construct two 2-6-4T locomotives, similar in outline but smaller than the Barsi Light Railway locomotives. Goods rolling stock included four coaches, two bogie open wagons and one bogie van, once again similar to Barsi stock. He also introduced four transporter wagons, designed to transport standard-gauge wagons. Each station on route had a short section of standard-gauge track where <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> could be placed. The use of transporter wagons eliminated transshipment, and removed the need for large numbers of goods wagons.|$|E

5|$|On Carpenter's command, several massive volleys of aimed Spencer repeating rifles hit {{the front}} {{waves of the}} mounted Indians.

5|$|Stanton and Pike {{stopped to}} rest, and Reed {{returned}} alone to the group, arriving {{four days after}} the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of Weber Canyon, or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route. Their progress slowed to about {{a mile and a half}} (2.4km) a day, and all the able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks to make room for <b>the</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|E
