At the meeting she kneels down for the Elders and apologizes to everyone in a sober state and eventually bursts into tears.|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and I can give them to you and all you have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>give</b> me your soul".|$|E

5000|$|Much like Lee Daniels' own father, Lucious is {{severely}} homophobic and extremely unapologetic about it. Daniels {{revealed that the}} decision to make Lucious homophobic stemmed from his experiences doing research for Precious. [...] "Homophobia is rampant in the African American community" [...] Daniels stated. [...] "I wanted to blow the lid off more on homophobia in my community," [...] Daniels continued. The openly gay Daniels recalled his father's point of view on his sexuality: [...] "You're an African-American man, that's hard enough. You're going to throw gay on top of it? What are you doing? You have a choice. Do you really want to go through life like this?" [...] "What we're doing is telling {{a little bit of the}} story of Lee growing up in that way," [...] Terrence Howard said, referring to the scene in which Lucious throws his 4-year-old son Jamal in a trash bin when the boy puts on his mother's heels. That scene was based on Daniels' actual experience with his own father. Howard elaborated on his experience during the scene: [...] "Watching Lee while we were shooting this — at one point, he had to look away because he was in tears, because he was facing it. His mother was also there on the set. It was cathartic for Lee." [...] Howard continued, [...] "Lee would not allow me to show any compassion in the scene. He reminded me how much Lucious loved little Jamal, but my need for the boy to be a strong man was greater than my need to show my love to him. That was a difficult scene." [...] Danny Strong initially did not tell Daniels about the decision to incorporate that part of his life story into the series because he feared Daniels would reject the idea. Howard revealed that his own father was also terribly homophobic and it scared him too. But [...] "that's what's taught in most and Latino households", Howard explained. [...] "What we're really trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>give</b> people an opportunity to see what they're doing is painful," [...] the actor continued. From Lucious' point of view, as a hip hop mogul, [...] "He is supposed to be the epitome of a 'man' in the black community. He's raising three strong sons." [...] Lucious feels that Jamal's homosexuality detracts from that powerful image.|$|E

5000|$|... "Homophobiais so {{real and}} it is {{happening}} to so many people, has happened to so many people... To {{children and young people}} that are questioning their sexuality or know for their sexuality, if they can look at someone and see themselves in Jamal, that's incredible. I embrace that fully." [...] Jussie Smollett, Television Critics Association Winter Preview (2015) Jamal's sexuality is a point of contention very early on for him and his father, while his mother sees the signs and loves him anyway. Lee Daniels made a conscious effort to remove the [...] "stereotype" [...] from Jamal's sexuality. [...] "Look... there are all different types of gay people" [...] Daniels remarked. Smollett said the show is [...] "not shoving anything down your throat. It's not preaching, it's not telling you the way you should feel about a certain issue, but it is giving you options. Lee Daniels holds up the mirror to us as human beings." [...] Thanks to his own experience as a gay man, Daniels is able to construct the world of Empire around Jamal who is written as a [...] "down-the-middle, well-mannered, even-keeled, guy-next-door type." [...] Daniels wanted to [...] "normalize" [...] gay romances, specifically between men of color. Show runner Ilene Chaiken said [...] "We're going to go places with Jamal that are unexpected and that you've never seen a television show go -- certainly not on a broadcast television show -- with a gay black character... Maybe not with any gay character, frankly." [...] Daniels said [...] "Homophobia is rampant in the African-American community" [...] and using the character of Jamal, [...] "I wanted to blow the lid off it." [...] "We are behind closed doors in a family situation and trying to tell it as honestly as possible. The things my father said to me because of homophobia frightened the devil out of me." [...] said Terrence Howard. He continued, [...] "What we're really trying <b>to</b> <b>do...</b> <b>is</b> <b>give</b> people an opportunity to see what they're doing is painful. It's crushing someone that could be beautiful." [...] The scene in which Lucious throws a 4-year-old Jamal into a trash can after Jamal dresses up in Cookie's heels comes from actual events from Daniels own childhood. While Jamal's sexuality is known in his personal life, Ilene Chaiken explained that Jamal is [...] "coming out to the world which not everybody gets." [...] However, {{it would be very difficult}} for Jamal not only as an artist, but also as the son of someone with such fame. In addition, Jamal is black and he is a part of the hip-hop community. This is a [...] "very, very big deal and it's a huge story to tell" [...] Chaiken said. However, Jamal wants to come out on his own terms, and that causes some trouble for him. According to Smollett, Jamal changes his mind about coming out in episode 102, [...] "The Outspoken King" [...] because [...] "It just wasn't the right time for him, especially to do it in such a grand way -- with the press conference and the performance. That was a show! That's not Jamal." ...|$|E
