40|$|Despite {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} the island as an ecotourist destination, the ecology and natural history of many organisms native to the Lesser Antillean island of Curaçao have remained enigmatic. We document multiple new observations of the behavioral ecology of several terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates that inhabit Curaçao. We present the first report of avian predation on the endemic Curaçao whiptail lizard, Cnemidophorus murinus, suggesting these lizards play a potentially important role in this island's food web. We also document the first instance of predation by the introduced <b>tropical</b> <b>house</b> <b>gecko,</b> Hemidactylus mabouia, on the native Antilles gecko, Gonatodes antillensis. Tropical house geckos {{are thought to be}} displacing native geckos through a combination of niche displacement and competitive exclusion, and our finding suggests that predation on smaller native lizards may be another factor aiding the success of this introduced gecko on Curaçao. We also present repeated observational evidence that juvenile bluehead wrasses (Thalassoma bifasciatum) seek refuge among the sessile and venomous giant Caribbean sea anemones (Condylactis gigantean). 6 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Brown spiders (Loxosceles spp.) are venomous arachnids, {{successfully}} {{adapted to}} urban habitats in Brazil. Loxoscelism became a serious {{public health problem}} in Paraná State, especially at the capital Curitiba, where the most abundant species is Loxosceles intermedia. Hemidactylus mabouia (Gekkonidae) lizards are synanthropic predators of arthropods. In this paper, we describe the predatory behavior of the <b>Tropical</b> <b>House</b> <b>Gecko</b> H. mabouia on L. intermedia under laboratory conditions. Twelve geckos were observed, {{and all of them}} fed on brown spiders (n= 123 observations). The attack consisted of a fast run followed by one bite on the spider’s abdomen or legs. The geckos did not attack L. intermedia anterior body parts, probably due to the fangs present in this region. Two Hemidactylus individuals were killed by L. intermedia bites: during a predatory encounter, and by an induced bite on a restrained lizard. The observations summarized in this paper show that H. mabouia could be used in the biological control of Loxosceles populations in human dwellings. However, additional field studies are necessary to quantify the impact of H. mabouia predation on urban populations of L. intermedia and other species of the same genus...|$|E
40|$|Predicting the {{response}} of endemic species to urbanization {{has emerged as a}} fundamental challenge in 21 st century conservation biology. The factors that underlie population declines of reptiles are particularly nebulous, as these are often the least understood class of vertebrates in a given community. In this study, we assess correlations between feeding ecology and phenotypic traits of the Lesser Antillean endemic Dutch leaf-toed gecko, Phyllodactylus martini, along an urban gradient in the Caribbean island of Curaçao. There has been a marked decline of this species in developed habitats associated with the invasive <b>tropical</b> <b>house</b> <b>gecko</b> Hemidactylus mabouia. We find a correlation between aspects of locomotor morphology and prey in undeveloped habitats that is absent in developed habitats. Analyses of stomach contents further suggest that Phyllodactylus martini alters primary prey items in developed areas. However, changes in prey promote the overlap in foraging niches between Phyllodactylus martini and Hemidactylus mabouia, suggesting that direct resource competition is contributing to the decline of Phyllodactylus martini. In addition to competitive exclusion, we suggest that the urban extirpation of Phyllodactylus martini could also be attributed to a top-down control on population growth by Hemidactylus mabouia. Colonizations of walls put Phyllodactylus martini in direct contact with Hemidactylus mabouia increasing the chances for predation events, as evidenced by our observation of a predation event on a Phyllodactylus martini juvenile by an adult Hemidactylus mabuoia. In total, our results add to a growing body of literature demonstrating the threat that invasive synanthropic reptiles pose to endemics that might otherwise be able to cope with increased urbanization pressures. 18 page(s...|$|E
40|$|House Geckos in the genusHemidactylusare highly {{successful}} colonizers of regions beyond their native range, often resulting in displacement of native gecko species through competitive interactions for daytime refuge (crevices) and prey resources. We report on {{data collected from}} night time surveys undertaken in April-May 2014 on Barbados, West Indies, {{that focused on the}} distribution and abundance of the endemic Barbados Leaf-Toed Gecko (Phyllodactylus pulcher) and the introduced <b>Tropical</b> <b>House</b> <b>Gecko</b> (Hemidactylus mabouia) along unlit coastal walls and among boulders in the grounds of a hotel resort. In contrast to patterns of displacement of native species byH. mabouiaseen elsewhere,P. pulcherwas more abundant thanH. mabouiaon coastal walls, whereas the latter was found in greater numbers using boulders at this site. Walls and boulders differed with regard to availability of diurnal refugia suitable for geckos; with the walls having high frequency of small crevices with openings < 20 mm, and boulders offering very little cover other than the underside of the boulder itself. To investigate if this niche separation was a result of differences in diurnal refuge use between the species, we conducted experimental trials in which geckos were allowed to select between refugia with different characteristics. Both species selected for narrower and warmer refugia, and refugia that had been previously occupied by the other species. These shared preferences for refugia type suggest that other factors underlie the niche separation observed in the field. In supporting high densities ofP. pulcher, coastal walls could offer important secondary habitat by augmenting the natural cliff side habitat of this endemic gecko, a finding that could be exploited for the conservation of this candidate species for Critically Endangered classification...|$|E
