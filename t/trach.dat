Like Phong Nha cave, this cave features spectacular stalactites and stalagmites shaped like several fairy-tales. Stalactite and stalagmite columns and walls here create strange sounds like that of gong and drum if they are knocked with the hand. According to British cave scientists, Tiên Sơn cave was created tens of million years ago when a water current holed this limestone mount in Kẻ Bàng. Following a series of landforms and movement of rocks, this mass was levered or lowered, blocking the current and creating what is now Tiên Sơn cave while the underground river redirected its current to Phong Nha cave. Although Phong Nha and Tiên Sơn caves are located next to each other, there are no linking grottos between them.|$|E

Part of {{the care of a}} mechanically ventilated patient is frequent suctioning of the trachea to remove secretions. Currently, there is no criterion for documenting the quantity of pulmonary secretions recovered from suctioning a mechanically ventilated patient. The purpose of this research survey is to determine criteria for documenting the quantity of pulmonary secretions retrieved. Methods: A survey has been sent via e-mail to thirteen respiratory therapy managers, with a request to disperse the survey to their employees- 576 employees. Hard copies of the survey were available upon request. The survey asks the participants to state criteria used to define commonly used terms: scant, small, moderate, large and copious when documenting the amount of pulmonary secretions collected after suctioning a <b>trached</b> or intubated patient for one setting. The data will be gathered and compiled into a spread sheet to determine criteria to standardize documentation of the quantity of pulmonary secretions. Data were analyzed to determine the consistency with a set of definitions devised by University based respiratory therapists. By the nature of the questionnaire there were “free text” responses. Each response was compared with the “definition”. If the respondent definition was not consistent with the definition the response was classified as non-consistent “nc”.

This reduction in the upper airway muscle tone may not end at the pharynx but may extend further distally, e. g., into the trachea. Because tracheal tone cannot be measured directly in conscious humans, we inferred the tone from the relative hysteresis of the tracheal area compared with the lung. Relative hysteresis was measured by plotting the cross-sectional area of a tracheal segment obtained by the acoustic reflection technique vs. lung volume. All measurements were performed during wakefulness. We found that in 42 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index> lo), relative hysteresis of the proxi-mal trachea was predominantly clockwise, i. e., smaller tha...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{collective}} control of multi-agent systems has attracted {{more and more}} researcher's attention in past decades due to its wide applications in different areas. This thesis mainly studies two aspects of the {{collective control}} problems of multi-agent systems, specifically, consensus of linear multi-agent systems and synchronizarion of nonlinear and heterogenous multi-agent systems. Moreover, the controllers designed throughout the whole thesis are in sampled-data versions. For consensus of linear multi-agent systems, I firstly establish a general linear dynamic for each individual, and assume that the communication topology among the agents is fixed. After proposing the sampled-data controller, it is shown that the consensus problem is equivalent to a stability problem of a continuous-time system with a time-varying time delay. Lyapunov-Razumikbin approach is used {{to deal with the}} stability problem. I then further consider a more general case where only the union of the communication topologies has a smapping tree and only the measurement output infomration of the agents are available for the controller in sampled-data setup. This problem is proved to be equivalent to a stability problem of a discrete-time system. Lyapunov-based approach is applied to solve it. For synchronization of nonlinear and heterogeneous multi-agents, I solve the problem by two steps. The first step is to design a linear reference model for each individual and to make the reference models reach consensus under the designed controllers. The second step is to design a sampled-data controller for each individual to make the output <b>traching</b> its own reference model. The analysis for consensus of linear MASs can be used directly for step one, thus, I am only concerned with the step two for synchronization of nonlinear and heterogenous multi-agents, and I call this problem in a two-step mannar, that is, I firstly design a continuous dynamic controller and discretize it to the sampled-data version. Throughout the thesis, the aforementioned two main problems will be stated in five chapters. Moreover, the Introduction and Conclusion are at {{the beginning and the end}} of the thesis, respectively.
