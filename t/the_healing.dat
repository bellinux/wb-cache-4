The purpose of the Healthy Eating, Active Living (HEAL) Idaho Network {{is to create an}} environment that allows all its residents access to healthy food options and opportunities for physical activity. <b>The</b> <b>HEAL</b> Idaho Network initiative seeks to accomplish this goal through an expanding collaborative network of organizations, agencies, businesses, and individuals that are concerned about improving the health education and overall well-being of all Idahoans. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess HEAL member’s levels of satisfaction with the planning and implementation, leadership, local and state-wide involvement, communication, and member involvement strategies, utility of the framework, and overall outcomes and impact. The member satisfaction survey was distributed through email to each member of <b>the</b> <b>HEAL</b> Idaho Network included in <b>the</b> <b>HEAL</b> Google Group. <b>The</b> Healthy Eating, Active Living (HEAL) Network Member Survey was completed by 37 participants; this represents a response rate of 24. 6 %, based on the number of email addresses in <b>the</b> <b>HEAL</b> Google Group email database. Overall, the mean satisfaction scores for each component indicate that the members of <b>the</b> <b>HEAL</b> Idaho Network were satisfied with the activities implemented by the network. Satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>HEAL</b> Framework indicated that the members were neutral about their use of the framework, specifically its development, the impact of the framework on their work, and progress towards goals. Through the continued enhancement of core competencies, such as those evaluated with this survey, <b>the</b> <b>HEAL</b> Network creates a environment that facilitates the dynamic changes that need to take place to successfully impact health outcomes in Idaho. Research indicates that sharing the commitment, resources, creative energy, and expanding reach contributes greatly to the sustainable future of collaborative efforts for creating change. <b>The</b> <b>HEAL</b> Network has <b>the</b> potential to be the catalyst for dramatic health impacts both at the local, community level, and for the entire state of Idaho...|$|R
5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> response {{and are the}} most common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E

5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E

During <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> phase, natural bone replaces the graft forming a new bony base for the implant.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E
