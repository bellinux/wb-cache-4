5|$|Another form of airpower {{employed}} by Kenney was air transport. This started in September 1942 when <b>troops</b> <b>of</b> the 32nd Infantry Division were airlifted from Australia to Port Moresby. Later in the campaign, C-47 Dakotas landed Australian troops at Wanigela. A year later, American paratroops landed at Nadzab, enabling the Australian 7th Division to be flown in.|$|E
50|$|The 1st Hussars traces {{its roots}} to the {{formation}} of the St. Thomas <b>Troop</b> <b>of</b> Volunteer Militia Cavalry in March 1856 and the First <b>Troop</b> <b>of</b> Volunteer Militia Cavalry of London in July of the same year. In 1863, these units were redesignated the St. Thomas <b>Troop</b> <b>of</b> Cavalry and the London <b>Troop</b> <b>of</b> Cavalry, respectively.

50|$|These {{grenadiers}} {{functioned as}} mounted infantry, riding with the Horse Guards but fighting with grenades and muskets on foot.

To The King's <b>Troop</b> <b>of</b> Horse Guards were attached 80 privates, officered by one captain, two lieutenants, three sergeants, and three corporals, and accompanied by two drummers and two hautboys. The grenadiers attached to The Queen's <b>Troop</b> <b>of</b> Horse Guards and The Duke <b>of</b> York's <b>Troop</b> <b>of</b> Horse Guards had no drummers, two sergeants and two corporals, and only sixty privates per troop.

5|$|Bratislava was {{bombarded by}} the Allies, {{occupied}} by German troops in 1944, and eventually taken by <b>troops</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front on 4 April 1945.
