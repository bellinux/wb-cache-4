[...] As these cult films become more popular, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> varied responses from fans that depend on different interpretations, such as camp, irony, genuine affection, or combinations thereof. [...] Earnest fans, who recognize and accept the film's faults, can make minor celebrities of the film's cast, though the benefits are not always clear. [...] Cult film stars known for their camp can inject subtle parody or signal when films should not be taken seriously. [...] Campy actors can also provide comic book supervillains for serious, artistic-minded films. [...] This can draw fan acclaim and obsession more readily than subtle, method-inspired acting. [...] Mark Chalon Smith of the Los Angeles Times says technical faults may be forgiven if a film makes up for them in other areas, such as camp or transgressive content. [...] Smith {{states that the}} early films of John Waters are amateurish and less influential than claimed, but Waters' outrageous vision cements his place in cult cinema. [...] Films such as [...] Myra Breckinridge (1970) and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) can experience critical reappraisal later, once their camp excess and avant-garde filmmaking are better accepted, and films that are initially dismissed as frivolous are often reassessed as campy. [...] Films that intentionally try to appeal to fans of camp may end up alienating them, as the films become perceived as trying too hard or not authentic.|$|E

The advantage of photothyristors is their insensitivity to electrical signals, {{which can cause}} faulty operation in electrically noisy environments.

The reasons they urge for such proceedings are ... that the people of the Waitara, without having been guilty of any crime, were driven at the point of the sword from villages, houses, and homes which they had occupied for years. That a great crime had been committed against them. That through all future generations it will be told that their lands have been forcibly and unlawfully taken from them by officers appointed by the Queen of England.

[...] Administration officials (implying that the hijackers were also guilty of piracy) said the president's position was complicated due to uncertainty if the pirates had been released to the PLO or were still in Egypt.
