25|$|Earthquake {{engineering}} is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall {{goal is to}} make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake {{engineering is}} the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance.|$|E
25|$|On {{the dawn}} of July 13, the Iraqi Army, backed by the Shiite and Sunni pro-government militias, {{launched}} an assault on several fronts in Anbar, including on Ramadi. According to the police sources in the province, the Iraqi forces pushed towards Ramadi from {{the west and the}} south. According to ISIL supporters, the advances of the Iraqi forces were repelled by militants. By the afternoon, the Iraqi Army retook the Ramadi Olympic stadium in western Ramadi and reached {{the eastern part of the}} city. According to Iraqi officials, pro-government fighters also pushed the extremists from the areas east of Ramadi. On July 20, the Olympic stadium was destroyed by ISIL militants with remotely detonated explosives. According to military officials said that there may have been number of Shiite militia fighters may have been inside the stadium at the time of its destruction, but they did not offer casualty figures. On July 23, Iraqi government announced that it had deployed United States-trained Iraqi troops for the first time to retake Ramadi. The Shiite militia commanders said that currently the initial main focus was on retaking Fallujah rather than Ramadi and the Iraqi government indicated <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used to liberate Ramadi. On July 26, pro-government forces took back the complete control of University of Anbar from ISIL fighters. It was retaken by forces from Iraq's Counter Terrorism Services with support from the Iraqi army and air support from the international coalition and Iraqi aircraft. On July 29, 12 Iraqi soldiers were killed when ISIL suicide attackers rammed 2 explosive-laden Humvees into forces deployed outside the university's compound.|$|E

Producer Bonnie Curtis described the character as [...] "this sub-human monster the kids feel they are becoming".

500|$|Dreaming of You is a multigenre work of American pop and Latin music. It {{incorporates}} the diverse stylistic influences of techno, hip-hop, pop rock, dance-pop, regional Mexican music, Tejano, R, disco, and flamenco music. The {{first half of}} the album comprises R and pop ballads, while the remainder contains Latin-themed influences that profile Selena's music career. Music journalists said producers who worked with Selena tried to caricature her with Paula Abdul, Amy Grant, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Madonna. Newsweek magazine called Selena's English-language recordings [...] "a blend of urban pop and Latin warmth". According to Allmusic's Stephen Erlewine, the album's mood is spicy, celebratory, and exuberant. [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] and [...] "Dreaming of You" [...] are lyrically identical; called [...] "confessional ballads", both recordings speak of despair, heartbreak, and fear of rejection from a man the songs' narrators are falling in love with.
