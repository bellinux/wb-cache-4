5|$|The {{extent to}} which cryovolcanism really occurs is a subject of some debate, as water, being denser than ice by about 8%, has {{difficulty}} erupting under normal circumstances. At Enceladus, it appears that cryovolcanism occurs because water-filled cracks are periodically exposed to vacuum, <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> being opened and closed by tidal stresses.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>crack</b> {{processes}} in single-phase alumina specimens {{have been investigated}} by acoustic emission (AE) analysis {{with regard to the}} increase of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> resistance. During loading of a notched specimen, individual AE signals are observed at first, which are probably due to the generation of microcracks in a process zone around the notch. At higher loads signal clusters are found, which should be due to the coalescence of microcracks. By these coalescence events <b>the</b> main <b>crack</b> is formed. At microscopic crack propagation most AE events are located within <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip zone.

5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion. The Doctor postulates that enough of the original universe still exists in the Pandorica to completely restore it via the exploding TARDIS. After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, the Doctor engages the Pandorica and flies it into the exploding TARDIS. A second Big Bang occurs. The Doctor comes to consciousness and begins witnessing events in his life in reverse as <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> in the universe close.

40|$|The plastic {{deformation}} processes around a crack tip at an atomic scale level under cyclic loading are examined using a molecular dynamics simulation. In this study, {{we deal with}} not only a specimen including both a crack and grain boundaries but also a specimen including only a <b>crack.</b> For <b>the</b> specimen including both <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> and <b>the</b> grain boundaries, we can observe the emission of edge dislocations in order to relax stress concentration around <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip during loading. The dislocations emitted from <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip return to <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip because of interaction between dislocations during unloading. <b>The</b> <b>crack</b> propagates due to coalescence of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip and <b>the</b> vacancies caused by the repeat of the dislocation emission and absorption at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>cracked</b> Brazilian disc (CBD) {{specimen}} {{is widely}} used {{in order to determine}} mode-I/II and mixed-mode fracture toughness of a rock medium. In this study, the stress intensity factor (SIF) on the crack-tip in this specimen is calculated for various geometrical <b>crack</b> conditions using <b>the</b> extended-finite element method (X-FEM). This method is based upon the finite element method (FEM). In this method, <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> is modeled independently from the mesh. The results obtained show that the dimensionless SIFs for the pure modes I and II increase with increase in <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> length but <b>the</b> angle in which pure mode-II occurs decreases.

5|$|This is {{the first}} series to feature Matt Smith as the {{eleventh}} incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in his TARDIS, {{which appears to be}} a British police box on the outside. Karen Gillan is also introduced as the Doctor's new companion Amy Pond, with her fiancé Rory Williams portrayed by Arthur Darvill, who is in seven episodes, and travels with the Doctor and Amy and is also a regular in the next series. Alex Kingston returns as River Song, a mysterious woman from the Doctor's future who summons the Doctor twice in this series. The main story arc concerns a pattern of cracks in the universe which appear over several episodes, sometimes going unnoticed by the characters. It is discovered that they have the power to erase things from existence, and this happens to Rory, causing Amy to forget him. In the series finale it is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> were caused by the TARDIS exploding and the Doctor is forced to reboot the universe to the state which it was in without <b>the</b> <b>cracks.</b>|$|E

30|$|After a crack initiates from a {{pre-existing}} flaw, {{the manner}} in which this crack propagates dictates whether the bridging fibers will be ruptured or pulled out. A lot of this depends on the opening magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>crack.</b> If crack opening is large, rupturing or pulling out of fibers on <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> flanks will be inevitable as <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> propagates. In an ideally brittle material, <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> opening is known to scale parabolically with distance behind <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tips, which means that <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> opening will increase indefinitely with <b>the</b> propagating <b>crack</b> length. In normal fiber reinforced concrete, the parabolic shaped opening near <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip is modified by the closing pressure of bridging fibers, but otherwise follows the same trend in terms of crack opening scaling with <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> length. This implies that <b>the</b> bridged <b>crack</b> must undergo tension softening as fibers are ruptured or pulled out in such composites. This is the normal scenario for ordinary fiber reinforced concrete.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, I+II mixed mode notch-crack fatigue {{propagation}} in {{titanium alloy}} steel TA 2 was tested {{with the emphasis}} on <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> mode transition and retardation under constant amplitude loading or overloading. Finite element method was employed to calculate the stress distribution at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip in order to explain <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> growth behavior. It is found that after initiation from <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip, <b>the</b> new formed <b>crack</b> propagates in a mode I form, regardless of the magnitudes of the inclined angle of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> and <b>the</b> overloading applied. The relationship between <b>the</b> fatigue <b>crack</b> growth rate and mode I stress intensity factor range was calculated. After overloading, crack initiation and propagation will be significantly slowed, or in other words, there exists overloading retardation. Calculation shows that after overloading, a plastic zone with residual compressive stress is formed which is responsible for the retardation of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate. Micro-morphologies of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> growth path and <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> fracture surface were also observed and analyzed...|$|R
5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account for the fact that <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. <b>The</b> <b>cracks</b> started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed.

5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> in the ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E
40|$|In certain {{ceramics}} one observes {{an increase}} in crack resistance with increasing crack length (R-curve behaviour).

5|$|Beyond the {{flexibility}} of the new broilers, the new equipment has several features intended to decrease operational costs. A more efficient design of the burners in the Nieco units produces a 30 percent reduction in energy consumption. The Duke units produce a $4,000 -$5,000 annual savings on energy compared to the original units, which ran approximately at full capacity all day.
