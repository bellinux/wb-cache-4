40|$|An {{important}} issue with many sequential data analysis problems, {{such as those}} encountered in nfiancial data sets, is that different variables are known at different frequencies, at different times (asynchronicity), or are sometimes missing. To address this issue we propose to use recurrent networks with feedback into the input units, based on two fundamental ideas. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>motivation</b> is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> "filled-in" value of the missing variable may not only depend in complicated ways {{on the value of}} this variable in the past of the sequence but also on the current and past values of other variables. The second <b>motivation</b> is <b>that,</b> for the purpose of making predictions or taking decisions, it is not always necessary to fill in the best possible value of the missing variables. In fact, it is sufficient to fill in a value which helps the system make better predictions or decisions. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated through experiments on several tasks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- We {{propose a}} new {{detection}} ordering for the V-BLAST. The main {{idea is to}} detect and cancel sub-streams in order {{of the magnitude of}} log-likelihood ratio (LLR), i. e. the symbol with the largest magnitude of LLR is detected <b>first.</b> <b>The</b> <b>motivation</b> is <b>that</b> the reliability of data decision increases with increasing magnitude of LLR. As a result, the error propagation associated with a wrong decision and the resulting error probability for the remaining sub-streams can be minimized. It is shown that the proposed LLR-based ordering significantly outperforms the conventional SNR-based ordering. Simplified LLR-based ordering and envelope-based ordering that require a much less computation, but provide a performance virtually identical to the LLR-based ordering, are also proposed.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine the way {{different}} motivational types from Self-Determination Theory (SDT) influence antecedents of customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach – The findings in this study were generated with a quantitative design using path analysis on data collected at two stages during an extended service encounter. Findings – Each motivation type played a unique and important role in influencing the antecedents of satisfaction, namely, positive and negative emotions and perceptions of service quality. As hypothesised, motives associated with higher levels of autonomy were consistently stronger predictors of positive emotions and service quality. The influence of motives on the antecedents did not change significantly over time, whereas significant differences were noted between all antecedents and satisfaction. The model explained 54 and 63 per cent of the variance in satisfaction in times one and two, respectively. Originality/value – This is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time <b>that</b> <b>motivation</b> as conceptualised from an SDT perspective has been applied to understanding the dynamic nature of customer satisfaction. The findings offer considerable opportunities for follow-up studies and the motivation types can provide practitioners with a stable and efficient segmentation option...|$|R

This study will consider the literature on reasons related to migration choices by considering gender differences. Furthermore, it {{will address the}} issue of acculturation, its relationship with well-being, and the stress of acculturation. Within this framework, we will discuss how immigrant women address the process of acculturation through the negotiation of their ethnic identity. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand the psychological, personal and relational dimensions of the acculturation process of immigrant working women in Italy. Additional objectives were to understand these women’s motivations for leaving their country of origin, to comprehend the challenges and resources used to address social and employment socialization, and to explore the ethnic identity negotiation of these women in their new country. One hundred and twenty immigrant working women participated in this study. A qualitative approach using in-depth interviews was employed. The guide topics were related to the <b>motivations</b> <b>that</b> led women to immigrate to Italy, the challenges they faced, the strategies used to overcome their problems and the process of ethnic identity negotiation.

In both countries, 24 home owners occupying either their apartment or their single family house, were interviewed in 2009 - 10 about their energy-saving renovation works and their justifications, both in cities and in the countryside. The paper begins {{with a description of}} the building stock in the two countries. Both have a large proportion of apartments (46 % of apartments in Bulgaria and 77 % in Latvia) and have many old buildings, {{more than half of the}} buildings dating from the sixties or before. People can live in these allotted dwellings for their lifetime or even pass them on to kin. The main part of the paper analyses the levers and brakes in refurbishing one’s dwelling according to the interviewees, for apartments and houses in both countries. It appears that in Latvia, the dwellings’ bad condition is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>motivation</b> for renovating them. In apartments, dwellers renovate because they are “feeling cold” in their dwellings, which is always related to their bad insulation.
