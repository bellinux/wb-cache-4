500|$|Letters {{began to}} pour in for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E

Turambar was forced to go back to war when Glaurung sent Orcs to attack Brethil: taking the sword up again, Túrin drove them away, taking control of the Folk from Brandir. Next year Níniel conceived; however, soon Glaurung {{attacked}} Brethil himself.|$|E

[...] They promised <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> forever. [...] When Maria discovered that he had met, fell in love with, and married a mortal woman, she was deeply hurt. Realizing that she could not trust townspeople because she was so different from them, and that they were just using her, she became angry and refused to give fruits to the trees, let animals and birds roam the forests for hunters to catch, and let fish abound in the lake. People seldom saw her, and those times when she could be seen were often only during pale moonlit nights.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final section}} opens with {{discussion}} of a plan developed for Dmitri's escape from his sentence of twenty years of hard labor in Siberia. The plan is never fully described, {{but it seems to}} involve Ivan and Katerina bribing some guards. Alyosha approves, first, because Dmitri is not emotionally ready to submit to such a harsh sentence, secondly, because he is innocent, and, third, because no guards or officers would suffer for aiding the escape. Dmitri and Grushenka plan to escape to America and work the land there for several years, and then to return to Russia under assumed American names, because they both cannot imagine living without Russia. Dmitri begs for Katerina to visit him in the hospital, where he is recovering from an illness before he is due to be taken away. When she does, Dmitri apologizes for having hurt her; she in turn apologizes for bringing up the implicating letter during the trial. They agree <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for that one moment, and say they will love each other forever, even though both now love other people. The novel concludes at Ilyusha's funeral, where Ilyusha's schoolboy friends listen to Alyosha's [...] "Speech by the Stone". Alyosha promises to remember Kolya, Ilyusha, and all the boys and keep them close in his heart, even though he will have to leave them and may not see them again until many years have passed. He implores them <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and to always remember Ilyusha, and to keep his memory alive in their hearts, and to remember this moment at the stone when they were all together and they all loved each other. Alyosha then recounts the Christian promise that they will all be united one day after the Resurrection. In tears, the twelve boys promise Alyosha that they will keep each other in their memories forever, join hands, and return to the Snegiryov household for the funeral dinner, chanting, [...] "Hurrah for Karamazov!" ...|$|E

Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, or I would even nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...' ...|$|E
2500|$|The apparitions of Our Lady of Kibeho {{began on}} November 28, 1981, in the African college of Kibeho, Rwanda. The Virgin Mary {{repeatedly}} appeared to three teenage students, Alphonsine Mumureke, Nathalie Mukamazimpaka, and Marie Claire Mukangango. The apparition identified {{herself in the}} native Rwandan dialect as [...] "Nyina wa Jambo", ( [...] "Mother of the Word"), which is synonymous with [...] "Mother of God." [...] The apparitions communicated various messages to the three girls, urging the people <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> asking for prayers to prevent a war, and warning of an apocalyptic vision of Rwanda descending into violence and hatred, which has been interpreted as foretelling the 1994 Rwandan Genocide (in which Mukangango was killed). Following an investigation, the Holy See released the declaration of Bishop Augustin Misago of Gikongoro approving the apparitions to Mumureke, Mukamazimpaka, and Mukangango; other apparitions reported by several other girls and one boy were not approved. (Bishop Misago himself was tried in a Rwandan court on charges that he took part in government meetings planning the genocide, but was cleared of all charges in 2000.) The Marian sanctuary at Kibeho was named [...] "Shrine of Our Lady of Sorrows" [...] in 1992, {{two years before the}} genocide. An estimated 500,000 pilgrims visit the site every year. Although the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has not released any official statement on Kibeho, Pope Francis, in an April 3, 2014 meeting with Rwandan bishops just prior to the twentieth anniversary of the genocide, referred to the apparitions, saying, [...] "The mother of Jesus wanted to show herself to your country's children, reminding them of the effectiveness of fasting and prayer, especially the rosary." ...|$|E

He arrived to Earth via his spaceship {{run by an}} artificial intelligence named Jan Pu, but crash lands on the surface where Hazumu is, killing him instantly. Hitoshi rectifies this by regenerating Hazumu, but unexpectedly changes his physical sex in the process. This is a mystery to Hitoshi for some time until he is finally able to confirm that Hazumu's [...] "life grain" [...] count is slowly dissipating, {{and by the time}} Hitoshi confirms this, Hazumu only has one month left to live. Hitoshi originally came to Earth as a cultural anthropologist and to study the emotions of the human race since his species has long-since given up any emotion at all. Hitoshi recounts that {{at the peak of his}} people's civilization, they had discovered the means to destroy all life in the entire universe instantly, so in order to prevent this from ever happening, his people chose to discard their emotions. However, even after becoming a calm, logical race where emotional clashes such as violence and war disappeared completely, his people also started to lose their sexual urges in order to propagate his species further. In their current situation, if something is not done soon, his entire species will soon become extinct, which is why he is on Earth to find a way to save his species. He arrives at the conclusion that his species needs to remember how <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in order to survive, so love becomes a focus of his research. In order to observe humans more closely, along with Hazumu and her ongoing relationship with Yasuna and Tomari, Hitoshi starts working at Hazumu's school as a biology teacher, and inadvertently becomes the target of Namiko's extreme affections.|$|E

2500|$|Miller was {{determined}} the production {{not become a}} farce, and in that vein, two keys texts were Lawrence Stone's The Family, Sex and Marriage in England: 1500-1800 and Michael Walzer's The Revolution of the Saints, which he used to help ground his interpretation in recognisably Renaissance-esque societal terms; Petruchio's actions are based on accepted economic, social and religious views of the time, as are Baptista's. In tandem with this interpretation, the song sung {{at the end of}} the play is a musical version of Psalm 128 ("Blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord"), which was often sung in Puritan households at the end of a meal during Shakespeare's own day, and which praised a peaceful family life. Speaking of the addition of the psalm, Miller states [...] "I had to give [...] an explicitly religious format, so people could see it as not just simply the high-jinks of an intolerantly selfish man who was simply destroying a woman to satisfy his own vanity, but a sacramental view of the nature of marriage, whereby this couple had come <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by reconciling themselves to the demands of a society which saw obedience as a religious requirement." [...] Along these lines, Miller was also insistent that to interpret the play in light of twentieth century feminism was a flawed approach; [...] "what we think now is really quite beside the point. If everything is done in the light of what we think, it's a sort of historical egocentricity, which is quite intolerable." [...] Diana E. Henderson was unimpressed with this approach, however, writing [...] "it was the perfect production to usher in the neo-conservative 1980s" [...] and [...] "this BBC-TV museum piece unabashedly celebrates the order achieved through female submission." ...|$|E
2500|$|We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service was {{released}} by Epic Records on November 11, 2016, to widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 91, based on 26 reviews; it was the year's best-reviewed hip hop album and fourth best-reviewed album overall, according to the website. Ray Rahman from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the record [...] "vividly demonstrates the group's unassailable greatness and continued relevance", while Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone believed that [...] "in both delivery and content", A Tribe Called Quest [...] "maintain {{the attitude of the}} Bohemian everydude funkonauts that inspired Kanye West, Andre 3000 and Kendrick Lamar (who all appear here)". Robert Christgau hailed it as a [...] "triumph" [...] in his review for Vice, writing that the record [...] "represents both their bond and the conscious black humanism they felt sure the nation was ready for ... urging us <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{as much as we can}} as we achieve a happiness it's our duty to reaccess if we're to battle as all we can be." [...] In Spin, Brian Josephs praised how the group [...] "worked with the understanding that black music at its finest conversed with ancestry while pointing toward future possibilities in resistance against the racist forces that run parallel." [...] According to Michael Madden from Consequence of Sound, the album exhibits [...] "the classic Tribe sound: a warm and crisp confluence of East Coast hip-hop, jazz, and more, all mixed and mastered impeccably", while Clayton Purdom of The A.V. Club believed the music had more in common with Q-Tip's 2008 solo album The Renaissance than with the group's previous work; he called We got it from Here... "a sinuous sound collage pulling much more from ’90s and ’00s R than it does Native Tongues boom-bap". In The Observer, Kitty Empire wrote that [...] "as the album enters its final third, some focus is lost, but the first two-thirds take no prisoners either lyrically or musically." ...|$|E
