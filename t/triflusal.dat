40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} costs to the Spanish {{healthcare}} system of 35 days' treatment with <b>triflusal</b> (600 mg/day) and aspirin (300 mg/day) in patients with confirmed acute myocardial infarction within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. Design: A cost minimisation analysis {{based on the results}} of the <b>Triflusal</b> in Acute Myocardial Infarction study (TIM) was conducted. The hypothesis was that despite a higher acquisition cost of <b>triflusal,</b> savings would result because of differences in efficacy and safety outcome (non-fatal cerebrovascular event and haemorrhagic events). Diagnostic Related Groups were used as a proxy for determining hospital costs in Spain and the values were obtained from different sources and refer to year 2000 costs. Only direct medical costs were considered for the economic analysis. Results: Although the acquisition cost of <b>triflusal</b> was more expensive than that of aspirin, the cost of prevented events - non-fatal ischaemic cerebrovascular events and cerebral haemorrhages - entirely compensated for the cost of <b>triflusal.</b> The overall cost of treating patients with <b>triflusal,</b> compared with aspirin, represented a net saving of 28. 4 % per patient treated. Conclusion: Our study showed that <b>triflusal</b> is cost saving compared with aspirin in the treatment of the acute phase of myocardial infarction.

40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{efficacy}} of the antiplatelet agent <b>triflusal</b> for prevention of vascular events after stroke {{has been reported in}} a pilot study. However, {{there is a need to}} confirm those results in a larger study. Methods—We performed a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to test the {{efficacy of}} <b>triflusal</b> (600 mg/d) versus aspirin (325 mg/d) for prevention of vascular events in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (<b>Triflusal</b> versus Aspirin in Cerebral Infarction Prevention [TACIP]). We assessed a combined end point (incidence of nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, or vascular death) as well as the incidence of these events separately and the incidence of major hemorrhage. Results—Of 2113 patients, 1058 received <b>triflusal</b> and 1055 aspirin. The mean follow-up period was 30. 1 months. The incidence of combined end point (13. 1 % for <b>triflusal,</b> 12. 4 % for aspirin) as well the survival analysis (hazard ratio [HR] for <b>triflusal</b> versus aspirin, 1. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 85 to 1. 38) showed no differences between groups. The incidence of nonfatal stroke (HR, 1. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 82 to 1. 44), nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (HR, 0. 95; 95 % CI, 0. 46 to 1. 98,) and vascular death (HR, 1. 22; 95 % CI, 0. 75 to 1. 96) was also similar. A significantly higher incidence of major hemorrhages in the aspirin group was recorded (HR, 0. 48; 95 % CI, 0. 28 to 0. 82).

40|$|Background and Purpose—Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and {{the signal}} {{transducer}} and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) are important transcription factors regulating inflammatory mechanisms and the glial response to neural injury, determining lesion outcome. In {{this study we}} evaluate the ability of <b>triflusal</b> (2 -acetoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylbenzoic acid), an antiplatelet agent inhibitor of NF-kB activation, to improve lesion outcome after excitotoxic damage to the immature brain. Methods—Postnatal day 9 rats received an intracortical injection of the excitotoxin N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and oral administration of <b>triflusal</b> (30 mg/kg) either as 3 doses before NMDA injection (pretreatment) or as a single dose 8 hours after NMDA injection (posttreatment). After survival times of 10 and 24 hours, brains were processed for toluidine blue staining, tomato lectin histochemistry, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, NF-kB, and STAT 3 immunocytochemistry. Results—NMDA-lesioned animals that were not treated with <b>triflusal</b> showed activation of NF-kB in neuronal cells at first and in glial cells subsequently. Animals that received pretreatment with <b>triflusal</b> showed a strong downregulation of neuronal and glial NF-kB but a similar development of the glial response and an equivalent lesion volume compared with nontreated animals.

40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{derivatives}} of salicylate, 2 -hydroxy- 4 -trifluoromethylbenzoic acid (HTB) and 2 -acetoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylbenzoic acid (<b>triflusal),</b> on {{the expression of}} several proteins displaying pro-inflammatory activities the regulation of which is associated to the transcription factor NF-κB, was assayed in the human astrocytoma cell line 1321 N 1. Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activated NF-κB as judged from both the appearance of κB-binding activity in the nuclear extracts, the degradation of IκB proteins in the cell lysates, and the activation of IκB kinases using an immunocomplex kinase assay with glutathione S-transferase (GST) -IκB proteins as substrates. HTB up to 3 [*]mM did not inhibit the nuclear translocation of NK-κB/Rel proteins as judged from electrophoretic mobility-shift assays; however, HTB inhibited the degradation of IκBβ without significantly affecting the degradation of both IκBα and IκBε. In keeping with their inhibitory effect on IκBβ degradation in the cell lysates, both HTB and <b>triflusal</b> inhibited the phosphorylation of GST-IκBβ elicited by TNF-α, without affecting the phosphorylation of GST-IκBα. The effect of both HTB and <b>triflusal</b> on κB-dependent trans-activation was studied by assaying the expression of both cyclo-oxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1). HTB and <b>triflusal</b> inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the expression of COX- 2 and VCAM- 1 mRNA and the induction of COX- 2 protein at therapeutically relevant concentrations.

40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{derivatives}} of salicylate, 2 -hydroxy- 4 -trifluoromethylbenzoic acid (HTB) and 2 -acetoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylbenzoic acid (<b>triflusal),</b> on the activation of NF-κB elicited by tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was tested. The {{expression of the}} mRNA of vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) was studied {{as an example of}} a gene the expression of which is regulated by NF-κB. To extend these findings to other systems, the induction of nitric oxide synthase in rat adherent peritoneal macrophages was studied. Both HTB and <b>triflusal</b> were more potent than aspirin or salicylate as inhibitors of the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. The calculation of the IC 50 values showed ≈amp; 2 [*]mM for HTB, 4 [*]mM for aspirin and > 4 [*]mM for salicylate. Comparison of the potency of these compounds on VCAM- 1 mRNA expression showed complete inhibition by both <b>triflusal</b> and HTB at a concentration of 4 [*]mM whereas aspirin and salicylate produced only 36 – 43 % inhibition at the same concentration. Inhibition of NF-κB activation was also observed in rat peritoneal macrophages stimulated via their receptors for the Fc portion of the antibody molecule with IgG/ovalbumin immune complexes.

40|$|<b>Triflusal</b> is a {{platelet}} aggregation inhibitor chemically related to acetylsalicylic acid, {{which is used}} for the prevention and/or treatment of vascular thromboembolisms, which acts as a prodrug. Actually, after oral administration it is absorbed primarily in the small intestine, binds to plasma proteins (99 %) and is rapidly biotransformed in the liver into its deacetylated active metabolite 2 -hydroxy- 4 -trifluoromethylbenzoic acid (HTB). In healthy humans, the half-life of <b>triflusal</b> is ca. 0. 5 h, whereas for HTB it is ca. 35 h. From a pharmacological point of view, {{it is interesting to note}} that HTB is itself highly active as a platelet anti-aggregant agent. Indeed, studies on the clinical profile of both drug and metabolite have shown no significant differences between them. It has been evidenced that HTB displays ability to induce photoallergy in humans. This phenomenon involves a cell-mediated immune response, which is initiated by covalent binding of a light-activated photosensitizer (or a species derived therefrom) to a protein. In this context, small proteins like ubiquitin could be appropriate models for investigating covalent binding by means of MS/MS and peptide fingerprint analysis. In previous work, it was shown that HTB forms covalent photoadducts with isolated lysine. Interestingly, ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues that could be modified by a similar reaction. With this background, the aim of the present work is to explore adduct formation between the <b>triflusal</b> metabolite and ubiquitin as model protein upon sunlight irradiation, combining proteomic and photophysical (fluorescence and laser flash photolysis) techniques. Photophysical and proteomic analysis demonstrate monoadduct formation as the major outcome of the reaction. Interestingly, addition can take place at any of the -amino groups of the lysine residues of the protein and involves replacement of the trifluoromethyl moiety with a new amide function. This process can in principle occur with other trifluoroaromatic compounds and may be responsible for the appearance of undesired photoallergic side effects...|$|E

40|$|Background. Antiplatelet therapy plays {{a crucial}} role in the primary and {{secondary}} prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke / transient ischemic attacks (IS/TIA). Several antiplatelet agents are available. This review deals with the characteristics of particular antiplatelet agents as well as choice of antiplatelet treatment in various situations, based on the evidence and international recommendations. Methods. PubMed and Stroke Trials Registry on-line databases and the European Stroke Organisation Guidelines for Management of IS/TIA 2008 and update of the recommendations of the American Heart Association / American Stroke Association Council 2008 on Stroke were used. Results. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is the only antiplatelet drug used in primary prevention, mainly to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), but also in women aged 45 years or more and in some patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation to reduce risk of IS/TIA. In the secondary prevention of noncardioembolic IS/TIA, ASA in combination with long release dipyridamole (DIP) and clopidogrel (CLOP) alone are considered first choice therapies. The choice of the particular antiplatelet agent should be individualized according to the patient risk factor profiles and treatment tolerance.

40|$|ObjectivesThis trial {{evaluated}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} the combination of antiplatelet and moderate-intensity anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation associated with recognized risk factors or mitral stenosis. BackgroundWarfarin was more effective than aspirin in preventing stroke in these patients; combined therapy with low anticoagulant intensity was ineffective. Mitral stenosis patients were not investigated. MethodsWe performed a multicenter randomized trial in 1, 209 patients at risk. The intermediate-risk group included patients with risk factors or age > 60 years: 242 received the cyclooxygenase inhibitor <b>triflusal,</b> 237 received acenocumarol, and 235 received a combination of both. The high-risk group included patients with prior embolism or mitral stenosis: 259 received anticoagulants and 236 received the combined therapy. Median follow-up was 2. 76 years. Primary outcome was a composite of vascular death and nonfatal stroke or systemic embolism. ResultsPrimary outcome was lower in the combined therapy than in the anticoagulant arm in both the intermediate- (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 33 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 12 to 0. 91]; p = 0. 02) and the high-risk group (HR 0. 51 [95 % CI 0. 27 to 0. 96]; p = 0. 03). Primary outcome plus severe bleeding was lower with combined therapy in the intermediate-risk group. Nonvalvular and mitral stenosis patients had similar embolic event rates during anticoagulant therapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke risk {{increases}} with age {{in patients who}} have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. It is uncertain whether the efficacy of stroke prevention therapies in atrial fibrillation changes as patients age. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of age on the relative efficacy of oral anticoagulants (OAC) and antiplatelet (AP) therapy (including acetylsalicylic acid and <b>triflusal)</b> on ischemic stroke, serious bleeding, and vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: This is an analysis of the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators database, which contains patient level-data from randomized trials of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. We used Cox regression models with age as a continuous variable that controlled for sex, year of randomization, and history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Outcomes included ischemic stroke, serious bleeding (intracranial hemorrhage or systemic bleeding requiring hospitalization, transfusion, or surgery), and cardiovascular events (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, or vascular death). RESULTS: The analysis included 8932 patients and 17 685 years of observation from 12 trials. Patient age increased risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio per decade increase 1. 45; 95 % CI, 1. 26 to 1. 66), serious bleeding (1. 61; 1. 47 to 1. 77), and cardiovascular events (1. 43; 1. 33 to 1. 53). Compared with placebo, OAC and AP significantly reduced the risk of ischemic stroke (OAC, 0. 36; 0. 29 to 0. 45; AP, 0. 81; 0. 72 to 0. 90) and cardiovascular outcomes (OAC, 0. 59; 0. 52 to 0. 66; AP, 0. 81; 0. 75 to 0. 88), whereas OAC increased risk of serious bleeding (1. 56; 1. 03 to 2. 37). The relative benefit of OAC versus placebo or AP did not vary by patient age for any outcome. Compared with placebo, the relative benefit of AP for preventing ischemic stroke decreased significantly as patients aged (P= 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: As patients with atrial fibrillation age, the relative efficacy of AP to prevent ischemic stroke appears to decrease, whereas it does not change for OAC. Because stroke risk {{increases with}} age, the absolute benefit of OAC increases as patients get older...|$|E
30|$|The {{advent of}} DES {{technology}} has brought its advantages {{to overcome the}} conventional limitations of BMS. Despite DES’s dramatic influence on clinical practice in vascular intervention, the incomplete endothelialization and hypersensitivity reactions to the polymer coating were major subjects of debate over the risk of implantation (Grabow et al. 2010). All drawbacks caused the first-generation DES to fail. Late thrombosis and delayed healing were two potential risks associating {{with the use of}} DES. Furthermore, their long-term efficiency was questionable since their coating material was not biodegradable and reports of hypersensitivity to DES implantation were reported (Farb et al. 2003; Joner et al. 2006; Lanzer et al. 2008; Nebeker et al. 2006; Virmani et al. 2004 a, b). The long-term presence of non-biodegradable materials in stents leads to late complications such as thrombosis, neointimial hyperplasia, and chronic inflammation (Jiang et al. 2017). It was evident that the newly improved version should have the polymer coating with higher biocompatibility and probable degradability with improved pharmacologic action (Grabow et al. 2010). To circumvent the problems associated with durable polymer-coated DES, the modified second-generation DES made use of biodegradable polymer to enhance the clinical performance. This new treatment has the following properties: (1) the ability to deliver greater amounts of drug {{over a longer period of}} time, (2) the ability to prepare a suitable framework for loading various drugs if necessary, and (3) the ability to overcome unfavorable effects of stenting (Kohn and Zeltinger 2005; Tanguay et al. 1994). Van der Giessen et al. (1992) published their pioneering experimental studies of implanting non-biodegradable polyethylene-terephthalate braided mesh stent in animal models. The first trial for creating a biodegradable scaffold started later in 1996 when the efficiency of five different biodegradable polymers consisting poly(glycolic acid)/poly(lactic acid) PGA/PLA copolymer, poly(caprolactone) (PCL), polyhydroxybutyrate/valerate copolymer, poly(ortho ester), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)/poly(butylene terephthalate) as coaters of Wiktor stent was studied for the implantation in animal models (Hårdhammar et al. 1996). The results, however, were not satisfactory to the group and were failed. The primitive clinical trial for biodegrdable failed due to the adverse effects of thrombosis, moderate intimal hyperplasia, and inflammatory response. Lack of manufacturing the engineered polymer for inhibiting inflammation and restenosis led the project to this failure (Garg and Serruys 2010; Van Der Giessen et al. 1996). A fundamental prerequisite for long-term survival of biomaterials is that these materials are compatible with physiological condition, i.e., a successful healing process necessitates not only utilizing biomaterials that is compatible with the host immune system, but also having a profound understanding of the host immune response towards implanted biomaterials (Franz et al. 2011). Later, Lincoff et al. (1997) took advantage of high-molecular weight poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) (321  kDa) for stent coating, and they compared the results with the low-molecular-weight (80  kDa) in a porcine model. The results proved the intense inflammatory neointimal hyperplasia within low-molecular-weight PLLA, while no major adverse effect was reported with high-molecular-weight PLLA. Yamawaki et al. (1998) reported the first successful outcome from the animal model. The contribution of permanent polymer coating in increasing the adverse effects of DES implantation such as delayed healing, late ST, local hypersensitivity reaction, and ISR was confirmed by Busch et al. (2014). Two biostable polymers used for drug-eluting stents, namely PEVA and PBMA, and four biodegradable polymers from the polyesters group, namely PLLA, poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate), poly(4 -hydroxybutyrate) (P(4 HB)), and a polymeric blend of PLLA/P(4 HB) in a ratio of 78 / 22 % (w/w) were chosen for comparison. The material-dependent endothelialization, SMC growth, and thrombogenicity were proved by in vitro tests conducted through cultivating human umbilical venous endothelial cells, human coronary arterial endothelial cells, and human coronary arterial SMCs on the surface of these polymers (Busch et al. 2014). Biodegradation implies the dispersion of polymeric materials as a consequence of macromolecular degradation (Generali et al. 2014; Vert 1989; Vert et al. 1992). Degradation is to be used for those ex vivo mechanisms, whereas biodegradation is restricted to all in vivo mechanism mediated in cells (Onuma and Serruys 2011; Vert 2009). PLA and PGA are of two most ubiquitous polymers that have been exploited in the second-generation DES. Huang et al. (2010) reported promising clinical results on their patented stent (Venkatraman et al. 2008). This is a dual drug-eluting stent (DDES) with two pharmaceutical drugs: one acts as an anti-proliferative (sirolimus) and the other acts as an anti-thrombotic (<b>triflusal).</b> Drugs were loaded in the biodegradable polymer matrix contributing together as coating layers on a CoCr stent. In this study, poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PDLGA) was employed as a drug carrier for its known properties of biocompatibility, biodegradability, and good mechanical strength (Huang et al. 2010). This 2 -layered dual-drug-coated stent was prepared by spray coating a biodegradable polymer loaded with dual drugs on the metallic frame. The presence of <b>triflusal</b> as a drug agent in the polymer accelerated the polymer breakdown. The in vivo results showed promising results from the combination of two drugs on the stent surface in comparison to a bare metal stent, a sirolimus-coated polymer-coated stent, and a pure polymer-coated stent (controls) (Huang et al. 2010). Problems with using polymers as an outer layer of stent have been reported as well. First, the expansion of the stent during deployment may expose the polymer on the outer layer to great amounts of stress that leads to mechanical damage such as cracks, waviness, depressions, and peeling as reported by others (Basalus et al. 2009; Basalus et al. 2012; Otsuka et al. 2007; Wiemer et al. 2010). Second, there might be inflammatory and hypersensitivity reactions of body immune system to some polymers. Biodegradation does not necessarily mean that no sensitivity would not happen as van Beuskeom et al. (2000) have found. They reported the extensive inflammatory responses of these polymers and their fibrocellular proliferation except for poly(metacryloyl phosphorylcholine lauryl methacrylate). Further in a study by van der Giessen et al. (1992), they undertook a comparative study for the rate of thrombosis and neointimal formation in synthetic biodegradable poly (methyl methacrylate) coated and uncoated stainless steel-based stents in animal models (Guildford et al. 2010). Finally, polymers may delay the growth of vascular endothelial cells (Lancaster et al. 2012); all disadvantages that further led to the idea of polymer-free stents (Hu et al. 2015). Further improvement on the performance of DESs will require the well-selected polymer coating matrices with the properties of degradability and low inflammatory response during polymer degradation to allow a quick and complete DES endothelialization (Guildford et al. 2010).|$|E
