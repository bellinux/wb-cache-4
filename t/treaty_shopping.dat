40|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years, {{the world has}} {{experienced}} exponential growth in international trade and investment, {{as well as the}} number of bilateral tax treaties which now number roughly 3, 000. As the globalization of economic activity has greatly increased opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, so also has the expansion of the international tax treaty network increased opportunities for taxpayers to take advantage of domestic tax rules and bilateral tax treaties by arranging their affairs in ways that reduce taxes otherwise owing or eliminate them altogether. Regarding many of these arrangements as abusive <b>treaty</b> <b>shopping,</b> the OECD and several member jurisdictions have adopted various responses to this phenomenon, involving the interpretation of treaties as the well as the introduction and application of anti-avoidance rules in domestic law and tax treaties.

The current criteria tin qualifying as a headquarter company is addressed in terms of Section 80 A of the Income Tax Act, which also addresses the draw backs and restrictions which as a result South Africa has not received any applications by companies in becoming a headquarter company. A comparison is drawn between South Africa's headquarter regime versus a well - known popular tax haven country namely Mauritius. A comparison is performed on both the qualification in becoming headquarter companies {{as well as the}} tax benefits thereto which encourage investment. From the comparison, it is clear that Mauritius provides a more favourable environment {{for the establishment of a}} headquarter regime based on the ease of qualification as a headquarter company, the corporate tax rate is low to none and it has no CGT, dividends withholding tax, and interest withholding tax, transfer pricing and thin capitalisation, exchange control and finally CFC rules.

Research paper 2 (Local tax) Is customer loyalty programmes capital or revenue of nature? The general gross income definition is defined as ' [...] . the total amount, in cash or otherwise, received by or accrued to in favour of such resident during such year or period of assessment, excluding receipts or accruals of a capital nature [...] . ' The research problem is extracted from the general gross income definition. The research problem is based on the fourth element of the general gross income definition, namely, whether the transaction is of revenue or a capital nature. In formulating an answer to our research problem, being the last element of the general gross income definition, we look at case law handling the test applied by courts on revenue versus capital applications. The test laid down, deals with the intention, duration, nature and frequency of the customer loyalty programme being of a revenue or capital nature. In terms of the general gross income definition, all elements except the last element, being, the transaction must be of a capital nature, are met. As all the elements of the general gross income definition are not met, the rewards from a customer loyalty programme should not be taxable in the hands of th e customer. However, capital gains tax consequences can be dealt with as the reward received as part of the customer loyalty programme is of a capital nature. If for some reason, SARS proves that a customer embarked in a customer loyalty programme as part of a scheme to make profits and therefore he should be taxed on the reward, the onus SARS having to collect monies from taxpayers would far exceed the monies received. And in most cases, majority of the active users of a customer loyalty programme would be below the submission of tax return threshold.

40|$|Abstract: On 5 October 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) {{released}} the final {{package of measures}} to reform the international tax system under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. The BEPS project pursued 15 Action Items that concerned {{a broad range of}} international tax topics, centered around three themes: coherence, substance, and transparency and certainty. The Action Plan to implement the BEPS project seeks to align taxation with economic activity and ensure that taxable profits cannot be artificially shifted. Action Item 6 of the Action Plan identifies treaty abuse (particularly, <b>treaty</b> <b>shopping)</b> as a principal source of concern because it enables taxpayers to gain access to tax treaty benefits in situations where the benefits were not intended. This Comment reviews the results of the finished BEPS project, specifically focusing on Action Item 6. I find that the BEPS project made remarkable progress considering the scope and complexity of the undertaking, as well as the political and corporate interests involved. While the efforts of the OECD have been impressive in scope, ambition, and the ability to find common ground on this issue, the results of the BEPS project thus far are insufficient to truly address the problem identified in Action Item 6. Moreover, significant challenges await the OECD before it can achieve the goal that it established for this effort...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} means by which tax {{authorities}} worldwide seek to strengthen their tax treaties, through safeguards of varying nature and scope, in order to identify and prevent what they consider to be abuse of such treaties. These means of challenge may be grouped under two headings: purposive approaches to treaty interpretation, particularly with respect to the terms 'person', 'resident' and 'beneficial ownership'; and broader responses to unacceptable tax avoidance, specifically reliance on treaty anti-abuse principles and domestic anti-avoidance rules. The Canadian response is evinced by two recent cases in which the government unsuccessfully challenged 'treaty shopping' arrangements, MIL (Investments) SA v Canada and Prevost Car Inc v Canada. Building on the existing literature regarding tax <b>treaty</b> <b>shopping</b> and other forms of tax treaty abuse, this work seeks not only to describe and explain the responses to treaty abuse but to make a critical inquiry into the essence of such abuse, particularly as it appears to be viewed by the Canadian revenue authorities. It is argued that the Canadian response to tax treaty abuse is inadequate, largely because it conflates multiple approaches and fails to address a key concern: the existence or lack of genuine economic establishment in the treaty state. The paper concludes with some suggestions for fashioning a more coherent and intellectually honest response to tax treaty abuse. ...|$|E

40|$|The United States is {{generally}} a tax haven for foreign portfolio investors: the United States exempts from tax most U. S. source interest and capital gains, but taxes dividends from U. S. companies; tax treaties generally eliminate U. S. tax on interest {{and reduce the}} 30 % statutory rate on dividends. Foreign investors in U. S. mutual funds have not been treated as favorably. Fund distributions (other than of net capital gains) were originally treated as taxable dividends, regardless of the fund’s underlying income. Interest or short-term capital gains earned by the mutual fund — {{which would have been}} tax exempt if directly earned by a foreign investor — were converted into taxable dividend income when distributed. To encourage foreign investment in U. S. mutual funds, Congress in 2004 modified the mutual fund distribution rules to exempt from tax fund dividends that are attributable to the fund’s U. S. source interest income or short-term capital gains. The stated goal of the legislation was to tax foreign investors on the same basis as if they had directly earned their share of a fund’s income. These provisions fail to fully achieve this goal by denying pass-through treatment for foreign source interest and dividends. This policy appears to be aimed at preventing foreign investors from using a U. S. mutual fund to obtain U. S. treaty benefits. Foreign source income should retain its source and character when distributed to foreign shareholders. This tax treatment is consistent with the tax results a foreign investor realizes when he or she invests directly or through a partnership and encourages foreign investment in mutual funds that invest globally. The <b>treaty</b> <b>shopping</b> concerns may be illusory. To address potential treaty abuse, Congress could consider limiting the pass- through of foreign source income to treaty residents...|$|E

The importance, as well as the various forms such issues take, has recently been highlighted in the decision of the Singapore High Court (SGHC) in Laos v. Sanum. In this case, the SGHC was asked by Laos to set aside an earlier arbitral award (in Sanum v. Laos), filed by a Macanese legal entity and rendered under the China-Laos bilateral investment treaty (BIT). In approaching the matter, the SGHC set aside the award {{on the grounds that the}} China-Laos BIT did not extend to Macao. This decision has provoked mixed feelings, as it may weigh heavily against the territorial application of Chinese IIAs to Hong Kong and Macao.

Within this setting, this article seeks to provide a conceptual framework for analyzing future investor-state arbitration disputes under IIAs where similar territorial application issues may arise.

The concept of beneficial owner {{in the double}} tax treaties, although not expressly defined, is a requirement for the treaty entitlement of persons receiving income from dividends, interest and royalties. This study aims at analyzing the criteria for the definition of its meaning within the double tax treaties that adopt the OECD Model Convention, also examining the limits and implications of this concept to Contracting States. The purpose of the Introduction is to define {{the scope of the}} object of study and, also, to present certain didactic considerations about international tax law, the area to which this work is related. In Chapter I, the origin of the term beneficial owner is analyzed. The main element therein is its relationship with the attributes of property law under the domestic laws of the common law countries, where it was created. Additionally, we will proceed the comparison with the legal treatment of this expression in the internal law of the civil law countries and, specifically, in the Brazilian law. Chapter II deals with the analysis of the interpretation rules of the double tax treaties and on which way they act on the construction of the meaning of terms not defined on its text. For this purpose, the several instruments that constitute the context of the tax treaties will be analyzed, as well as the relation of the other instruments that may help in the interpretation process, demonstrating the requirements for the interpretative remittance of the term through domestic law of the Contracting States. On Chapter III, the different forms and criteria for the interpretation of the term will be examined. Also, we will analyze the treatment of the subject on OECD MC and Commentaries, its relevance and scope in the fight against <b>treaty</b> <b>shopping</b> and the current international jurisprudence.

40|$|This paper assesses whether, {{and to what}} extent, the OECD's recent {{initiative}} on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) is likely to affect holding company structures commonly used by Finnish tax planners. Building on the OECD’s previous “harmful tax planning” initiatives released around the millennium, the BEPS initiative is a political instrument aiming to curb cross-border tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs) through 15 specific action points targeting such tax-related areas as CFC rules, <b>treaty</b> <b>shopping,</b> hybrid financing, interest deductions, permanent establishment (PE) avoidance, transfer pricing (TP), and exchange of tax information. Since its release in 2013, the BEPS initiative has received {{a great deal of}} political support by governments and lots of attention by diverse interest groups. Many commentaries on and analyses of the initiative, mostly by tax consultant firms, have already been released, but despite the attention, no academic research on the subject has yet been conducted from a Finnish perspective. This paper attempts to fill that gap. The importance of the research is obvious for both governments and MNEs, since tax planning is an economically significant field for both of these stakeholders, and thus any impact on the scope of possible tax planning structures is worth our attention. Methodologically, I have tackled the research problem by focusing on both political and legal factors. Surveying a wide range of expert commentaries, analyses and political declarations, I have first analysed the political momentum behind the BEPS initiative as a whole and the likelihood of each specific action point to be enacted in domestic legislation or through international treaties affecting tax planning. I have also looked at the BEPS initiative in a historical context of the OECD’s earlier post-millennium initiatives, assessing how the former’s global reception differs, or is likely to differ, from that of the latter. After the political analysis, the focus of the paper shifts to actual Finnish holding company structures presented in Finnish guidebooks and training material on tax-efficient corporate structures. In this part of the paper, I assess the likelihood of five specific commonly used Finnish holding company structures to be affected by the BEPS action points. The findings of this paper suggest that the BEPS initiative is almost certain {{to have an impact on}} holding company structures in some areas; that in others, political potential is considerable but lots of technical and problems still remain; and that many BEPS action points are either not at all relevant to holding companies or unlikely to affect them for other reasons. Politically, the OECD’s most potent proposals are those on transfer pricing (action points 8 to 10) and tax information exchange (action points 11 to 13), although the latter will only affect holding company structures indirectly. Another action that seems likely to be enacted in legislation is the BEPS action point 2 on hybrid mismatches, mainly because of a recent EU proposal against tax avoidance relying on hybrid financing. However, the findings of this paper suggest that even though some other actions, particularly action 4 on interest-stripping and action point 6 on <b>treaty</b> <b>shopping,</b> enjoy a lot of political support, there are still significant unsolved political and technical problems on these fronts. Finally, this paper’s analysis on specific Finnish holding company structures suggests that the Finnish structures most likely to be affected by the OECD’s proposals are those relying on tax rate shopping (“capitalisation on tax rate differences”) and hybrid mismatches (“re-characterisation of income”). In particular, the former is likely to be affected by the OECD’s current thinking on transfer pricing and its “important people” doctrine, while the latter has a fair change of being affected, for example, by the OECD’s proposal against hybrid mismatches, at least if the EU’s current efforts in this area are successful...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{discoveries of}} natural gas in Tanzania, {{estimated}} at about fifty-seven trillion cubic feet (tcf), have sparked tremendous hopes for socio-economic development in the country. While this optimism seems to be supported by conventional wisdom and economic insights, evidence from other oil-rich African countries shows {{that in spite of}} the ongoing oil and gas extraction, they are floundering in poverty, corruption and political instability. This phenomenal dichotomy between oil and gas wealth and socioeconomic development {{is referred to as the}} "resource curse". As this study demonstrates, the "curse" is partly a result of under-taxation. This study uses the resource curse study to analyze and evaluate tax-related challenges in the Tanzanian upstream oil and gas industry. In doing so, the study identifies three factors that may cause loss of potential tax revenues - referred to as "tax revenue leakage". First, the discretionary tax incentives, such as tax exemptions, lowering tax rates and special tax treatment, result in non-payment of taxes that would have otherwise been payable. Second, the International Oil Companies (IOCs) adopt a variety of techniques, such as transfer pricing, thin capitalization, corporate re-organization tax evasion and <b>treaty</b> <b>shopping</b> to exploit the loopholes or gaps in the tax laws to minimize, reduce or eliminate their tax obligations without being detected or punished. Third, corrupt Government officials willfully fail to collect taxes due, short levy taxes, grant undeserving tax incentives to the IOCs or divert revenues collected for their own account. All these factors demonstrate the close connection between under-taxation, corruption and tax avoidance. As this study argues, in the absence of counteractive measures, the Government will collect only a fraction of potential taxes, thus losing revenues required to finance development projects. The study establishes that Tanzania counteracts tax avoidance and tax evasion through anti-avoidance legislation. Tanzania also has accountability measures, which impose restraints on the exercise of public power and prevent corruption. The study concludes that although Tanzania has a competitive fiscal regime, anti-avoidance legislation and systems of accountability, the level of Government's tax revenue nevertheless depends on institutional capacity to detect, prevent and penalize tax avoidance schemes and corruption...|$|E
40|$|The {{core of this}} {{dissertation}} analyses the compatibility of {{the limitation}} on benefits (LOB) clause in European Community (EC) Member State tax treaties with the United States (US) with EC law. This dissertation argues that the LOB clause is generally incompatible with the fundamental freedoms in the EC Treaty. In order to adequately remove the defects of the LOB clause, any anti-treaty shopping clause {{should be based on}} the theory of economic allegiance and should accurately assess a corporate taxpayer’s economic attachment to a contracting State. The most appropriate method to assess this economic attachment is to develop subjective economic criteria based on the theory of formulary apportionment. The LOB clause has a number of obtrusive defects in both its goal and its compatibility with the aims and objectives of a community of States such as the EC. This dissertation focuses {{on the question of whether}} the LOB clause is compatible with the fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty. Answering this question involves considering complex legal issues in EC law such as the internal and external scope of EC law, the concept of an economic activity, the evolution of EC law and the exercise of discrimination by a non-Member State. This dissertation claims that EC law has not yet evolved to a stage where it will apply to a situation lacking a cross-border intra-Community economic activity. Consequently, a Member State may appropriately exclude certain non-active corporate residents from the benefits of its double tax treaties without infringing its obligations under the EC Treaty. This dissertation also evaluates the potential liability in damages of the Member States for concluding a tax treaty with the US that includes a LOB clause. This dissertation claims that the Member States will not be found liable for including the clause in their tax treaties due to the lack of incentive for a taxpayer to challenge the clause, and further due to the inability of a taxpayer to establish causation in any claim for damages. The LOB clause is a creature of bilateral tax treaties. The US government developed the clause in an aim to restrict <b>treaty</b> <b>shopping,</b> reduce the erosion of it tax base and preserve its balance of payments as the economic position of the US changed substantially from the 1960 s to the 1980 s. This significant economic change prompted the US Treasury Department to develop the LOB clause in its modern form. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The OECD Model Tax Convention {{contains}} a beneficial owner {{requirement for the}} taxation of dividend, interest and royalty income. The purpose of the requirement is to prevent improper use of tax treaties, and consequently counteract abusive <b>treaty</b> <b>shopping</b> structures that aim at gaining tax treaty benefits that would not otherwise be achievable. As the beneficial owner requirement {{is included in the}} OECD Model Tax Convention, it is consequently included in tax treaties that are concluded by Member States of the European Union. From the perspective of the EU law, the requirement may, however, constitute as a restriction on free movement. As there is not significant harmonization of direct taxation within the European Union, nationals of Member States are able to use the different tax systems of different Member States to minimize their tax burden by exercising the freedom of establishment. The structures that make use of the disparities in the national tax systems of Member States can be view as abusive on national level, but they may be protected by the fundamental freedoms that the EU treaties provide for. Therefore, anti-abusive legislation that a Member State has introduced may create a restriction on free movement. The freedom of establishment ensures that a national of a Member States has the right to move freely within the EU without being subject to excessive measures, which are not applied in purely domestic but comparable situations. This gives an EU national the possibility to choose to establish an entity in a Member State where the taxation of dividend, interest and royalty income on source is most favourable for the tax payer. However, in order to invoke the freedom of establishment, the company in question must pursuit effective and genuine economic activities in the state of establishment. This thesis examines whether the structures that are used by Member State nationals to gain tax treaty benefits are protected by the EU law, and if the application of the beneficial ownership concept that is included in the tax treaties that are concluded between different Member States, is in fact against EU law, and particularly against the freedom of establishment. Furthermore, the thesis examines the potential justifications for the restriction that the beneficial ownership requirement might create on the freedom of establishment. The thesis aims to conclude how the beneficial ownership provisions in tax treaties should be interpreted so that the interpretation is essentially in compliance with EU law. When examining the case law of the European Court of Justice, it seems evident that the beneficial owner requirement can create a restriction on the freedom of establishment. Nevertheless, this restriction may be justified, to some extent, by the necessity to prevent tax avoidance. The European Court of Justice has developed in its practice a doctrine of abuse, under which the Member States are allowed to introduce national anti-abuse legislation to counteract tax avoidance. It is established in the case law of the European Court of Justice that while national anti-abusive legislation may create a restriction on the freedom of establishment, the restriction may be justified on the grounds of prevention of abusive practices. The national anti-abusive legislation must be, however, designed exclusively to prevent the use of wholly artificial arrangements, and therefore establishments that entail effective and genuine economic activities cannot be excluded from obtaining tax treaty benefits. Consequently, the beneficial owner requirement must be applied in such manner that it only excludes purely artificial arrangement from attaining the benefits of a tax treaty...|$|E
