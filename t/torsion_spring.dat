25|$|The {{torsion balance}} {{consists}} of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak <b>torsion</b> <b>spring.</b> In Coulomb's experiment, the torsion balance was an insulating rod with a metal-coated ball attached to one end, suspended by a silk thread. The ball was charged with a known charge of static electricity, and a second charged ball of the same polarity was brought near it. The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber through a certain angle, which could be read from a scale on the instrument. By knowing how much force it took to twist the fiber through a given angle, Coulomb was able to calculate the force between the balls and derive his inverse-square proportionality law.|$|E

5000|$|A torsion {{pendulum}} clock, or torsion clock (also known as 400-day or anniversary clock), is a mechanical clock which keeps {{time with a}} mechanism called a {{torsion pendulum}}. This is a weighted disk or wheel, often a decorative wheel with 3 or 4 chrome balls on ornate spokes, suspended by a thin wire or ribbon called a <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> (also known as [...] "suspension spring"). The torsion pendulum rotates about the vertical axis of the wire, twisting it, instead of swinging like an ordinary pendulum. The force of the twisting <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> reverses the direction of rotation, so the torsion pendulum oscillates slowly, clockwise and counterclockwise. The clock's gears apply a pulse of torque {{to the top of}} the <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> with each rotation to keep the wheel going. The wheel and <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> function similarly to a watch's balance wheel and hairspring, as a harmonic oscillator to control the rate of the clock's hands.|$|E

A Genetic Algorithm (GA) based algorithm was developed for finding the energy optimal trajectory during gait by comparing all the possible trajectories. It is first proved that addition of <b>torsion</b> <b>springs</b> at the joints lead to reduction of energy consumption as compared to a biped with no springs. All the gait parameters were then optimized to get the optimum values for the spring constants at each joint, reference angle of springs and length of each step.

50|$|A <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> is {{a spring}} that works by torsion or twisting; that is, a {{flexible}} elastic object that stores mechanical energy {{when it is}} twisted. When it is twisted, it exerts a force (actually torque) in the opposite direction, proportional to the amount (angle) it is twisted. There are two types. A torsion bar is a straight bar of metal or rubber that is subjected to twisting (shear stress) about its axis by torque applied at its ends. A more delicate form used in sensitive instruments, called a torsion fiber consists of a fiber of silk, glass, or quartz under tension, that is twisted about its axis. The other type, a helical <b>torsion</b> <b>spring,</b> is a metal rod or wire {{in the shape of}} a helix (coil) that is subjected to twisting about the axis of the coil by sideways forces (bending moments) applied to its ends, twisting the coil tighter. This terminology can be confusing because in a helical <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> the forces acting on the wire are actually bending stresses, not torsional (shear) stresses.|$|E

5000|$|One {{oscillation}} of the {{torsion pendulum}} usually takes 12, 15, or 20 seconds.

A crutch device {{at the top of}} the <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> engages a lever with two anchor-shaped arms; the arms in turn alternately engage the teeth of the escape wheel. As the anchor releases a tooth of the escape wheel, the lever, which is fixed to the anchor, moves to one side and, via the crutch, gives a small twist to the top of the <b>torsion</b> <b>spring.</b> This is just enough to keep the oscillation going.|$|E
