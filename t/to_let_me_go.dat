500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Ten were completed in May 1991. Krusen left the band once the sessions were completed, checking himself into rehabilitation. According to Krusen, {{he was suffering}} from personal problems at the time. Krusen said, [...] "It was a great experience. I felt from the beginning of that band that it was something special," [...] and added, [...] "They had <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go.</b> I couldn't stop drinking, and it was causing problems. They gave me many chances, but I couldn't get it together." [...] In June, the band joined Tim Palmer in England for mixing. Palmer decided to mix the album at Ridge Farm Studios in Dorking, a converted farm that according to Palmer was [...] "about as far away from an L.A. or New York studio as you can get." [...] Palmer made a few additions to the already-recorded songs, including having McCready finish up the guitar solo on [...] "Alive" [...] and tweaking the intro to [...] "Black". Palmer overdubbed a pepper shaker and a fire extinguisher as percussion on [...] "Oceans".|$|E
2500|$|Ashby {{promoted}} Michael Chapman, {{his camera}} operator on The Landlord, [...] to director of photography. They {{worked together to}} create a specific look for the film that involved using natural light to create a realistic, documentary-style. Ashby let Nicholson look through the camera's viewfinder as a shot was being set up so he knew the parameters of a given scene and how much freedom he had within the frame. The actor said, [...] "Hal is the first director <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go,</b> to let me find my own level".|$|E
2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Captain," [...] said Ralph, [...] "I {{suppose you}} will not now object <b>to</b> <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> {{in the morning to}} explore that opening. I can walk across the bottom of the lake without any danger, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come! you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go!" [...] muttered the boy, struggling, and {{clenching}} his teeth. [...] "I've {{done nothing}} <b>to</b> you. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go,</b> will you, <b>to</b> the woman!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He thought I was sick. He worked over me. He gave me medicine. And then he prayed. I saw him, in the dark, on his knees, {{praying for}} me. That seemed strange. Yet he was kind, so kind that I begged him <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go.</b> I {{was not a}} Mormon. I couldn't marry him. I begged him <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
6000|$|My {{heart was}} sick for poor Cecile. 'My brother-in-law!' I said. 'Oh, Mademoiselle, I entreat of you <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> to his aid.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say," [...] said Mike gratefully, [...] "it {{was most}} awfully decent of you getting Burgess <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> in. It was simply ripping of you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{waste the}} {{precious}} time," [...] he said. [...] "Don't leave her cruelly to herself. If you can't <b>go</b> <b>to</b> her, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> as your messenger, in your place." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Miss Amy, pray! Will {{you have}} the {{goodness}} to stop a moment? Miss Amy, if it comes <b>to</b> that, <b>let</b> <b>ME</b> <b>go.</b> I shall go out of my senses, if I {{have to think that}} I have driven you away like this.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The most tragic {{woman is}} cowed by a tragic man, and {{although}} Boldwood was, in vehemence and glow, nearly her own self rendered into another sex, Bathsheba's cheek quivered.

6000|$|... "Oh! my Prince, my Prince," [...] I said, [...] "I pray you <b>to</b> dismiss <b>me.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> {{anywhere}} out of {{the reach}} of her Highness's tongue." ...|$|R

6000|$|The nearer Wetherford came to {{the actual}} meeting with his wife the more he shook. At last he stopped in the road. [...] "I don't believe I can do it," [...] he declared. [...] "I'll be like a ghost to her. What's the use of it? She'll only be worried by my story. I reckon I'd better keep dark <b>to</b> everybody. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> back.
