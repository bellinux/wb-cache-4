2500|$|Although AM {{was used}} in a few crude {{experiments}} in multiplex telegraph and <b>telephone</b> <b>transmission</b> in the late 1800s, the practical development of amplitude modulation is synonymous with the development between 1900 and 1920 of [...] "radiotelephone" [...] transmission, that is, the effort to send sound (audio) by radio waves. [...] The first radio transmitters, called spark gap transmitters, transmitted information by wireless telegraphy, using different length pulses of carrier wave to spell out text messages in Morse code. [...] They couldn't transmit audio because the carrier consisted of strings of damped waves, pulses of radio waves that declined to zero, {{that sounded like a}} buzz in receivers. [...] In effect they were already amplitude modulated.|$|E

2500|$|Much like Austria, the Nazis {{set their}} {{sights on the}} Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia, a region with over three-million ethnic Germans which they wanted to {{incorporate}} into the Reich; more than that, Hitler once told his generals that he desired for Czechoslovakia to [...] "disappear from the map". In the summer of 1938, the Gestapo and SD-Ausland, which had taken control of the Secret Service in Czechoslovakia, helped the Sudeten Nazis from the Sudetendeutsche Partei infiltrate regional and local organizations, veterans groups, musical societies, sporting associations, sailing clubs, and cultural societies—which gave them insight into the economic, political, and military situation there. So thorough was the Nazi penetration {{in much of the}} Sudetenland, that Schellenberg stated later it was necessary to establish two <b>telephone</b> <b>transmission</b> stations along the frontier to communicate with Berlin. Eventually after strained negotiations with the West, Hitler acquired the Sudetenland when the Munich Agreement was concluded. Following this event, Schellenberg accompanied Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich into Prague on 15 March 1939 and reported that Himmler was so pleased with the performance and racial makeup of the Czech police, that he incorporated them into the SS.|$|E

5000|$|Campbell {{discussed}} lattice filters in {{his article}} of 1922, while other early workers {{with an interest in}} the lattice included Johnson and Bartlett. [...] Zobel's article on filter theory and design, published at about this time, mentioned lattices only briefly, with his main emphasis on ladder networks. It was only later, when Zobel considered the simulation and equalisation of <b>telephone</b> <b>transmission</b> lines, that he gave the lattice configuration more attention. [...] (The <b>telephone</b> <b>transmission</b> lines of the time had a balanced-pair configuration with a nominal characteristic impedance of 600 ohms, so the lattice equaliser, with its balanced structure, was particularly appropriate for use with them). Later workers, especially Hendrik Wade Bode, gave greater prominence to lattice networks in their filter designs.|$|E

While {{trying to track}} down a source of electrical interference on <b>telephone</b> <b>transmissions,</b> Karl Guthe Jansky of Bell Telephone Laboratories discovered radio waves emanating from stars in outer space while investigating static that interfered with short wave transatlantic voice transmissions. Thus, the field of radio astronomy was born.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Some {{preliminary}} {{comparisons between}} different loudness loss estimation methods for <b>telephone</b> network <b>transmission</b> planning are presented (sidetone algorithms are not treated, however). The methods discussed are {{all based on}} objective measurements on <b>telephone</b> instruments. The <b>transmission</b> planner has some basic requirements: 1) to obtain a meaningful and reliable indication of the <b>telephone</b> speech <b>transmission</b> quality as regards the acoustic loss between the talking subscriber's mouth and the listening subscriber's ear; 2) to characterize the individual parts of a connection by numerical values {{in such a way}} that their sum equals the acoustic loss measure of the complete connection; 3) to ensure that the numerical values can be determined reliably, inexpensively and with sufficient accuracy from measurements.

50|$|Error {{correction}} adds extra {{data bits}} {{to make the}} transmission of data more robust to disturbances present on the transmission channel. The ordinary user {{may not be aware}} of many applications using error correction. A typical music CD uses the Reed-Solomon code to correct for scratches and dust. In this application the transmission channel is the CD itself. Cell phones also use coding techniques to correct for the fading and noise of high frequency radio <b>transmission.</b> Data modems, <b>telephone</b> <b>transmissions,</b> and NASA all employ channel coding techniques to get the bits through, for example the turbo code and LDPC codes.|$|R

The Electronics Corporation of Israel became ECI Telecom in 1981, and had its first trading on NASDAQ in 1982. Since that time, ECI has undergone a number of mergers and acquisitions, most recently an acquisition in 2007 by the Swarth Group and the Ashmore Group, private equity firms, making ECI a private company once again.|$|E
