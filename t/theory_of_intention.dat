60|$|The great {{authority}} for the modern history of the divining rod is a work published by M. Chevreuil, in Paris, in 1854. M. Chevreuil, probably with truth, regarded the wand as much {{on a par with}} the turning-tables, which, in 1854, attracted a good deal of attention. He studied the topic historically, and his book, with a few accessible French tracts and letters of the seventeenth century, must here be our guide. A good deal of M. Chevreuil's learning, it should be said, is reproduced in Mr. Baring Gould's 'Curious Myths of the Middle Ages,' but the French author is much more exhaustive in his treatment of the topic. M. Chevreuil could find no earlier book on the twig than the 'Testament du Frere Basil Valentin,' a holy man who flourished (the twig) about 1413; but whose treatise is possibly apocryphal. According to Basil Valentin, the twig was regarded with awe by ignorant labouring men, which is still true. Paracelsus, though he has a reputation for magical daring, thought the use of the twig 'uncertain and unlawful'; and Agricola, in his 'De Re Metallica' (1546) expresses a good deal of scepticism about the use of the rod in mining. A traveller of 1554 found that the wand was not used--and this seems to have surprised him--in the mines of Macedonia. Most of the writers of the sixteenth century accounted for the turning of the rod by 'sympathy,' which was then as favourite an explanation of everything as evolution is to-day. In 1630 the Baron de Beau Soleil of Bohemia (his name sounds rather Bohemian) came to France with his wife, and made much use of the rod in the search for water and minerals. The Baroness wrote a little volume on the subject, afterwards reprinted in a great storehouse of this lore, 'La Physique Occulte,' of Vallemont. Kircher, a Jesuit, made experiments which came to nothing; but Gaspard Schott, a learned writer, cautiously declined to say that the Devil was always 'at the bottom of it' when the rod turned successfully. The problem of the rod was placed before our own Royal Society by Boyle, in 1666, but the Society was not more successful here than in dealing with the philosophical difficulty proposed by Charles II. In 1679 De Saint Remain, deserting the old hypothesis of secret 'sympathies,' explained the motion of the rod (supposing it to move) by the action of corpuscules. From this time the question became the playing ground of the Cartesian and other philosophers. The struggle was between theories of 'atoms,' magnetism, 'corpuscules,' electric effluvia, and so forth, on one side, and the immediate action of devils or of conscious imposture, on the other. The controversy, comparatively simple as long as the rod only indicated hidden water or minerals, was complicated by the revival of the savage belief that the wand could 'smell out' moral offences. As long as the twig turned over material objects, you could imagine sympathies and 'effluvia' at pleasure. But when the wand twirled over the scene of a murder, or dragged the expert after the traces of the culprit, fresh explanations were wanted. Le Brun wrote to Malebranche on July 8, 1689, to tell him that the wand only turned over what the holder had the intention of discovering. {190} If he were following a murderer, the wand good-naturedly refused to distract him by turning over hidden water. On the other hand, Vallemont says that when a peasant was using the wand to find water, it turned over a spot in a wood where a murdered woman was buried, and it conducted the peasant to the murderer's house. These events seem inconsistent with Le Brun's <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention.</b> Malebranche replied, in effect, that he had only heard of the turning of the wand over water and minerals; that it then turned (if turn it did) by virtue of some such force as electricity; that, if such force existed, the wand would turn over open water. But it does not so turn; and, as physical causes are constant, it follows that the turning of the rod cannot be the result of a physical cause. The only other explanation is an intelligent cause--either the will of an impostor, or the action of a spirit. Good spirits would not meddle with such matters; therefore either the Devil or an impostor causes the motion of the rod, if it does move at all. This logic of Malebranche's is not agreeable to believers in the twig; but there the controversy stood, till, in 1692, Jacques Aymar, a peasant of Dauphine, by the use of the twig discovered one of the Lyons murderers.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} dicult {{problems}} within the eld of Articial Intelligence (AI) is that of processing language by computer, or natural-language processing. A major problem in natural-language processing is to build theories and models of how individual utterances cling together into a coherent discourse. The problem is important because, to properly understand natural language, a computer should have {{some sense of what}} it means for a discourse to be coherent and rational. Theories, models and implementations of natural-language processing argue for a measure of coherence based on three themes: meaning, structure, and intention. Most approaches stress one theme over all the others. Their future lies in the integration of components of all approaches. A <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention</b> analysis solves, in part, the problem of natural-language dialogue processing.

40|$|Abstract. During {{face to face}} interactions, the {{emotional}} state of each participant is greatly affected by the behavior of other participants and how much this behavior conforms with common protocols of interaction in the society. Research in human to human interaction in face to face situations has uncovered many forms of synchrony {{in the behavior of}} the interacting partners. This includes factors as body alignment, entrainment of verbal behavior. Maintenance of these kinds of synchrony is essential to keep the interaction natural and to regulate the affective state of the interacting partners. In this chapter we examine the interplay between one partner’s use of interaction protocols, maintenance of synchrony and {{the emotional}} response of the other partner in the two way interactions. We will first define the notion of interaction protocol and relate it with the Reactive <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>Intention</b> and Low Level Emotions.

Thomas Nagel was perhaps one of the earliest contemporary philosophers to point out the typical aspect of planning of human agency in his The Possibility of Altruism. However, the concept of actions planning was already emphasized by Aristotle in his theory of deliberation.

40|$|The guiding {{theme of}} the {{dissertation}} is that any theory of perception must also be a <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention.</b> One cannot give a plausible theory of perception without an explanation of intention being front and center in the theory. The main argument presented is that current accounts of perception, both direct and indirect cannot succeed because of their inadequate accounts of perceptual intention. ^ The first section of the dissertation looks {{at the idea that}} perception provides a foundation for knowledge about the world. The implications for perceptual theory of holding that knowledge must be certain is examined within in the context of two classic indirect theories of perception: C. D. Broad 2 ̆ 7 s theory of Sensa, and Bertrand Russell 2 ̆ 7 s account of sense-data. I argue that neither theory can account for the intentional content of perception, and the contrast of Broad 2 ̆ 7 s and Russell 2 ̆ 7 s account clearly brings out how their epistemological assumptions force the move to indirect theory. The structure of indirect theory, however, makes it impossible to give an account of intention that does not negate their claims to realism. Indirect realism, I argue, cannot support claims to knowledge of an external world. ^ In the second section of the dissertation I examine Gibsonian perceptual theory, focusing on the work of Michael Turvey. I argue that while Gibsonian theory has made many inroads against indirect arguments, it ultimately fails to escape from the forces that shaped indirect theory because it shares the same epistemological assumptions. Their <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention</b> faces an unmanageable choice between including incidents of ‘perceptual error’ to account for intentional inexistence, or leaving them out to preserve the nomic nature of the Gibsonian account of perceptual intentionality. ^ In the third section it is argued that only by abandoning the epistemological assumptions shared by the examined perceptual theories that a realist theory of perception is possible. Doing so, however, prevents us from using any of the theories of intention advanced in the discussed positions. I argue that a robust direct realist theory of perception is possible by incorporating Ruth Millikan 2 ̆ 7 s theory of proper functions into the Gibsonian empirical framework. ...|$|E

It suggests that this happens either by way of the defendant's illegitimate structuring of the claimant's choice or by way of the claimant's deferring his judgment to that of the defendant.
