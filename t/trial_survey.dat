5000|$|The Madras {{government}} of the South Indian Railway wanted to extend their rail links into Travancore (Thiruvithamkoor) for commercial interests of both the states, during 1873. The Chief Engineer of Travancore, Mr. Barton, suggested a proposal to link Travancore by a railway line drawn from Kovilpatti of Madras state to Trivandrum (since renamed Thiruvananthapuram) through Shencottah in the Chittar mountain area, and from Trivandrum to Quilon (since renamed Kollam), the commercial centre of Kerala. Although the [...] "South Indian Railway Company were inclined to make {{a survey of the}} southern route via the Aramboly pass to Trivandrum, --- the balance of opinion was in favour of the Northern route,so they obtained permission to survey that as well" [...] The Dewan of Travancore Mr. Ramiengar [...] "suggested that a line from Kovilpatti to Quilon through Shencottah would be the one most advantageous."About the close of 1881 the Consulting Engineer for Railways ordered for a <b>trial</b> <b>survey</b> of the line from Tirunelveli to Trvandrum via Shenkottai, Aryankavu and Quilon. Immediately the Chief Engineer of S.I.R took up the survey of, both the Southern and Northern routes to Trivandrum. In 1882, he submitted the report wherein he discussed the merits and demerits of both the routes. He held that the southern route would be cheaper and more beneficial than the northern one. But Dewan Ramiengar was strongly in favour of the northern route which would better promote its commercial interests of the country since Trivandrum was no more important commercially than Quilon. So the northern route was approved by the S.I.R. authorities and work started to link Tirunelveli Quilon via Tenkasi, Shencottah and Aryankavu. In 1913, the Secretary of State for India sanctioned the extension of railway line from Quilon to Trivandrum beach (present Pettai Station) and it was opened for traffic on 1 January 1918. In 1926 the extension of this line from Trivandrum Beach {{to the heart of the}} city, that is Thampanoor (the present-day Thiruvananthapuram Central), was completed in 1931. Hence the rail link ended at Trivandrum. At that point, when the work of extension of the railway line from Quilon to Trivandrum was taken up, there were no proposal or plan to extend it to Nagercoil.|$|E

As {{part of a national}} study, supported by funding from the Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC), we have trialled an instrument designed to uncover expectations and experiences of non-physics majors enrolled in a first year physics subject. The trial surveyed bio/medical science majors at a large metropolitan university.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To test {{a survey}} method for {{estimating}} {{the coverage of}} selective feeding programmes in humanitarian emergencies. METHODS: The <b>trial</b> <b>survey</b> used a stratified design with strata that were defined using the centric systematic area sample method. Thirty 100 km 2 quadrats were sampled. The communities located closest to the centre of each quadrat were sampled using a case-finding approach. FINDINGS: The method proved simple and rapid to implement and allowed overall and per-quadrat coverage to be estimated. Overall coverage was 20. 0 % (95 % confidence intervals, 13. 8 - 26. 3 %). Per-quadrat coverage ranged from zero (in nine quadrats) to 50 % (in one quadrat). Coverage was highest in the quadrats closest to therapeutic feeding centres and in quadrats containing major roads leading to the towns in which therapeutic feeding centres were located. CONCLUSION: The method should be used, in preference to WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) -derived survey methods, for estimating the coverage of selective feeding programmes.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{phenomenon}} of bruxism and assess {{the current state of}} the literature regarding its role in temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Data sources: A review of the literature contained in the CINAHL; Pubmed; COCHRANE; MANTIS and MEDLINE (ovid) database searches as well as hand searches was conducted between September 2005 and March 2006. Study selection: Studies using the keywords bruxism, temporomandibular, jaw, randomised controlled <b>trial,</b> <b>survey,</b> epidemiological, longitudinal, were screened. Uncontrolled studies, case studies, case series and reviews were ignored. A total of 172 studies were identified and compared in terms of their definition of bruxism, TMD, and conclusions regarding the role of bruxism. Conclusion: The majority of studies found a relationship between bruxism and TMD. However, inconsistency and equivocation of different parafunctional activities are common within the literature. The subject is further complicated by the lack of a universally accepted definition of both TMD and bruxism and an additional failure to standardise investigative variables such as frequency, duration and intensity of episodes. The role of bruxism as it is currently described can therefore be considered a controversial and unresolved issue. The authors suggest that the term bruxism be abandoned in favour of a set of diagnostically more appropriate descriptors. 11 page(s...|$|E

Thirty soil pits were dug and sampled every ten centimetres, both on and off the pedogeochemical anomaly. The samples came from areas with potential copper, lead and zinc mineralization and analyses have been restricted to these elements and potential scavengers. Chemical analyses for carbon, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Fe and Mn revealed a distinct vertical and horizontal distribution that could be explained by changes in Eh/pH environment and presence of "metal scavengers".
