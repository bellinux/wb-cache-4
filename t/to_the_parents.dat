When the body was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.|$|E

50|$|When a {{subsidiary}} of a corporation files for bankruptcy, there may be reason to suspect that it was deliberately undercapitalized and mismanaged {{for the benefit of}} <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> corporation. <b>The</b> main cause of failure may have been excessive payments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> for goods or services provided by <b>the</b> <b>parent,</b> or inadequate charges for goods or services provided <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b> In effect, capital provided by other investors was channeled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> corporation until <b>the</b> subsidiary failed.

25|$|In {{the first}} passage preserved, Encolpius is in a Greek town in Campania, perhaps Puteoli, {{where he is}} {{standing}} outside a school, railing against the Asiatic style and false taste in literature, which he blames on the prevailing system of declamatory education (1–2). His adversary in this debate is Agamemnon, a sophist, who shifts the blame from the teachers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> (3–5). Encolpius discovers that his companion Ascyltos has left and breaks away from Agamemnon {{when a group of}} students arrive (6).|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{the parents}} would often name their child after an older relative, so that his/her name would {{live on in}} the family. Today, however, these are not binding {{conditions}} and are often ignored: parents often pick a name without conforming with these traditions, however it is really up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> as still many of them continue to observe these traditions. Traditions to name a child after the parents' best man or maid of honor or the saint on whose name day the child is born also exist.|$|E
25|$|In {{stationary}} organisms, such as plants, exploitative competition plays a {{much larger}} role than interference competition because individuals are rooted to a specific area and utilise resources in their immediate surroundings. Saplings will compete for light, most {{of which will be}} blocked and utilised by taller trees. The saplings can be easily out-competed by larger members of their own species, {{which is one of the}} reasons why seed dispersal distances can be so large. Seeds that germinate in close proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> are very likely to be out-competed and die.|$|E

25|$|Prominently {{displayed}} in the Burying Ground is an obelisk erected in 1827 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> and relatives of Benjamin Franklin {{who was born in}} Boston and is buried in Philadelphia. Franklin's father was Josiah Franklin, originally from Ecton, Northamptonshire, England, and his mother was Abiah, who was born in Nantucket and was Josiah's second wife. Constructed of granite from the Bunker Hill Monument quarry, the obelisk was constructed to replace the original Franklin family gravestones which had been in poor condition. The new memorial was dedicated on 15 June 1827.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a story}} that, between 1949 and 1951, up to 1,033 {{children}} of Yemenite immigrant families may have disappeared from the immigrant camps. It was said that the parents were told that their children were ill and required hospitalization. Upon later visiting the hospital, it is claimed that the parents were told that their children had died though no bodies were presented and graves which have later proven to be empty in many cases were shown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> Those who believed the theory contended that the Israeli government {{as well as other}} organizations in Israel kidnapped the children and gave them for adoption to other, non-Yemenite, families.|$|E
25|$|The mode of {{inheritance}} for A-T is autosomal recessive. Each {{parent is}} a carrier, {{meaning that they}} have one normal copy of the A-T gene (ATM) and one copy which is mutated. A-T occurs if a child inherits the mutated A-T gene from each parent, so in a family with two carrier parents, there is 1 chance in 4 that a child born <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> will have the disorder. Prenatal diagnosis (and carrier detection) {{can be carried out}} in families if the errors (mutation) in an affected child’s two ATM genes have been identified. The process of getting this done can be complicated and, as it requires time, should be arranged before conception.|$|E

25|$|Since {{hypotheses}} for {{the origins}} of sex are difficult to test experimentally (outside of Evolutionary computation), most current work {{has focused on the}} maintenance of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction must offer significant fitness advantages to a species because despite the two-fold cost of sex, it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from recombination, where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual replication, where the offspring is identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> Recombination supplies two fault-tolerance mechanisms at the molecular level: recombinational DNA repair (promoted during meiosis because homologous chromosomes pair at that time) and complementation (also known as heterosis, hybrid vigor or masking of mutations).|$|E

Kit reiterates that he is sane and believes the aliens to have killed those women, and that the third decapitated and skinned body is not Alma. He believes she is still alive because he saw her while he was being examined by the aliens. Dr. Thredson diagnoses Kit as insane, and before leaving, speaks to Sister Jude about the horrendous conditions at the asylum that he has witnessed during his visit.
