[...] We also heard a lot about the ideology behind enslavement. Masters such as William Ford and Edwin Epps, although very different characters, both used an interpretation of Christianity to justify their ownership of slaves. They believed the Bible sanctioned slavery, and that it was their 'Christian duty' to preach the scriptures to their slaves." ...|$|E

Patton commanded the battle from a shell hole for another hour before being evacuated. He stopped at a rear command post to submit his report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E.

[...] Jason Bracelin of the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Timberlake sings about [...] "threatening to steal your girl." [...] Charlie Brooker for The Guardian, in regards to the lyric, [...] "them other fuckers don't know how to act", writing that Timberlake's translation is of him telling everyone in the world that they are a [...] "clueless fornicator".

500|$|... "Minimum Wage", which {{features}} only two words, saw the band dabbling in sampling. The {{sound of the}} whip was crafted in the studio when the band {{was unable to find}} a suitable stock sound effect; the effect was a composite of a wind sound from Linnell's Moog keyboard and <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> a wet towel, courtesy of Roger Moutenot. [...] "Letterbox", which was also considered as a potential single from the album, was another track that had been in live setlists years prior to the release of the album. For [...] "Whistling in the Dark", Flansburgh and Linnell wanted the bass drum to be extremely pronounced, although they were later unhappy with the result. Linnell noted that, lyrically, the song is about two men who engage in a fight, only for the listener to soon learn that they are both in prison. [...] "Hot Cha!" [...] references the name of a wooden horse in the Parker Brothers board game Derby Day. Musically, the song is a mix of eclectic sounds (such as the noise of mallets and drumsticks banging on a sing and base of a refrigerator), samples (such as a door buzzer), and unique recording methods (such as running horn samples through a guitar fuzz box). In the cheerful tune [...] "Women and Men", the band examines human reproduction from a [...] "disengaged view", and [...] "Sapphire Bullets of Pure Love" [...] takes its title from a Mahavishnu Orchestra album cut of the same name. [...] "They Might Be Giants" [...] operates as the band's manifesto, and was inspired by The Monkees song [...] "(Theme From) The Monkees". Flood concludes with [...] "Road Movie to Berlin", which was written by John Flansburgh in Germany in 1989 (at which point the Berlin Wall still stood). The song deals with the clash between absurdism and existentialism that the band encountered while touring Europe. Flansburgh's voice was slowed down for this song, an effect that he later called [...] "creepy". Due to the haste with which the final portion of the album was recording, the band accidentally forgot to include an entire verse of the song in the finished product; Linnell and Flansburgh, however, felt {{that they did not have}} the time to fix it, and the mistake remained. The song also makes use of [...] "synthetic or sampled" [...] trumpet sounds, one of which was also included in [...] "Birdhouse in Your Soul".|$|E
