5|$|Beyond the Clans' territories lies a {{mountain}} range, inhabited by the <b>Tribe</b> <b>of</b> Rushing Water. The Tribe {{is shown to}} be similar to the Clans, yet follows a different set of ancestors: the <b>Tribe</b> <b>of</b> Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the <b>Tribe</b> <b>of</b> Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe, and the prey-hunters hunt.The Tribe was formed by the Ancients when they left the lake to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.|$|E

5|$|People {{who kept}} more {{traditional}} ways had settlements along the Tamiami Trail {{and tended to}} speak the Mikasuki language.

They earned money by wrestling alligators and selling craftworks. As of 2008, the Seminole <b>Tribe</b> <b>of</b> Florida had five reservations, and the lands of the Miccosukee <b>Tribe</b> <b>of</b> Indians were collectively considered a sixth reservation. The two tribes have each developed casino gaming on some of their properties to generate revenue for support, services and economic development.|$|E
