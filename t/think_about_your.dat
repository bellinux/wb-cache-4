500|$|... "Siempre Tú" [...] was {{composed}} by Muñiz in Los Angeles {{along with its}} producers Nico Stadi and Mike Green. It was recorded {{in the same city}} at the Pulse Music Group Studios. The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell a person that you miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico. The accompanying cover artwork shows Muñiz sitting on a chair looking off in the far distance against a backdrop of a street with tall buildings.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{says the}} text from Ecclesiastes should [...] "awaken you to concern about yourself." [...] "The {{thought of the}} Creator is youth's most {{beautiful}} splendor" [...] and the Preacher [...] "is not just saying that you can <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> Creator, but he admonishes you to do it; {{and if you are}} young, whether you are joyful or dejected; whether you are carefree or discouraged, whoever you are, it is nevertheless to you, precisely to you, that he is speaking, you to whom the admonition applies ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is my opinion," [...] said Miss Annie, [...] "that {{you ought}} to <b>think</b> more <b>about</b> <b>your</b> sprained ankle and your general health, than <b>about</b> having <b>your</b> mind settled by Miss March. I should think that keeping your blood boiling, in this way, would inflame your joints." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ólafur Arnalds won a British Academy Television (BAFTA) Craft Award for Original Television Music in April 2014. It was {{his first}} {{composition}} for television. Ólafur's music was widely praised. Mike Hale, writing in The New York Times, called it [...] "a tasty icing of gloom and foreboding", and noted that the show leaned very heavily on the mood that the music created. Cast members were equally as impressed with the music. Actress Jodie Whittaker has said that [...] "hearing the music by Ólafur Arnalds just broke me every time." [...] Actor Andrew Buchan was equally effusive. [...] "The power of music can draw people in more than they realise. I had never heard {{a piece of music}} like it. They deliberately went left-field with Ólafur Arnalds. I found it haunting, beautiful and desolate. It can make or break a show. If you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> reasons for watching The Killing, the music that swells at the end draws you into watching another one. Same with Broadchurch— the music can't be ignored." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ulliott took £10,000 {{with him}} on the trip, and was around even, until he entered the $500 pot limit Omaha event of the 1997 Four Queens Poker Classic. When the event reached the heads-up stage, {{numerous}} Vietnamese-American followers of Men Nguyen supported the latter by cheering [...] "Go on the Master" [...] at him. In response, Whitaker cheered Ulliott on by cheering [...] "Go on the Devilfish." [...] The nickname was thought up by Stephen Au-Yeung early 1997, who ran a poker game that Ulliott had frequented in Birmingham UK, who later sold him the website DevilFishPoker.com in 2005; a devilfish (or fugu) is a poisonous fish that can kill when ingested, if not properly prepared. Ulliott reduced Nguyen's stack to one chip, and the tournament director insisted upon still taking a one-hour scheduled break, over Nguyen's protests. Ulliott turned to Nguyen and said, [...] "We’re taking the break, and in all fairness to you, I think you should go upstairs and <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> tactics." [...] Ulliott went on to win, and the headlines the next day read, Devilfish devours the Master. Since the event, Ulliott claimed that the event was only of significance for defining his nickname.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 64 is {{very similar}} to Shakespeare's Sonnet 60 where both sonnets focus on a central idolizing of [...] "time as the destroyer". In Helen Vendler's, The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Vendler {{describes}} Sonnet 64 to be written in a state of horror and [...] "unprotected vulnerability". The speaker's horror is manifested in the line, Increasing store with loss, and loss with store. Vendler argues that in this line [...] "Loss wins in both cases. It is of course impossible to increase abundance with loss, and equally impossible to increase loss by adding abundance to it." [...] Atkins is also in agreement that sonnet 64 especially in line 12, the speaker expresses a state of fear: That Time will come and take my love away. In [...] "Shakespeare's Sonnets" [...] Atkins argues the meaning of this line is clear that [...] "after seeing all these other ruins, I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> eventual ruin". Vendler calls line 12 a [...] "collapse into monosyllabic truth", [...] "and its dismayed adolescent simplicity of rhythm, this line feels like a death." [...] Booth claims that in line 13 is unclear: [...] "death, the nearest potential antecedent, cannot choose, but it cannot weep or fear either; thought makes better sense, but it is the thinker who does the weeping and fearing." [...] Vendler argues that in the last three lines of the sonnet a [...] "'natural' pattern of unreversed ruin 'defeats' the intellectual mastery-by-chiasmus, as the concept of gradual leakage comes to represent personal loss. Time takes love away, a thought is like a death, one weeps to have what one fears to lose.... Having while fearing to lose is already a form of losing." [...] Overall, both Booth and Vendler agree in the last three lines of the sonnet the speaker weeps at the fear of losing his love, ultimately realizing that he cannot escape time and time will come and take his love away.|$|E
