5|$|While {{he was in}} Paris at the Jardin des Plantes, Gray saw {{an unnamed}} dried specimen, {{collected}} by André Michaux, and named it Shortia galacifolia. He spent considerable time and effort over the next 38 years looking for a specimen in the wild. The first such expedition was in late June to late July 1841 to an area near Jefferson, Ashe County, North Carolina. His further expeditions searching for this species were also unsuccessful, including one in 1876. In May 1877 a North Carolina herb collector found a specimen but {{did not know what}} it was. Eighteen months later the collector sent it to Joseph Whipple Congdon, who contacted Gray, telling Gray that he felt he had found Shortia. Gray was ecstatic to confirm this when he saw the specimen in October 1878. In spring 1879 Gray led an expedition, in which the collector helped, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> S.galacifolia had been found. Gray never saw the species in the wild in bloom, but made a final trip to this region in 1884.|$|E

5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one {{has been called the}} Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E

They then fled on foot, taking the marijuana with them. Their vehicle was found later in the day.|$|E
500|$|The Katyn {{massacre}} was {{beneficial to}} Nazi Germany, which {{used it to}} discredit the Soviet Union. On 14 April 1943, Goebbels wrote in his diary: [...] "We are now using the discovery of 12,000 Polish officers, murdered by the GPU, for anti-Bolshevik propaganda on a grand style. We sent neutral journalists and Polish intellectuals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> they were found. Their reports now reaching us from ahead are gruesome.

Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she'll never see Glinda again and tell her that she and Fiyero are alive. Simultaneously, returning to the musical's starting point, Glinda reports to the people of Oz that the Wicked Witch of the West has been killed and promises to properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz behind. ("Finale") ...|$|E

500|$|The Chinese {{authorities}} {{stated that}} the seven people {{who had come to}} Tiananmen Square with the intention of self-immolating were all from the city of Kaifeng in Henan province. The state-run Xinhua News Agency asserted that the self-immolators were [...] "avid practitioners" [...] of Falun Gong who had taken up the practice between 1994 and 1997, and that they fantasised during the preceding week about [...] "how wonderful it would be to enter heaven". Six of them reportedly took the train on 16 January, meeting Chen Guo, the daughter of one of them, upon their arrival in Beijing. The seven agreed to light themselves {{in different parts of the}} Square at 2:30 pm on the designated day with gasoline smuggled there in plastic soda bottles; each had been armed with two lighters in case one would fail. According to the government-run China Association For Cultic Studies website, Wang Jindong stated afterwards that the group arrived in Tiananmen Square by two taxis, and were dropped off at the south of the Great Hall of the People, from where they walked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> they would ignite themselves. Wang said he was approached by police as he was splitting open the soda bottles, and ignited himself hurriedly without assuming the lotus position.

500|$|At {{the same}} time, McAleer proved a strong performer. A later {{newspaper}} account {{described him as}} an outstanding outfielder who was [...] "blessed with excellent speed". The article noted that McAleer's skills as a sprinter helped him steal 51 bases in one year and 41 in another. According to some accounts, he was [...] "the first centerfielder to {{take his eyes off}} a fly ball, run <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> it fell to earth, and catch it". Less proficient as a hitter, McAleer accumulated a lifetime batting average of [...]253. During his career, the league's batting (pitchers removed) average for players with the same home field was [...]284. On April 24, 1894, he assisted in Cleveland's 1–0 victory over Cincinnati with a single in the ninth that drove home Buck Ewing, who had doubled. Along with teammates Cy Young, Jesse Burkett, John Clarkson, and Charles Zimmer, McAleer also participated in the Spiders' victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1895 Temple Cup, a post-season series between first and second-place teams of the National League. The Spiders placed second to the Orioles at the close of both the 1895 and 1896 seasons. McAleer's performance came in spite of a serious injury he received during a game held in Philadelphia on August 24, 1895, when he collided with a fence. Furthermore, he balanced his achievements in sports with a foray into politics in his hometown of Youngstown. During the summer of 1895, McAleer was promoted in the local media as a mayoral candidate, first as a Republican, and then as an independent. Further research is required to determine the depth of his involvement in politics.|$|E
500|$|Driving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a {{young girl}} walking towards them, and signalled Hindley to stop, which she did not do until she had passed the girl. Brady drew up {{alongside}} on his motorbike, demanding to know why she had not offered the girl a lift, to which Hindley replied that she recognised her as Marie Ruck, a near neighbour of her mother. Shortly after 8:00pm, continuing down Froxmer Street, Brady spotted a girl wearing a pale blue coat and white high-heeled shoes walking away from them, and once again signalled for the van to stop. Hindley recognised the girl as Pauline Reade, a friend of her younger sister, Maureen. Reade got into the van with Hindley, who then asked if she would mind helping to search for an expensive glove she had lost on Saddleworth Moor. Reade said she was in no great hurry, and agreed. At 16, Pauline Reade was older than Marie Ruck, and Hindley believed {{that there would be}} less of an outcry over the disappearance of a teenager than there would over a child of seven or eight. When the van reached the moor, Hindley stopped and Brady arrived shortly afterwards on his motorcycle. She introduced him to Reade as her boyfriend, and said that he had also come to help find the missing glove. Hindley claimed Brady took Reade onto the moor while Hindley waited in the van. After about 30minutes Brady returned alone, and took Hindley <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Reade lay dying. Her throat had been cut twice with a large knife. The larger of these wounds was a four-inch incision across her voice box, and the collar of Reade's coat had been deliberately pushed into this wound. He told her to stay with Reade while he fetched a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit to the moor, to bury the body. Hindley noticed that [...] "Pauline's coat was undone and her clothes were in disarray... She had guessed from the time he had taken that Brady had sexually assaulted her." [...] Brady's account differed from Hindley's. He claimed that Hindley was not only there at the scene, but that she assisted him with the sexual assault on Pauline. Returning home from the moor in the van—they had loaded the motorcycle into the back—Brady and Hindley passed Reade's mother, Joan, accompanied by her son, Paul, searching the streets for Pauline.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the Pale developed an identity familiar from other settler-colonists of a beleaguered enclave of civilisation surrounded by [...] "barbarous natives". The siege mentality of medieval Dubliners is best illustrated by their annual pilgrimage to the area called Fiodh Chuilinn, or Holly Wood (rendered in English as Cullenswood) in Ranelagh, where, in 1209, five hundred recent settlers from Bristol had been massacred by the O'Toole clan during an outing outside the city limits.

Ellis, for the first time, disregarded this rule, and on catching the ball, instead of retiring backwards, rushed forwards with the ball in his hands towards the opposite goal, with what result as to the game I know not, neither do I know how this infringement of a well-known rule was followed up, or when it became, as it is now, a standing rule." ...|$|E

2500|$|The city of St. Augustine, Florida {{is home to}} the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, {{a tribute}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Ponce de León is {{traditionally}} said to have landed. Although there were several instances of the property being used as an attraction as early as the 1860s, the tourist attraction in its present form was created by Luella Day McConnell in 1904. Because she supposedly purchased the Park property from Mr. H.H. Williams using diamonds and cash, she was also known as [...] "Diamond Lil". It is said that Dr. McConnell had a diamond mounted in her front tooth, but this may be a myth. Luella Day McConnell fabricated stories to amuse and appall the city’s residents and tourists until her death in a car accident in 1927. The first archaeological digs at the Fountain of Youth in 1934 were performed by the Smithsonian Institution. These digs produced a large number of Christianized Timucua burials. These burials eventually pointed to the Park as the location of the first Christian Mission in the United States. Called the Mission Nombre de Dios, this mission was begun by Franciscan friars in 1587. Succeeding decades have seen the unearthing of items which positively identify the Park as the location of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés' 1565 settlement of St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. The park currently exhibits native and colonial artifacts to celebrate St. Augustine's Timucua and Spanish heritage.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{forefront}} of the bowling attack was Ray Lindwall, who became a fast bowler after watching Harold Larwood in 1932-33. His whose smooth run up and perfect delivery produced swing and control and bouncers at a lethal pace, though he dropped the ball short less than Miller. Neville Cardus later wrote that [...] "He has so many brains it's a wonder why he ever went in for fast bowling" [...] and working hand-in-glove with his captain Don Bradman he would think batsman out and catch them in carefully selected field-placings. A. P. Herbert was moved to poetry to describe his bowling action and Trevor Bailey wrote [...] "Watching him bowl {{was one of the most}} satisfying spectacles the game has ever produced". Even so, his arm was thought to be too low (Frank Tyson thought him almost a round-arm bowler) and his long drag could have produced numerous no balls, though he was rarely called for this. His partner Keith Miller had been a batsmen, but in the Victory Tests the Australian Services XI were short of bowlers and Hassett used Miller initially as a change bowler and then gave him the new ball. To everyone's surprise he picked up wickets and soon his strength and natural talent made him into a genuine fast bowler. Bradman knew Australia needed this more than another batsman and encouraged Miller to develop his new talent, though his back injury limited him to short spells. Unlike his new-ball partner Miller liked to drop the ball short and lacked consistency, sometimes bowling leg-breaks or off-spin. Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when he appears to be well under the control of the batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone". Together they formed the best fast bowling duo in post-war cricket, perhaps the greatest of any era, and were the spearhead of Australia's success. Ernie Toshack was a left-arm medium pace bowler who bowled with a packed leg-side field and tied up the batsmen when Lindwall and Miller were resting. In the First Test he had the perfect pace to unhinge the English batting on a Brisbane sticky, but failed to understand Bradman's instructions. In the end Bradman took him to the middle, pointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> he wanted Toshack to bowl, and made him practice alongside the wicket until he understood what was required. Once this was done 9 of the last 15 wickets fell to his bowling and Australia won by an innings. Fred Freer was a steady fast-medium swing bowler who liked to drop the ball short and replaced Ray Lindwall in the Second Test when the fast bowler had chickenpox.|$|E
