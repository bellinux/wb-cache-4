40|$|Oxidative {{demethylation}} of {{the secondary}} carcinogen dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) by isolated mouse liver microsomes and the activation of DMN to a bacterial mutagen followed similar kinetics. The rates of demethylation and DMN activation increased following induction of the cytochrome P- 450 mixed-function oxidase system by polychlorinated biphenyls. Both the oxidative demethylation and the activation of DMN to a mutagen were inhibited by carbon monoxide, and the inhibition was maximally re versed by monochromatic light at 450 nm. These observa tions indicate that both microsomal metabolism and ac <b>tivation</b> <b>of</b> DMN to a mutagen are cytochrome P- 450 dependent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Although a major site of {{transcription}} in heat shock, the Drosophila hsroJ gene {{does not}} encode any known heat shock proteins. Instead, {{studies of the}} hsroJ transcripts suggest that the RNA molecules, rather than encoded proteins, are the active products of this gene.

It contains information on the origin, cul- <b>tivation</b> and utilization <b>of</b> waxy maize {{in the world and}} can be a contribution to the development of new research on maize cultivation and starch processing technology. 			Maize, as an old and economically important cereal, played an enormous role in the ancient civilisations of the New World. Among the maize subspecies compared, Z. mays ssp. indurata and Z. mays ssp. indentata are now the most important in Poland. The subspecies Z. mays ssp. saccharata has a marginal role, while Z. mays ssp. ceratina has not been hitherto cultivated. Decisions to introduce the subspecies Z. mays ssp. ceratina into cultivation are based on different grounds, taking into account both agro-climatic conditions and industrial uses of grain processing products. The growing demand for maize grain, stimulated by the increased demand for maize starch and oil in the global market as raw materials that are important in food production, is an impulse for the development of agrobiological research. The development of the starch industry, associated with the demand for industrial starch, will probably contribute to increased interest in this subspecies in Central Europe, also including Poland. Waxy maize grain can be a major ingredient of high-energy feeds for livestock, replacing in this role the type of maize that has been grown for this purpose until now. 			A great advantage of waxy maize is its specific structure of starch, due to its unique and high amylopectin content (95 - 98 %), which creates unlimited possibilities of industrial use. Currently, waxy maize acreage in Europe does not exceed 2 % of the maize crop area in this continent...|$|R

40|$|Emotion {{regulation}} plays {{a central}} role in mental health and illness, but little is known about even the most basic forms of emotion regulation. To examine the acute effects of inhibiting negative and positive emotion, we asked 180 female participants to watch sad, neutral, and amusing films under 1 of 2 conditions. Suppression participants (N = 90) inhibited their expressive behavior while watching the films; no suppression participants (N = 90) simply watched the films. Suppression diminished expressive behavior in all 3 films and decreased amusement self-reports in sad and amusing films. Physiologically, suppression had no effect in the neutral film, but clear effects in both negative and positive motional films, including increased sympathetic a <b>tivation</b> <b>of</b> the cardiovascular system. On the basis of these findings, we suggest several ways emotional inhibition may influence psychological functioning. Emotion regulation and dysregulation figure prominently in mental health and illness (Gross & Mufioz, 1995).

40|$|Abstract. The {{release of}} {{reactive}} oxygen intermediates (ROl), mediators of inflammatory reactions, was evaluated in murine Trypanosoma cruzi infection. In acutely infected BALBIC mice, spleen cells were stimulated, either with epimastigote or trypomastigote {{forms of the}} parasite, and the effect was enhanced by serum from infected mice. Only opsonized parasites triggered the release of ROI by normal mouse cells and this response was several times lower than in infected mice. This {{seems to indicate that}} cells from acutely infected mice reacted to T. cruzi and that neither parasites nor serum factors blocked the release of ROl. During the acute stage of the infection, both the parasitemia and the release of ROI by spleen cells were higher in BALB/c than in C 3 H mice (ROI generated in response to a phagocytic stimulation was 12 and 3 times the normal levels, respectively). In addition, in BALB/c mice infected with different numbers of parasites, the production of ROl was related to parasitemia. On the other hand, during the chronic stage of the infection, the inflammatory reaction in myocardium was greater in C 3 H than in BALB/c mice, and the increase in ROl production was 30 % and 100 % above the normal levels in BALB/c and C 3 H mice, respec tively. This suggests that the increased ROI production paralleled the parasite burden in the acute phase, and could be related to inflammatory processes after the control of the parasitemia. During acute Trypanosoma cruzi infections, macrophages increase phagocytic ' and trypanocidal activities. 2 This ac <b>tivation</b> <b>of</b> phagocytic cells is considered important for host defense mechanism(s) against T. ru 23 the causative agent of Chagas ' disease.

40|$|High-speed videographic flow {{visualization}} {{and detailed}} two-component particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements {{were conducted to}} examine the wake produced by a hovering single-bladed rotor as it interacted with a horizontal ground plane. The mo- <b>tivation</b> <b>of</b> the work was {{to better understand the}} nature of the flow field at the ground and the possible aerodynamic mechanisms that create brownout dust clouds when rotorcraft take off and land over surfaces covered with loose sediment. Rotors with four different blade tips were tested: 1. A baseline rectangular tip, 2. A simple 20 &# 9702; swept tip, 3. A BERP-like tip, and 4. A slotted tip. Flow visualization was performed using a high- repetition rate Nd:YLF laser that illuminated appropriately seeded flows in radial planes, with imaging performed using a high-speed CMOS camera. PIV measurements were performed in regions near the blades and at the ground plane by using a Nd:YAG laser with a CCD camera. Measurements as functions of wake age were obtained to examine the morphology of the vortical rotor wake during its interaction with the ground. The results showed that the wake was subjected to powerful curvature and straining effects as it interacted with the ground plane and was deflected into a radially outward direction along the plane. Reintensification of the tip vortices during the interaction caused them to remain very distinct features in the flow near the ground to as old as six or more ro- tor revolutions. The unsteady outward flow over the ground plane was shown to have similarities to a classical turbulent wall jet, especially further away from the rotor. Flow measurements were obtained deep into the boundary layer region at the ground, and in some cases into the laminar sublayer. The results showed certain common flow features between the four blade tips, but also differences in the flows that may ultimately affect the problem of brownout. The slotted-tip was shown to be particularly effective in diffusing the tip vortices and reducing the overall intensity of the fluctuating aspects of the flow at the ground...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to investigate the effect of atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) against a range of microbial biofilms commonly implicated in foodborne and health- care associated human infections and against P. aeruginosa quorum sensing (QS) -regu- lated virulence factors, such as pyocyanin, elastase (Las B) and biofilm formation capacity post-ACP treatment. The effect of processing factors, namely treatment time and mode of plasma exposure on antimicrobial activity of ACP were also examined. Antibiofilm activity was assessed for E. coli, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in terms of reduction of cultur- ability and retention of metabolic activity using colony count and XTT assays, respectively. All samples were treated ‘inpack’ using sealed polypropylene containers with a high voltage dielectric barrier discharge ACP generated at 80 kV for 0, 60, 120 and 300 s and a post treatment storage time of 24 h. According to colony counts, ACP treatment for 60 s reduced populations of E. coli to undetectable levels, whereas 300 s was necessary to significantly reduce populations of L. monocytogenes and S. aureus biofilms. The results obtained from XTT assay indicated possible induction of viable but non culturable state of bacteria. With respect to P. aeruginosa QS-related virulence factors, the production of pyocyanin was sig- nificantly inhibited after short treatment times, but reduction of elastase was notable only after 300 s and no reduction in actual biofilm formation was achieved post-ACP treatment. Importantly, reduction of virulence factors was associated with reduction of the cytotoxic effects of the bacterial supernatant on CHO-K 1 cells, regardless of mode and duration of treatment. The {{results of this study}} point to ACP technology as an effective strategy for inac- <b>tivation</b> <b>of</b> established biofilms and may {{play an important role in}} attenuation of virulence of pathogenic bacteria.
