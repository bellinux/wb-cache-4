40|$|This study {{analyzes}} specific {{scenes in}} the novels dealt with {{in order to determine}} the type of women characters Mauriac has created. This study covers Mauriac's early, middle, and late periods as a novelist. <b>The</b> <b>heroines</b> are nearly all examined in relation to each other chronologically. The study shows that Mauriac first portrays a religious and simple <b>heroine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>heroines</b> become agnostic, if not atheistic in several of the subsequent novels. Through Therese, they become progressively more psychologically complex. They then become less complicated and, except for <b>the</b> last <b>heroine,</b> are religious. <b>The</b> last <b>heroine</b> is psychologically portrayed but is the least original of <b>the</b> <b>heroines.</b> <b>The</b> examination of Mauriac's women characters seems to show that the author is deeply sympathetic with the majority of them...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{entitled}} “Women 2 ̆ 7 s Portrayals in the Comic Books (A Visual Grammar of <b>the</b> <b>Heroines</b> 2 ̆ 7 Portrayals in the Selected Comic Books Published by DC Comics and Marvel) ” {{is aimed}} at investigating how women, especially heroines are portrayed in the comic books and what the portrayals signify. The study is a qualitative study using the visual grammar theory proposed by Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) and the systemic functional linguistics theory proposed by Halliday (2004). The data are {{in the form of}} four online comics published by DC Comics and Marvel. The study finds that heroines are portrayed in negative and positive ways. The negative ways portray <b>the</b> <b>heroines</b> as sex symbols, the ones who sexually stimulate men 2 ̆ 7 s attention in their appearance, greedy, fragile (especially when <b>the</b> <b>heroines</b> play their character as alter ego). While, the positive ways portray <b>the</b> <b>heroines</b> as strong, brave, smart and impressive ones.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines are given the same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, <b>the</b> <b>heroine</b> ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when it is appropriate to disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the life experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears <b>the</b> <b>heroine</b> to the hero.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} the Hero dreaming that he meets the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, and a woman named Yuriko; she {{promises}} that she will become the Hero's partner. He wakes up, and receives an e-mail with a computer program for summoning demons attached. While out on an errand, he learns that a scientist has opened a portal to the Abyss, which allows demons to enter Tokyo. He also meets Yuriko, who says she will fulfill her promise. The next night, the Hero again dreams that he meets the Law Hero and Chaos Hero, and that they save <b>the</b> <b>Heroine</b> from a sacrificial ritual. The next day, he meets the Law Hero and Chaos Hero in reality; they reveal {{that they had the}} same dreams. News of the demons spread, and the US military, led by ambassador Thorman, decides to intervene. The Japan Self-Defense Forces, led by general Gotou, opposes them, as they see demons as the ancient spirits of the land. A third group, led by <b>the</b> <b>Heroine,</b> tries to prevent conflict between the other two. She gets captured by Gotou's forces; they are about to publicly execute her under supervision by Yuriko, but she is saved by the Hero, Law Hero, and Chaos Hero.

5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} highlights <b>the</b> <b>heroine's</b> many masculine qualities, {{which include}} a fierce independence and a disregard for social mores.

40|$|The present paper aims {{at making}} clear how George Eliot {{attempted}} a reconciliation between Christian world＇s view and scientific rationalism. If we focus {{our attention to}} the text of Gwendolen, <b>the</b> <b>heroine＇s</b> matrimonial tragedy in Daniel Deronda, we become aware that the author＇s own view of human depravity is graphically illustrated through her insightful portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>heroine＇s</b> death in life in her marital impasse. The readers are {{invited to participate in the}} process of Gwendolen＇s youthful belief in free will turning into a bitter disappointment and disillusionment with life＇s reality. We recognize in this drama a plot of the protagonist＇s dawning sense of law through her suffering and sorrow. Thus we are shown into the inner mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>heroine＇s</b> conscience being forged by the tragedy. The textual analysis illuminates that the discourse of <b>the</b> <b>heroine＇s</b> inner drama is rich in imaginative power owing to a complex interweaving of traditional Christian phraseology and scientific one...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>heroine,</b> Annis, {{is one of}} Heyer's {{more modern}} characters.
