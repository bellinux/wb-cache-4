40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} on the northwestern coast of Portugal {{to evaluate the}} selectivity effect of both <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> and mesh size on the catch of the white clam (Spisula solida). Two typical clam dredges, equipped with different <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> and mesh size, were towed side by side. Three <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> (20, 40 and 60 mm) and three mesh sizes (35, 40 and 50 mm) were investigated. The dredge selectivity experiments were performed by attaching a cover bag with a 20 mm mesh to the gear. Individual hauls were analysed by the SELECT model. The Fryer’s mixed model of between-haul variation was also applied to data. The {{results showed that the}} space between teeth does not have an effect on selectivity. Tooth length was directly related to the dredge’s capture efficiency. The only factor that contributed to dredge size selection was mesh size. The 50 % retention lengths estimated for mesh sizes 30, 40 and 50 mm were 25. 68, 26. 35 and 31. 94 mm, respectively. For all mesh sizes, very narrow selection ranges were observed.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of profile modification for reducing dynamic loads in gears with different <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> errors. The simulation examined varying amplitudes of spacing error and differences {{in the span of}} teeth over which the error occurs. The modification considered included both linear and parabolic tip relief. The analysis considered spacing error that varies around most of the gear circumference (similar to a typical sinusoidal error pattern) as well as a shorter span of spacing errors that occurs on only a few teeth. The dynamic analysis was performed using a revised version of a NASA gear dynamics code, modified to add <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> errors to the analysis. Results obtained from the investigation show that linear tip relief is more effective in reducing dynamic loads on gears with small spacing errors but parabolic tip relief becomes more effective as the amplitude of spacing error increases. In addition, the parabolic modification is more effective for the more severe error case where the error is spread over a longer span of teeth. The findings of this study can be used to design robust tooth profile modification for improving dynamic performance of gear sets with different <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> errors...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{to assess}} the effect of mesh size and <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> on the catch of Spisula solida were {{undertaken}} {{with the aim of}} determining an optimal combination of these two characteristics to minimize the dredging impact on by-catch species. However, our data showed that <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing,</b> mesh size and the interactions between these two factors did not affect the number of damaged macrofaunal individual’s caught. This may be because infauna entered the dredge without passing through the space between the teeth and the mesh of the net bag closed as it was stretched by the weight of the contents, preventing the escape of the caught individuals. Thus, independently of mesh size, when the dredge is towed over the sediment, the retained individuals were injured due to abrasion between animals and/or between animals and debris. The severity of injuries inflicted by dredging on different macrobenthic species is related to their morphology and fragility...|$|E
40|$|Machining is an {{industrial}} {{process in which}} parts are shaped by removal of unwanted material in the forms of chips. Manufacturing industry today demands shorter production times and high quality parts at competitive cost. Increased MRR (material removal rate) in milling and turning may provide high productivity but elevated forces and vibrations are still major obstacles to fulfill these requirements. Chatter vibrations may limit the full potential of machining productivity. In this thesis, chatter stability of multi delay systems is investigated. As examples of multi delay systems, variable <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> tools such as variable pitch and helix milling cutters and parallel milling operations are investigated. Although there are few studies about the chatter stability of variable <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> tools, no work has been reported on optimum design for a given cutting condition. Optimization studies are carried out to determine the optimum variable tool geometry and a new design methodology is presented. Moreover, for parallel milling operations, an analytical solution methodology {{which is based on}} frequency domain analysis is proposed to solve the chatter stability {{for the first time in}} the literature. Optimum cutting conditions are identified and effects of process parameters and workpiece dynamics on the chatter stability of parallel milling are shown. Since the operation contains single time delay, optimization studies are carried out to determine the optimum cutter dynamic properties in parallel turning. Simulated conditions are verified by time domain and experimental tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the state of the dentition of middle-aged and elderly Chinese in Hong Kong in terms of <b>teeth</b> present, <b>tooth</b> <b>spaces,</b> and prosthetic treatment received. In an oral health survey conducted in 1991 in Hong Kong, a sample of 372 35 - 44 -yr-olds and 537 noninstitutionalized 65 - 74 -yr-olds was interviewed and clinically examined. In all dentate subjects, each tooth was scored for the presence/absence of that <b>tooth,</b> a <b>tooth</b> <b>space</b> of 5. 5 mm which had not been treated, or the presence of a denture or pontic replacing that tooth. Each denture was assessed according to a set of criteria. None of the 35 - 44 -yr-olds were edentulous and the mean number of teeth present was 27. 5. About 40 % of the third molars and about 35 % of the mandibular first molars were missing. For only 1 % of the missing <b>teeth</b> had <b>space</b> closure resulted in missing teeth not being recorded as <b>tooth</b> <b>spaces</b> or treated <b>tooth</b> <b>spaces.</b> Overall, 72 % of the 35 - 44 -yr-olds had no prosthesis, 17 % had a bridge or bridges, 12 % had a denture or dentures, and 1 % had both. Of the 65 - 74 -yr-olds, 12 % were edentulous, and the dentate subjects had a mean number of 17 teeth present. About 70 % of the molars were missing. Overall, only 29 % of the elderly had no prosthesis, 52 % had a denture or dentures, 33 % had a bridge or bridges, and 13 % had both.

30|$|Long-term {{components}} of manufacturing errors mainly include eccentricity and accumulative pitch error. Yu et al. [18] employed a dynamic model of cylindrical geared rotor system {{to investigate the}} dynamic coupling behavior of transverse and rotational motions of gears subjected to gear eccentricities. The {{results indicated that the}} dynamic coupling behavior will become apparent in the low speed range when the resonances are excited by TVMS or profile errors. Wang et al. [19] presented theoretical formulas of no loaded static transmission error and time-varying backlash due to gear eccentricity, and developed a calculation method of dynamic transmission error for spur gears in consideration of gear eccentricities based on LS-DYNA 3 D. Xiang and Gao [20] studied the coupled torsion-bending vibration of a gear-rotor- bearing system in consideration of TVMS, gear eccentricity and nonlinear bearing force. The results suggested that the eccentricity has more significant effects on system vibration when the rotational speed is relatively lower. Umezawa and Sato [21] investigated the effect of accumulative pitch error on vibration acceleration of a spur gear pair, and drew the influence chart related with speed and contact ratio when accumulative pitch error is combined with other errors. Fernández-del-Rincón et al. [22] studied the loaded transmission error, pressure angle, as well as meshing force and bearing force of spur gears having index and run out errors under several transmitted torques. The results indicated that index errors will influence vibration behavior of the system and result in high overloads. Index errors will bring higher amplitude at the rotation frequency of shaft but run out errors will lead to lower values. Handschuh et al. [23], Talbot et al. [24] and Inalpolat et al. [25] performed numerical simulations and experiments to investigate the effect of <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> errors on the root stress, dynamic factors and dynamic transmission error of a spur gear pair, respectively. The results suggested that <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> errors have a direct impact on the root stress and significantly alter the baseline dynamic response.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the laser beam on chip {{formation}} when machining Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy has been investigated at different cutting speeds and laser powers. The characteristics of the segmented chip produced by laser-assisted machining (LAM) {{in terms of the}} tooth depth and <b>tooth</b> <b>spacing</b> were strongly dependent on the cutting speed and laser power. Two types of segmented chip formation processes were observed, one at low and the other at high cutting speeds with a continuous chip occurring between these two types of segmented chips. The critical cutting speed at which the transition from the sharp, segmented chip to the continuous chip occurred increased with laser power. To obtain the continuous chip, plastic deformation at the shear zone to match the deformation strain introduced by the cutting tool is required.
