50|$|During the Presidency of Joseph Banks {{the work}} of the Committee of Papers {{continued}} fairly efficiently, with the President himself in frequent attendance. There was a number of ways in which the President and Secretaries could bypass or subvert the Royal Society's publishing procedures.

5000|$|Dollar cost {{averaging}} {{is a form}} of product churn under certain conditions. In this strategy, an investor is advised to repeatedly buy or sell small lots of a security as the price changes. Each <b>transaction</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> commission fee. In this way the overall cost is averaged down as prices fall, and the investor is protected from market fluctuations which can be very difficult to accurately predict. The effectiveness of this as an investing strategy is open to debate, but it involves many transactions, creating brokerage commissions for the brokerage firm. Frequent trading in fee-based accounts is not an example of churning, since no commissions are generated in those transactions. However, the practice of putting clients who trade infrequently into a fee-based brokerage account is known as [...] "reverse churning", since clients are charged fees in accounts with few if any transactions.|$|R

40|$|At {{least since}} the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) first {{published}} its Forty Recommendations, financial institutions in FATF-compliant jurisdictions have been required to implement preventive measures that require FIs to identify customers, establish client profiles, monitor for unusual transactions, review those transactions {{to see if there}} was suspicion that they involved the proceeds of crime and, if so, report the transaction to the authorities in the form of a suspicious transaction report (STR). When these requirements were first established, neither financial institutions nor their supervisors/regulators had much experience as to what in a client 2 ̆ 7 s profile and the client 2 ̆ 7 s patterns of transactions might indicate money laundering. However, based on an expanding knowledge of how criminals tend to launder their money, over time financial institutions have developed increasingly effective detection and reporting systems. By studying known examples of laundering, the FATF, FATF-Style Regional Bodies, and national competent authorities (especially financial intelligence units) have identified patterns or indicators of possible money laundering, and made them available to financial institutions as money laundering typologies. In addition, there has been some feedback from financial intelligence units and other competent authorities to financial institutions with respect to their anti-money laundering programs. Using these sources, financial institutions have been able to develop systems to help them determine which <b>transactions</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> materially greater risk that laundering is involved...|$|R

40|$|Fragmentation of {{production}} into {{more and more}} complex supply chains is a prominent feature of globalisation. Transaction management purports to minimise the transaction costs associated with this fragmentation {{of production}}. In this era of globalisation, <b>transaction</b> costs <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> large weight in total costs of ownership which is the relevant cost function in procurement decisions. This article discusses how transaction management can be helpful to these procurement decisions. An analysis of {{the various types of}} transaction costs is essential in the 'make or buy' and location decisions in global sourcing. In general, a distinction can be made between 'hard' and 'soft' transaction costs when making strategic procurement decisions. Soft transaction costs are difficult to quantify but become more important now that formal trade barriers gradually disappear and transport costs are reduced. Business strategies to keep transaction costs low in the long run can also, to a considerable extent, explain socially responsible business conduct from the perspective of rational economic behaviour.

40|$|Self-Dealing {{within a}} Joint-Stock Company and a Limited Liability Company Martin Pástor The main {{aim of this}} thesis is to analyze the {{regulation}} of self-dealing in Czech law with a brief regard to theoretical fundamentals that influence the legal approach to such regulation and further to compare it with Slovak regulation of self-dealing and the future regulation of self-dealing after the recodification of private law in the Czech Republic. The regulation of self-dealing is provided for in section 196 a of the Commercial Code. This highly controversial provision causes many interpretation difficulties and strongly influences the legal certainty of entrepreneurs and non- entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic. As I mention in the introduction of this thesis, the legislator incorporated this provision into the Commercial Code due to negative experience of Czech society with so-called tunneling after the change of regime to capitalistic and with an intent to regulate transactions with conflicts of interests, in particular <b>transactions</b> <b>carried</b> out between <b>a</b> corporation and related persons.
