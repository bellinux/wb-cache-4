5|$|The storm {{first brought}} heavy {{rainfall}} to Jamaica, causing six deaths and some damage from mudslides. While crossing Cuba {{and later the}} Bahamas, the storm caused little impact, limited to some crop damage. As a subtropical storm, Gilda brought gusty winds and high waves <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east coast of the United States, causing minor beach erosion and coastal property damage.|$|E
5|$|According to Turkish {{traveller}} Evliya Çelebi, {{who visited}} the city in 1670, at that time there were 200 houses within the castle, 200 in the Christian eastern neighborhood of Kyçyk Varosh (meaning small neighborhood outside the castle), 150 houses in the Byjyk Varosh (meaning big neighborhood outside the castle), and six additional neighborhoods: Palorto, Vutosh, Dunavat, Manalat, Haxhi Bey, and Memi Bey, extending on eight hills around the castle. According to the traveller, the city had at that time around 2000 houses, eight mosques, three churches, 280 shops, five fountains, and five inns. From the 16th century until the early 19th century Gjirokastër {{went from being a}} predominantly Christian city to one with a Muslim majority due <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban population converting to Islam alongside an influx of Muslim converts from the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolution, George Rogers Clark was sent from Virginia to enforce its claim <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land in the Great Lakes region. In July 1778, Clark and about 175men crossed the Ohio River and took control of Kaskaskia, Vincennes, and several other villages in British Indiana. The occupation was accomplished without firing a shot because Clark carried letters from the French ambassador stating that France supported the Americans. These letters made most of the French and Native American inhabitants of the area unwilling to support the British.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{attention}} created by the Beatles' song, the street signs for Blue Jay Way have long been collector's items for fans visiting the Hollywood Hills. In May 2015, a lane in the Heavitree area of Exeter, in the English county of Devon, was named Blue Jay Way after the song. In addition <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filming for Magical Mystery Tour having taken place at various locations in the West Country, the title commemorates the Beatles' three concert appearances at Exeter's ABC Cinema over 1963–64.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, and {{the siege}} of Basing House between 1643 and 1645, the town played host to large numbers of Parliamentarians. During this time, St. Michael's Church was damaged whilst being used as an {{explosive}} store and lead was stripped {{from the roof of}} the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, Basingstoke leading to its eventual ruin. It had been incorporated in 1524, but was effectively out of use after the Civil War. The 17th century saw serious damage <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town and its churches, because of the great fires of 1601 and 1656. Cromwell is thought to have stayed here towards the end of {{the siege of}} Basing House, and wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons addressed from Basingstoke.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, {{moisture}} from Bonnie {{combined with a}} cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Arkansas, lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city of Rison after striking a transformer. Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where awnings were blown off homes, structures sustained roof damage, and trees were felled. Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding, covering several highways. Throughout the state, storm damage was estimated at $356,000 (2010USD).|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{video game}} {{developers}} Wolf Team {{signed a deal}} with publisher Namco to release the game that would be Tales of Phantasia, which was later released in 1995 in Japan for the Super Famicom. However, the development cycle for this game was plagued with creative disputes between the developers and publisher, leading <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development team leaving {{to form a new}} company, which would become tri-Ace, which explains some of the common themes between the games, such as the similar battle systems.|$|E
5|$|Innocent {{gave some}} dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic {{communities}} {{were allowed to}} celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches {{appear to have been}} steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} boats were built beside the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. Richard Dunston {{set up a}} boatyard at Thorne, on the north bank just below the lock, in 1858, after selling his {{previous}} boatyard at Torksey. He initially constructed clinker-built sailing barges, capable of carrying up to 80 tons. The boatyard was fairly self-contained, using timber which was grown locally and was sawn by hand at the yard. It included a ropewalk, which made ropes for many industries in the locality, {{as well as for}} rigging of the boats, and supplied sails, masts and chandlery <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Humber region. Gradually, carvel-built barges with their smoother hulls replaced clinker-built ones, and boat sizes became more standard, with Sheffield-sized keels and larger sloops. Shortly after Richard's grandson took over the yard in 1910, it was remodelled to build iron and steel ships, and only one wooden boat was built subsequently.|$|E

5|$|Lawrence {{was hired}} as an {{associate}} professor of physics at the University of California in 1928, and two years later became a full professor, becoming the university's youngest professor. Robert Gordon Sproul, who became university president the day after Lawrence became a professor, {{was a member of the}} Bohemian Club, and he sponsored Lawrence's membership in 1932. Through this club, Lawrence met William Henry Crocker, Edwin Pauley, and John Francis Neylan. They were influential men who helped him obtain money for his energetic nuclear particle investigations. There was great hope for medical uses to come from the development of particle physics, and this led <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early funding for advances Lawrence was able to obtain.|$|E
5|$|Much like {{drum and}} bass before it, dubstep started to become {{incorporated}} into other media. In 2007, Benga, Skream, and other dubstep producers provided the soundtrack <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second series of Dubplate Drama, which aired on Channel 4 with a soundtrack CD later released on Rinse Recordings. A track by Skream also {{featured in the}} second series of the teen drama Skins, which also aired on Channel 4 in early 2008.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{initially}} moved little, Bret brought prolonged overcast conditions <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern Bahamas, {{with most}} of the activity over the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama. An estimated 3 in (75mm) of precipitation fell in Abaco over the weekend of July 1617. In addition, a weather station on the island reported gale-force gusting of up to 48mph (77km/h) {{at the height of the}} storm. The rain led to the cancellation of a local Little League baseball match. Outer rainbands spawned a waterspout that touched down on eastern Paradise Island, accompanied by lightning strikes and torrents. Nevertheless, locals considered the storm's impact to be generally positive, as its rains aided in alleviating mild drought conditions across the nation.|$|E

5|$|Surviving {{letters from}} the precentor of Chichester Cathedral beg the bishop to come to Chichester over Easter to {{celebrate}} the Easter Mass {{and to deal with}} pressing issues in the diocese. Neville's duties as chancellor kept him from attending <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business of his diocese, but he employed clerics to administer the ecclesiastical offices of his diocese and in general his relationship with his cathedral chapter appears to have been good. He employed a teacher of theology for his cathedral, and supported students at schools in Lincoln, Oxford, and Douai. He worked to protect the rights, lands, and privileges of his diocese and cathedral chapter from encroachment by others, both secular and clerical. On one occasion he threatened to excommunicate the Earl of Arundel or the earl's men for hunting on land the bishop considered to be his own.|$|E
5|$|The Sonic X-treme debacle {{has been}} cited {{as a reason for}} the {{ultimate}} failure of the Sega Saturn. With the Sonic the Hedgehog series being attributed <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> success of the company's prior system, the Genesis, and Sony and Nintendo both having flagship 3D platformers available early in the life cycle of their consoles (Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, respectively), Sega was expected by fans to follow suit and produce an official 3D Sonic game. With the game's cancellation, the Saturn never did receive an exclusive Sonic platform game, but rather only the Genesis port of Sonic 3D Blast; Sonic Jam, a compilation of the 2D Genesis Sonic titles; and Sonic R, a racing game. Sonic's debut in a full 3D platform game was not until 1998, with Sonic Adventure as a Dreamcast launch title, well after the discontinuation of the Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Emily was a weak Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone that brought torrential rains <b>to</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern Caribbean in 2011. The fifth named storm {{of the annual}} hurricane season, Emily developed from a strong but poorly organized tropical wave that tracked the open Atlantic for several days in late July. On August1, it approached the Lesser Antilles and became better defined, producing inclement weather {{over much of the}} area. Two days later, the disturbance developed a closed wind circulation center, marking the formation of Tropical Storm Emily. The storm remained fairly disorganized as it proceeded into the Caribbean, though it generated strong thunderstorms and gusty winds along its path. On August4, Emily was declassified as a {{tropical cyclone}}, after the mountainous areas of Hispaniola disrupted its weak circulation. Upon exiting the northeastern Caribbean on August6, its remnants regenerated into a tropical storm, ultimately dissipating the next day.|$|E
