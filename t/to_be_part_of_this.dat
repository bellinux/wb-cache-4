25|$|Sarajevo is and has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} most important musical enclaves in the region. The Sarajevo school of pop rock developed in the city between 1961 and 1991. This type of music began with bands like Indexi, Pro Arte, and singer-songwriter Kemal Monteno. It continued into the 1980s, with bands such as Plavi Orkestar, Crvena Jabuka, and Divlje Jagode, by most accounts, pioneering the regional rock and roll movement. Sarajevo was also the home and birthplace of arguably the most popular and influential Yugoslav rock band of all time, Bijelo Dugme, somewhat of a Bosnian parallel to the Rolling Stones, in both popularity and influence. Sarajevo was also the home of a very notable post-punk urban subculture known as the New Primitives, which began during the early 1980s with the Baglama Band which was banned shortly after first LP and was brought into the mainstream through bands such as Zabranjeno Pušenje and Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors, as well as the Top Lista Nadrealista radio, and later television show. Other notable bands considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> subculture are Bombaj Štampa. Besides and separately from the New Primitives, Sarajevo is the hometown to one of the most significant ex-Yugoslavian alternative industrial-noise bands, SCH (1983–current).|$|E

500|$|Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina on 6October 1908, {{which caused}} the Annexation Crisis in Europe. The Kingdom of Serbia protested and mobilised its army, but then on 31March 1909, it {{formally}} accepted the annexation. In 1911, Mladen Stojanović {{became a member}} of the secret association of students of the Tuzla gymnasium called Narodno Jedinstvo (National Unity); its members described it as a youth society of nationalists. It was one of a group of diverse student organisations later called Young Bosnia, which strongly opposed Austria-Hungary's rule over Bosnia-Herzegovina. The activists of Young Bosnia were Bosnian Serbs, Muslims, and Croats, though most were Serbs. The first organisation regarded <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group was established in 1904 by Serb students of the Mostar gymnasium. 1905 saw considerable political unrest among the Serb and Croat students of the Tuzla gymnasium. Although the provincial government imposed the name [...] "Bosnian" [...] on the language of the province (Serbo-Croatian), the students demonstratively termed it as Serbian or Croatian depending on their ethnic affiliation.|$|E

My hope is we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio call and say they would be foolish enough not to connect these things." [...] He did state that [...] "you can't tell this story without" [...] acknowledging that Legion is the son of Charles Xavier, who appears in the films. This acknowledgement comes in [...] "Chapter 7", with the appearance of Xavier's signature wheelchair in one of Haller's memories. Hawley explained that Haller would look to learn more of his father in future seasons, with Xavier potentially making a physical appearance in the series at that point.|$|E
500|$|Speed Grapher {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Zac Bertschy and Theron Martin of Anime News Network both found the animation to be sub-par {{when compared to}} other Gonzo releases. In addition, Zac found the storyline to be [...] "totally silly" [...] and strange though it was possibly very entertaining because of its uniqueness. Theron found that later episodes felt [...] "more natural" [...] and cited the characters <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> improvement, though the animation was [...] "still second-class (at best)." [...] Compared to the Japanese release, Theron Martin greatly preferred the English dubs, noting that [...] "the English dialogue has more punch and better flow than the drier and sometimes awkwardly-worded Japanese." [...] Tasha Robinson of Sci Fi Weekly found Speed Grapher to have a [...] "rich feel that's mirrored in the lovely visuals" [...] and a complicated storyline. She also commented that [...] "Its dry, serious central plotline is also clearly aimed at viewers who value sophisticated, drawn-out serial stories over instant gratification." [...] D. F. Smith of IGN disliked the storyline, though for different reasons. He felt that the series was [...] "trying way too hard to push the content envelope" [...] and that the characters were not likable. However, in contrast to the Anime News Network reviewers, he found the art and animation to be a [...] "first-rate job." ...|$|E

500|$|The 167 Bikini islanders {{first learned}} their fate four days later, on Sunday, February 10, when Navy Commodore Ben H. Wyatt, United States {{military}} {{governor of the}} Marshall Islands, arrived by seaplane from Kwajalein. Referring to Biblical stories which they had learned from Protestant missionaries, he compared them to [...] "the children of Israel whom the Lord saved from their enemy and led into the Promised Land." [...] He also claimed it was [...] "for the good of mankind and to end all world wars." [...] There was no signed agreement, but he reported by cable [...] "their local chieftain, referred to as King Juda, arose {{and said that the}} natives of Bikini were very proud <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> wonderful undertaking." [...] On March 6, Wyatt attempted to stage a filmed reenactment of the February 10 meeting in which the Bikinians had given away their atoll. Despite repeated promptings and at least seven retakes, Juda confined his on-camera remarks to, [...] "We are willing to go. Everything is in God's hands." [...] The next day, LST-861 moved them and their belongings [...] east to the uninhabited Rongerik Atoll, to begin a permanent exile. Three Bikini families returned in 1974 but were evacuated again in 1978 because of radioactivity in their bodies from four years of eating contaminated food.

500|$|Tchaikovsky's music {{remained}} {{popular in}} Russia {{as well as}} abroad, and his scholarly prowess was admired by the Belyayev circle; however, these composers chose not to emulate his style. Composers who wished <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group and desired Belyayev's patronage had to write in a musical style approved by Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. That approved style, Maes writes, included harmonies from the coronation scene in Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov, the colorful harmonization and octotonicism of Rimsky-Korsakov's operas Mlada and Sadko, and Balakirev's folk-song stylizations. These elements [...] "served as a store of recipes for writing Russian national music. In the portrayal of the national character... these techniques prevailed over the subjects portrayed." [...] Taruskin writes that echoing this style of writing became the prime order of business, with absolute music such as symphonies and chamber works preferred over the program music favored by The Five, and quasi-oriental themes such as those used in Balakirev's Islamey and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade scoffed at. The trend toward writing in the preferred style would continue at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory after Rimsky-Korsakov's retirement in 1906, with his son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg in charge of composition classes at the Conservatory through the 1920s. Dmitri Shostakovich would complain about Steinberg's musical conservatism, typified by such phrases as [...] "the inviolable foundations of the kuchka", and the [...] "sacred traditions of Nikolai Andreyevich [...] ". (Kuchka, short for Moguchaya kuchka or [...] "Mighty Handful", was another name for The Five.) Eventually, the Belyayev aesthetic spread as more of its composers took up academic posts in music conservatories throughout Russia. Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov became director of the Moscow Conservatory, where Tchaikovsky had once exerted great influence, and Reinhold Glière likewise in Kiev, ensuring that these institutes [...] "retained a direct link with the Belyayev aesthetic".|$|E
