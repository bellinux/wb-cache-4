50|$|Under the Ukrainian laws, {{the districts}} have both {{administrative}} and municipal status, {{while under the}} Russian laws the districts are purely administrative and have no further divisions. Within the Russian municipal framework, however, <b>the</b> territory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal city <b>of</b> Sevastopol is divided into nine municipal okrugs and <b>the</b> Town <b>of</b> Inkerman. While individual municipal divisions are contained within <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> administrative districts, they are not otherwise related to <b>the</b> administrative districts. <b>The</b> <b>borders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipal okrugs are unchanged from <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipalities which exist under the Ukrainian law.|$|R

5|$|A {{topographic}} map {{shows that the}} majority of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landscape is the Canada–US border. This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E

5|$|Actual {{purification}} of {{the waste}} water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about {{one third of the}} polluted water, and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E
5|$|Cumberland {{is located}} at the {{junction}} of Cumberland Avenue and the Kennedy Expressway (I-90, exit 79). The station is located in the O'Hare neighborhood of Chicago on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norwood Park neighborhood. It is the closest 'L' station to the city of Park Ridge, which borders Chicago along Higgins Road north of the station. The area surrounding the station consists of a mixture of planned development, commercial, and residential areas. Citicorp Plaza, an office building which houses the headquarters of telecommunications provider U.S. Cellular, is located to the south of Cumberland at 8410 W. Bryn Mawr. The Renaissance Chicago O'Hare Suites Hotel is also located near the station at 8500 W. Bryn Mawr.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose a threat to the highly populated region.|$|E

5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mirror.|$|E
5|$|In 1637 Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania died. He was {{the last}} of the Slavic Griffins Dynasty of the Duchy of Pomerania.

Słupsk Land was also sought by Władysław IV at the peace conference, but it ended up a part of Brandenburg, which after the Peace of Westphalia controlled all of Pomerania adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth, extending south to where it met with Habsburg lands.
