His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>book</b> for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>book</b> at his show, making Jenna very proud of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E
25|$|An often-used {{analogy to}} explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>book</b> for the Internet by {{translating}} human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.119 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 (IPv6). Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue {{to use the same}} host name. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and e-mail addresses without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.|$|E

Despite Anka's original version totaling six minutes and 29 seconds, Streisand's is considerably shorter at three minutes and 52 seconds. On Anka's self-written book My Way: An Autobiography, he wrote that {{he was surprised to}} learn that Streisand's then-boyfriend Jon Peters was the one who produced the track: [...] "Peters was still her hairdresser. Next thing you know he's her producer, and he's produced mega motion pictures". However, he also acknowledged Streisand's rendition: [...] "Barbra can sing <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>book.</b> She has no problem singing anything. She's got one of the great voices".

I found it exciting to play such massive emotions and deal with such interesting, to say the least, situations. I saw it as a huge challenge, and I have huge admiration for this character. A lot of people might consider her to be sort of evil or bad, but I think she's wonderful. She's just a survivor, doing what she's got to do." ...|$|E
500|$|On ButterFly, Streisand {{departed}} from the pop and rock influences that were strong on her previous efforts and instead relied more {{on a variety of}} experimental, contemporary pop music. The singer also explored the reggae and classic R genres that were, at the time, popular on mainstream radio. The album opens with a [...] "seductive" [...] version of [...] "Love in the Afternoon", a song originally performed by American singer Evie Sands earlier in 1974. It was written by Sands, Ben Geminaro, and Richard Wiseman; production of [...] "Love in the Afternoon" [...] and all songs on ButterFly were solely handled by Peters. [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] is track two and a cover of Bob Marley's 1971 single. One of the reggae songs on the album, it features [...] "risqué lyrics" [...] that suggest that guava jelly {{could be used as a}} type of sexual lubricant. Bill Withers's R ballad [...] "Grandma's Hands" [...] follows and is primarily a [...] "gospel-flavored" [...] song. Lyrically, it details a woman who shares a strong bond with her grandmother. [...] "I Won't Last a Day Without You" [...] is the fourth track and a cover of the Carpenters' 1974 single; it was written by Paul Williams and Roger Nichols. The album's second and final single, [...] "Jubilation", was a song made famous by Paul Anka in 1972. In response to Streisand's rendition of the track, Anka questioned her decision to have Peters produce but remarked, [...] "Barbra can sing <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>book.</b> She has no problem singing anything.

Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks him up in <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>book</b> and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added {{that there was a}} danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she had no idea who they were.
