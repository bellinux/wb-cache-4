5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving {{drinking and driving}} and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E

40|$|First-order shear {{deformation}} theories, one proposed by Reissner {{and another one}} by Mindlin, are widely in use, even today, because of their simplicity. In this paper two new displacement based first-order {{shear deformation}} theories involving only two unknown functions, as against three functions in case of Reissners and Mindlin's <b>theories,</b> <b>are</b> introduced. For static problems, governing equations {{of one of the}} proposed <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> uncoupled.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name of the pub is unclear, but one {{reported}} <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> that it was named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664. Local people say that one of the beams in the pub comes from the ship, the remains of which may have been broken up at a nearby shipyard after the battle. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> that it was named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed.

5|$|An {{important}} parameter {{determining the}} future {{evolution of the}} Universe <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> the density parameter, Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density.

5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.|$|E

50|$|Before the 1990s, string theorists {{believed}} {{there were five}} distinct superstring theories: type I, types IIA and IIB, and the two heterotic string theories (SO(32) and E8×E8). The thinking was that out of these five candidate <b>theories,</b> only one <b>was</b> the actual <b>theory</b> of everything, and that <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> the <b>theory</b> whose low energy limit, with ten dimensions spacetime compactified down to four, matched the physics observed in our world today. It is now known that the five superstring <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> not fundamental, but are instead different limits of a more fundamental theory, dubbed M-theory. These <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> related by transformations called dualities. If two <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> related by a duality transformation, each observable of the first <b>theory</b> can <b>be</b> mapped {{in some way to}} the second theory to yield equivalent predictions. The two <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> then said to be dual to one another under that transformation. Put differently, the two <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> two mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. A simple example of a duality is the equivalence of particle physics upon replacing matter with antimatter; describing our universe in terms of anti-particles would yield identical predictions for any possible experiment.|$|R
50|$|In 1978 {{he showed}} that the maximum {{dimension}} of supersymmetric <b>theories</b> <b>was</b> d = 11.

5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which would lead to more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds.

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{does not}} place any {{limits on the}} possible dimensions of spacetime. Although the <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> typically formulated in four dimensions, one can write down the same equations for the gravitational field {{in any number of}} dimensions. Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of dimensions. In 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> eleven. In the same year, Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way.
