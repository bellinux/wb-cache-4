40|$|The {{issue of}} sources of {{law has been}} a matter of {{considerable}} attention not only in legal theory and philosophy but also in positive law disciplines. Sources of law are commonly divided into substantive, formal and value-based sources. Depending on classifications suggested by different authors, general principles of law may fall into all three categories of sources of law. General principles of domestic law are rules covering a vast number of specific situations which are subsequently used as grounds for generating numerous norms regulating these situations in more detail. In international law, there are general principles of international law as well as legal principles recognized by civilized nations. General <b>principles</b> of <b>the</b> European Union law {{are an integral part of}} the positive EU legislation, which clearly differentiates them from similar sets of general goals, objectives, values, agenda postulates, and the like. <b>The</b> general <b>principles</b> of EU law are have their origins in the Founding Treaties, the legal systems of the Member States and the case law of the EU Court of Justice. Considering their content and legal nature, <b>the</b> general <b>principles</b> of EU law are divided into: compulsory or axiomatic principles, regulatory or structural principles (which all national laws of the Member States have in common), and <b>the</b> general <b>principles</b> inherent to <b>the</b> EU legal order. Some of the most important general principles of EU law are: <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of supremacy of EU law over the national law, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of direct effect of EU law, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of autonomy of EU law, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of full effect of EU law, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of State liability for damage, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of legality, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of legal certainty, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of good faith and fair dealing, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of fair hearing, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of subsidiarity, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of proportionality, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of loyalty, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of non-discrimination, etc...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>principle</b> of {{equality}} of arms is firmly {{entrenched in the}} jurisprudence of international tribunals, but hardly at all in domestic systems.

After examining the normative value of <b>the</b> <b>principle,</b> <b>the</b> article refers to a number of domestic jurisdictions that have applied <b>the</b> <b>principle.</b> It also examines the general acceptability {{of equality}} and fairness in Botswana case law. This represents a foundation for applying <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> in Botswana. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> was developed by the European Court of Human Rights, creating its own concept of fairness in trials, irrespective of the position in domestic systems.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the third and most disputed {{principle}} of John Rawls’s theory of justice: <b>the</b> so-called difference <b>principle.</b> My reasoning has three parts.

A proper understanding of <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> permits me to spend {{the second half of the}} paper with exploring <b>the</b> difficulties <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> encounters. I first discuss four well-known objections and argue that all of them, partly or entirely, hold against <b>the</b> <b>principle.</b> I then discuss the applicability of <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> with special attention to the relations among <b>the</b> three Rawlsian <b>principles</b> and <b>the</b> notion of the social minimum. Investigation of the first issue shows that <b>the</b> two other <b>principles</b> leave enough room for <b>the</b> difference <b>principle,</b> whereas in <b>the</b> second case I conclude that parties to the Rawlsian original position would prefer a social minimum <b>principle</b> to <b>the</b> difference <b>principle.</b> Finally, at <b>the</b> end of the paper, I briefly summarize my reasoning repeating its most important findings...|$|R
