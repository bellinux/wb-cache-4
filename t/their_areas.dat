5|$|Ap Bac had {{far-reaching}} {{consequences for}} the South Vietnamese government and the American involvement in Vietnam. The battle was a milestone for the Viet Cong. For individual Viet Cong soldiers, the battle demonstrated they could defeat nominally superior ARVN forces, well equipped as they were with up-to-date military hardware and significant support and funding from the United States. Militarily, the morale and confidence of Viet Cong commanders and soldiers, who had experienced serious setbacks in the previous year, were greatly boosted. Politically, the Viet Cong 261st and 514th Battalions were able to exploit the prestige gained from having inflicted disproportionate losses on the ARVN forces to exercise greater influence in <b>their</b> <b>areas</b> of operations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton {{experienced}} rapid residential growth, stimulated by the railways running through <b>their</b> <b>areas,</b> with landowners in both areas profiting from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less accessible to the railways, the parishes of Merton and Morden, which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new line through the area and increase the value of the land.|$|E

5|$|Outside of Trenggalek, Sudirman and {{his group}} were stopped by TNI {{soldiers}} belonging to 102Battalion. These soldiers, who were told that Sudirmanâ€“ who was in civilian clothes and unrecognised by the troops holding themâ€“ was a prisoner, refused to allow the group to pass; they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, things which may have belonged to spies. When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men were right to guard <b>their</b> <b>areas</b> diligently, Fanani called a post in Kediri and ordered that a car be sent {{to pick up the}} general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; as they left the city on 24December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri.|$|E

40|$|Expert chess players, {{specialized}} in different openings, recalled positions and solved problems {{within and outside}} <b>their</b> <b>area</b> of specialization. While their general expertise was at a similar level players performed better with stimuli from <b>their</b> <b>area</b> of specialization. The effect of specialization on both recall and problem solving {{was strong enough to}} override general expertise â€“ players remembering positions and solving problems from <b>their</b> <b>area</b> of specialization performed at around the level of players one standard deviation above them in general skill. Their problem solving strategy also changed depending on whether the problem was within <b>their</b> <b>area</b> of specialization or not. When it was, they searched more in depth and less in breadth; with problems outside <b>their</b> <b>area</b> of specialization, the reverse. The knowledge that comes from familiarity with a problem area is more important than general purpose strategies in determining how an expert will tackle it. These results demonstrate the link in experts between problem solving and memory of specific experiences and indicate that the search for context independent general purpose problem solving strategies to teach to future experts is unlikely to be successful...|$|R

5|$|The first phase, {{known as}} the â€˜orange phaseâ€™, was {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} because it provided South Vietnamese units in I Corps with a platform to stop enemy attacks, and even attack them if necessary. To accomplish the objectives of the â€˜orange phaseâ€™, General TrÆ°á»Ÿng placed several elite combat units such as the Ranger groups and armoured forces on constant combat alert. The second phase, {{known as the}} â€˜green phaseâ€™, was designed to delay enemy forces and buy more time for the South Vietnamese to regroup in order to stage a counter-attack, in the scenario that enemy forces managed to overcome the â€˜orange phaseâ€™. In the final phase, or the â€˜blue phasesâ€™, require South Vietnamese units to secure <b>their</b> <b>areas</b> of defence, then destroy and push enemy forces out of I Corps.|$|E
5|$|The rebel bands {{had worked}} {{independently}} {{of each other}} until July, when al-Hajj Muhammad, Arif Abd al-Raziq and Fakhri Abd al-Hadi decided to coordinate the actions of their respective militias. Abd al-Raziq was based in the Bani Sa'b area around Tayibe, while Abd al-Hadi operated in Sha'ruwiya, around Arraba. All of <b>their</b> <b>areas</b> of operation were concentrated in the north-central highlands. Another meeting between the leaders was held in August to designate official areas of operation and specific targets to attack. The Jerusalem-area militia of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni was absent from both of these meetings, making {{it increasingly difficult to}} form a solid military command among rebels across the country.|$|E

5|$|When the Chetnik leaders {{appointed}} by DraÅ¾a MihailoviÄ‡, Majors BoÅ¡ko TodoroviÄ‡ and DangiÄ‡, {{became aware of}} the commencement of Operation Southeast Croatia, they advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans, and {{there was no need for}} the Chetniks to get involved. Following this, their units withdrew from their positions on the front line, let the Germans pass through <b>their</b> <b>areas,</b> or went home. Many withdrew across the Drina into German-occupied Serbia to avoid being engaged, which severely weakened the Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory. These actions severed any remaining cooperative links that remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated <b>their</b> <b>areas</b> of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E
5|$|As Steinhauer {{noted in}} his autobiography, the UK was a {{dangerous}} environment for a foreign agent. Only five years previously, the country {{had not had a}} dedicated counter-espionage organisation. In 1909 a series of spy scares fanned by the press led to the establishment of the Secret Service Bureau, jointly headed by Captain Vernon Kell and Lieutenant-Commander Mansfield Cumming. They soon split their responsibilities; Kell took charge of counter-espionage, while Cumming focused on foreign intelligence. These two divisions of the Secret Service Bureau eventually became two independent intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6. The Bureau quickly identified a list of possible German agents in the UK. Just before the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, Chief Constables across Britain and Ireland were instructed to arrest suspects in <b>their</b> <b>areas.</b> This was done quickly and a number of German agents were caught, crippling German intelligence operations in the UK at a crucial moment in the war. Steinhauer himself had been lucky to escape arrest; he was known by name to the British authorities and he had been spying on the Royal Navy in Scotland as recently as late June 1914.|$|E
