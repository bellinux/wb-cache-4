Paralympic cross-country skiing includes standing events, sitting events (for wheelchair users), and events for visually impaired athletes under {{the rules of the}} International Paralympic Committee. These are divided into several categories for people who are missing limbs, have amputations, are blind, or have any other physical disability, to continue <b>their</b> <b>sport.</b>|$|E
5|$|The BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award is {{the main}} award of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony, which takes place each December.

The winner is selected by a public-vote from a pre-determined shortlist. The most recent award winner is tennis player Andy Murray, who won in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{exclusion}} of professionals caused several controversies {{throughout the history}} of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds. Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with <b>their</b> <b>sport</b> and were thus considered professionals.|$|E

5|$|Johns Hopkins University, located {{north of}} the Naval Academy, in Baltimore, started their {{football}} program a couple years after Navy. Hopkins' first team was assembled in 1881, and spent an entire year training and learning {{a version of the}} game. <b>Their</b> <b>sport,</b> which was closer to rugby, was played in Druid Hill Park. After the training, the team planned a two-game 1882 season. The squad had to play the season under the title of the Clifton Athletic Club, due to the school's policy on the sport of football. The first was a practice game with the Baltimore Athletic Club, played on October 7. The Hopkins team lost the contest 4–0. The following game was their first true game, to be played against the Naval Academy.|$|E
5|$|The British cyclists, {{for example}} doubled their medal target on 19 August when Victoria Pendleton won Britain's 12th cycling medal, a {{gold in the}} women's sprint. A further two medals were already {{guaranteed}} {{at this stage in}} the men's individual sprint, where gold and silver were soon won by Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny respectively. In all Team GB won seven of the ten gold medals up for grabs at the velodrome. The swimmers also managed to double the targeted number of medals in <b>their</b> <b>sport</b> when David Davies won the team's sixth swimming medal– a silver medal in the men's 10 km open water marathon on 21 August. Despite the men's and women's archery teams having come second and third respectively at the 2007 world championships, British archers were unable to win either of their targeted medals. This led to criticism of the tactics used by head coach Peter Suk from members of the team.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of decompression techniques {{is another matter}} altogether. Recreational divers are expected not to do decompression dives by most certification organizations, though CMAS and BSAC allow for short decompression dives in some levels of recreational divers. Technical, commercial, military and scientific divers may all be expected to do decompression dives in {{the normal course of}} <b>their</b> <b>sport</b> or occupation, and are specifically trained in appropriate procedures and equipment relevant to their level of certification. A significant part of practical and theoretical training for these divers is on the {{practice of}} safe and effective decompression procedures and the selection and use of the appropriate equipment.|$|E

25|$|An athlete {{may choose}} to leave <b>their</b> <b>sport</b> due to many reasons, either due to an injury or due to them {{reaching}} an old age. If an athlete becomes injured, this must be looked deeper into, as an injury can vary between very subtle and very dangerous. If the athlete loves <b>their</b> <b>sport,</b> they will sometimes hide {{the severity of the}} injury and just wait till it heals slightly {{in order for them to}} get playing as soon as possible, which could cause catastrophic injuries later on in their career. This is why injuries need to be looked into, because if the injury is too extreme where the athlete can't physically go back to playing <b>their</b> <b>sport,</b> they may get forced to retire in order for them not to damage themselves at a more extreme level, resulting in the athlete experiencing many different feelings, such as alienation, distress or uselessness.|$|E
