40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate whether corpus luteum (CL) of the buffalo cow undergoes luteal regression by the process of apoptosis, and to examine the involvement of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases during PGF 2 a-induced luteolysis. Sections of CL from late-estrous cycle i. e., during spontaneous luteolysis, stained for DAPI revealed increased number of condensed nuclei indicating cell death by apoptosis confirmed further by the occurrence of pronounced oligonucleosome formation. For morphological and biochemical characterization during PGF 2 a-induced apoptosis, CL were collected at 0, 4, 12 and 18 h after injection of 750 mg of <b>Tiaprost,</b> a synthetic analog of PGF 2 a to mid-estrous cycle buffalo cows. Serum P 4 concentrations fell within 4 h and decreased (p 5 fold increase (p < 0. 05) in the low molecular weight DNA fragments by 18 h post injection. Immunoblot analysis of CL tissue lysates showed increased (p < 0. 05) levels of phospho-JNK 1 (4 - 14 fold during 4 - 18 h) and phospho-p 38 (2 - 4 fold at 18 h). Immunohistochemistry of CL sections revealed an increased nuclear localization of phospho-JNK after treatment. These findings demonstrate that CL of the buffalo cow undergoes cell death by the process of apoptosis both during spontaneous and PGF 2 a-induced luteolysis, and that MAP kinases are involved during PGF 2 a-mediated apoptosis in the CL...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a protocol for the synchronization of ovulation followed by timed AI (Ovsynch) was {{compared with a}} reproductive protocol {{based on the results}} of rectal palpation. Further objectives were to analyze the timing of ovulation in the Ovsynch group by ultrasound and the conception rate after different times of ovulation. Additionally, the effect of the stage of estrous cycle at the start of the Ovsynch protocol on conception rate was investigated. The stage of the estrous cycle was determined by milk progesterone assay. The study was conducted on a commercial dairy farm in Brandenburg, Germany. Cows in the Ovsynch group (n= 366) were treated between 61 and 69 days postpartum (d. p. p.) with 0. 02 mg of Buserelin (Receptal ?) intramusculary (i. m.) at a random stage of the estrous cycle. Seven days later 0. 75 mg of <b>Tiaprost</b> (Iliren C ?) were administered i. m. to regress the corpus luteum (C. l.). All cows received a second injection with 0. 02 mg of Buserelin 48 hrs later and were inseminated 16 - 20 hrs after the second Buserelin injection (72. - 78. dpp). Cows in the Prostaglandin F 2 a group (n= 350) were examined by rectal palpation between 61 and 69 d. p. p. If a C. l. had been diagnosed, cows were administered 0. 75 mg of <b>Tiaprost</b> to induce estrus. Cows were inseminated on observed estrus. Cows not inseminated within 14 days after treatment were examined again between 83 and 89 d. p. p. For both groups, the voluntary waiting period was set at 72 d. p. p. Service rate was higher, days to first service and days open were shorter in the Ovsynch group (p Prostaglandin F 2 a group. In both groups, first service conception rate was higher for primiparous cows than for multiparous cows. However, the differences were not significant. An economic evaluation for the total costs per pregnancy in 71 different cost scenarios showed only slight differences between the groups. Mean costs per pregnancy were ý 271. 02 and ý 273. 72 for the Ovsynch and the Prostaglandin F 2 a group, respectively. In the Ovsynch group, ovaries were scanned via ultrasonography four times in each cow: at the time of the second GnRH injection, at the time of AI, as well as 26 hrs and 40 hrs after the second GnRH injection. Synchronization-rate was 87. 0 %. The percentage of follicles ovulating between 0 to 17 hrs and 17 to 26 hrs and 26 to 40 hrs was 9. 4 %, 20. 3 % and 57. 2 %, respectively. First service conception rate did not differ significantly between the ovulation intervals. The avarage circumference of the follicles at ovulation was 49. 1 mm. Size of the follicle differed not between the ovulation intervals. Milk samples were collected seven days prior to first GnRH injection, at the first GnRH and PGF 2 a injections. The first two milk samples were collected to determine stage of estrous cycle at the start of the Ovsynch protocol. The third milk sample was collected to determine the presence of a C. l. at the time of PGF 2 a injection. First service conception rate was not influenced by the stage of estrous cycle at the start of the protocol (p> 0. 05). A corpus luteum was demonstrated in 60. 7 % of cows at the time of PGF 2 a treatment. First service conception rate was higher for cows with a C. l. at the time of the luteolytic treatment. However, the difference was not significant...|$|E
40|$|In bovines {{characterization}} of biochemical and molecular determinants {{of the dominant}} follicle before and during different time intervals after gonadotrophin surge requires precise identification of the dominant follicle from a follicular wave. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to standardize an experimental model in buffalo cows for accurately identifying the dominant follicle of the first wave of follicular growth and characterize changes in follicular fluid hormone concentrations as well as expression patterns of various genes associated with the process of ovulation. From the day of estrus (day 0), animals were subjected to blood sampling and ultrasonography for monitoring circulating progesterone levels and follicular growth. On day 7 of the cycle, animals were administered a PGF 2 α analogue (<b>Tiaprost</b> Trometamol, 750 μg i. m.) followed by an injection of hCG (2000 IU i. m.) 36 h later. Circulating progesterone levels progressively increased from day 1 of the cycle to 2. 26 ± 0. 17 ng/ml on day 7 of the cycle, but declined significantly after PGF 2 α injection. A progressive increase {{in the size of the}} dominant follicle was observed by ultrasonography. The follicular fluid estradiol and progesterone concentrations in the dominant follicle were 600 ± 16. 7 and 38 ± 7. 6 ng/ml, respectively, before hCG injection and the concentration of estradiol decreased to 125. 8 ± 25. 26 ng/ml, but concentration of progesterone increased to 195 ± 24. 6 ng/ml, 24 h post-hCG injection. Inh-α and Cyp 19 A 1 expressions in granulosa cells were maximal in the dominant follicle and declined in response to hCG treatment. Progesterone receptor, oxytocin and cycloxygenase- 2 expressions in granulosa cells, regarded as markers of ovulation, were maximal at 24 h post-hCG. The expressions of genes belonging to the super family of proteases were also examined; Cathepsin L expression decreased, while ADAMTS 3 and 5 expressions increased 24 h post-hCG treatment. The results of the current study indicate that sequential treatments of PGF 2 α and hCG during early estrous cycle in the buffalo cow leads to follicular growth that culminates in ovulation. The model system reported in the present study would be valuable for examining temporo-spatial changes in the periovulatory follicle immediately before and after the onset of gonadotrophin surge...|$|E
40|$|Three {{management}} programs {{were compared to}} improve reproductive efficiency in 542 cows (average milk yield of 7659 kg/ year). Cows were examined 22 to 29 days after parturition. Sixty days after calving healthy cows were inseminated on observed estrus. Cows not seen in estrus 80 days after parturition were reexamined. Cows were divided into three treatment groups: In group 1 cows with abnormal vaginal discharge were treated with 100 ml 2 % Lotagen ® (m-Cresolsulfonsäure-Formaldehyd-Polykondensat) intrauterine. In group 2 cows were injected with 5 ml of Iliren ® C (0, 150 mg <b>Tiaprost)</b> intramuscularily in 2 week intervalls, starting on day 43 to 49 until insemination. If they were seen in estrus after the 2 nd or 3 rd treatment, they were inseminated. In group 3 cows with abnormal vaginal discharge were treated with 120 ml of 20 % Eucacomp ® (Majorana Herb., Calendula Flos., Melissa Herb., Ol. Eucalypti) intrauterine. 185 of 542 cows (34 %) showed vaginal discharge. 36 percent of the cows were culled during lactation. 17 % of the cows were culled for infertility. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for all cows and the three treatment groups. Estrus detection rate was significantly higher in group 2 compared to group 1 and 3. Overall conception rate and first service conception rate showed {{no difference between the}} treatment groups. Days to first service were 9 days (group 1) and 18 days (group 3) longer than in group 2. Days open intervall was 35 days shorter in group 2 than in group 3 and 5 days shorter than in group one. Costs per pregnancy were 148, [...] DM higher in group 1 and 88, [...] DM higher in group 3 than in group 2.
