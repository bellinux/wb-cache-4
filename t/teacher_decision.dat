40|$|The study {{investigated}} early childhood <b>teacher</b> <b>decision</b> making at the preschool {{level in the}} state of Victoria, Australia. Victorian teachers at the preschool level were in an interesting position in 2004. Unlike most other Australian states Victoria did not have a curriculum framework guiding educational content and pedagogy. Consequently, this study was {{able to take advantage of}} this situation and examine <b>teacher</b> <b>decision</b> making at a time when early childhood teachers were relatively autonomous in deciding curriculum content. The opportunity to study <b>teacher</b> <b>decision</b> making in this way has since passed, as Victorian preschool teachers are now regulated by newly introduced state and national curricula frameworks. To identify influences affecting <b>teacher</b> <b>decision</b> making three preschool teachers were interviewed and curricula related policies were analysed. The data were analysed using Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis (CDA) technique. Critical discourse analysis enabled a close analysis of influences on <b>teacher</b> <b>decision</b> making illustrating how discourse is legitimated, marginalised, and silenced in certain curricula practices. Critical theory was the underpinning framework used for the study and enabled taken-for-granted understandings to be uncovered within early childhood policies and teacher interviews. Key findings were that despite there not being a government-mandated curricula framework for Victorian preschool education in 2004, teachers were held accountable for their curricula practice. Yet as professionals, early childhood teachers were denied public acknowledgment of their expertise as they were almost invisible in policy. Subsequently, teachers’ authority as professionals with curricula knowledge was diminished. The study found that developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) was a dominant discourse influencing <b>teacher</b> <b>decision</b> making (TDM). It operated as legitimated discourse in the 2004 Victorian preschool context. Additionally, the study found that teacher directed practice was legitimated, marginalised, and silenced by teachers. The findings have implications for early childhood <b>teacher</b> <b>decision</b> making at the practice, research, and policy levels. Findings show that the dominance of the DAP discourse informing <b>teacher</b> <b>decision</b> making limits other ways of thinking and practising...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to test this claim by comparing the level of influence that teachers in the three sectors exert on schoolwide and classroom decisions. Further, the study examined the effects of <b>teacher</b> <b>decision</b> making on the work experiences and career aspirations of charter teachers. Another study objective was to estimate which policy variables are associated with teacher professional opportunities. ^ Data for this study come from the National Center of Education Statistics 2 ̆ 7 Schools and Staffing Survey (1999 - 2000). The survey included a sample of public and private schools, and a census of charter schools that had been opened, at least, since the 1998 - 1999 school year. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the effects of <b>teacher</b> <b>decision</b> making and the effects of charter policy on the level of decision making. ^ Charter policies examined included three autonomy measures: freedom to budget and manage funds, hire and dismiss staff, chose a curriculum. Other policy predictors included origin of the school (new compared to a former school converting to charter status), legal status, management structure (EMO or not), whether the school was authorized by the district. ^ Findings from this study demonstrated that in most decision categories, charter teachers had somewhat more decision-making authority than public school teachers. Charter teachers 2 ̆ 7 overall influence on schoolwide decisions was positively associated with job satisfaction, cohesive relationship with the principal, cohesive community among teachers, and to a lesser extent to teacher efficacy and commitment. Control of classroom discipline had a weak effect on the cohesion outcomes and teacher efficacy.

The high likelihood of mid-career teachers searching indicates that teachers know when they are most desirable to schools and choose to search for a new position before they become entrenched (and moving costs become too high).|$|R
