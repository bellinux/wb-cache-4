If a rhodocenium containing melt is treated with sodium or potassium metals and then sublimed onto a liquid nitrogen-cooled cold finger, a black polycrystalline material results. Warming this material <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> produces a yellow solid which has been confirmed as the rhodocene dimer.

5|$|Americium is {{paramagnetic}} {{in a wide}} temperature range, {{from that}} of liquid helium, <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> and above. This behavior is markedly {{different from that of}} its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Am3+/Am0 is −2.08 ± 0.01V.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature.</b> There {{is a significant}} increase in resistivity over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium {{is similar to that of}} gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, polonium and thorium.|$|E

5|$|The {{safety issues}} for {{cryogenic}} helium {{are similar to}} those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E

25|$|Sodium acetate is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice. Sodium acetate trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their water of crystallization. When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E

25|$|Acrylic {{flow meters}} : Under some {{circumstances}} of high flow rates we may use simple acrylic flow meters (0-2.5liters/min) {{to control the}} flow rates through the metabolic chambers.

The flow meters are simple to use but should be calibrated twice daily {{for use in the}} respirometry system: once before recording begins (but after the animal has been sealed inside the chamber!!) and again {{at the end of the}} recording (before the animal is removed from the chamber). Calibration must be done with a bubble flow meter because the calibration marks on the acrylic meters are only approximate. For proper calibration of flow rates remember that both barometric pressure and temperature of the air streaming through the flow meter (which we assume to be equal <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature)</b> must be recorded.|$|E
25|$|It {{was water}} hammer {{that caused the}} {{physical}} damage to the reactor, the deaths of personnel who stood atop and nearby, {{and the release of}} radioactive isotopes to the environment. One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme water hammer hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> and there is an air gap between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the incident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful water hammer. Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit peak pressure. The extra water is also a very effective radiation shield for those who are directly above the vessel. Written procedures at SL-1 had included a directive to pump down the level of water in the reactor prior to the maintenance procedure that destroyed it.|$|E

500|$|... "White" [...] {{cast irons}} contain their carbon {{in the form}} of cementite, or iron carbide (Fe3C). This hard, brittle {{compound}} dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron-carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723°C <b>to</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and ferrite, which is soft and malleable and is called pearlite for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle martensite. The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite. The end product below 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-ferrite mixture, and that above 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture.|$|E
