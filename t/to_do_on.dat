However, Karthik had little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> his Caribbean sojourn, playing in only one non-first-class tour match ahead of the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E

5|$|Roddenberry {{said that}} the show would {{continue}} to cover modern themes in a science fiction way as had the first series, saying that these could include hijacking, nationalism and radicalization of both individuals and groups. He also wanted to show 23rd-century Earth for the first time, and said that this had been the answer to Paramount executives asking him {{if there had been}} anything he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> The Original Series but could not. A further change was to be the number of female cast members, as NBC had a requirement of a maximum of one-third, and Roddenberry wanted to have them appear in authority positions.|$|E
5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, {{that it is the}} wrong thing <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs can be found in science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to philosophy, Boyle devoted {{much time to}} theology, showing a very decided leaning to the practical side and an indifference to controversial polemics. At the Restoration of the king in 1660, he was favourably received at court and in 1665 would have received the provostship of Eton College had he agreed to take holy orders, but this he refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> the ground that his writings on religious subjects would have greater weight coming from a layman than a paid minister of the Church.|$|E
25|$|The first large {{expedition}} to the North was undertaken in 1779 by French Vice Admiral d'Estaing. In the attempt to invade the British-occupied Savannah, the French brought 20 ships-of-the-line and 3,000 troops in transports to Georgia. Although Washington failed to cooperate with his allies, being fixated on attacking the British in New York City, D'Estaing landed the troops in aid to the Americans before he returned to France, {{as he had been}} ordered <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>On</b> 9 October 1779, in concert with a contingent of the Continental Army, the French admiral initiated an assault on the besieged city. The well-fortified British army repulsed the invaders; d'Estaing was seriously wounded and had to sail for Europe. Despite a correct strategic concept, allied cooperation eluded successful operational implementation.|$|E
25|$|Incidents {{of police}} {{brutality}} seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it {{is yet to be}} seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which is the driving force behind many instances {{of police brutality}} - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality. Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>On</b> a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.|$|E

[...] He selected Schulz as his center, {{the first of many}} such All-Time All-American selections for Schulz. At the time, Camp said: [...] "Big, strong and fast, he combined all the defensive and offensive qualities of the best line men with the speed, sure tackling and intuition as to what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> the instant that are winning qualities of the defensive back. [...] In addition, his passing was excellent, as he had plenty of speed for his kicker, steadiness for his quarter, and ability to pass in directions other than in a straight line which made him especially valuable in certain formation plays".|$|E

Rowe recalls feelings similar to Stannard's: [...] "I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I'd met before, really." [...] The session was productive; Stannard and Rowe discussed the songwriting process with the group and talked about what the group wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> the record. In her autobiography, Brown recalls that the duo instinctively understood their point of view and knew how to incorporate [...] "the spirit of five loud girls into great pop music." ...|$|E

[...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they?

[...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because {{those are the kinds of}} films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E
500|$|Her {{guns were}} {{operable}} by September 1942, but replacing her entire electrical system took longer so the navy {{took advantage of}} the delays and incorporated some modifications based on lessons learned from the attack. Other changes planned were the replacement of her secondary and anti-aircraft weapons with a dozen [...] dual-purpose guns in twin mounts, twelve , and twenty-three 20mm AA guns. The repair work was suspended in June 1943, with an estimated six months work left <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> Conte di Cavour remaining, in order to expedite the construction of urgently needed smaller ships. She was captured by the Germans on 8 September when Italy surrendered to the Allies, and was reduced to a hulk. She was damaged in an air raid on 17 February 1945, and capsized on 23 February. Refloated shortly {{after the end of the}} war, Conte di Cavour was scrapped in 1946.|$|E

On January 10, 2011, the band announced that recording was officially completed. A week later, the band said the album's artwork was being produced and Valentine was mixing the tracks.
