5|$|The deputies {{turned their}} {{attention}} to Cripple Creek itself. They arrested and imprisoned hundreds of citizens without cause. Many inhabitants of the town were seized on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> pulled from their homes, then clubbed, kicked or beaten. The deputies formed a gauntlet and forced townspeople to pass through it, spitting, slapping and kicking them. With Bull Hill in his possession, Gen. Brooks began detaining the deputies. By nightfall, Brooks had seized the town and corralled all of Bowers' men.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E

50|$|The Vagrancy Act 1824 {{makes it}} an offence to sleep on <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> to beg.

To sleep on <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> to beg became a crime, whatever reason an individual might have had for being in such a predicament.

25|$|Prisoners {{developed}} {{hand signals}} to communicate {{things they did}} not want the guards or other prisoners to hear. When a prisoner wanted to pass a note down to a girlfriend, he would attach a little bundle {{to the end of a}} long rope woven from mattress fibers and throw the bundle down into the street. The girlfriend down below would run to catch the bundle and take out the note. This would also give her an opportunity to stuff a note, cigarettes, drugs, a photograph of their child, a weapon, into the bundle, which the inmate could then hoist back up through the hole in the wall, before the guards came running to intercept the line. They called these rope and bundle setups palomas ("pigeons") and apparently, at any given time, seven or eight palomas could be flying down into <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>or</b> back up to the prison, attached to their makeshift ropes.|$|E

25|$|Many {{stations}} in the subway system have mezzanines. In underground stations, this typically consists of the first level below <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> the areas between the street and platform level. For open-cut, grade-level and elevated stations, prevalent in uptown Manhattan and the outer boroughs, the mezzanine area often consists of a station house at street level or above the street. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having {{to cross the street}} before entering. At busy intersections, they also act as a pedestrian underpass or overpass. They also allow for crossover between uptown and downtown trains on side platforms or a pair of island platforms, which is very useful when local tracks are closed for construction. Within the mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In underground subway stations built close to ground level or under narrow streets, a characteristic of early IRT and BMT construction, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E
500|$|A revised Second System plan, {{drawn up}} in 1939 after the {{completion}} of the South Brooklyn line, followed the original Bay Ridge plan, and would have also extended the IND down Fort Hamilton Parkway and/or 10th Avenue to meet up with the tunnel route. The IND connection would be located at either the Fort Hamilton Parkway station (where the express tracks of the line run on a separate level directly under <b>the</b> <b>street)</b> <b>or</b> the Church Avenue express station, the former terminus of the line. The Church Avenue connection would have utilized the lower level yard just south of the station, currently used to relay terminating [...] trains. None of these plans were ever funded, due to the onset of the Great Depression and, subsequently, World War II.|$|E

500|$|Pfizer and Lilly Icos {{have filed}} many {{lawsuits}} {{against each other}} in various countries over Cialis and Viagra. Pfizer was given a broad patent on PDE5 inhibitors in Britain in 1993. Lilly Icos filed a complaint in a London court in September1999, and the patent was overturned in November2000 on the grounds that Pfizer's patent was based on information already in the public domain when the patent was issued. In the United States, Pfizer filed suit against Lilly Icos soon after receiving a broad US patent for PDE5 inhibitors in October2002. The United States Patent and Trademark Office ordered a reexamination of the patent, and, as in Britain, the examiner found that PDE5 inhibitors were not a new invention by Pfizer, voiding the patent. In Canada, Pfizer moved to block sales of Cialis five months after it was approved there, arguing that there could be consumer backlash against Pfizer should Cialis be pulled from the market months later {{as a result of an}} ongoing patent lawsuit. A federal judge refused, saying he could not [...] "imagine demonstrations in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> storming of the barricades because one impotence medicine is made unavailable".|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy held that Drayton and Brown were not seized and their consent to the search was voluntary. He explained that [...] "aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching individuals on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen". Additionally, Justice Kennedy emphasized that [...] "f a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter, then he or she has not been seized". Citing the Court's analytic framework established in Florida v. Bostic, Justice Kennedy concluded that a reasonable person would have felt free to [...] "leav the bus or otherwise terminat the encounter". Justice Kennedy noted that the officers did not brandish weapons, they did not make [...] "intimidating movements", they left the aisle clear, and they [...] "spoke to passengers one by one and in a polite, quiet voice". He noted that [...] "t is beyond question that had this encounter occurred on the street, it would be constitutional", {{and the fact that the}} encounter occurred on a bus does not make it illegal.|$|E
500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world.

Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid {{there are so many}} who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:â€“ Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'â€“ Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.' ...|$|E
