25|$|In 1977, {{radio station}} WBUR-FM in Boston {{scheduled}} {{a panel of}} local car mechanics to discuss car repairs on one of its programs, but only Tom Magliozzi showed up. He did so well that {{he was asked to}} return as a guest, and he invited his younger brother Ray (who was actually more of a car repair expert) to join him. The brothers were soon asked to host their own radio show on WBUR, which they continued <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>every</b> week. In 1986, NPR decided to distribute their show nationally.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} voting in the United States. Even though most {{people say that}} voting is important, and a good {{practice}} for them <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>every</b> year a sub-optimal percentage of Americans turn up to vote, especially in presidential elections (only 51% in the 2000 election). One vote may feel very small {{in a group of}} millions, so people may not think a vote is worth the time and effort. If too many people think this way, there is a small percentage of voter turnout. Some countries enforce compulsory voting to reduce this effect.|$|E

25|$|A new {{consciousness}} of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan's best-seller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation {{of the notion that}} women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>every</b> type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women, or NOW, to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the {{controversy}} surrounding the BCS became a topic of conversation within the United States government. In 2008 U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) had {{said that he would}} hold congressional hearings on the BCS in the future after his Utah team failed to play in the national championship game. Following up on Senator Hatch's actions in the Senate, in April 2011 the Attorney General of Utah announced that he would be initiating a class action anti-trust lawsuit against the BCS, despite the fact that Utah is joining to the Pacific-10 Conference, which is an automatic qualifying conference. In May 2011 the U.S. Justice Department {{sent a letter to the}} NCAA asking for a detailed explanation about why FBS football was the only NCAA sport that the NCAA did not 1) have a playoff system in place to determine a champion and 2) why the NCAA had abrogated its responsibility to do so and given the authority to determine the NCAA Champion to an outside group such as the BCS. The Justice Department's investigation and Utah Attorney General's lawsuit are both aimed at forcing the BCS to open its books, which they are as a non-profit required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>every</b> year and have never done, and at determining whether the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel based on Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of 1914 and the Robinson-Patman Anti-Price Discrimination Act. Two more states Attorneys General are said to be considering joining the Utah lawsuit, and the investigation by the Justice Department will probably include a minute and extensive examination of the Fiesta Bowl Scandal as well as conducting complete audits of the other BCS Bowls, the BCS itself and possibly even the schools of the 6 BCS Automatic Qualification Conferences.|$|E

[...] He added: [...] "There's a danger of being seduced into being self-conscious, of being aware of your 'career'. That can be lethal." [...] He also grew more concerned of the [...] "threatening" [...] corporate influence into the film industry at the expense of [...] "the idea of the creative spirit". He channeled this ambivalence into Broadcast News. As a romantic comedy, Brooks felt he could say [...] "something new ... with that form" [...] adding [...] "One of the things you're supposed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>every</b> once in a while as a filmmaker is capture time and place.

500|$|In 1880, Weaver {{prepared}} a resolution {{stating that the}} government, not banks, should issue currency and determine its volume, and that the federal debt should be repaid in whatever currency the government chose, not just gold as the law then required. The proposed resolution would never be allowed to emerge from committees dominated by Democrats and Republicans, so Weaver planned to introduce it directly to the whole House for debate, as members were permitted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>every</b> Monday. [...] Rather than debate a proposition that would expose the monetary divide in the Democratic Party, Speaker SamuelJ. Randall refused to recognize Weaver when he rose to propose the resolution. Weaver returned to the floor each succeeding Monday, with the same result, and the press took notice of Randall's obstruction. Eventually, Republican JamesA. Garfield of Ohio interceded with Randall to recognize Weaver, which he reluctantly did on April 5, 1880. The Republicans, mostly united behind hard money, largely voted against the measure, while many Democrats joined the Greenbackers voting in favor. [...] Despite support by the soft-money Democrats, the resolution was defeated 84–117 with many members abstaining. [...] Although he lost the vote, Weaver had promoted the monetary issue in the national consciousness.|$|E

The route, as always, was via the Catherine Canal and over the Pevchesky Bridge.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{questioned}} {{the portrayal of}} Jess' girlishness early on. Phillip Maciak of Slant Magazine initially expected New Girl as one of 2011's many new female-centric shows to [...] "be an exemplar of this new age of empowerment, but found instead that [...] "New Girl presents us with a narratively scattered, male fantasy of a show about a cooing woman-child in a polka-dot skirt who literally can't say the word 'penis' without giggling." [...] Meriwether stated {{it was not the}} show's goal to create a symbol and, pointing to gender double-standards, rejected opinions that Jess was emblematic of all women. She [...] "was really just writing about myself, and so my main goal is just to give Zooey, really fun, interesting things <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>every</b> week, and then just be really honest with myself about the character and present an interesting, funny female character on television." [...] Critics felt the first-season episode [...] "Jess & Julia" [...] was a meta reference to Jess' girliness and the initial [...] "adorkable" [...] ad campaign for New Girl, but Meriwether stated the episode was more a response to a controversial New York magazine cover story about Deschanel's personality and her views on women's issues.|$|E
