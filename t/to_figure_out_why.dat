25|$|Torishima {{is a fan}} {{of video}} games and was {{therefore}} put in charge of the first video game-related articles in Weekly Shōnen Jump, for which he brought in Yuji Horii to help. When his manager told him <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> CoroCoro Comic was doing so well, Torishima determined {{it was because of the}} sealed pages that had to be cut opened and included cheats and tips for video games. In addition to including similar pages in Jump, they also began to rate games, something new at the time, with the resulting content being voted third in the magazine's reader polls. This was the birth of , the video game section of Weekly Shōnen Jump issues. After finding success with video game articles and wanting to show readers of Jump how one is developed, the magazine decided to develop their own role-playing game like Ultima so that they would have exclusive coverage of it. He decided to have Horii, who had begun working at Enix, write the scenario and Toriyama design the characters. Torishima claimed that he purposefully had Enix fully fund the game, intentionally keeping Shueisha out of the decision making process for the good of the product while still reserving the option to create a manga based on it and not pay any royalties. The video game was Dragon Quest.|$|E

[...] Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield called it one of the funniest of West's career, a [...] "confessional" [...] song where he [...] "honestly struggles <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> he has to be such a douchebag."

500|$|The group took a {{hands-on}} {{approach to the}} actual recording sessions for Phantom Power, engineering and producing themselves for the first time. Recording largely took place at AV Happenings {{during the second half}} of 2002, with the band working through the night so as not to disturb staff who worked in other parts of the building during the day. According to bassist Guto Pryce this involved a fair amount of trial and error as the band [...] "didn't really know what [...] were doing". Soundproof booths were improvised by setting up tents in the office corridors: [...] "we'd record a guitar and it'd sound rubbish and we had <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why.</b> So we started experimenting with different tent designs. In the end it was the wigwam that was easiest to put up and sounded best". The band had to take these booths down before office workers arrived in the morning, a process that guitarist Huw Bunford has described as [...] "ghosts in the night ... a bit clandestine". A brief two-week session with Gorwel Owen at Rockfield Studios saw some of the album's more [...] "straight ahead" [...] tracks recorded with live vocals before the band returned to AV Happenings and [...] "messed around" [...] with them. When the album was almost finished the band enlisted the services of Tony Doogan who engineered sessions during which several vocal parts were recorded.|$|E

500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production [...] "puts a higher gloss, {{and sometimes a}} heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "Let's try <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> {{we wanted to be}} in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys—first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually." [...] He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, [...] "The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make {{is a long way from}} where you live." [...] Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.|$|E
500|$|The Lone Gunmen come to Mulder's {{apartment}} in disguise {{and tell him}} that they cannot find Scully.

He claims she was merely exhausted and he was trying to make her comfortable.

Mulder and The Lone Gunmen go to Skinner <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> Scully was communicating with Cobra. They find that an anonymous person has hacked into Scully's computer and has been sending Cobra messages calling for a meeting.

At dinner, The Smoking Man tells Scully that the cure he possesses is not just the cure for cancer, but for all human disease, and that it is extraterrestrial. The Smoking Man goes outside and tells the man who has been following them that Cobra has not shown. Scully finds a note under her dessert plate saying to meet at Calico Cove at dawn. She goes alone and is stopped by Cobra, who gives her a disc before being shot and killed by a sniper. The sniper also attempts to kill Scully, but is killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E

40|$|After a {{discussion}} of the impact of psychoanalysis on psychological thinking about personality theory and the changes that have been taking place within psychoanalytic theory about women, eight criteria arising out of feminist therapy theory are stated. These criteria represent sug-gested minimum conditions that a woman-based theory of female de-velopment and personality needs to fulfill. Freudian theory, current psychoanalytic theory, and several feminist theories are then evaluated in light of the stated criteria. The author concludes that feminiits have arrived at some degree of general agreement about personality theory, although they have often arrived at their specific approaches via diverse theoretical routes. I have been studying Sigmund Freud's life experiences as well as the culture in which he lived in order {{to learn as much as}} possible about where his theories about women came from (Lerman, in press).

In addition, we further propose a novel synthetic data-based strategy, which artificially generates source-target data using pivot language. Experimental results on benchmarking da-ta show that the proposed joint alignment optimization algorithm significantly im-proves the accuracy of model-based strat-egy and the proposed synthetic data-based strategy is very effective for pivot-based machine transliteration. ...|$|R
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of wordplay used in cryptics. One is {{straightforward}} definition substitution using parts of a word. For example, in one puzzle by Mel Taub, the answer IMPORTANT is given the clue [...] "To bring worker into the country may prove significant". The explanation is that to import means [...] "to bring into the country", the [...] "worker" [...] is a worker ant, and [...] "significant" [...] means important. Here, [...] "significant" [...] is the straight definition (appearing here {{at the end of}} the clue), [...] "to bring worker into the country" [...] is the wordplay definition, and [...] "may prove" [...] serves to link the two. Note that in a cryptic clue, there is almost always only one answer that fits both the definition and the wordplay, so that when one sees the answer, one knows that it is the right answer—although it can sometimes be a challenge <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> it is the right answer. A good cryptic clue should provide a fair and exact definition of the answer, while at the same time being deliberately misleading.|$|E
