5|$|In 2009, Xabi Alonso criticised then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown's {{economic}} policy, {{in particular}} the devalued pound sterling and the 50% tax rate, warning that it has weakened English football and could drive <b>top</b> <b>players</b> away from the UK.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1906–07 season, {{the players}} were not paid to play hockey, as the team was abiding by the {{principles}} of amateur sports. Ottawa HC had an advantage in attracting <b>top</b> <b>players</b> to its squad. The players could work for the government, and the work allowed the players {{to play for the}} team. Meanwhile, in the United States, the International Hockey League was paying players. In response to this, the ECAHA, while still having several purely amateur teams, started to allow professional players. The top teams could therefore compete for the <b>top</b> <b>players</b> and the gate attractions that they were. The only restriction was that the status of each and every player had to be publicized.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lee's {{difficulties}} in international play, he recorded his seventh consecutive {{victory at the}} National Badminton Grand Prix Final in Kedah on 12 December 2008, thus breaking the record of six consecutive titles set by Misbun Sidek. Lee ended the year with a title in the Super Series Masters Finals. However, Lin Dan and China's other <b>top</b> <b>players</b> did not compete, their association citing injuries and fatigue.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} {{international}} bughouse tournaments is the yearly tournament in Berlin. Going into its sixth edition, it is popular among <b>top</b> <b>players</b> from FICS.

Five of them have been first overall picks: Sue Bird (2002), Diana Taurasi (2004), Tina Charles (2010), Maya Moore (2011), and Breanna Stewart (2016).

5|$|After {{just one}} season with Texas, McCoy {{received}} a lot of media attention, including appearing on some lists of the nation's <b>top</b> <b>players</b> of 2007. In June 2007, McCoy appeared on the cover of Dave Campbell's Texas Football alongside Texas A quarterback Stephen McGee and TCU defensive end Tommy Blake. Additionally, Rivals.com named McCoy one of the top 10 quarterbacks going into the 2007 season. He also made the Athlon Sports first-team All Big 12.|$|E
5|$|After this tournament, the gambit {{finally began}} to be taken seriously. <b>Top</b> <b>players</b> like Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch started to play it. Schlechter {{published}} in 1918 the monograph Die budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits, which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920, {{so much so that}} many White players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 to avoid it.|$|E

5|$|As the {{prestige}} of winning the Cup grew, so did the need to attract <b>top</b> <b>players.</b> Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a resolution {{at the annual meeting}} of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, the Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams. The first professional competition came one month later during the Wanderers' two-game, total goals challenge series, which they won 17goals to 5.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the four}} {{consecutive}} first-round losses—which had {{been attributed to}} the split from his wife—Murphy claimed his third ranking title at the UK Championship, defeating Fu 10–9 in a low-quality final, in which he fluked a pink in the deciding frame that was effectively match ball. The victory meant he joined Davis, Alex Higgins, Griffiths, John Parrott, Hendry, O'Sullivan, Williams, John Higgins and Ebdon as the tenth player to have won both the World title and the UK title, cementing his place {{as one of the}} elite <b>top</b> <b>players</b> in the world.|$|E
5|$|From 1840 onwards {{he became}} a leading chess commentator, and won matches against <b>top</b> <b>players</b> of the 1840s. In 1847 he entered a {{parallel}} career as a Shakespearean scholar. Ill health and his two writing careers led him to give up competitive chess after 1851. In 1858 {{attempts were made to}} organise a match between Staunton and Paul Morphy, but they failed. It is often alleged that Staunton deliberately misled Morphy while trying to avoid the match, but it is also possible Staunton overestimated his chances of getting physically fit and of making time available for a match.|$|E

5|$|From 1924 to 1988, {{the tournament}} {{started with a}} {{round-robin}} series of games and ended with the medal round. Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round. The games of the tournament follow {{the rules of the}} International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), which differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL. The tournament follows the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) rules on performance-enhancing drugs and the IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, a list of <b>top</b> <b>players</b> who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. Several players have tested positive for banned substances since the 1972 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Hodgson next {{represented}} Canada at the 2008 IIHF World U18 Championships in Kazan, Russia. Playing in the quarter-finals against Finland, Hodgson {{was named}} {{player of the}} game after scoring the game-winning goal in a 2–1 victory. Hodgson finished with a tournament-high 12 points in seven games, leading Canada as team captain to its second IIHF World U18 gold medal with an 8–0 victory over tournament host Russia. He was chosen as one of Canada's three <b>top</b> <b>players</b> by tournament coaches, along with forward Jordan Eberle and goaltender Jake Allen.|$|E
5|$|Many of Canada's <b>top</b> <b>players</b> were NHL {{professional}}s, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) {{pushed for}} {{the ability to use}} professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games held after 1988. The NHL was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held {{in the middle of the}} NHL season. An agreement was later reached and NHL players began competing in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Salo {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman, capable of being matched up against {{opposing}} team's <b>top</b> <b>players,</b> while also contributing offensively. His offensive game is characterized by his powerful slapshot. He has won numerous hardest shot titles with the Canucks in the team's SuperSkills competitions, clocking one shot at 102.7 miles-per-hour (163.5 kph) in 2012. As a result, he is used frequently on the powerplay, being set up by teammates for shots from the point. A well-rounded defenceman, Salo also earns time on the penalty kill.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson's primary {{offensive}} attribute is his shot. Rather {{than relying}} on stickhandling in the offensive zone, his primary tendency is to direct the puck towards the net, hoping for a rebound. Before becoming an offensive threat later in his career, he established himself first as a defensively responsible forward in the NHL, earning time on the penalty kill and against opposing team's <b>top</b> <b>players.</b> Strong on his skates, he is also noted to play aggressively, as well. As a result, Samuelsson {{is known as a}} versatile, two-way player.|$|E
5|$|Suter {{made his}} {{international}} debut with the American national junior {{team at the}} 1984 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships where he recorded a goal and an assist in seven games. He was playing college hockey with Wisconsin {{when he made his}} debut with the senior team at the 1985 World Championship. One of his team's <b>top</b> <b>players</b> in the tournament, he was named co-MVP of Team USA. Suter played in a second World Championship in 1992.|$|E
