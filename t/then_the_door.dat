500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and <b>then.</b> <b>The</b> <b>door</b> would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{opened and}} the head contractor's {{engineer}} came in.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{closed behind}} him, {{and we were}} left to ourselves.|$|E
50|$|Above {{the capitals}} of the columns are windows, {{which are more}} {{elaborated}} <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> bulky elements that connect the second cornice, to the upper (similar to the ones anterior).|$|R
6000|$|... "More {{than likely}} {{two or three}} loads of coal have been dumped, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were fastened. <b>The</b> drift has been worked out, {{and none of the}} bosses would come here in time to suspect mischief." ...|$|R
50|$|In Hong Kong, {{the former}} KCRC (now part of MTR Corporation) reconstructed the {{platforms}} at the checkpoint terminus, Lo Wu Station, {{to a similar}} layout. When the train stops, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> on <b>the</b> island (alighting) platform open and all passengers get off. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> close and <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> on <b>the</b> side (boarding) platform open.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no reply}} for a moment, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was opened.|$|E
60|$|Another {{two minutes}} went by, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{opened and the}} parlour-maid came in.|$|E
60|$|It worried at {{the catch}} for a minute, perhaps, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opened.|$|E
50|$|Golghar {{has never}} been filled to its maximum {{capacity}} {{and there are no}} plans to do so. The reason for this is a flaw whereby <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> are designed to open inwards. Thus, if it is filled to its maximum capacity, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> will not open. Presently renovation of this historical monument is underway.|$|R
60|$|Another peal of laughter. Troy <b>then</b> closed <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and locked}} himself in.|$|R
60|$|She hesitated. <b>Then,</b> {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{was fast}} closed, {{she dropped her}} voice.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed, and Leland stood still, {{leaning on}} the table, with {{thoughtful}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was locked, {{and the man}} {{carefully}} fastened {{both the}} shutter and window.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a short}} delay, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was opened. A {{young woman}} peered out.|$|E
60|$|The woman {{hesitated a}} moment, looked out again, and <b>then</b> closed <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{deliberately}} crossed <b>the</b> room, <b>then</b> opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{which led}} to his own apartments.|$|R
60|$|Just <b>then</b> <b>the</b> little <b>door</b> opened quickly, and Pike's {{dripping}} head appeared.|$|R
60|$|Just <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opened, and Mr Mason entered. His face wore a dreadfully anxious expression.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed {{gently and}} he heard her go upstairs.|$|E
60|$|She {{shut the}} folding doors {{leading to the}} sitting room, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the hall.|$|E
60|$|Ralph lit <b>the</b> lamp, and <b>then</b> opened <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Before him stood Mrs. Carrington and her daughter.|$|R
60|$|These {{lifted the}} {{prostrate}} figure and assisted her {{in through the}} doorway. <b>The</b> man <b>then</b> closed <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|She bade them good-night, and <b>then,</b> opening <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> paused {{with her}} hand on the knob and stood irresolute.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opened, and {{the eyes}} of all three were centred upon the girl that entered.|$|E
60|$|There was a moment's hesitation. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was opened. Fenella entered. Arnold {{sprang to}} his feet.|$|E
60|$|A {{man came}} to the door and let him in. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was tightly closed once more.|$|E
60|$|Instantly {{he turned}} out the light in <b>the</b> office. <b>Then</b> opening <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to <b>the</b> hall he listened attentively.|$|R
60|$|Soon after Captain Asher {{had gone}} Mr. Port walked to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of his daughter's room, {{gave a little}} knock, and <b>then</b> opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> a little.|$|R
60|$|Julian {{listened for}} a moment and <b>then</b> closed <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> She sat {{watching}} him, with the pen still in her fingers.|$|R
60|$|There was a hurried {{movement}} within, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{which had}} been securely locked, was cautiously opened.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw the}} paper down again. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was {{suddenly}} opened, and Fenella appeared. She rang a bell.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{crashed in}} {{and half a}} dozen troopers {{followed}} by Pesita himself burst into the room.|$|E
60|$|La Boulaye proffered {{his wrist}} to assist her to alight, <b>then</b> reclosed <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and led her}} slowly towards the stable.|$|R
60|$|Five {{minutes more}} went by, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> house opened and Martin came out.|$|R
50|$|The {{point of}} each level is to destroy each monster, and <b>then</b> locate <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{which is located}} {{underneath}} a random block.|$|R
