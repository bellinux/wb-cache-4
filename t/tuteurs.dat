40|$|What is the {{contribution}} of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) technologies to the tutorial activity ? Do they lead to {{a significant change in}} the relationships between tutor and students ? between tutor and professor ? Do they contribute to renew the pedagogy ? This paper is based on an analysis of an action learning program on project management at the national school of information and library sciences (enssib). The first results of this on-going research give answers to some of these questions through the study of a corpus of interactions on 3 forums, and the representations given by the tutors of their own use of the variety of way they would communicate with the students or with their peer groups. Qu'apportent les TICE à la dimension tutorale ? Induisent-elles une modification de la relation tuteur/apprenant ? de la relation tuteur/enseignant ? Contribuent-elles à un renouvellement de la pédagogie ? Cette communication, retour d'expérience sur une formation-action à la gestion et conduite de projet, tente de répondre à ces questions à partir de l'analyse des échanges sur des forums et de l'usage perçu des différentes modalités de communication mises en place par les <b>tuteurs</b> dans l'exercice de leur activité...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectives : In {{the context}} of {{sustainable}} reconstruction of Haiti following the earthquake of January 12, 2010, this research analyses the processes of resilience and creators of young and adolescent Haitians. In particular, it examines the role of family, school, care institutions, beliefs, association networks, {{the state and the}} international community in the development of these processes. These strata are considered as human resources that may assist in the living of difficult experiences, and reconstruction-shoring research mainly aims to identify guardians’ resilience among young and adolescent Haitians living in camps in Port-au-Prince and the other most affected cities after the nearby earthquake. Methodology : From a questionnaire developed jointly with the University Lumière Lyon 2 (CRPPC) Editec and the State University of Haiti (UEH) in {{the context of}} research, individual interviews were conducted with a sample of n = 1475 children and adolescents, 782 girls and 693 boys, 19 % of whom were under the age of 6 years, 52 % aged 6 to 15 years and 29 % aged 15 to 20 years. This allowed the collection of their perception and representation of different elements, which serve as scaffolding to cope with the post-traumatic situation they experienced and to analyse and establish the correlation links between the tutors identified. Among the young people in the sample, 97 % are mostly educated, and they remain in three cities that have been particularly affected by the earthquake: the capital Port-au-Prince, Leogane a commune of Port-au-Prince located in the department of the West, and Jacmel a commune of Haiti and head of the department of the South East. We enjoyed the perception and representation of children and adolescents on several potential guardians’ resilience: family, school, health care institutions, places of worship, social and community networks, government and international organizations. Results : Some data concluded that tutors can actually be correlated and identified by sex and level of development topics. Analyses revealed that the majority of children had not lost their parents and said they feel safe with their families. Academic performance tended mostly to increase after the earthquake, young people perceived care as accessible and available, and the majority claim to be Protestant. They certify that they have many friends and have ties in the community and feel safe in the streets. The data show a positive dominance of religious practice and sense of trust in institutions of care on the part of girls while the boys claim to have more confidence in the State. The school performance is more important to those aged between 6 – 15 years, while the older ones practice less religion and rely less on the State and international organizations. These results suggest the importance of institutions such as the family, places of worship, educational institutions, health centres, community, etc. Dans le contexte de reconstruction durable d’Haïti suite au séisme du 12 janvier 2010, cette recherche analyse les processus de résilience et créateurs des enfants et adolescents haïtiens. Elle examine notamment le rôle de la famille, de l’école, des institutions de soin, des croyances, des réseaux associatifs, de l’État et de la communauté internationale dans l’émergence de ces processus. Ces strates sont considérées comme des moyens humains susceptibles d’aider à l’élaboration des vécus difficiles et à la reconstruction des étayages, la recherche vise principalement à repérer les <b>tuteurs</b> de résilience auprès des enfants et adolescents haïtiens vivant dans des camps de Port-au-Prince et dans les villes avoisinantes les plus touchées suite au séisme du 12 janvier 2010. À partir d’un questionnaire élaboré de manière conjointe avec l’université Lumière Lyon 2 (CRPPC), EDITEC et l’université d’État d’Haïti (UEH) dans le cadre de la recherche, des entrevues individuelles sont menées auprès d’un échantillon de n = 1475 enfants : 782 filles et 693 garçons dont 19 % sont âgés de moins de 6 ans, 52 % de 6 à 15 ans et 29 % de 15 à 20 ans. Les résultats d’analyses laissent envisager l’importance de certaines institutions telles que la famille, les lieux de culte les institutions scolaires, les centres de soins, la communauté, etc. Ils révèlent l’existence de corrélation entre certains <b>tuteurs</b> et les différents processus mis en place pour rebondir selon le sexe et le niveau de développement des sujets...|$|E

50|$|Any form of intensive, obsessive {{mothering}} has, as Katha Pollitt stated, {{devastating consequences}} for the equality of treatment {{of women in the}} society. In France, Élisabeth Badinter argued that over-parenting, obsession with washable diapers and organic, home made infant food, and parenting practices as the ones recommended by Sears, with breastfeeding into toddlerhood, bring women inevitably back into outdated patterns of gender role. In the United States, Badinter's book The Conflict: How Modern Motherhood Undermines the Status of Women (2010) had a partially critical reception, because there is no publicly paid childcare leave in this country, and many women consider it a luxury {{to be able to be}} a stay-at-home-mom during the child's first years. Still, gynecologist Amy <b>Tuteur</b> (formerly Harvard Medical School) stated that attachment parenting amounts to a new subjection of the woman's body under social control - a trend that is more than questionable in the face to the hard-fought achievements of women's movement.|$|R
