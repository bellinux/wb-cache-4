50|$|Humans can be {{infected}} by this roundworm, a condition called toxocariasis, just by stroking an infected dog's fur and accidentally ingesting infective eggs {{that may be}} present on the dog's fur. When humans ingest infective eggs, diseases like hepatomegaly, myocarditis, respiratory failure and vision problems can result depending on where the larva are deposited in the body. In humans, this parasite usually grows {{in the back of}} the eye, which can result in blindness, or in the liver or lungs. However, a 2004 study showed, of 15 infected dogs, only seven had eggs in their coats, and no more than one egg was found on each dog. Furthermore, only 4% of those eggs were infectious. Given the low concentration of fertile eggs on infected dogs' coats (less than 0.00186% per gram), it is plausible that such eggs were transferred to the dog's coat by contact with fecal deposites in the environment, making dog coats the passive <b>transport</b> <b>host</b> vehicle. However, although the risk of being infected by petting a dog is extremely limited, a single infected puppy can produce more than 100,000 roundworm eggs per gram of feces.|$|E

The study focused on the infection levels of the three most abundant nematode species, Hysterothylacium aduncum, Anisakis simplex and Contracaecum osculatum, in the three flatfish species American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and common dab (Limanda limanda). When all nematode and fish species were pooled the percentage of infected fish (i. e prevalence), {{the average number of}} nematodes per fish (i. e. abundance) and the average number of nematodes per infected fish (i. e. the intensity) were significantly higher at Langøya than at Torbjørnskjær. While H. aduncum and C. osculatum had higher abundances at the western site, A. simplex was more abundant at the eastern site. Among the three flatfish species, American plaice had a relatively high prevalence both at Langøya and at Torbjørnskjær (55 and 53 % respectively). Witch flounder was only infected at Langøya (59 %) and mainly with H. aduncum (53 %). Common dab had a high prevalence at Langøya (80 %) and rather low at Torbjørnskjær (15 %). However, since the sample size was small for witch flounder at Torbjørnskjær (n = 4) and for common dab at Langøya (n = 5), these results are likely to be biased. This study also supports the general view that there is a large fluctuation in the nematode populations in the outer Oslofjord. The previously observed decrease of A. simplex seems to continue. C. osculatum and H. aduncum are getting more widespread in the Oslofjord. In addition, my data contain the first recording of the flatfish nematode Cucullanus heterochrous at Langøya, suggesting that also this species is expanding in the Oslofjord. The lengths of the nematodes were used to investigate whether the three flatfishes are suitable hosts for the three nematode species. American plaice and witch flounder are good transport and final hosts for H. aduncum. American plaice seemed to be suitable <b>transport</b> <b>host</b> for C. osculatum as well. Despite the fact that A. simplex is known to have a pelagic life-cycle with Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as the main <b>transport</b> <b>host,</b> my observations show that it can also use the benthic common dab as <b>transport</b> <b>host</b> in the outer Oslofjord. The number of nematodes per witch flounder and common dab had a random distribution (Poisson distribution).

It is likely that a combination of different factors, especially the feeding ecology and habitat preferences of the fish, is the cause for the observed infestation patterns.

40|$|The {{present study}} used {{experimental}} infections {{to compare the}} life cycles and life histories of 6 Rhabdias spp. infecting snakes and anurans. Free-living development of anuran lungworms was primarily limited to heterogonic reproduction, and females utilized matricidal endotoky exclusively, whereas snake lungworms primarily reproduced homogonically and, when heterogonic reproduction occurred, females used a combination of releasing eggs and matricidal endotoky. Infective snake lungworms survived for longer periods in fresh water compared to anuran worms. Infective anuran lungworms penetrated into the skin of frogs and toads; few infections resulted from per os infections. In contrast, snake lungworms were unable to penetrate skin; instead, infective juveniles penetrated into snake esophageal tissue during per os infections. Despite separate points of entry, anuran and snake lungworms both migrated and developed in the fascia, eventually penetrating into the body cavity of the host. Worms molted to adulthood inside the body cavity and subsequently penetrated into the host’s lungs, where they fed on blood while becoming gravid. Adult lungworm survival varied among lungworm species, but, in general, snake lungworms were longer lived than anuran worms.

40|$|Many variant {{proteins}} encoded by Plasmodium-specific multigene {{families are}} exported into {{red blood cells}} (RBC). P. falciparum-specific variant proteins encoded by the var, stevor and rifin multigene families are exported {{onto the surface of}} infected red blood cells (iRBC) and mediate interactions between iRBC and host cells resulting in tissue sequestration and rosetting. However, the precise function of most other Plasmodium multigene families encoding exported proteins is unknown. To understand the role of RBC-exported proteins of rodent malaria parasites (RMP) we analysed the expression and cellular location by fluorescent-tagging of members of the pir, fam-a and fam-b multigene families. Furthermore, we performed phylogenetic analyses of the fam-a and fam-b multigene families, which indicate that both families have a history of functional differentiation unique to RMP. We demonstrate for all three families that expression of family members in iRBC is not mutually exclusive. Most tagged proteins were transported into the iRBC cytoplasm but not onto the iRBC plasma membrane, indicating that they are unlikely to play a direct role in iRBC-host cell interactions. Unexpectedly, most family members are also expressed during the liver stage, where they are transported into the parasitophorous vacuole. This suggests that these protein families promote parasite development in both the liver and blood, either by supporting parasite development within hepatocytes and erythrocytes and/or by manipulating the host immune response. Indeed, in the case of Fam-A, which have a steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) domain, we found that several family members can transfer phosphatidylcholine in vitro.
