25|$|It fell to Croix {{to expel}} the Jesuits from the colony (June 25, 1767) and {{confiscate}} their properties. In this he was {{aided by the}} visitador (inspector general), José de Gálvez.

25|$|In U.S. seasons five through nine, {{the last}} team {{to check in}} was {{stripped}} of all their money and was not given any money {{at the start of}} the next leg, forcing that team to literally beg for money from the local population of the city they were in for such expenses as cab, bus, or train fare. In addition, from seasons seven through nine, these teams would also be forced to give up all their bags and possessions therein, leaving them with only <b>the</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> their backs and the fanny pack teams use to carry their passports and Race documentation; this latter penalty caused many teams, thinking themselves to be in last place, to wear as much clothing as possible before checking in.|$|E
25|$|The {{isolated}} {{figures are}} given statuesque but largely unmodeled treatment, and their skin and their clothes are clean, with a waxy finish. They appear unselfconscious, {{at ease in}} their environment, and—with {{the possible exception of}} the boy to the bottom right—are locked in a pensive and solitary reverie. Horizontal and vertical lines at the middle and far distance contrast with arched backs and the relaxed postures of the figures toward the front. These postures, angles of heads, directions of gaze, and positions of limbs are repeated among the figures, giving the group a rhythmic unity. Distinctively coloured forms in close proximity, such as the grouping of horse-chestnut colours of <b>the</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> the bank, and the grouping of oranges of the boys in the water, add to the stability of the work—an effect reinforced in the cluster of shadows to the left on the bank, and the un-verisimilar play of light around the bathing figures.|$|E

25|$|Within a {{month of}} Baldwin's arrival, Marie left Constantinople for Western Europe, {{assuming}} they followed the instructions of Blanche of Castille, Marie's great-aunt, who had arranged for her visit and had given Baldwin 20,000 livres in exchange for two promises: not to sell his properties at Namur, and to send Marie to visit her within a month after his return to Constantinople. Baldwin {{is said to have}} prepared four armed ships to take Marie and her escort abroad. Marie arrived in Cyprus while Louis IX and the Crusaders were there, only to have a strong wind blow her ship free of its anchor, taking it and all its cargo to Acre, leaving Marie with only <b>the</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> her back and a cloak. The Crusaders there took care of her. Presumably soon after leaving Cyprus, Marie arrived in Negropont 30 January 1249, from where she reached France in May. According to the Chronique de Flandres, Marie stayed with her great-aunt until Blanche died in 1252, after which, it reports, Marie went to live in her husband's estates at Namur. For the next years Marie contested unsuccessfully with Henry of Luxembourg for control of those properties—which were the source of income for both Emperor and Empress—until her cession of these lands and castles 17 June 1258 to Margaret of Flanders. Despite this, the Castle of Namur refused to surrender to Henry of Luxembourg, the vassal of Margaret of Flanders, until St. Vincent's Day (21 January 1259). After this she had gone to the court of Castile where she successfully raised the money to ransom her son Peter, who was held hostage by bankers in Venice and who was released at some date between June 1258 and 1 May 1261.|$|E

500|$|This was Gazan's last field command. Gazan's pre-emptive {{withdrawal}} {{created a}} gap in French line, exposing D'Erlon's army in the center. D'Erlon held his position {{as long as he}} could, but the line collapsed around him. Joseph's planned orderly withdrawal turned into a rout. Gazan abandoned all his artillery. The Allies captured the entire supply convoy, all the baggage and took many prisoners, including Gazan's wife and children, although they later managed to rejoin him. After losing their supply train, the plight of the French army was terrible. Gazan mentioned that general officers and subordinates alike [...] "were reduced to <b>the</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> their backs and most of them were barefoot," [...] but the rank and file of the army also suffered enormously from hunger, exposure, and disease. When Soult took command of the new Army of the Pyrenees, Gazan became his chief of staff until Napoleon's abdication.|$|E

500|$|Because Mackintosh had {{intended}} to use Aurora as the party's main living quarters, most of the shore party's personal gear, food, equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed. Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton's depots had been landed, the ten stranded men were left with [...] "only <b>the</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> their backs". [...] Mackintosh [...] summarised their situation: [...] "We {{have to face the}} possibility that we may have to stay here, unsupported, for two years. [...] We cannot expect rescue before then, and so we must conserve and economize on what we have, and we must seek and apply what substitutes we can gather". Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. [...] These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. [...] "Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop" [...] fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco—"Hut Point Mixture"—was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few dried herbs. [...] By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: [...] "Tomorrow we start for Hut Point".|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who managed}} to flee the ghettos and camps had nothing more than <b>the</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> their backs, and their {{possessions}} often were reduced to rags through constant wear.

2500|$|The {{video was}} choreographed by Shawnette Heard and Marty Kudelka. It {{was the first}} time Jackson had not worked with Tina Landon since the Rhythm Nation era. The video's routine {{consisted}} of contemporary, jazz, and street dance styles. The dancers in the clip were intended to appear [...] "wild", in contrast to Jackson's more [...] "sedate" [...] appearance. [...] "It's kind of over-the-top trendy as far as the clothing", said Jackson. The video's stylist desired a Tokyo-influence in the wardrobe, exclaiming [...] "it's so great to pull clothes, and then put <b>the</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> her and have them become iconic because it's Janet." [...] The majority of the video was designed through CGI and chroma key. The clip is famous for its portrayal of futuristic technology and choreographed dance scenes set on a hovering platform. Jackson described the platform to be [...] "like a ride," [...] adding [...] "it tilts, slants, you can slide off or fall. I was literally airborne, it was lifting me right up." [...] The original scene was designed on a set, but was taken apart and replaced with a green screen. Kahn said [...] "that just put even more pressure on me, because I didn’t want to be the director that made the bad Janet Jackson video." [...] Throughout the dance sequence, scenes from Sega Dreamcast games Jet Grind Radio, Samba de Amigo, and Shenmue are shown in the background.|$|E
2500|$|She also enlisted costume {{designer}} Arianne Phillips {{to create the}} dresses for the film. The costumes designed were a combination of real vintage pieces, others were remade based on patterns that were obtained out of the museum archives, and the rest had to be freshly made. In an interview with W magazine in November 2011, Philips explained that she [...] "started doing research in 2009, a year before [...] began filming... To me, Wallis Simpson was a style icon, but I didn’t know she was a couture client well before she met Edward. She was also a hungry whore for jewelry. Edward gave Wallis jewelry {{to make her feel}} royal. My first task was figuring out how to re-create those famous gifts." [...] Madonna had sent a box of her research to Phillips, so that the designer could get a head start for the project. The singer understood the kind of attention to detail needed to create the costumes, drawing from her own garments which included couture. Phillips then researched <b>the</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> display at fashion departments of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York, the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. She then went to Los Angeles, where retailer Doris Raymond, from The Way We Wore had opened up her personal library of 1930s couture. There Phillips watched old newsreels from the University of California archives. Once filming started, the designer moved in Madonna's guesthouse in London, where they would watch the shot reels together and scrutinise the dresses. Phillips established contacts with designer labels like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels to replicate a cross bracelet and ten other pieces. For the gowns, undergarments, and dresses needed for the 60costume changes in the film, Phillips scoured the archives of Vionnet and Schiaparelli; then with the cooperation of both houses she redesigned Simpson's clothing. The first dress in which Riseborough appeared as Simpson in the film was a re-creation of the dress owned by Simpson herself. Phillips decked the dresses with diamond bow brooch at the neck and paired with organza skirts, and was able to obtain duplicates for some of them from Cos Prop, a costume shop in London.|$|E
