5|$|A hunchback {{fisherman}} finds a {{young girl}} tied to a mast, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, and raises her into womanhood {{with the intention of}} making her his wife. Ten years pass and the woman, out of gratitude, promises to marry him. The hunchback hires a handsome stranger, the boy. The boy and the girl fall in love, but the girl refuses to marry him. The hunchback sees the two embrace and threatens <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> a knife. The next day, the three go fishing in the boat and an argument breaks out. During the argument the boat tips over and the girl is washed away. The hunchback and the boy search for her, until the boy becomes exhausted and collapses on the shore. The hunchback finds the girl on a rock and brings her ashore. As the two reunite, he sees how happy they are together and takes his leave.|$|E
40|$|Children with Language Impairment (LI) have {{difficulties}} navigating peer situations, withdraw from social interaction and {{are at risk}} for developing further behavioral and socio-emotional problems. Children with LI often forego interactions, in which language and social skills are naturally trained, including conflict management. Conflict resolution is an especially challenging task with heightened emotional intensity, in which behavioral regulation is required to facilitate perspective taking abilities. Reconciliation, i. e. friendly contact between former opponents shortly following conflict termination, is positively associated with subsequent initiation or resumption of developmental peer interaction after a conflict has run its course. The aim of this thesis was to describe conflict behavior between <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI and determine possible deviations from conflict progression of <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> typical language development (TL). Unstructured free-play between 11 preschool <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI and between 20 preschool <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL was examined. Incidents entailing mutual opposition were identified as conflicts, and coded according to a validated system. The interrelations were examined between social interaction (mutual responsive exchanges) prior to conflict in the pre-conflict period, conflict causes, functions and effects of non-affiliative behavior and reconciliatory behavior in the post-conflict period, and social interaction in the succeeding non-conflict period. In Paper I it was established that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL demonstrate a sequential non-random pattern of conflict progression, with behaviors associated with previous behavioral exchanges within the conflict and directly preceding conflict outbreak. The conflict cause was linked to whether opponents socially interacted in the pre-conflict period, and subsequently related to the category of exhibited reconciliatory strategy in the post-conflict period. Further, the aggressor and the victim initiated reconciliation at similar rates, with the exception of verbal apologies, which were initiated most often by the aggressor. Also verbal apologies were the reconciliatory behavior that was least accepted by opponents. Finally, a higher rate of social interaction between former opponents in the succeeding non-conflict period was positively associated with both social interaction between opponents in the pre-conflict period and reconciliation. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI reconciled a smaller mean proportion of conflicts (47. 3 ± 4. 5 %) than <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL (63. 6 ± 2. 0 %). This main result was shown in Papers II-IV to stem from two behavioral characteristics within the communicative style of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI. First, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI exhibited overt withdrawal and non-assertiveness. The distribution of reconciliatory categories and the rates, at which opponents accept a reconciliatory behavior, were similar between the LI group and the TL group. However, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI displayed reconciliatory behavior in a smaller share of conflicts than <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI demonstrated a strong reliance on a reference point in the pre-conflict period in order to attempt reconciliation and functionally reconcile conflicts in similar proportions as <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL. Rather, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI conducted active withdrawal (left the room) relatively more often than <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL, particularly in conflicts without social interaction in the pre-conflict period. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI often escalated aggressive and emotionally charged behavior and exhibited difficulties concluding these behavioral turns. This lead to the seldom reconciled aberrant caused conflicts, which represented a larger share of LI conflicts than TL conflicts. Aberrant caused conflicts entailed inappropriate behavioral play/protest intensities that without communicative intent escalated to screaming/physical tantrums and thereby hindered the opponent from responding with a behavioral turn. Also, following post-conflict aggression, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI were unable to overcome, in particular reciprocal and only verbal aggression, and thereafter reconciled a smaller share of these conflicts than <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL. Further, <b>the</b> LI group s most representative non-affiliative behavior, active withdrawal, was less conducive to reconciliation than aggression, the most representative non-affiliative behavior in the TL group. In the succeeding non-conflict period, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI socially interacted at lower rates than TL boys, deriving mainly from the negative consequences of the LI lower reconciliation rates when social interaction was absent in the pre-conflict period and the larger share of rarely reconciled aberrant caused conflicts. The results indicate that in addition to traditional psycholinguistic remediation, children with LI may benefit from intervention methods that support initiating and maintaining communicational contact in the cases an immediate communicative referent is unavailable, as well as effectively concluding emotionally intensive and aggressive behavioral turns and providing positive experiences of peer interaction...|$|R

5|$|The {{song was}} a primary {{theme of the}} film score for <b>The</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>with</b> Green Hair (1948), for which the {{original}} version was used. The producers of the film reportedly paid $10,000 to ahbez for using the song, which was cumulatively more than what {{the author of the}} story, Betsy Beaton, was paid. A recording by Kate Ceberano was featured in the film The Crossing (1990). The tune and lyrics feature prominently in the film Untamed Heart (1993), for which Cole's version was used during the closing credits, while a piano version by Roger Williams served as the opener for the film. The song was also played in intermediate scenes featuring the principal cast.|$|E
5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> a large book on military strategy. He goes on to tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E
5|$|In The Orrery, all the {{subjects}} {{have been identified}} apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to Isaac Newton but differs enough to make positive identification impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint Portrait of a Young Man of 1760–1761 and the figure of <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> his head cocked staring intently at the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, An old man leaning on a staff, which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even {{the figure of the}} natural philosopher has touches of Frye's Figure with Candle. Though Henry Fuseli would later also develop on the style of Frye's work {{there is no evidence of}} him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the Air Pump was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.|$|E

5|$|The {{actor and}} {{presenter}} Bob Holness {{lived in the}} town {{as a child and}} attended Herne Bay Primary School until moving to Ashford. Nicki Chapman, the judge on the UK television series Popstars and Pop Idol, {{was born and raised in}} the town. Originally from London, Daniel Tammet, the subject of the UK documentary <b>The</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>with</b> the Incredible Brain, has now moved to the town. He is an autistic savant with outstanding abilities in mathematics, sequence memorising and language learning. Lydia Cecilia Hill (1913–1940), known as Cissie Hill, lived at Westcliff; she was a favourite of Ibrahim of Johor and former dancer. The Yorkshire-born writer Will Scott lived and wrote in Herne Bay until his death in 1964. During the late 1960s, many successful rock and jazz bands were formed around the city of Canterbury, creating a subgenre of music known as the Canterbury sound. Some of these musicians were residents of Herne Bay, including Dave Sinclair and Richard Coughlan of Caravan, and Kevin Ayers of Soft Machine. George W. M. Reynolds, one of the most popular British authors of the early Victorian era, moved to Herne Bay in 1854 and became one of the town's Improvement Commissioners. The children's writer Evelyn Whitaker was born there in 1844. Héctor García Ribeyro, the Mayor of Lima in Peru during the 1950s, had part of his schooling at the now defunct Herne Bay International school. Colin Dixon, the depot manager held hostage with his family during the £53million Securitas depot robbery of February 2006, lived in Herne Bay at the time.|$|E
