5|$|Recalling his {{homesickness}} {{and loneliness}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ventured abroad, {{for his next}} foreign trip Etty travelled {{in the company of}} Richard Evans, who had been a fellow student of Thomas Lawrence. Despite warnings that Italy would be uncomfortably hot, the two men set out on 23June 1822 with the aim of reaching Rome. Crossing to France by means of the recently developed steamboat, they arrived in Paris on 26June. They stayed in Paris for two weeks, visiting Versailles and the city's public art galleries; they also visited the much-reduced remaining exhibits of the Louvre. The Louvre was hosting an exhibition of modern French painting at the time, at which Etty felt a great dislike for the quality of portraiture in France, but he was nonetheless greatly impressed by the permanent collections, in particular Rubens's Marie de' Medici cycle, elements of which he would later reuse in many of his own works.|$|E
5|$|In January 1833, {{strong winds}} forced {{the old and}} poorly built Jaguaripe aground off Santa Marta beach in the {{southern}} province of Santa Catarina, where it sank. Joaquim Inácio was again the last to abandon ship. The entire crew was rescued, though he himself barely survived. Joaquim Inácio {{and his younger brother}} Bento José (who was also a navy officer) stayed afloat by holding onto a leather basket until reaching the shore. Afterward, Joaquim Inácio was court martialed and absolved of any wrongdoing. On 5 April 1833, he was given command of the barque-brig Vinte e nove de agosto (the same ship he had saved in 1828) and sailed to the province of Maranhão. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been in the province was in 1825. He remained stationed in the provincial capital (São Luís) as chief of the port until his return to Rio de Janeiro on 30 December 1836. He was transferred to the steam barque Urânia in 1837 and later, on 19 July of the same year, to the brig Constança (a different vessel than the schooner he lost in 1827).|$|E
5|$|On 28 February 2016, Buffon {{kept his}} eighth {{consecutive}} clean sheet in Serie A in a 2–0 win over Inter. In the process, {{he set a}} new personal best in the top flight, and the outright sixth-best unbeaten streak {{in the history of}} the Italian league, after going 746 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, overtaking Morgan De Sanctis and Marchegiani. In the following league match against Atalanta on 6 March, he extended his unbeaten record by keeping another clean sheet in a 2–0 away win, also equalling Dino Zoff's and Sebastiano Rossi's league record of nine consecutive clean sheets in Serie A. His unbeaten streak of 836 minutes without conceding a goal was the third best unbeaten streak in Serie A history, behind only Zoff and Rossi, and was also the longest period a goalkeeper has gone without conceding a goal since three points for a win were introduced in Serie A during the 1994–95 season. He overtook Zoff in a 1–0 home victory over Sassuolo on 11 March, achieving a league record 10 consecutive clean sheets, and extended his unbeaten streak to 926 minutes without conceding a goal, only three minutes behind the all-time record holder, Rossi; <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> conceded a goal was when he was beaten by Antonio Cassano, in the 64th minute of a 2–1 away win over Sampdoria, on 10 January 2016. Buffon surpassed Rossi's record of 929 minutes by 45 minutes in a 4–1 away win over inter-city rivals Torino on 20 March, also surpassing Gianpiero Combi's Italian league record unbeaten streak of 934 minutes in the process; he set the new all-time record at 974 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal. Andrea Belotti finally ended his goalless streak by beating him from the penalty spot in the 48th minute of the same match.|$|E

25|$|On 9 May 2009, Kadyrov claimed Umarov {{had been}} {{reportedly}} severely wounded and that {{four of his}} bodyguards were killed in an operation commanded by Kadyrov's cousin and deputy, Adam Delimkhanov. Early rumors claimed Umarov had been killed, and in June the Russian authorities forensically examined the four burned corpses {{to see whether they}} included that of Umarov. The next month, however, Umarov himself phoned the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to say he is alive; and in an interview conducted in July 2009 with Prague Watchdog Umarov claimed that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been wounded was in 1995 during the First Chechen War. On 19 January 2010, Kadyrov announced that he had launched another Delimkhanov-led special operation in Chechnya’s mountains to find and eliminate Umarov. Umarov's possible death was reported once again in March 2011, when Russian government said an air strike and special forces raid on a rebel base in Ingushetia killed 17 Chechen and Ingush militants including his deputy Supyan Abdullayev, but Umarov's body was not found there too.|$|E
500|$|On June 14, 2007, Howard {{was traded}} to the Minnesota Timberwolves for James and Justin Reed. [...] According to ESPN, he regretted not {{choosing}} Minnesota <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been a free agent and was looking forward to playing with Garnett. [...] Soon after Howard signed with Minnesota, the team traded Garnett to the Boston Celtics. Howard made it clear he was not interested in being on a team in Minnesota that was focused on developing young talent and consequently requested a trade once Garnett was no longer a member of the team. [...] Howard still had $6.88million and $7.38million in salary owed to him over the next two seasons, which made him difficult to trade. Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor noted that the team would attempt to accommodate his wishes but acknowledged that doing so would be difficult. On October 29, 2007, the Timberwolves waived Howard after agreeing to a contractual buyout agreement worth $10million spread over four years instead of the roughly $14.25million ($6.88million plus $7.38million) that Minnesota would otherwise have owed him.|$|E
500|$|According to Burks, Hubbard [...] "was so {{sure he had}} {{something}} 'away out and beyond' anything else that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers, telling them that he had written 'THE book' {{and that they were}} to meet him at Penn Station, and he would discuss it with them and go with whomever gave him the best offer." [...] However, nobody bought the manuscript. Forrest J Ackerman, later Hubbard's literary agent, recalled that Hubbard told him [...] "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office {{to find out what the}} reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window." [...] Hubbard's failure to sell Excalibur depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: [...] "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. So you see I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position." [...] He went on: ...|$|E

500|$|The Dodgers {{entered the}} game with a 0–1 record, having lost to the Reds, who were 1–0 the day before. As Hershiser {{prepared}} for his first start, he said that the continuation of the streak via the asterisk did not mean much to him and that in his mind the streak was already over. His mound opponent was Tom Browning who had pitched a perfect game <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> faced the Dodgers (September 16, 1988). Todd Benzinger drove in Larkin to end Hershiser's streak in the first inning and Hershiser was tagged with his first loss since August 24. The Dodgers endured three errors and a passed ball in the game. Leadoff hitter Larkin chopped a groundball over Hershiser into centerfield. Hershiser's pick off throw hit Larkin's armpit. After Hershiser retired Chris Sabo and Eric Davis via strikeout, he walked Kal Daniels, who had a career [...]500 batting average and four home runs against Hershiser, on four pitches. Then Benzinger, with whom Hershiser was unfamiliar, singled through {{the right side of the}} Dodger infield to score Larkin thus ending Hershiser's streak. Howell did not allow an earned run in his second 1989 outing on April 10. Thus, Howell's streak went from August 11, 1988, through April 9, 1989.|$|E

During the intermission Europe went to have a talk with two of his drummers, Steve and Herbert Wright. After Europe criticized some of their behavior (walking off stage during others' performances), Herbert Wright became very agitated and threw his drumsticks down in a seemingly unwarranted outburst of anger. He claimed Europe did not treat him well and that he was tired of getting blamed for others' mistakes. He lunged for Europe with a penknife and was able to stab him in the neck. Europe told his band to finish the set and he would see them the next morning. To Europe and his band the wound seemed superficial. As he was carried away, he told them [...] "I'll get along alright." [...] At the hospital, they could not stop the bleeding and he died hours later.|$|E

Sadiq Daba was prepared for Waziri's character for a period of 8 months before filming commenced. On a day of shoot, a serious disagreement occurred between Daba and Afolayan that Daba walked out on set; the dispute however was eventually settled and shooting was resumed.

2500|$|In 2014, Gordon {{recorded}} four wins, {{starting at}} the May Kansas race; 2007 was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> won {{at least four times}} in a season. Entering the Brickyard 400, the twenty-year anniversary of his first career win in the 1994 race, the day was declared [...] "Jeff Gordon Day" [...] by Indianapolis mayor Greg Ballard. Gordon passed teammate Kasey Kahne with 17 laps to go to win, breaking a tie with teammate Jimmie Johnson for most wins in the event, and tied with former Formula One driver Michael Schumacher for the most wins at Indianapolis. Gordon also won at Michigan and Dover, his first wins at the tracks since 2001. At Texas, Gordon and Keselowski were racing for the win when Keselowski tried to shoot between Johnson and Gordon, which cut Gordon's left rear tire and spun him out. Gordon fell to 29th, while Keselowski would finish third. Following the race, Gordon confronted Keselowski in pit road over the incident with both drivers being surrounded by their pit crews. However, it escalated into a brawl due to Keselowski being shoved from behind by Harvick, who had also battled with Keselowski in the final laps. Despite the four wins, Gordon was unable to compete for the championship after being eliminated from Chase contention in the penultimate race at Phoenix. Gordon won the pole for the final race at Homestead, and led a race-high 161 laps, but the decision to pit with 13 laps to go relegated him to 24th, and he finished 10th. The finish marked his 454th top-ten, surpassing Mark Martin for second in all-time top tens, behind Richard Petty's 712.|$|E
2500|$|Just before 6pm on 28 May Robert Bayne {{walked into}} the police {{incident}} caravan at Wishaw and {{said he wanted to}} make a statement. The officer on duty, PC Robert Davie, said: [...] "The male appeared to be quite intoxicated. He was slurring his words." [...] Bayne said he had been to Motherwell several days previously and on the return journey a man called Stewart Campbell had got onto the bus. He told PC Davie: [...] "I went up to Stewart Campbell and said to him 'Were you with Zoe on Saturday night?'" [...] to which he claimed Campbell replied: [...] "Aye, I killed her." [...] As Bayne began to give a description of Campbell, police detectives {{walked into the}} caravan and immediately detained Bayne by snapping handcuffs on him. On the morning of 29 May Strathclyde Police issued a statement saying: [...] "A 20-year-old man has been arrested and is presently detained in police custody in connection with the death [...] A full report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal." [...] Bayne was detained in custody to appear at Hamilton Sheriff Court on 1 June 2010. At the subsequent brief court hearing Bayne made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody. [...] During police interviews following his arrest, Bayne insisted that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen Nelson was on the morning of 22 May [...] "after a chance meeting, when he went to a local newsagent to buy cigarettes." [...] He claimed he then {{spent the rest of the}} day at home in Cambusnethan. At a preliminary hearing at the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh on 1 December 2010, Bayne entered not guilty pleas to all charges. A trial date was set for February 2011. On 8 January 2011 Bayne was transferred to HMP Greenock where he was segregated from the main prison population for his own safety.|$|E

2500|$|Salli Frattini, the {{executive}} producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled {{a phone call from}} the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. [...] "We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'", Frattini said. [...] "There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s. What just happened?'" [...] Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. [...] "I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay", he said. [...] "Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport." [...] Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible [...] "set up", adding it was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats. An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, [...] "When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song". The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.|$|E
