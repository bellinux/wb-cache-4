5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a major}} predator {{of smaller}} woodland birds, though only 10% of its hunting attacks are successful. It hunts by surprise attack, using hedges, tree-belts, copses, orchards and other cover near woodland areas; its choice of habitat is dictated by <b>these</b> <b>requirements.</b> It also makes use of gardens in built-up areas, {{taking advantage of the}} prey found there.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. <b>These</b> <b>requirements</b> allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|Andrée gave a glowingly optimistic {{account of}} {{the ease with which}} <b>these</b> <b>requirements</b> could be met. Larger {{balloons}} had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the Svea, stating that a deviation of 27degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.|$|E

5|$|From the 1994–95 to 2013–14 seasons the Regional League, {{along with}} the Midland Football Combination, served {{as one of the}} two {{official}} feeders to the Midland Football Alliance. The highest-placed team which met the Alliance's entry requirements was promoted to the Alliance, and one or more teams were relegated into the Regional League from the Alliance depending on the number of clubs remaining in each league. (<b>These</b> <b>requirements</b> were inherited by the second Midland League; see last paragraph.) Prior to the 2006–07 season, the league was defined as a step 7 league within the National League System, even though it fed into the Alliance, which was graded as step 5.

5|$|In June 1947, the {{military}} requirements were updated and the Model 464-17 met {{all of them}} except for the range. It was becoming obvious to the Air Force that, even with the updated performance, the XB-52 would be obsolete {{by the time it}} entered production and would offer little improvement over the Convair B-36; as a result, the entire project was postponed for six months. During this time, Boeing continued to perfect the design, which resulted in the Model 464-29 with a top speed of 455miles per hour (395kn, 730km/h) and a 5,000-mile range. In September 1947, the Heavy Bombardment Committee was convened to ascertain performance requirements for a nuclear bomber. Formalized on 8 December 1947, <b>these</b> <b>requirements</b> called for a top speed of 500miles per hour (440kn, 800km/h) and an 8,000mile (7,000nmi, 13,000km) range, far beyond the capabilities of 464-29.|$|E

5|$|The SS was {{regarded}} as the NSDAP's elite unit. In keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany, {{in the early days}} all SS officer candidates had to provide proof of Aryan ancestry back to 1750 and for other ranks to 1800. Once the war started and it became more difficult to confirm ancestry, the regulation was amended to just proving the candidate's grandparents were Aryan, as spelled out in the Nuremberg Laws. Other requirements were complete obedience to the Führer and a commitment to the German people and nation. Himmler also tried to institute physical criteria based on appearance and height, but <b>these</b> <b>requirements</b> were only loosely enforced, and over half the SS men did not meet the criteria. Inducements such as higher salaries and larger homes were provided to members of the SS, since they were expected to produce more children than the average German family as part of their commitment to NSDAP doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet <b>these</b> <b>requirements,</b> the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the new Knights Companions were knighted by the King and invested with their ribands and badges on 27 May 1725.

This precedent was followed until 1812, after which the Installation was also dispensed with, until its revival in the twentieth century. The ceremonies however remained part of the Statutes until 1847.|$|E
40|$|Some {{requirement}} modelling languages such as UML’s statechart diagrams allow {{developers to}} specify requirements of state-transition {{behavior in a}} visual way. <b>These</b> <b>requirement</b> specifications are useful in many ways, including helping program understanding and specification-based testing. However, there are {{a large number of}} legacy systems that are not equipped with <b>these</b> <b>requirement</b> specifications. This paper proposes a new approach, called Brastra, for extracting object state machines (OSM) from unit-test executions. An OSM describes how a method call transits an object from one state to another. When the state of an object is represented with concrete-state information (the values of fields transitively reachable from the object), the extracted OSMs are simply too complex to be useful. Our Brastra approach abstracts an object’s concrete state to an abstract state based on the branch coverage information exercised by methods invoked on the object. We have prototyped our Brastra approach and shown the utility of the approach with an illustrating example. Our initial experience shows that Brastra can extract compact OSMs that provide useful information for understanding state-transition behavior. ...|$|R

5|$|On 6 September 1937, Captain Félix Verdeja, {{commanding}} the maintenance {{company of the}} Nationalist Batallón de Carros de Combate ("Tank Battalion"), began to privately develop a new light tank. His position, with direct access to Panzer Is and T-26s, gave Verdeja direct evidence of the shortcomings of current tank models in terms of combat ability and maintenance issues. Verdeja established a future tank requiring the 45millimetre (1.77in) gun fitted in the T-26; two coaxial light machine guns; a low profile, all-around armor greater than 15millimetres (0.6in), with a turret mantlet plate of at least 30millimetres (1.2in); road speed of , combat range of , and a capable suspension and new track system. This latter requirement was based on experiences with existing light tanks, which frequently lost their tracks in combat. <b>These</b> <b>requirements</b> and solutions were presented in October 1938 to Colonel Díaz de la Lastra, commanding officer of the Agrupación de Carros de Combate. Although the project was approved, the program had to use scrap to build the first prototype {{due to a lack}} of resources and money. Despite early obstacles, including criticism from von Thoma, the program continued and Verdeja was awarded a warehouse in Zaragoza to continue with the construction of the prototype.|$|E
