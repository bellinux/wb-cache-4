5|$|Aquinas {{reasoned}} that acting contrary to conscience is an evil action but an errant conscience is only blameworthy {{if it is}} the result of culpable or vincible ignorance of factors <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> a duty to have knowledge of. Aquinas also argued that conscience should be educated to act towards real goods (from God) which encouraged human flourishing, rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures. In his Commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics Aquinas claimed it was weak will that allowed a non-virtuous man to choose a principle allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint.|$|E
5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E

The reason being <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> the {{flexibility}} to design/modify design blocks from vendor provided libraries in ASIC. This flexibility is missing for Semi-Custom flows using FPGAs (e.g. Altera).|$|E

25|$|I see no {{rational}} {{ground for}} excluding from conduct capable of {{giving rise to}} criminal liability, conduct which consists of failing to take measures that lie within one's power to counteract a danger <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> oneself created, if {{at the time of}} such conduct one's state of mind is such as constitutes a necessary ingredient of the offence.|$|E
25|$|During term time, Uno bus runs every 7–8 minutes.

25|$|More specifically, it {{has been}} seen by Batson as {{comprising}} a willingness to view religious doubts in a positive manner, acceptance that religious orientation can change and existential complexity, the belief that one's religious beliefs should be shaped from personal crises <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> experienced in one's life. Batson refers to extrinsic, intrinsic and quest respectively as religion-as-means, religion-as-end and religion-as-quest, and measures these constructs on the Religious Life Inventory (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).|$|E

25|$|FXS is {{characterized}} by social anxiety, including poor eye contact, gaze aversion, prolonged time to commence social interaction, and challenges forming peer relationships. Social anxiety {{is one of the}} most common features associated with FXS, with up to 75% of males in one series characterized as having excessive shyness and 50% having panic attacks. Social anxiety in individuals with FXS is related to challenges with face encoding, the ability to recognize a face <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> seen before.|$|E
25|$|Another {{model that}} has been put forth is the incentive-motivation model. The model {{explains}} that the desire for sex comes from an interaction between a sensitive sexual response system and stimuli that {{are present in the}} environment. Researchers argue that this model supports the idea that sexual desire is not spontaneous. Furthermore, this model implies that the case is not <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> sex because one feels sexual desire; rather, the case is that one feels sexual desire because one has sex.|$|E
25|$|Plato was {{the first}} philosopher who {{systematically}} inquired into issues such as those noted above. He wrote many dialogues, such as Euthyphro and the Apology, but {{it is from the}} Meno that the modern instantiation of Plato's Problem is derived. In the Meno, Plato theorizes about the relationship between knowledge and experience and provides an explanation for how it is possible to know something <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> never been explicitly taught. Plato believed that we possess innate ideas that precede any knowledge that we gain through experience.|$|E

25|$|Just as the {{signature}} of the metric is differently defined in the literature, this quantity is not consistently named. The interval (as defined here) is {{sometimes referred to as}} the interval squared. Even the square root of the present interval occurs. When signature and interval are fixed, ambiguity still remains as which coordinate is the time coordinate. It may be the fourth, or it may be the zeroth. This is not an exhaustive list of notational inconsistencies. It {{is a fact of life}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> to check out the definitions first thing when one consults the relativity literature.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tenth}} year of Emperor Nero's reign, Ben-Hur is staying with Simonides, whose {{business}} has been extremely successful. With Ben-Hur, the two men have given most of the fortunes to the church of Antioch. Now, as an old man, Simonides has sold all his ships but one, and <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> returned for probably its final voyage. Learning that the Christians in Rome are suffering {{at the hands of}} Emperor Nero, Ben-Hur and his friends decide to help. Ben-Hur, Esther and Malluch sail to Rome, where they decided to build an underground church. It will survive through the ages and comes {{to be known as the}} Catacomb of Callixtus.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the kinds of language experience and knowledge gained through the statistical learning of the first language influences one's acquisition of a second language. Some research points to the possibility that the difficulty of learning a second language may be derived from the structural patterns and language cues <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> already picked up from his or her acquisition of first language. In that sense, the knowledge of and skills to process the first language from statistical acquisition may act as a complicating factor when one tries to learn a new language with different sentence structures, grammatical rules, and speech patterns.|$|E

25|$|The Tibetan Buddhism {{tradition}} emphasizes an instructive and devotional {{relationship to}} a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as guru yoga which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits {{the existence of}} various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or yidam are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: santana; refer mindstream) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage yidam or tutelary deities will depend upon the level or more appropriately yana at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And {{at a higher level}} one may deliberately cultivate the idea <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is śūnyatā. The views of the more esoteric yana are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.|$|E
25|$|The {{interests}} objection {{claims that}} what makes murder wrong {{is not just}} the deprivation of a valuable future, but the deprivation of a future <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> an interest in. The embryo has no conscious interest in its future, and so (the objection concludes) to kill it is not wrong. The defender of Marquis-style arguments may, however, give the counterexample of the suicidal teenager who takes no interest in his or her future, but killing whom is nonetheless wrong and murder. If the opponent responds that one can have an interest in one's future without taking an interest in it, then the defender of the Marquis-style argument can claim that this applies to the embryo. Similarly, if an opponent claims that what is crucial is having a valuable future which one would, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve (whether or not one does in fact desire to preserve it), then the defender may ask why the embryo would not, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve its future.|$|E
25|$|In {{depression}} and grief syndromes, crying is typically {{a sign of}} sadness, whereas the pathological displays of crying which occur in PBA are often {{in contrast to the}} underlying mood, or greatly in excess of the mood or eliciting stimulus. In addition, a key to differentiating depression from PBA is duration: PBA episodes are sudden, occurring in a brief episodic manner, while crying in depression is a more sustained presentation and closely relates to the underlying mood state. The level of control <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> over the crying episodes in PBA is minimal or nonexistent, whereas for those suffering from depression, the emotional expression (typically crying) can be modulated by the situation. Similarly, the trigger for episodes of crying in patients with PBA may be nonspecific, minimal or inappropriate to the situation, but in depression the stimulus is specific to the mood-related condition. These differences are outlined in the adjacent Table.|$|E
