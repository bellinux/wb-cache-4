5|$|Rite of Memphis-Misraïm Proceeding from Cagliostro's rite, <b>the</b> <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Misraïm (from Arabic مصر Miṣr = Egypt) {{continued}} {{as a form}} of mixed, esoteric masonry. Banned in 1817, it was reformulated as <b>the</b> <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Memphis in 1838, and in spite of fluctuating fortunes in its French home, began to spread internationally {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. During the 1880s the two rites were fused by Giuseppe Garibaldi into <b>the</b> <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Memphis-Misraïm.

5|$|Before {{the first}} {{gramophone}} disc recordings of The Rite were issued in 1929, Stravinsky {{had helped to}} produce a pianola version of the work for the Aeolian Company. He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the French player piano company Pleyel, with whom he signed a contract in 1923 under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium. The Pleyel version of <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Spring was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson recorded the work in this form in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Films of {{the time}} {{typically}} used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War. Thus, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and Godzilla (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests. An alternative appears in Disney's animated Fantasia (1940), in its <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Spring sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time) and also in Karel Zeman's Cesta do praveku (1955;Journey to the Beginning of Time) Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.|$|E
5|$|Holding such {{conservative}} views, Saint-Saëns was out {{of sympathy}} – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty. It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky's ballet <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Spring in 1913. In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane.|$|E

5|$|Ravel {{composed}} little during 1913. He {{collaborated with}} Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky's unfinished opera Khovanshchina, {{and his own}} works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier. In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Spring. Stravinsky later said that Ravel {{was the only person}} who immediately understood the music. Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} of the Holy Roman Church {{up to the}} 11th {{century had}} strictly liturgical duties and generally took no part {{in the government of}} the Church.

5|$|The exact date of Stephen's {{coronation}} is unknown.

Details of Stephen's coronation preserved in his Greater Legend suggest that the ceremony, which took place in Esztergom or Székesfehérvár followed <b>the</b> <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> the coronation of the German kings. Accordingly, Stephen was anointed with consecrated oil during the ceremony. Stephen's portrait, preserved on his royal cloak from 1031, shows that his crown, like the Holy Roman Emperor's diadem, was a hoop crown decorated with gemstones.|$|E

5|$|An early {{concept for}} <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
