5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was best}} known for {{reviving}} interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output, that is, the quantity <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins {{can be traced back}} to the 16th-century School of Salamanca or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations. Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.|$|E
5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E

50|$|Credit <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> (also called debt <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>money)</b> are <b>theories</b> {{concerning}} {{the relationship between}} credit and <b>money.</b> Proponents <b>of</b> these <b>theories,</b> such as Alfred Mitchell-Innes, sometimes emphasize that money and credit/debt are the same thing, seen from different points of view. Proponents assert that the essential nature <b>of</b> <b>money</b> is credit (debt), at least in eras where money is not backed by a commodity such as gold. Two common strands of thought within these theories are the idea that money originated as a unit of account for debt, and the position that money creation involves the simultaneous creation <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and debt. Some proponents <b>of</b> credit <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> argue that money is best understood as debt even in systems often understood as using commodity money.

25|$|Brunnermeier and Yuliy Sannikov {{integrated}} financial frictions into macro {{and international}} economic models. Their macro models capture non-linearities that occur during crises episodes.

Their monetary paper, The I <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>Money,</b> studies debt deflation à la Fisher and the interaction between monetary policy and macroprudential policy. It provides an alternative to the predominant New Keynesian view, in which price and wage rigidities are the primary frictions.|$|E
25|$|Fisher's main {{intellectual}} rival was the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell.

Although both economists concluded from their theories that {{at the heart of the}} business cycle (and economic crisis) was government monetary policy, their disagreement would not be solved in their lifetimes, and indeed, it was inherited by the policy debates between the Keynesians and monetarists beginning a half-century later.|$|E

He developed a monetary theory inspired by the research of Carl Menger, and he applied himself during the following years to the problems of the quantity <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> In his last 25 years he dedicated himself to sociology, which he believed must go hand-in-hand with economics for the fullest understanding of human society.

50|$|British {{classical}} economists in the 19th {{century had}} a well-developed controversy between theBanking and the Currency School. This parallels recent debates between proponents <b>of</b> the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> endogeneous <b>money,</b> such as Nicholas Kaldor, and monetarists, such as Milton Friedman. Monetarists {{and members of}} the currency school argued that banks can and should control the supply <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> According to their theories, inflation is caused by banks issuing an excessive supply <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> According to proponents <b>of</b> the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> endogenous <b>money,</b> the supply <b>of</b> <b>money</b> automatically adjusts to the demand, and banks can only control the terms (e.g., the rate of interest) on which loans are made.|$|R
50|$|Interest {{is being}} {{explained}} as a property premium instead.

500|$|The {{quantity}} <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> dominated macroeconomic theory {{until the}} 1930s. Two versions were particularly influential, one developed by Irving Fisher in works that included his 1911 The Purchasing Power of Money and another by Cambridge economists {{over the course}} of the early 20th century. Fisher's version of the quantity theory can be expressed by holding money velocity (the frequency with which a given piece of currency is used in transactions) (V) and real income (Q) constant and allowing money supply (M) and the price level (P) to vary in the equation of exchange: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{classical}} theory, {{the interest}} rate is determined by savings and investment alone, [...] Changes in the quantity of money do not affect {{the interest rate}} but only influence the price level (quantity <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>money).</b> Keynesian liquidity preference theory determines interest and income using two separate equilibrium conditions, namely, the equality of savings and investment, , and the equality of money demand and money supply, [...] This is the familiar IS-LM model. Like the classical approach, the IS-LM model contains an equilibrium condition that equates savings and investment.|$|E
500|$|Friedman {{developed}} his own quantity <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> that referred to Irving Fisher's but inherited much from Keynes. Friedman's 1956 [...] "The Quantity Theory of Money: A Restatement" [...] incorporated Keynes's {{demand for money}} and liquidity preference into an equation similar to the classical equation of exchange. Friedman's updated quantity theory also allowed {{for the possibility of}} using monetary or fiscal policy to remedy a major downturn. Friedman broke with Keynes by arguing that money demand is relatively stable—even during a downturn. Monetarists argued that [...] "fine-tuning" [...] through fiscal and monetary policy is counterproductive. They found money demand to be stable even during fiscal policy shifts, and both fiscal and monetary policies suffer from lags that made them too slow to prevent mild downturns.|$|E
5000|$|This contribution, {{called the}} [...] "cumulative process," [...] implied {{that if the}} natural rate of {{interest}} was not equal to the interest rate on loans, investment demand and savings would differ. If the interest rate is beneath the natural rate, an economic expansion occurs, and prices, ceteris paribus, will rise. This gave an early <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> endogenous <b>money</b> - money created by the internal workings of the economy, rather than external factors, and various <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> endogenous <b>money</b> have since developed.|$|R
50|$|His major {{contributions}} {{related to}} the quantity theory and the trade cycle. He {{was one of the}} first English economists to stress the primacy of credit-money rather than metallic legal tender. Furthermore, his income-based approach led to a closer integration <b>of</b> the <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and output. For Hawtrey, money income determines expenditure, expenditure determines demand and demand determines prices. Hawtrey summarized his aims in monetary theory in the preface to Currency and Credit.|$|R
50|$|The key {{distinction}} {{from mainstream}} economic <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> creation is that circuitism holds {{that money is}} created endogenously by the banking sector, rather than exogenously by the government through central bank lending: that is, the economy creates money itself (endogenously), rather than money being provided by some outside agent (exogenously). Circuitism also models banks and other firms separately, rather than combining them into a representative agent as in mainstream neoclassical models.|$|R
500|$|Hayek {{created the}} Austrian {{business}} cycle theory, which synthesizes Menger's capital theory and Mises's <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and credit. The theory proposes {{a model of}} inter-temporal investment in which production plans precede the manufacture of the finished product. The producers revise production plans to adapt to changes in consumer preferences. Producers respond to [...] "derived demand," [...] which is estimated demand for the future, instead of current demand. If consumers reduce their spending, producers believe that consumers are saving for additional spending later, so that production remains constant. Combined with a market of loanable funds (which relates savings and investment through the interest rate), this theory of capital production leads to {{a model of the}} macroeconomy where markets reflect inter-temporal preferences. Hayek's model suggests that an economic bubble begins when cheap credit initiates a boom where resources are misallocated, so that early stages of production receive more resources than they should and overproduction begins; the later stages of capital are not funded for maintenance to prevent depreciation. Overproduction in the early stages cannot be processed by poorly maintained later stage capital. The boom becomes a bust when a lack of finished goods leads to [...] "forced saving" [...] since fewer finished goods can be produced for sale.|$|E
