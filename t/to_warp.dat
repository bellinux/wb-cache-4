5|$|Working with {{producer}} J. Robbins, {{the group}} recorded the follow-up <b>to</b> <b>Warp</b> Riders at Magpie Cage Studios in Baltimore, Maryland between June and July 2012. The resulting album, Apocryphon, {{was released in}} October 2012 and debuted at number 17 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling over 16,000 copies in its first week and providing a new chart record for the band. The promotional Apocryphon Tour commenced the following week in the US, and continued across the world {{throughout the rest of}} 2012 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena chlorophos {{are found in}} forests, where they grow in groups on woody debris such as fallen twigs, branches, and bark. In the Japanese Hachijo and Bonin Islands, {{mushrooms}} occur predominantly on decaying petioles of the palm Phenix roeberenii. The fungus requires a proper range of humidity to form mushrooms; for example, on Hachijo Island, fruiting only occurs in the rainy seasons in June/July and September/October when the relative humidity is around 88%, usually the day after rain falls. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} mushroom primordia that are too wet become deformed, while conditions that are too dry cause the caps <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> and break because the delicate gelatinous membrane covering them is broken.|$|E
5|$|While {{performing}} a test run prior to the park opening on July 9, 2013, one of the roller coaster trains became stuck {{near the top of}} the lift hill. The train was eventually brought down a week later, and the ride remained closed for more than two months. Kings Dominion later explained the closure through a statement released on their official Facebook page on August 28, 2013, which stated that a problem with the weight distribution on the gearbox caused a part <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> and fail. The replacement part had to be custom-built in another country, causing the extended closure. The ride eventually reopened on September 14, 2013.|$|E

5|$|Billie is the {{youngest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal and her powers were inherited from her maternal grandmother, making Helen a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. Billie has the basic abilities of a witch, including casting spells, performing rituals, brewing potions, scrying for lost people or objects using of a crystal pendant, and communicating with the dead. She also has the power of telekinesis and later develops the ability <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> reality using a power known as projection. She is shown mastering her original powers very easily and adapting them using unconventional methods, such as attaching a large quartz crystal to her computer's mouse to scry through a GPS system. Her telekinesis enables her to perform acrobatic moves, such as backflips. However, she experiences difficulty using her power of projection due to her fear of hurting others. Billie eventually masters this power, and by the series finale she can easily travel through time.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Herren {{signed to}} the British label Warp under two aliases, Prefuse 73 and Savath & Savalas, after Warp staff {{had heard a}} {{previous}} record of Herren's which had sparked their interest in his work. Herren {{was familiar with the}} label through artists Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, but chose to sign <b>to</b> <b>Warp</b> as he was a fan of the group Broadcast who had released an EP through the label. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives features rapping from Mikah 9, Aesop Rock and MF Doom, and vocals from Sam Prekop of the indie rock band the Sea and Cake. The vocalists did not work directly with Herren, but sent him audio tapes of their own vocal recordings. Herren later commented on having Prekop sing on the album, noting that having an indie rock artist on the album was his way of trying to get his sound out to a new audience.|$|E
5|$|As was {{customary}} Collier {{received a}} promotion, to master and commander on 3 September 1799, and a command, the 18-gun sloop , on 21 October. Collier commanded the Victor {{for the next}} couple of years, escorting convoys and on one occasion a convoy of troop transports to the Red Sea, bringing troops to defeat the French forces in Egypt. He stopped briefly at Diego Garcia to take on supplies, whereupon he fell in with the 22-gun French corvette Flèche. The two ships fought a brief engagement on 1 September 1801, during which the Flèche damaged the Victors rigging and managed to escape. After repairing the damage, Collier searched the surrounding area before coming across his opponent on 5 September, sheltering in Mahé Roads. The channel was very narrow, and the wind unfavourable, but Collier managed <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> the Victor into the harbour, and with the aid of her staysails, closed on the French ship. After enduring raking fire for sometime, he was finally able to haul his ship around and the two vessels exchanged broadsides for over two hours. By then the Flèche was observed to be in a sinking condition, and her captain ran her aground. A party of men were sent over from the Victor, but having boarded the French vessel, found her crew had set her on fire and then abandoned ship. The men were temporarily evacuated while further assistance was sent across, after which they re-boarded and managed to extinguish the fire. Just as this had been achieved, the Flèche slipped off the reef into deeper water and sank.|$|E

50|$|Maintaining wooden boards {{requires}} {{that they be}} properly stored in a humidity and temperature controlled environment <b>to</b> prevent discoloration, <b>warping,</b> cracking, woodworm, mold and other serious wear. Prolonged exposure to sunlight can bleach the board. Boards transported between climates with significantly differing humidity levels may be subjected <b>to</b> <b>warping</b> or cracking due to rapidly changing moisture content in the wood.|$|R
5|$|Lasarra was {{a female}} protoss {{scientist}} stationed on Kaldir when it was attacked by zerg led by Sarah Kerrigan. The protoss were defeated; Lasarra was captured during the attack on Kaldir {{at the request of}} Abathur, who wanted to experiment on her even though it was known that the protoss could not be infested. Kerrigan agreed to spare Lasarra's life until she found a use for her. During her time onboard Kerrigan's leviathan, Lasarra interacted with Kerrigan a number of times. Kerrigan tried to justify her actions on Kaldir, saying that if the protoss could contact Shakuras, Kerrigan {{would not have been able}} to survive. However, Lasarra is unconvinced, saying that self-preservation is no justification for killing so many innocents. Eventually, Kerrigan admitted she could not and would not justify her actions, stating that both the zerg and protoss were killers. Eventually, as one of the protoss ships was able to break through the zerg blockade, Lasarra was implanted with a special larva and allowed <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> in to that ship. The larva devoured her and then other lifeforms being stored on the ship, evading detection. It eventually transformed into a broodmother, Niadra, which bred a new brood that infested the ship, killing every protoss on board. Kerrigan later showed some regret over Lasarra's death, as she told Izsha that she did not enjoy having to kill her.|$|E

40|$|A geometrically thin, {{optically}} thick, warped {{accretion disk}} {{with a central}} source of luminosity is subject to non-axisymmetric forces due to radiation pressure; the resulting torque acts <b>to</b> modify the <b>warp.</b> In a recent paper, disks are unstable <b>to</b> <b>warping</b> driven by radiation torque. Here we extend this work with a global analysis of the stable and unstable modes. We confirm Pringle's conclusion that thin centrally-illuminated accretion disks are generically unstable <b>to</b> <b>warping</b> via this mechanism; we discuss the time-evolution and likely steady-state of such systems and show specifically that this mechanism can explain the warping of the disk of water masers in NGC 4258 and the 164 -day precession period of the accretion disk in SS 433. Radiation-driven warping and precession provides a robust mechanism for producing warped, precessing accretion disks in active galactic nuclei and X-ray binary systems...|$|R

25|$|In 1808 Gambier was {{appointed}} to command the Channel Fleet. In April 1809 he chased a squadron of French ships that had escaped from Brest into the Basque Roads. He called a council of war in which Lord Cochrane was given command of the inshore squadron, and who subsequently led the attack. Gambier refused to commit the Channel Fleet after Cochrane's attack, using explosion vessels that encouraged the French squadron <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> further into the shallows of the estuary. This action resulted {{in the majority of}} the French fleet running aground at Rochefort.|$|E

As Wright was attempting <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> her out to the channel, he observed that a flotilla of gunboats had come out from the Morbihan and was approaching Vincejo. The gunboats started firing {{as soon as they}} were in range and continued firing as they approached. Vincejo crew alternated between manning the larboard guns and the starboard sweeps, leaving them exhausted.|$|E

25|$|On 17 August 1814, Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane {{detached}} Devastation, Euryalus, Ætna, Meteor, Manly and Erebus, {{all under}} Captain Alexander Gordon in Seahorse, {{to go up}} the Potomac and bombard Fort Washington, which was on the left bank of the river, some ten or twelve miles below Washington itself. The British suffered from several disadvantages. First, they lacked pilots that knew the Kettle-Bottoms, a difficult stretch of the river. Second, the winds blew in the wrong direction, slowing their advance. Consequently, it took them ten days to reach the fort, and during the journey all the ships grounded at least 20 times. For five successive days they had <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> over a distance of 50 miles.|$|E
25|$|Crew {{living on}} the International Space Station (ISS) are {{partially}} protected from the space environment by Earth's magnetic field, as the magnetosphere deflects solar wind around {{the earth and the}} ISS. Nevertheless, solar flares are powerful enough <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> and penetrate the magnetic defences, and so are still a hazard to the crew. The crew of Expedition 10 took shelter as a precaution in 2005 in a more heavily shielded part of the station designed for this purpose. However, beyond the limited protection of Earth's magnetosphere, interplanetary manned missions are much more vulnerable. Lawrence Townsend of the University of Tennessee and others have studied the most powerful solar flare ever recorded. Radiation doses astronauts would receive from a flare of this magnitude could cause acute radiation sickness and possibly even death.|$|E
25|$|As {{oversize}} wooden racquets have {{a strong}} tendency <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> and also lack solidity when produced at a playable weight, only one was produced, the Prince Woodie, which had many layers of graphite to improve its stability. That racquet was used successfully by male and female professionals, such as Gabriela Sabatini and professionals in development, such as Tommy Haas. Although it offered very little power, when compared with a graphite racquet, due to its flexibility, it absorbed ball shock well due to its wood construction, making it an excellent racquet for training. Similarly, fiberglass was quite flexible, like wood. The desire for more power led to graphite eventually completely displacing fiberglass, although graphite racquets with approximately 20% fiberglass were produced long after 100% fiberglass racquets disappeared from the market.|$|E

25|$|Quicksilver plays {{a pivotal}} role in the limited series House of M, convincing his now mentally {{unstable}} sister Wanda to use her abilities <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> reality and create a world where mutants are in a majority and humans are the minority. Thanks to Wolverine retaining his memories, along with the mysterious Layla Miller, many of Earth's heroes regain their memories and battle Magneto, who also remembers and realizes that Pietro is to blame for this mistake. Magneto kills Quicksilver (crushing his body with a robot Sentinel) in a rage at this perceived 'abuse' of his dream, although the character is resurrected and the normal reality restored when the Scarlet Witch witnesses this, telling Magneto he cares more for mutants than his own children. In retaliation the Scarlet Witch has also depowered 98% of the mutant population, which by accident includes Quicksilver.|$|E
25|$|Saving {{the game}} and {{leveling}} a character up can be done at specific locations in the game, albeit in a somewhat unconventional manner. Large red and blue flowers are scattered through the game. The player can save by directing the character to stand over a flower (both red and blue), although saving can also be done when navigating the sub-world screen. Leveling up can only be done via a blue flower, which allows the player <b>to</b> <b>warp</b> back to a church. At the church, he/she can pray to the priest in order to level up, {{as well as to}} upgrade their class. A level up results in an increase in the character's primary attributes such as HP and attack and defense, while a class up results in an increase in the character's deck capacity. The latter can only be done once a certain item Magnus is obtained (one per character per class).|$|E
