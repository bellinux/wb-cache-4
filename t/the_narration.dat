5|$|Like {{many other}} postmodern novels, Fowles uses {{multiple}} different stylistic and structural techniques to highlight his thematic interests in The French Lieutenant's Woman. When discussing these stylistic concerns, many literary critics {{comment on the}} importance of the narrator and <b>the</b> <b>narration,</b> the intertextual references to other literary works, and the multiple endings.|$|E

5|$|Abovian saw in {{strengthening}} of the friendship of Russian and Armenian peoples a guarantee of the national, political and cultural revival of his native lands. However; when Abovian wrote the novel he was already disillusioned with Tsarist policies in Armenia, particularly {{with the implementation of}} Polozhenie (Statute) in 1836 which greatly reduced the political power of the Armenian Catholicos and the abolishment of the Armenian Oblast in 1840. In the novel, elements of romanticism and realism are interlaced while <b>the</b> <b>narration</b> is supplanted by lyrical retreats.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} this variety and his interfusion of Western, Indian folk and Carnatic elements, Ilaiyaraaja's {{compositions}} {{appeal to the}} Indian rural dweller for its rhythmic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic Ragas, and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound. Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to <b>the</b> <b>narration,</b> which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{opposed the}} profanity in the script, as the vulgar {{language}} {{did not fit}} {{his vision of the}} 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with <b>the</b> <b>narration</b> technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to examine and compare narrations by five witnesses, who has written about atrocities against Christians from 1915 to 1919 in what is today {{south-eastern}} Turkey, but {{what was then the}} Ottoman Empire. I have focused on how the roles of perpetrators, victims, spectators and protectors are featured in <b>the</b> witness <b>narrations.</b> Four questions were posed in the study: Who are portrayed as perpetrators, victims, bystanders and protectors in <b>the</b> various witness <b>narrations?</b> How are these roles expressed in <b>the</b> witness <b>narrations?</b> What differences can be found among the five selected witness narrations from Mardin and Urfa, 1915 - 1919 ? What are the explanations of the differences in <b>the</b> witness <b>narrations?</b> <b>The</b> method I have used has been an analysis in which I compare how <b>the</b> different <b>narrations</b> capture <b>the</b> events of 1915 - 1919. I have used three factors to look at the explanations why there may be differences in <b>the</b> witness <b>narrations.</b> <b>The</b> three factors are nationality, position, and religious affiliation. In the comparison and the results of <b>the</b> witness <b>narrations,</b> I have found that the three factors affect the way the authors write about the events and that these factors help to explain the differences in <b>the</b> witness <b>narrations.</b> These factors {{are a part of the}} authors’ respective worldviews. Also, local differences, power constellations, and political factors meant that witness narrations differed...|$|R
5|$|Designing the in-game propaganda, {{they studied}} {{its use in}} history, finding {{the same pattern of}} {{elements}} reappearing throughout the centuries. In place of the militarily inspired propaganda of the first game, Dishonored 2 would employ a subtler approach; lavish posters for invariably canceled enterprises meant to aid the people of Serkonos were made to exhibit the nature of tyranny as practised by the Duke of Serkonos and his government. To further detail the world, <b>the</b> <b>narration</b> team would come up with fictitious products and brand names and make advertisements of them.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{considered}} {{releasing the}} film's soundtrack {{around the time}} of the film's roadshow release, but this idea was not realized. The soundtrack was first released as a mono three LP set and a stereo 8-track tape in sixteen countries by Disneyland and Buena Vista Records in 1957, containing the musical pieces without <b>the</b> <b>narration.</b> A stereo edition LP was issued by Buena Vista Records in 1961. Disney was required to obtain permission from Stokowski, who initially rejected its sale unless the Philadelphia Orchestra Association received a share of the royalties.|$|E

5|$|Featuring {{a number}} of erudite characters, The Elegance of the Hedgehog is full of allusions to {{literary}} works, music, films, and paintings. It incorporates themes relating to philosophy, class consciousness, and personal conflict. The events and ideas of the novel are presented through the thoughts and reactions, interleaved throughout the novel, of two narrators, Renée and Paloma. The changes of narrator are marked by switches of typeface. In the case of Paloma, <b>the</b> <b>narration</b> {{takes the form of}} her written journal entries and other philosophical reflections; Renée's story is also told in the first person but more novelistically and in the present tense.|$|E
5|$|Mary Alice Young is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the ABC television series Desperate Housewives. The character {{was created by}} television producer and screenwriter Marc Cherry and is portrayed by Brenda Strong, who also serves as the narrator of the series from beyond the grave; the character's suicide in the pilot episode served as the catalyst of the series. <b>The</b> <b>narration</b> provided by Mary Alice {{is essential to the}} tale of Wisteria Lane, as the series revolves around her sharing the secrets of her friends and neighbors. Her narration technique is akin in style to Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology (1915).|$|E

Fienberg stated that <b>the</b> <b>narrations</b> were devoid of meaning and attributed it to ABC having [...] "an in-house style that says that having your female lead narrate nothingness at the start of every episode is a worthy strategy", which he stated does not provide a good setting for a story about revenge.|$|R
