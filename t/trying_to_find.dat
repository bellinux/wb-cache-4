5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out which veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed {{to be set as}} the team got lost in the Houston Astrodome when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their way out, and barely made it to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out with solid defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began to set in. They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense {{spent a lot of time}} on the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency of the offense to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving their offense the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E

Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date again as it had on its previous release Louder Than Love (1989).

Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E
