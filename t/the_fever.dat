In 2007, however, outbreaks {{in the city}} was almost unstoppable. <b>The</b> <b>fever</b> outbreaks originally occurred only in Annan District, where the first case was reported in June. The health department failed to control the spread of <b>the</b> <b>fever,</b> and all six districts ended up having confirmed cases. There were also an outbreak in an old soldiers' home. On August 22, Mayor Hsu apologized for the disastrous outbreak of the dengue fever; he announced that the health department would be reorganized and new officials would be appointed in six months.|$|E
5|$|Between 1904 and 1906, the Malta Fever Commission (MFC) {{worked in}} the Castallania, and on 14 June 1905 the {{physician}} Sir Themistocles Zammit discovered the cause behind the Mediterranean fever (known also by various names) while working there. <b>The</b> <b>fever</b> was first traced in Malta among British soldiers during the French occupation of Malta.|$|E
5|$|Complications of {{smallpox}} arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia.

5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} <b>the</b> <b>fever</b> and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts {{for one to}} two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness {{in the back}} and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, difficulty swallowing, muscle pain, loss of superficial and deep reflexes, paresthesia (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to three days, and is usually complete by the time <b>the</b> <b>fever</b> breaks.|$|E
5|$|In June 1904, {{during the}} experiments, Zammit {{learned that a}} Maltese family of five members became {{simultaneously}} ill after consuming fresh unpasteurized milk from goats. Zammit decided to purchase healthy goats and tested them, {{and at one point}} also kept them {{on the first floor of}} the Castellania (then known as the public health building or the variants). Zammit was successful in the discovery of the disease. David Bruce, who led the MFC, discouraged the experiments when proposed by Zammit. However, when the experiment concluded in the discovery, Bruce tried to discredit Zammit by taking the merit for himself. Information about the role of Zammit was kept low profile or ignored. <b>The</b> <b>fever</b> was renamed after Bruce, as brucellosis. The MFC managed to find cure and ways to eradicate <b>the</b> <b>fever,</b> but had a hard time since there was lack of cooperation with sellers and consumers of milk, some dismissing or ignoring the finding. It was under control by 1938, with the enforcement of standard procedures of pasteurizing milk. However, slaughtering of infected animals continued throughout the 20th century and there was another rising challenge for the department in 1994 and 1995.|$|E

5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the bark of the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when <b>the</b> <b>fever</b> reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required for a complete recovery.|$|E

5|$|After the bungled murder, Raskolnikov {{falls into}} a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder. He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock, and tries desperately to clean his {{clothing}} of any blood or evidence. He {{falls into a}} fever later that day, though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin. As <b>the</b> <b>fever</b> comes and goes in the following days, Raskolnikov behaves as though he wishes to betray himself. He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions {{the murder of the}} pawn-broker, which is now known about and talked of in the city. In his delirium, Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg, drawing more and more attention to himself and his relation to the crime. In one of his walks through the city, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets. Rushing to help him, Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man's family, which includes his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family.|$|E
5|$|In fatal {{cases of}} {{ordinary}} smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth {{days of the}} illness. The cause of death from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating immune complexes, overwhelming viremia, or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors. In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after <b>the</b> <b>fever</b> develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death. In flat smallpox modes of death {{are similar to those}} in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and electrolytes beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and fulminating sepsis.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, before antibiotics, {{patients}} with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with malaria to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese psychiatrist, began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced Plasmodium vivax malaria. Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (Spirochaeta pallida also known as Treponema pallidum). P. vivax infections were then terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling <b>the</b> <b>fever</b> with quinine, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of chemotherapeutic research and was practised until 1950. Wagner-Jauregg was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation {{in the treatment of}} dementia paralytica.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to <b>the</b> <b>fever,</b> chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to earn a}} {{good living}} in the village, Harihar travels {{to the city to}} seek a better job.

One day during the monsoon season, Durga plays in the downpour for too long, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Adequate medical care being unavailable, <b>the</b> <b>fever</b> becomes worse, and on a night of incessant rain and gusty winds, she dies. Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. Sarbajaya, who remains silent, breaks down at the feet of her husband, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that he has lost his daughter. The family decide to leave their ancestral home. As they start packing, Apu finds the necklace that Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart.|$|E

5|$|Spanish missionaries {{found that}} fever was treated by Amerindians near Loxa (Peru) with powder from Peruvian bark (later {{established}} to be from any of several trees of genus Cinchona). It {{was used by the}} Quechua Indians of Peru to reduce the shaking effects caused by severe chills. Jesuit Brother Agostino Salumbrino (1561–1642), who lived in Lima and was an apothecary by training, observed the Quechua using the bark of the cinchona tree for that purpose. While its effect in treating malaria (and hence malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from cold, it was nevertheless effective for malaria. The use of the “fever tree” bark was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries (Jesuit's bark). Jesuit Bernabé de Cobo (1582–1657), who explored Mexico and Peru, is credited with taking cinchona bark to Europe. He brought the bark from Lima to Spain, and then to Rome and other parts of Italy, in 1632. Francesco Torti wrote in 1712 that only “intermittent fever” was amenable to <b>the</b> <b>fever</b> tree bark. This work finally established the specific nature of cinchona bark and brought about its general use in medicine.|$|E
5|$|When a {{mosquito}} carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus enters the skin {{together with the}} mosquito's saliva. It binds to and enters white blood cells, and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body. The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins, such as cytokines and interferons, which are responsible {{for many of the}} symptoms, such as <b>the</b> <b>fever,</b> the flu-like symptoms, and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the liver and the bone marrow) can be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to capillary permeability. As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the stromal cells leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.|$|E
