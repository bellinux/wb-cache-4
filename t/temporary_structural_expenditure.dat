40|$|The {{debate over}} the EU budget 2007 - 2013 made clear the need of an {{in-depth}} understanding {{of the distribution of}} the EU development funds. The scarce resources available need to be targeted more effectively towards the real needs of EU countries and regions in order to deliver the expected benefits. The literature on the impact of <b>structural</b> funds <b>expenditure</b> on regional growth and cohesion highlighted the reduced long-term impact of <b>structural</b> funds <b>expenditure.</b> One of the reasons for such result was identified in the biased allocation of funds among the different development axes. In this paper we assume a different perspective and focus the spatial structure of the expenditure for the Eu development policies under the 2000 - 2006 budget. For this purpose we collect a specific dataset for the EU- 15 regions, including not only structural funds (as in the existing literature) but also rural development funds under the CAP. This extended dataset allows us to assess the spatial structure of a significant percentage of the total funds targeted towards regional development. On the basis such dataset we are able: a) to analyse the spatial concentration of <b>structural</b> <b>expenditure</b> as an important prerequisite for its effectiveness. A low degree of spatial concentration of the funds may support the hypothesis of a distribution based on political equilibrium rather than effectiveness. In addition {{we will be able to}} test the spatial association of rural and regional development funds which are rarely analysed jointly thus shedding some light on the spatial coherence of the expenditure for different policies; b) to compare the spatial concentration of EU funds with a specifically developed indicator of socio-economic disadvantage of the EU regions. This analysis will allow us to analyse the coherence of the EU regional policies with regard to the structural disadvantage of EU regions thus uncovering a potential inconsistency between policy objectives (favouring disadvantaged areas) and the beneficiaries of the funds. The paper shows that although there a certain degree of spatial association between structural and rural development expenditure the factors of socio-economic disadvantage are more spatially concentrated than the funds aimed at addressing such disadvantage. ...|$|R

The methylation requires the pairing of an sRNA antisense element to an rRNA target site with {{formation of an}} RNA–RNA duplex. The temporary formation of such a duplex during rRNA maturation is expected to influence rRNA folding in a chaperone-like way, in particular in thermophilic Archaea, where multiple sRNAs with two binding sites are found. Here we investigate possible mechanisms of chaperone function of Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Pyrococcus abyssi C/D box sRNAs using computer simulations of rRNA secondary structure formation by genetic algorithm. The effects of sRNA binding on rRNA structure are introduced as <b>temporary</b> <b>structural</b> constraints during co-transcriptional folding. Comparisons of the final predictions with simulations without sRNA binding and with phylogenetic structures show that sRNAs with two antisense elements may significantly facilitate the correct formation of long-range interactions in rRNAs, in particular at elevated temperatures.

40|$|Economic {{and social}} {{cohesion}} between the EU Member States {{is one of}} the explicitly stated goals in the Treaty on European Union. The EU’s Structural Funds {{as a part of the}} Union’s regional policies are a mechanism of conditional grants that provides co-financing for growth enhancing investments. Evidence on the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is mixed. While Boldrin and Canova (2001) find no sign of a catch-up effect of regions receiving aid for the period of 1980 - 1996, Beugelsdijk and Eijffinger (2005) find a positive relationship between (lagged) <b>Structural</b> Funds <b>expenditure</b> and GDP growth at the national level covering 1995 - 2001. De La Fuente (2002) points to the fact that the inclusion of conditioning variables might also play a crucial role for the results. Ederveen, deGroot and Nahuis (2002) find that Structural Funds themselves have a negative impact on growth. However, the impact turns out to be significantly positive, when interacting variables measuring institutional quality are taken into account. Similarly, Esposti (2005) shows that additional policy measures (spending on CAP) can have significant counter-effects on the effectiveness of <b>Structural</b> Funds <b>expenditure.</b> So far the federal structure of the EU Member States did not attract much attention when the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is considered. Although the EU Commission requires the inclusion of regional authorities and stakeholders in the planning and implementation procedure of programs funded by Structural Funds, one should expect that the performance is better, where the sub-national authorities are more accustomed to pursuing economic policy and implementing programs. This should be the case in states with a higher degree of sub-national autonomy. Using panel-data for a sample of 13 EU Member States from 1960 - 1995 the effects of Structural Funds on growth are analysed. Then a decentralization index by Stegarescu (2004) is introduced as an interacting variable in order to measure the degree of sub-national autonomy.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to investigate how cooperation can be facili-tated in the real-world social dilemma of choosing to commute by automobile rather than by public transport. A survey of 335 drivers was carried out before and during an 8 -day temporary freeway closure in Osaka, Japan. The results showed that the fre-quency of switching to public transport during the closure was inversely related to the frequency of automobile commuting before the closure. Furthermore, drivers who more frequently commuted by automobile overestimated commuting time by public transport to a larger extent than did drivers who commuted less frequently by automo-bile. At the same time, the larger the overestimation the more likely were drivers to change their perception of commute time. It is suggested that a <b>temporary</b> <b>structural</b> change, such as a freeway closure, may be an important catalyst that triggers coopera-tion in a social dilemma...|$|R

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), especially ultra-short SWNTs (US-tubes), have proven useful for reinforcing synthetic polymeric scaffold materials. In this article, we report on the in vivo biocompatibility of US-tube reinforced porous biodegradable scaffolds in a rabbit model. US-tube nanocomposite scaffolds and control polymer scaffolds were implanted in rabbit femoral condyles and in subcutaneous pockets. The hard and soft tissue response was analyzed with micro-computed tomography (micro CT), histology, and histomorphometry at 4 and 12 weeks after implantation. The porous US-tube nanocomposite scaffolds exhibited favorable hard and soft tissue responses at both time points. At 12 weeks, a three-fold greater bone tissue ingrowth was seen in defects containing US-tube nanocomposite scaffolds compared to control polymer scaffolds. Additionally, the 12 week samples showed reduced inflammatory cell density and increased connective tissue organization. No significant quantitative difference in polymer degradation was observed among the various groups; qualitative differences between the two time points were consistent with expected degradation due to the progression of time. Although no conclusions can be drawn from the present study concerning the osteoinductivity of US-tube nanocomposite scaffolds, the results suggest that the presence of US-tubes may render nanocomposite scaffolds bioactive assisting osteogenesis...|$|R

Second, conventional estimates of revenue elasticities seem not to allow an accurate assessment of the fiscal stance and {{of the strength of}} underlying fiscal positions during boom-bust phases.
