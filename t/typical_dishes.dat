500|$|The backcountry {{relied heavily}} on a diet based on mush made from soured milk or boiled grains. Clabber, a yogurt-like food made with soured milk, was a {{standard}} breakfast dish and was eaten by backcountry settlers of all ages. This dietary habit was not shared by other British immigrant groups and was equally despised by those still in Britain. The Anglican missionary Charles Woodmason, who spent time among Ulster Irish immigrants, described them as depending [...] "wholly on butter, milk, clabber and what in England is given to hogs". Oatmeal mush was a popular meal in the British borderlands and remained popular in America. The only difference was that the oatmeal was replaced by corn, and is still known today in the South as grits. Cakes of unleavened dough baked on bakestones or circular griddles were common and went by names such as [...] "clapbread", [...] "griddle cakes" [...] and [...] "pancakes". While the potato had originated in South America, it did not become established in North America until it {{was brought to the}} colonies by northern British settlers in the 18th century and became an important backcountry staple along with corn. Pork had been a food taboo among northern Britons and the primary meat had been sheep. In the American colonies the raising of sheep was not as efficient and mutton was therefore replaced with pork. The habit of eating [...] "sallet" [...] or [...] "greens" [...] remained popular, but the vegetables of the Old World were replaced with plants like squashes, gourds, beans, corn, land cress, and pokeweed. The distinctive cooking style of the British borderlands and the American backcountry was boiling. Along with clabber, porridge, and mushes, the <b>typical</b> <b>dishes</b> were various stews, soups and pot pies.|$|E
