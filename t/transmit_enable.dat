Using feedback CSI, the base station jointly selects a set of orthogonal beamforming vectors and schedules a subset of feedback users for downlink transmission such that the throughput is maximized.

This paper proposes and analyzes a practical scheme for joint orthogonal beamforming and scheduling, which is enabled by feedback of quantized channel state information. In this approach, the base station generates multiple sets of orthogonal beamforming vectors and associates each vector with a specific user. Subsequently, the base station selects one set of beamforming vectors and the associated users for downlink transmission such that the throughput is maximized. Unlike the optimal approach, the proposed scheme has computational complexity that increases only linearly {{with the number of}} users since it does not require an exhaustive search over all possible subsets of users.

30|$|Due to its {{low cost}} and popularity, the IEEE 802.11 WLAN (wireless local area network) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising wireless technologies for IoT (Internet of Things). 802.11 WLAN also provides a PSM (power saving mechanism), by which the devices that have no data to <b>transmit</b> are <b>enabled</b> to turn into doze mode where much less power is consumed. However, the 802.11 PSM is known to be inefficient because of its contention-based mechanism, i.e., it suffers from the performance degradation due to hidden terminals, especially in a network with a large number of devices. In this paper, in order to improve the performance of the 802.11 PSM, we propose a BC (backoff counter) reservation scheme that is combined with a neighbor polling solution. By building analytic models and performing extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme provides a much improved performance.|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} system, {{as applied to}} 625 line analogue TV, the audio signal was sampled twice during each television line and each sample converted to 10-bit PCM. Two such samples were inserted into the next line synchronising pulse. At the destination, the audio samples were converted back to analogue form and the video waveform restored to normal. Compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved. As the PCM noise was predominantly high-pitched, the compandor only needed to operate on the high frequencies. Also, the compandor only operated at high audio levels, so that modulation of the noise by the companding would be masked by the relatively loud high-frequency audio components. A pilot tone at half the sampling frequency was <b>transmitted</b> to <b>enable</b> the expander to track the gain adjustment applied by the compressor, even when the latter was limiting.|$|R

30|$|In coordinated transmissions, the {{beamforming}} weights {{are chosen}} {{according to the}} level of knowledge available at each transmitter, i.e., the data and channel state information (CSI), and the degree of cooperation between the transmit cells. The exchange of full CSI and data information between the <b>transmit</b> cells <b>enables</b> the joint computation of the beamforming weights [4]. However, even if this scheme achieves optimal performance, it requires a central coordinator to gather all CSI to jointly compute the beamforming weights and then to redistribute these weights to each transmit cell [5]. The implementation of coordinated transmissions in a distributed network is hence challenging due to the complexity of the joint beamforming and the extensive sharing of information between the transmit cells where backhaul limitations and latency issues arise [6, 7]. In addition, considering a source broadcasting its symbol information to two relay stations, the symbol information is then readily available at both relays [8, 9]. However, in such a case, the sharing of the CSI is difficult, especially when the receivers are moving and their channels are varying.|$|R
