It's an act of commitment <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>family.</b> I honestly {{think that that is}} a different kind of crime.

2500|$|Runner {{up of the}} {{eleventh}} series, Vana Koutsomitis criticized the living conditions that candidates live in; granted they are accommodated in a lavish house, Vana claimed that the bosses impose living conditions similar to Big Brother - with strict rules and zero contact with outsiders. She said [...] "They just throw you into a house {{and tell you that}} you have no phone, no internet and you’ll have no contact with the outside world, You can only talk <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>family</b> once a week for 10 minutes and that’s monitored. And we weren’t allowed to go to Boots to grab something. We had to be monitored and guided there." [...] She continued; [...] "I think that element of cabin fever and psychological torture is not necessary for a business competition. I don’t believe that you need to isolate people.

2500|$|Two {{days before}} the film was {{released}} in theaters, the Richard Nixon Library and birthplace in Yorba Linda, California issued a statement {{on behalf of the}} Nixon family, calling parts of the film [...] "reprehensible" [...] and that it was designed to [...] "defame and degrade President and Mrs. Nixon's memories {{in the mind of the}} American public". This statement was based on a published copy of the script. The statement also criticized Stone's depiction of Nixon's private life, that of his childhood, and his part in planning the assassination of Fidel Castro. Stone responded that his [...] "purpose in making the film, Nixon was neither malicious nor defamatory", and was an attempt to gain [...] "a fuller understanding of the life and career of Richard Nixon [...] the good and the bad, the triumphs and the tragedies, and the legacy he left his nation and the world". Walt Disney's daughter, Diane Disney Miller, wrote a letter to Nixon's daughters saying that Stone had [...] "committed a grave disservice <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>family,</b> to the Presidency, and to American history". Stone does not see his film as the definitive statement on Nixon but as [...] "a basis to start reading, to start investigating on your own".|$|E
