5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by <b>the</b> <b>magistrates,</b> who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of <b>the</b> <b>magistrates,</b> each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E
5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two {{lines in the}} crowd a few yards apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 May, a meeting was held in Southery, Norfolk. The group, {{including}} a Thomas Sindall, marched through Denver to Downham Market to meet with <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> at their weekly meeting at The Crown public house. Sindall {{was the only person}} known to have been at both the riots at Downham Market and Littleport. He was killed by troopers at Littleport—see below. The mob of 1,500, mainly men but some women, besieged The Crown until <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> agreed to allow a deputation of eight rioters inside to make their pleas: to have work and two-shillings (£) per day. <b>The</b> <b>magistrates</b> acceded to these demands, but they had already called the yeoman cavalry from Upwell, who arrived at 5pm. Backed by the troops, the Riot Act was then read in the market place by Reverend Dering, causing further tussles, which subsided after arrests started to be made.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>magistrate</b> undresses {{and hangs}} his clothes {{on a tree}} and goes {{to sleep in the}} miller's bed. The miller has escaped from prison and sees <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> in his bed. The miller thinks that <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> is {{sleeping}} with his wife and plans to switch clothes with <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> and avenge himself by seducing <b>the</b> <b>magistrate's</b> wife. <b>The</b> miller leaves, dressed as <b>the</b> <b>magistrate,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> soon wakes up. He goes outside and sees that his clothes are gone, so he dresses in the miller's clothes. The bodyguard comes and sees <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> dressed as <b>the</b> miller and goes to arrest him. The miller's wife sees the bodyguard fighting with what looks like her husband and joins in the fight. The miller comes back and sees his wife in the fight and joins it to protect her. <b>The</b> <b>magistrate</b> explains <b>the</b> entire story and the ballet ends with the miller's guests tossing <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> up and down in a blanket.|$|R
50|$|The miller hides and <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> sees <b>the</b> miller's wife dancing. After {{her dance}} she offers him some grapes. When <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> gets <b>the</b> grapes the miller's wife runs away with <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> {{following}} her. Finally he catches her, and the miller {{jumps out of}} a bush with a stick. The miller chases <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> away and <b>the</b> miller and his wife continue working.|$|R
50|$|If {{the accused}} pleads guilty, the {{prosecutor}} {{will present a}} summary report of the evidence and findings to <b>the</b> court. <b>The</b> <b>magistrate</b> will then read the report out loud and ask the accused {{whether or not he}} agrees with the summary. Even though the accused pleads guilty and agrees with the summary report, <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> still has <b>the</b> responsibility to ensure that everything fulfils all the required elements for conviction. If <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> considers that <b>the</b> prosecutor’s findings and the accused’s guilty plea are not enough for conviction, <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> can acquit <b>the</b> accused disregarding the fact the accused pleads guilty. If <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> accepts <b>the</b> report and the guilty plea, <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> is required to give the accused the last chance of word to present excuses and reasons in the hope of receiving less severe judgement. After, <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> can give judgement or wait for the reports from probation officers and other experts. Under the principle of the last chance of word, the accused has every right to read all the probation reports or other documents and comment on all of them before <b>the</b> <b>magistrate.</b> Then, <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> can give final judgement.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>magistrates</b> court {{continued}} to cover significant trials that were widely {{reported by the}} media. In 1963, Christine Keeler was tried here for attempting to obstruct the course of justice. In the late 1960s, a number of rock stars, including The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones, stood trial on drugs offences at <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> court. Richards was tried here again in 1973 for possession of heroin and owning unlicensed firearms, but was only fined £205 (now £). John Lennon and Yoko Ono were tried for obscenity here in 1970. The building became Grade II listed in 1970. The courts closed in 1998, and are now the Courthouse Hotel.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} {{relating to}} {{the election of the}} pope have undergone almost two millennia of development. Procedures similar to the present system were introduced in 1274 when Gregory X promulgated Ubi periculum following the action of <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> of Viterbo during the interregnum of 1268–1271.|$|E
5|$|A duel {{was fought}} on the moor in July 1804 between Mr. Jones and Mr. Shakspere Philips. Mr. Jones fired at Mr. Philips without effect and Mr. Philips then fired his pistol in the air, {{upon which the}} seconds interfered, the two man shook hands and honour was satisfied. Two weeks later, two other {{men who had been}} quarrelling in the {{newspapers}} met on the moor to gain satisfaction. However, <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> had been informed and the men were arrested before the duel could take place.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also the}} method used to {{transfer}} a case from <b>the</b> <b>Magistrate’s</b> Court to a Regional Court where <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> does have territorial and offence-type jurisdiction, but the State feels that {{it is likely that}} the sentence will exceed <b>the</b> <b>magistrate’s</b> sentence jurisdiction.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Magistrate's</b> Court is <b>the</b> {{court of}} lowest {{jurisdiction}} in the British Virgin Islands. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Magistrate's</b> Court deals mainly with criminal matters with summary jurisdiction, minor civil claims, and certain family law matters. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Magistrate</b> also has limited jurisdiction {{in relation to}} salvage and wreck.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>magistrate</b> judge's seat {{is not a}} {{separate}} court; the authority that a magistrate judge exercises is {{the jurisdiction of the}} district court itself, delegated to <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> judge by <b>the</b> district judges of the court under governing statutory authority, local rules of court, or court orders. Rather than fixing <b>the</b> duties of <b>magistrate</b> judges nationwide, <b>the</b> Federal <b>Magistrates</b> Act allows each district court to assign duties to <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> judges as fits the needs of that court.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> {{delegated}} Henry Law {{to go to}} London {{to discuss}} the matter with Lord Sidmouth, the Home Secretary. On the way, Law stopped at the barracks of the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry and requested they go to Ely. Law was unable to convince Sidmouth of the seriousness of the situation, and Sidmouth asked Reverend Sir Henry Bate Dudley to return with Law and report on the matter.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Caesar {{began to}} prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome would limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC. This {{transformed}} <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> from representatives of the people to representatives of the dictator.|$|E
5|$|Sixty cavalrymen of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, led by Captain Hugh Hornby Birley, a local factory owner, {{arrived at}} the house from where <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> were watching; some reports allege that they were drunk. Andrews, the Chief Constable, {{instructed}} Birley {{that he had an}} arrest warrant which he needed assistance to execute. Birley was asked to take his cavalry to the hustings to allow the speakers to be removed; it was by then about 1:40pm.|$|E
50|$|If {{it appears}} to <b>the</b> <b>magistrate,</b> on <b>the</b> {{materials}} submitted, that a death took place, {{and that it was}} not due to natural causes, <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> causes an inquest to be instituted. If the inquest is to be held in another district, or before a judge or regional <b>magistrate,</b> <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> forwards <b>the</b> papers accordingly.|$|R
50|$|While <b>the</b> Chinese <b>magistrate's</b> staff {{attempted}} {{to suppress the}} riot, the French Consul visited <b>the</b> <b>magistrate's</b> official quarters to lodge an angry diatribe, even {{going so far as}} to draw his sword and embed it in <b>the</b> <b>magistrate's</b> table. <b>The</b> <b>magistrate</b> was not there, however, and Fontanier left empty-handed. The series of events afterwards are somewhat confused: while both Chinese and French histories agree Fontanier shot a Chinese assistant dead after an argument with <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> (who was just entering his office as the Consul was leaving), the French version says Fontanier's shot only came after he was threatened by the mob and <b>the</b> <b>magistrate.</b> In any case, both the French Consul and his assistant, M. Simon, were murdered by the rioters and their bodies dumped in the river.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>magistrate</b> judge {{recommended}} {{dismissal of}} Day's habeas petition. In his {{objection to the}} report and recommendation of <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> judge, Day argued {{for the first time}} that the concession of timeliness by the state was dispositive because it constituted a forfeiture of that defense. The district court instead adopted <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> judge's report and dismissed Day's petition.|$|R
5|$|The Town Hall {{was built}} in 1778, with the porch and arcade being added in 1861 and the balcony and round windows in 1932. It is a Grade II listed building. It {{replaced}} the former {{on the site of}} the Market and Assize Hall in the Market Place, and a Canonical House also known as 'The Exchequer', on the authority of an Act of Parliament dated 1779. The building also houses <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> courts and other offices. The Assize court last sat here in October 1970.|$|E
5|$|This case {{became a}} model for, and was {{referenced}} in, the Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts, when <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> {{were looking for}} proof that spectral evidence {{could be used in}} a court of law. Reverend John Hale, whose wife was accused at Salem, in his publication, Modest Inquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft, noted how the judges consulted for precedents and lists the 60-page publication A Tryal of Witches.|$|E
5|$|Augusta Raurica and Aventicum {{were also}} the civitates, or capitals, of the non-Roman tribes of the Rauraci and Helvetii, respectively. In that capacity, <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> of Aventicum, as duoviri coloniae Helvetiorum, also governed the entire Helvetic population, which had {{the legal status of}} incolae (inhabitants) {{invested}} with the Latin Right. The rights of the Roman coloni, or colonists, were represented by a special authority, the curatores colonorum Aventicensum ("Heads of the colonists of Aventicum"). Moreover, the Roman citizens of the entire territory established the cives Romani conventus Helvetici ("Association of Roman citizens in Helvetia").|$|E

50|$|Originally {{established}} in 1853 as the Police Court <b>the</b> <b>Magistrate's</b> Court, which was renamed in 1996, can try any criminal offence if <b>the</b> <b>Magistrate</b> considers that <b>the</b> appropriate sentence {{is not more}} than one year in prison or a fine of £5,000. If <b>the</b> <b>Magistrate</b> considers that a heavier sentence might be appropriate, then the case will be committed to the Royal Court for trial. Similarly if, having tried <b>the</b> case, <b>the</b> <b>Magistrate</b> subsequently decides that their sentencing powers are insufficient, they may refer the case to the Royal Court for sentencing.|$|R
50|$|Under some circumstances, the {{prosecutors}} may request <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> to postpone <b>the</b> case without {{asking the question}} {{whether or not the}} accused pleads guilty. The prosecutors may bring such requests to <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> when <b>the</b> prosecutors are waiting for the reports from the government laboratory (like, analysis of the purity of illegal drugs) or the decision from the Secretary of transferring the case to the District Court or not. If <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> approves such request, <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> will arrange <b>the</b> next hearing and deal with the issue of admission to bail.|$|R

5|$|Economic {{conditions}} in 1817 {{led to a}} group who became known as Blanketeers to organise a march from Manchester to London so they could petition the Prince Regent for parliamentary reform. A crowd of 25,000 including 5,000 men who intended to march gathered in St Peter's Fields. After <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> read the Riot Act, the crowd was dispersed by the King's Dragoon Guards. The ringleaders were arrested and subsequently released when serious charges against them were not forthcoming. In April 1819 three leading Blanketeers were convicted of sedition and conspiracy when witnesses alleged they had advocated the principal towns of the kingdom should elect representatives to a National Convention to demand their rights and if refused enforce them 'sword in hand' during a meeting in Stockport in September 1818.|$|E
5|$|Kalākaua {{arrived in}} Glasgow on September 7.

5|$|Tribunes {{could use}} their sacrosanctity {{to order the}} use of capital {{punishment}} against any person who interfered with their duties. Tribunes could also use their sacrosanctity as protection when physically manhandling an individual, such as when arresting someone. On a couple of rare occasions (such as during the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus), a tribune might use a form of blanket obstruction, which could involve a broad veto over all governmental functions. While a tribune could veto any act of the senate, the assemblies, or <b>the</b> <b>magistrates,</b> he could only veto the act, and not the actual measure. Therefore, he had to physically be present when the act was occurring. As soon as that tribune was no longer present, the act could be completed as if {{there had never been}} a veto.|$|E
5|$|When Augustus died in 14 AD, the Principate legally ended. Tiberius {{knew that}} if he secured the support of the army, the rest of the {{government}} would soon follow. Therefore, Tiberius assumed command of the Praetorian Guard, and used his Proconsular imperium to force the armies to swear allegiance to him. As soon as this occurred, the Senate and <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> acquiesced. Under Tiberius, the power to elect magistrates was transferred from the assemblies to the Senate. When Tiberius died, Caligula was proclaimed Emperor by the Senate. In 41 Caligula was assassinated, and for two days following his assassination, the Senate debated the merits of restoring the Republic. Due {{to the demands of the}} army, however, Claudius was declared emperor, but he was ultimately killed, and Nero was declared Emperor.|$|E
5|$|At about 11pm, the rioters {{arrived at}} the house of the Reverend John Vachell, who, after {{threatening}} to shoot anyone who entered his house, was disarmed when threemen rushed him. He fled on foot {{with his wife and two}} daughters towards Ely. After Vachell had left, the rioters destroyed his goods and chattels and stole some of his silverware. Vachell was later to sue the Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act. He received over £708 (£), an award which was challenged in the press, as many people complained about the size of the resulting district levies used to pay for it. The rioters then stopped a post-chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham. They robbed Evans of 14shillings (£) before allowing them both to proceed. On reaching Ely, Evans alerted <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> who sent a carriage for Reverend Vachell, which collected him and his family walking towards Ely.|$|E
