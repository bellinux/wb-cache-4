5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed,</b> and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|A soundtrack album, Soma Bringer Original Soundtrack, was {{released}} through the Sleigh Bells label on April 2, 2008. The soundtrack covers three discs. In addition to tracks used in-game, the album includes four tracks with full orchestral versions of particular tracks. Ben Schweitzer, writing for RPGFan, positively compared the score to earlier works by Mitsuda, calling it his best recent soundtrack despite some tracks being overly similar to earlier work. Don Kotowski of Video Game Music Online gave the soundtrack album a perfect score of 5/5 stars. He frequently praised Mitsuda's style, and like Schweitzer {{noted that it}} often recalled his earlier work. He also praised the additional tracks for their richness and depth, finishing his review by {{saying that it was}} a soundtrack not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> by buyers of video game music.|$|E
5|$|The {{naming of}} their {{children}} represented a break with the traditional Scots regal names such as Malcolm, Cináed and Áed. The point of naming Margaret's sons—Edward after her father Edward the Exile, Edmund for her grandfather Edmund Ironside, Ethelred for her great-grandfather Ethelred the Unready and Edgar for her great-great-grandfather Edgar and her brother, briefly the elected king, Edgar Ætheling—was unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> in England, where William of Normandy's grasp on power was far from secure. Whether {{the adoption of the}} classical Alexander for the future Alexander I of Scotland (either for Pope Alexander II or for Alexander the Great) and the biblical David for the future David I of Scotland represented a recognition that William of Normandy would not be easily removed, or was due to the repetition of Anglo-Saxon royal name—another Edmund had preceded Edgar—is not known. Margaret also gave Malcolm two daughters, Edith, who married Henry I of England, and Mary, who married Eustace III of Boulogne.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} expressionist use of {{monolithic}} materials was by Erich Mendelsohn at the Einstein Tower. Not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> was a pun on the towers namesake, Einstein, and {{an attempt to}} make the building out of one stone, Ein stein. Though not cast in one pour of concrete (due to technical difficulties, brick and stucco were used partially) the effect of the building is an expression of the fluidity of concrete before it is cast. 'Architecture of Steel and Concrete' was the title of an 1919 exhibition of Mendelsohn's sketches at Paul Cassirer's gallery in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{control by}} deadpan and sisterless disappears and what becomes {{important}} is {{the form of the}} sex-lethal gene. A secondary promoter causes transcription in both males and females. Analysis of the cDNA has shown that different forms are expressed in males and females. Sex-lethal has been shown to affect the splicing of its own mRNA. In males, the third exon is included which encodes a stop codon, causing a truncated form to be produced. In the female version, the presence of sex-lethal causes this exon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> out; the other seven amino acids are produced as a full peptide chain, again giving a difference between males and females.|$|E
25|$|Vaccines {{have contributed}} to the {{eradication}} of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases in humans. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago. As long as {{the vast majority of people}} are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called herd immunity. Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan). However, the difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings have caused the anticipated eradication date <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> several times.|$|E

25|$|Genome-wide {{analysis}} of alternative splicing is a challenging task. Typically, alternatively spliced transcripts {{have been found}} by comparing EST sequences, but this requires sequencing of very large numbers of ESTs. Most EST libraries come from a very limited number of tissues, so tissue-specific splice variants are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> in any case. High-throughput approaches to investigate splicing have, however, been developed, such as: DNA microarray-based analyses, RNA-binding assays, and deep sequencing. These methods {{can be used to}} screen for polymorphisms or mutations in or around splicing elements that affect protein binding. When combined with splicing assays, including in vivo reporter gene assays, the functional effects of polymorphisms or mutations on the splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts can then be analyzed.|$|E

In 2004, Tara Ariano of MSNBC.com wrote that the character trivia is [...] "revealed in a manner completely organic to the plot.

[...] Another statement {{of the same kind}} is found in Thingal patham which says, [...] "Those who wear a tuft (Brahmins) will not remain on this earth any longer". Apart from these open statements, certain mythical episodes implicating the Brahmins are too conspicuous <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed.</b> For example, the mythical narrative blames the Brahmins for consuming the whole of the nectar that is meant for all humanity, and on that account, condemns them to grow on earth as palmyra trees.|$|E

[...] The Times of London commented that although Miranda's videos have made her [...] "a darling of the Broadway musical-theatre scene ... is not online but on stage that Miranda truly comes to ghastly life." [...] In 2010, a BroadwayWorld review of Miranda's live comedy act said that Ballinger's [...] "'Miranda Sings' persona is a very unique and original concept devised by a very creative imagination. ... Miranda is not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed.</b> [...] the old saying goes, it takes talent to be that bad". Another commentator wrote similarly: [...] "It's so awful, it's brilliant." [...] Woman Around Town called Miranda [...] "an atrocious, comedic masterpiece." [...] Perez Hilton praised Miranda's parody of the hit song [...] "Chandelier" [...] as [...] "the crowning achievement of music video parodies ... utterly fantastic". TheaterJones noted that Ballinger: [...] "has hit on a character that reflects the zeitgeist of our time and does it with tongue firmly planted in cheek." [...] In 2015, Playbill concluded: [...] "Miranda Sings is a huge talent. With very demonstrative facial expressions, a unique take on makeup and wardrobe and her almost unbelievable vocal stylings, she cuts an undeniable figure {{in the world of}} online music video." [...] The Guardian characterized Miranda's channel as [...] "so bad it's great".

Patrick Mulkern praised Sarah Dollard's writing of the Doctor in [...] "Thin Ice", noting how she [...] "examines his moral code; the ideals he aspires to and the crimes and misdemeanors he's prepared to indulge". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Extremis" [...] received praise, with Alasdair Wilkins stating [...] "Peter Capaldi is perilously close to becoming my unqualified pick for favorite Doctor, he underplays the moment, making small choices to signal both his compassion and his heartbreak". He also praised the interactions between him and Missy, noting how they recall [...] "a more emotionally complex version of the repartee that Jon Pertwee’s Doctor and Roger Delgado’s Master had during their many encounters". Patrick Mulkern praised Capaldi’s performance in [...] "The Lie of the Land" [...] proclaiming [...] "he wavers between downright nasty and at best disconcerting. He’s world-weary — specifically, Earth-weary. You can almost believe he’s working for the dark side, so great is his disenchantment with the human race". After the broadcast of World Enough and Time, Steven Moffat paid a special tribute to Capaldi, “Peter only has to think at the screen and you know what he’s thinking,” he said. “He only has to move his face and I know the particular blend of Scottish torment he’s feeling right now. Despite trying to fight his emotions, he has given us the most emotional Doctor.” [...] Capaldi received overwhelming praise for his performance in [...] "The Doctor Falls" [...] with Patrick Mulkern noted the episode as a story dedicated to the character and how he [...] "stands tall", along with Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror highlighting the twelfth Doctor, praising how he [...] "simply shines". Flickering Myth stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is a magnificent Doctor, a person who captures the wisdom, madness, caring and frustration of a two-thousand year old Time Lord". Digital Spy praised Capaldi's [...] "Where I stand is where I fall" [...] speech, noting it as quite possibly the actor's finest moment to date. Simon Brew of Den of Geek heavily praised the actor's performance stating: [...] "The majestic, wonderful, brilliant Peter Capaldi. If you needed a reminder of just how much he’s going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> when he finally departs Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} year, his outstanding work here was precisely that. When he was blasted, apparently mortally, and he kept holding off his regeneration I found myself saying out loud “I don’t want you to go”". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine agreed, admitting that [...] "the man’s been a revelation. I love Peter Capaldi. He has without a doubt been my Doctor for this new incarnation of Doctor Who that’s wrapping up its tenth season, and we have been nothing short of fortunate to have been blessed with his talents. I don’t want you to go either, Peter".|$|E
