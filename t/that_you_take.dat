25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

Horton, which called it [...] "a game-changing film which redefined and reconceptualised the film form as we know it." [...] Nick Hyman, writing for Metacritic, included the film on its list of [...] "movies that critics got wrong" [...] calling it [...] "a cult classic in the making". It was described as [...] "nearly unmatched [...] insofar as action/adventure/family films go" [...] by Alejandro Stepenberg from JoBlo.com, while Slates Chris Wade named it [...] "an underrated masterpiece," [...] stating [...] "they [...] made a brilliant visual cartoon that dares to ask <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> it seriously." [...] Annalee Newitz of io9 analyzed the ten reasons why she believes the film to be an [...] "unsung masterpiece"; among them, the visuals, the humor, and even its political themes. Tor.com's Dexter Palmer considered {{the possibility that the}} film is a [...] "misunderstood art film", highlighting its color scheme that is a [...] "pleasure" [...] and the fact it does not try to seem real. Palmer lauded it because he does not think films must imitate reality, and ultimately said it is [...] "an extreme reminder of what films, and especially fantasy and science fiction films, can place on screen" [...] and that it is [...] "a refreshing change of pace" [...] in film industry. Collider's Kayti Burt ranked it at #30 of Best Hollywood Blockbusters of the 21st Century stating, [...] "While other blockbusters of the year (and the decade) worked to ground their fantastical premises in a gritty, realistic setting, Speed Racer leaned hard in the other direction." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the joint}} album leaked on February 22, 2002 it caused the label, Roc-A-Fella, {{to push the}} album's release date up from the initial date, March 26, to March 19.

2500|$|Stilwell appealed {{directly}} to President Roosevelt {{for help with}} his dispute with Chiang, and as a result, Roosevelt sent Chiang a message which read: [...] "I have urged time and again in recent months <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> drastic action to resist the disaster which has been moving closer to China and to you. Now, when you have not yet placed General Stilwell in command of all forces in China, {{we are faced with}} the loss of a critical area... with possible catastrophic consequences". Roosevelt ended his ultimatum to Chiang with the threat to end all American aid unless Chiang [...] "at once" [...] place Stilwell [...] "in unrestricted command of all your forces." [...] General Chennault later claimed that Stilwell had deliberately ordered Sino-American forces out of Guilin as a way of creating a crisis that would force Chiang to give up command of his armies to Stilwell. Stilwell's diary supports Chennault's claim as Stilwell wrote that if a crisis emerged that was [...] "just sufficient {{to get rid of the}} Peanut without entirely wrecking the ship, it would be worth it", going on to write that the entire Kuomintang system had to be [...] "torn to bits" [...] and Chiang would just have to go.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, during rehearsals for his then {{upcoming}} [...] "Future History World Tour", Derulo {{was practicing}} a stunt {{when he fell}} and broke his C2 vertebrae – leaving him in a neck brace {{for six months and}} forcing him to cancel his first headlining tour. [...] "I was not able to dance, I couldn't even really bop my head. It's the simple things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> for granted — not being able to perform for that amount of time, and also knowing that it could be gone in an instant." [...] said Jason during an interview. [...] "I wouldn't change the accident for anything because I've grown so much from it," [...] Jason admits. Derulo then decided to channel all of this creative energy into studio time, on writing and recording his third album. He had written over 300 songs, recorded between 100 and 120 of those songs for the album and had to narrow them down to 12. A very difficult process for him as he states [...] "I wanted {{to be sure that the}} album was a roller coaster ride, that every single song was totally different from the last... I wanted to be sure this album was far different from that one, to make sure that the growth was present. I'm 23 now. I really wanted this album to be a direct representation of who I am. I didn't want to hide anything. This album, I wanted to tell a story.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, {{said that}} he had become a deist. In the article Flew states that he has renounced his long-standing espousal of atheism by endorsing a deism of the sort that Thomas Jefferson advocated ("While reason, mainly in the form of arguments to design, assures us that there is a God, there is no room either for any supernatural revelation of that God or for any transactions between that God and individual human beings"). [...] Flew stated that [...] "the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries" [...] and that [...] "the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was when I first met it". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, which ever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, [...] "So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?". He supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with [...] "the characteristics of power and also intelligence", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created [...] "a lot of" [...] evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book.|$|E
