5|$|Since {{wind speed}} is not constant, a wind farm's annual energy {{production}} is never {{as much as}} the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 15–50%; values at {{the upper end of the}} range are achieved in favourable sites and are due to wind turbine design improvements.|$|E

His co-pilot was First Officer Price Bruner, age 49, who had over 17,200 <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> flying time and over 300 hours in DC-9s.

5|$|More than 2.7million players {{participated in}} the beta, which lasted from May 3 to 20. The game was rolled out from an {{internal}} group of Bungie and Microsoft employees, with {{the total number of}} players in the thousands. When the beta went public, more than a million played the first day, causing back-end servers to struggle to handle the traffic. While the engineering team had overestimated server load, bugs in server clusters caused game uploads to become backed up, slowing matchmaking until the underlying issues could be fixed. Jarrard noted that the 16million <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> of play time and large-scale rollout of the beta was vital to seeing how Reach would perform.|$|E

5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at {{the upper end of the}} range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor calculated from data published by OFGEM for June 2016 to May 2017 was 25.20%.|$|E

5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E
25|$|The {{captain was}} 31-year-old Jordi Sola Lopez from Barcelona. The first officer was 27-year-old Andrew Cantle from Sunderland, England. Both were {{employed}} by Air Lada.

500|$|From the {{earliest}} days of the academy, one form of punishment for cadets who commit regulatory infractions has been a process officially known as punishment tours. This process is better known to the cadets as [...] "hours" [...] because as punishment, cadets must walk a specified number of hours in penalty. Cadets are [...] "awarded" [...] punishment tours based upon the severity of the infraction. Being late to class or having an unkempt room may result in as little as 5 hours while more severe misconduct infractions may result in upwards of 60 to 80 hours. In its most traditional form, punishment tours are [...] "walked off" [...] by wearing the dress gray uniform under arms and walking back and forth in a designated area of the cadet barracks courtyard, known as [...] "Central Area." [...] Cadets who get into trouble frequently and spend many weekends [...] "walking off their hours" [...] are known as [...] "area birds." [...] Cadets who walk more than 100 <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> in their career are affectionately known as [...] "Century Men." [...] An alternate form of punishment to walking hours is known as [...] "fatigue tours," [...] where assigned hours may be [...] "worked off" [...] by manual labor, such as cleaning the barracks. Certain cadets whose academics are deficient may also conduct [...] "sitting tours," [...] where they have to [...] "sit hours" [...] in a designated academic room in a controlled study environment, for which they receive half credit towards their reduction of tours. Cadets' uniforms are inspected before their tours begin each day. A small number of cadets may be relieved of their tours that day if their uniforms are exceptionally presentable. Another tradition associated with punishment tours is that any visiting head of state has the authority to grant [...] "amnesty," [...] releasing all cadets with outstanding hours from the remainder of their assigned tours.|$|E
