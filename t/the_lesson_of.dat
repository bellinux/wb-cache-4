5|$|In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, {{argues that}} the {{relative}} autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> greater openness when it faced {{the issues raised by}} The Da Vinci Code and other critics.|$|E
25|$|Simeon {{also learned}} <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> how {{vulnerable}} Bulgaria {{was to the}} northern tribes neighbouring his realm, when they were influenced by Byzantine diplomacy. That experience paid off in 917, when Simeon managed to counter the Byzantine efforts to ally with the Serbs or the Pechenegs, and forced them to fight alone {{in the battle of}} Achelous, where the Byzantines were soundly defeated in one of the biggest disasters in Byzantine history.|$|E
25|$|LaSalle sales had {{consistently}} exceeded Cadillac's since 1933, so {{the question}} arises, why did GM decide to drop LaSalle? Evidently <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> the Packard One-Twenty had been weighing {{on the minds of}} the executives at GM. Since its introduction in 1935 the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle, with sales volume exceeding Cadillac's counterpart by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935-40 inclusively. Since LaSalle had been a Cadillac in all but name for most of its lifespan, it was {{decided it was time to}} bestow upon it the prestigious title of Cadillac.|$|E

500|$|The {{mainstream}} press praised her as well. Christian Century suggested, [...] "the {{story of her}} life should be taught to every school child for generations to come." [...] The New York Times noted she was, [...] "one of the most potent factors {{in the growth of}} interracial goodwill in America." [...] The Washington Post said: [...] "So great were her dynamism and force that it was almost impossible to resist her... Not only her own people, but all America has been enriched and ennobled by her courageous, ebullient spirit."

500|$|The {{formation}} of the regiment {{following the end of}} the Second World War was fundamentally important to the post-war Australian Army, forming a key component of the first [...] "permanent, professional army, available in peace and war for any task the government might direct". Prior to this time the Australian Army had been substantially a part-time militia with a permanent cadre. A major influence in the raising of the regiment was Australia's desire to secure a prominent role in the occupation of Japan and the eventual peace settlement. After some delays the 65th, 66th and 67th Battalions arrived in Japan's Hiroshima Prefecture in February 1946. Subsequent employment [...] "involved activities designed to reinforce upon the Japanese <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> their defeat", in addition to guard duty, patrolling and training. In December 1948 the Australian component of the BCOF was reduced from a brigade to one understrength battalion, with the 1st and 2nd Battalions returning to Australia, while the 3rd Battalion remained in Japan.|$|E
500|$|To {{celebrate}} their new-found attitude, the town holds a [...] "Do What You Feel" [...] festival. However, the festival soon goes awry because {{those responsible for}} building the stages and maintaining the rides [...] "didn't feel like" [...] doing a thorough job, resulting in a runaway Ferris wheel and more. Arguments begin, as everybody has been encouraged to always say exactly what is on their mind, and soon a riot starts. Bart is quickly blamed for starting the whole [...] "Do As You Feel" [...] trend. The town chases after Bart, but Homer drives by in a float and saves him. The town gives up the chase despite the float's slow speed and decides {{to go to the}} old mill to get some cider. The Simpson family returns home where they {{try to figure out what}} <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> the episode was, before finally concluding that everyone is fine the way they are and start to watch television.|$|E

500|$|New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley {{published}} {{a volume of}} memoirs, Time Present, Time Past in 1996. [...] In it, the Democrat mentioned having written a high-school report on Hanna—his history teacher, Bradley related, told him that <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> the 1896 campaign is that money is power. [...] Bradley, a former basketball player, mentioned {{that when he was}} being interviewed in high school, he stated that Hanna was one of his heroes. [...] By the time he wrote the book, however, Bradley had come to believe in limits on campaign spending and blamed Hanna for a sharp escalation in campaign costs. [...] Bradley also stated what Horner terms mischaracterizations of Hanna: that he was the Republican boss of Ohio, and that he did his best to disrupt Roosevelt's presidency. [...] Bradley alleged that since 1896, Republicans have raised money easily from the rich. [...] Despite his condemnation of Hanna, Bradley wrote that he regretted that he could not find a Hanna-like figure who could play an analogous role in advancing his political career.|$|E
500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents {{confirms}} the suspicion widely expressed in circles of Latin American literature that North Americans {{choose not to}} differentiate between political and economic exile. Alvarez pointedly demonstrates the North American tendency to undervalue cultural diversity by highlighting instances of American ignorance toward distinctions between different Hispanic-Caribbean groups. The García girls are quite conflicted upon their arrival in the United States as they find that distinct cultural groups are lumped together under one broad [...] "immigrant" [...] category and newcomers are encouraged to assimilate silently to the American norm. Yolanda’s conflict with her father regarding the potentially controversial speech she has prepared for the Teacher’s Day Address provides {{a classic example of}} {{the manner in which the}} García girls are pressured to conform to the norm. Yolanda feels as though she has sacrificed her principles and sold out to the hyper-sensitive authorities when her father forces her to discard her empowering, rebellious achievement of artistic self-expression for [...] "two brief pages of stale compliments and the polite commonplaces on teachers. A speech wrought by necessity and without much invention". Julie Barak affirms that [...] "although this incident is in many ways a defeat for both Yolanda and her mother, it does teach them <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> conformity that is so important to living peacefully in America. Yolanda learns to fit in, to do the expected". The girls go on to attend the best schools, lose their Spanish accents and acquire the same psychological disorders as their upper-class American counterparts. Sandra battles anorexia, Carla and Yolanda both have failed marriages, Yolanda and Sandra are both institutionalized for psychiatric issues at one time or another, and Sofía is impregnated out of wedlock.|$|E
500|$|One {{of their}} most notable episodes was [...] "Homer's Enemy", an episode {{designed}} to [...] "push the envelope conceptually." [...] The idea for [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] was first conceived by Oakley, who thought that Homer should have an enemy. This evolved into {{the concept of a}} [...] "real world" [...] co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results. The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; in some scenes, his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero," [...] is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. Oakley says the episode was [...] "hyper-meta" [...] and focused on [...] "parodying to some degree the Homer we don't like. That's {{one of the things that}} episode is supposed to illustrate– 'Homer gone wrong'. Although, I would argue that in 'Homer's Enemy' he's not even really even all that excessively stupid or immature, actually." [...] Weinstein said: [...] "We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was 'What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?' I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [...] about the ending—we just did that because (a) it’s really funny and shocking, (2) we like <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> 'sometimes, you just can't win'—the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned." [...] When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which many fans [...] "didn't get." [...] Weinstein talks about a [...] "generation gap"—the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.|$|E

2500|$|David Denby from The New Yorker {{called the}} film [...] "a superb achievement" [...] and praised the director's [...] "impressive visual skills".

2500|$|Wodiczko’s visual {{interventions}} {{into public}} space {{are intended to}} alter what Jacques Rancière would later term {{the realm of the}} sensible.
