40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{sensitivity}} of yellowtail Senola quinqueradiata and <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream Pagrus major tq Nocardia seriolae was investigated. The LDso for yellowtail and <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream after being injected with N. seriolae was 1. 1 x 103 CFU/l 00 9 B. W. and 3. 4 x 104 CFU/l 00 g B. W., respectively. In an immersion challenge, the LDso for yellowtail was 1. 2 x 104 CFU/mL, while no mortality {{was observed in}} <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream at 1. 0 x 105 CFUlmL for 26 days. These data indicate that yellowtail is more sensitive to <b>the</b> bacterium than <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream. Serum bactericidal activity against N. seriolae was not observed in both fish species. Production of superoxide anion in kid-ney phagocytes isolated from <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream significantly increased in response to addition of live N. seriolae.

5|$|Following on {{from the}} {{previous}} volume in the series, The Calculus Affair, <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> Sharks was created {{with the aid of}} Hergé's team of artists at Studios Hergé. Influenced by Honoré de Balzac's The Human Comedy, Hergé used the story as a vehicle in which to reintroduce a wide range of characters who had first appeared in earlier installments of the series. The story dealt with the ongoing trade in enslaved Africans across the Arab world, however in the 1960s the story would generate controversy as Hergé was repeatedly accused of having portrayed the Africans in a racist manner. He was upset by these claims, and made alterations to the depiction of the Africans in later reprints. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in Tibet, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> Sharks was critically well-received, with various commentators describing it {{as one of the best}} Tintin adventures.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{turbulence}} on <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream larvae survival was tested at two prey densities and four turbulence levels in <b>the</b> laboratory for <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream. <b>The</b> effect of ontogenic stage on feeding behavior parameters was examined. The range of turbulence at which <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream larvae could survive and ingest prey increased with larval growth. Therefore, turbulence {{is an important}} condition impacting survival of small larvae during the initial period of feeding. At low prey density, larvae fed at the highest feeding rate and had a high RNA : DNA ratio at a medium turbulence level {{on the order of}} 10 (- 6. 5) m 2 s(- 3). Thus, an optimum turbulence level induces faster growth, and it can be concluded that turbulence {{plays an important role in}} larval growth and survival. For interspecific comparison, a feeding success index calculated by numerical modeling in sea bream was compared to that of Pacific bluefin tuna using data reported by Kato et al. (2008). There were large differences in the index. The equivalent curve for <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream showed a linear relationship, while that for Pacific bluefin tuna showed a dome-shaped relationship.
