40|$|Four {{methods for}} {{measuring}} quantities of 12 plant-available nutrients were compared using three sandy soils {{in a series}} of three experiments. Three of the methods use different ion-exchange resin forms-bags, capsules, and membranes-and the fourth was conventional chemical extraction. The first experiment compared nutrient extraction data from a medium of sand saturated with a nutrient solution. The second and third experiments used Nakai and Sheppard series soils from Canyonlands National Park, which are relatively high in soil carbonates. The second experiment compared nutrient extraction data provided by the four methods from soils equilibrated at two temperatures, 2 ̆ 2 warm 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 cold. 2 ̆ 2 The third experiment extracted nutrients from the same soils in a field equilibration. Our results show that the four extraction techniques are not comparable. This conclusion is due to differences among the methods in <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>quantities</b> of nutrients extracted from equivalent soil volumes, in the proportional representation of nutrients within similar soils and treatments, in the measurement of nutrients that were added in known quantities, and even in the order of nutrients ranked by net abundance. We attribute the disparities in nutrient measurement among the different resin forms to interacting effects of the inherent differences in resin exchange capacity, differences among nutrients in their resin affinities, and possibly the relatively short equilibration time for laboratory trials. One constraint for measuring carbonate-related nutrients in high-carbonate soils is the conventional ammonium acetate extraction method, which we suspect of dissolving fine CaCO 3 particles that are more abundant in Nakai series soils, resulting in erroneously high Ca 2 + estimates. For study of plant-available nutrients, it is important to identify the nutrients of foremost interest and understand differences in their resin sorption dynamics to determine the most appropriate extraction method...|$|R

The paper reviews this formalism, and a number of existing formulae for effective NEQ, or equivalent bare charge, in terms of ratio of casing weight to charge weight, in the light of trials data from a number of sources. These include blast data from in-service munitions as well as from experimental configurations. The evidence indicates that the nature of the casing material, as well as casing mass, is important in determining the equivalent bare charge. Potential explanations, and their implications, are discussed, and a correlation with casing material properties is developed...|$|R

40|$|The {{information}} on wooden potentials from Slovenian forests {{is important for}} all stakeholders involved in the forest-wood chain (such as enterprises engaged in purchasing, processing or sales of roundwood, pulp industry, CHP plants [...] .). For these stakeholders, the actual amounts of wood appearing on the market are relevant. Thus the amount of wood consumed by forest owners for their own needs should be excluded. The Slovenian Forestry Institute has developed its own methodology {{for the evaluation of}} the actual and heoretical estimates of the quantities of timber. This article presents the potentials of both coniferous and deciduous roundwood as well as wood of lower quality. The actual potentials are based on the five-year averages (2009 % 2013) of wood that had previously been marked by district foresters for harvesting and at that time appeared on the market. The theoretical potentials, on the other hand, delineate the maximum amount of wood that can be harvested annually and sold on the market, while providing for sustainable forest management at the same time. The results are given in net cubic metres (m 3 without bark) and oven-dry tons (ODT) when dealing with energy potential of lower-quality wood. The results show {{that in the case of}} spruce and fir trees <b>the</b> actual <b>net</b> <b>quantity</b> of roundwood on the market amounts to 1, 239, 000 m 3. The assessment of theoretically marketable potentials of deciduous roundwood is 410, 000 m 3, while the actual amount of the deciduous roundwood on the market is 206, 000 m 3. In the case of lower-quality wood, the assessment of the total theoretically marketable potential is 1, 443, 000 ODT, while the assessment of the actual potentials on the market amounts to 468, 000 ODT. The results indicate a low utilization rate of Slovenian forests, especially as far as privately owned forests are concerned. Still, we should be cautious in interpreting the results, as the analyses of the actual potential consider only the timber that was marked for harvesting by district forester, while in reality the harvested quantities are likely to be greater especially in privately owned forests...|$|R

By proceeding like this, the net emissions associated with the production of producer gas with 1 MJ of energy are determined by subtracting {{the sum of the}} emissions (or impacts) associated with the saved fossil fuel-based electricity production and the saved commercial lubricant production from the emissions associated with the generation of producer gas.|$|E
40|$|A {{clearing}} process describes <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>quantity</b> in a service system (e. g. a batch service queue or dam) which receives an exogenous random input over time. {{and has an}} output mechanism that intermittently clears random quantities from the system.

We describe the asymptotic distribution of such processes and show how it arises in limits of certain functionals of these processes. An asymptotic distribution is different from a limiting distribution, but it has some similar properties. We then identify some clearing processes whose asymptotic distribution is uniform. This is true for modulo c clearing with a stationary input if the Palm probability is used rather than the usual probability. Our results on this give a partial answer to an anomaly in the classical economic lot size inventory model. We also present a functional central limit law and law of the iterated logorithm for clearing processes, {{as well as a}} result on the convergence of a sequence of such processes. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of clinically useful phosphorus binders {{for patients with}} chronic kidney failure. Over the past 30 years it has become apparent that hyperphosphatemia plays a major causative role across the entire spectrum of morbidity associated with advancing kidney dysfunction and failure. A large fraction (60 % to 70 %) of dietary phosphorus is absorbed and normally excreted by the kidneys. Ideally, as kidney function deteriorates, <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>quantity</b> of phosphorus absorbed from the GI tract should be proportionally reduced to match the decrease in kidney function. After initiation of chronic dialysis therapy, the absorbed phosphorus load should match the amount of phosphorus removed via dialysis plus any excreted by residual kidney function. Because {{it is very difficult}} to reduce dietary phosphorus to these levels, a variety of oral phosphorus binders have been employed. Currently available binders include alkaline aluminum, magnesium, and calcium salts (primarily calcium carbonate and calcium acetate), various iron salts, and the binding resin sevelamer hydrochloride. Lanthanum carbonate is the newest agent and will probably be released shortly. This review compares the theoretic and in vitro chemistry of these drugs with in vivo data obtained in both normal patients, and in patients with kidney failure. The clinical potency and potential toxicity of the binding agents are compared, and optimal drug administration strategies are also reviewed...|$|E

40|$|The {{accidental}} detonation {{of ammunition}} stacked inside a storage enclosure can have disastrous effects. Additional to the related blast wave, the potential {{damage caused by}} debris throw is significant. Not only is the human body more vulnerable to flying debris than to air-pressure waves, but the unobstructed ejection can extend into distances far beyond the hazardous range of the blast wave. The eight-national Klotz Group (KG) investigates the effects of accidental detonation of high explosive (HE) sources inside storage structures. The present contribution describes recent findings addressing the influence of metal casings and stacking of sources on the break-up process, with the goal {{to better understand the}} initial launch conditions for debris originating from the surrounding faces of the enclosure. Based on findings of recent investigations with two different cased sources, additional to <b>the</b> <b>net</b> explosive <b>quantity</b> (NEQ) and thus loading density inside the storage, parameters like number and location of sources, HE mass to hull mass ratio, and the properties of the casing {{have a significant effect on}} the structural failure process. In the event of a simultaneous explosion stacked sources affect each other in two ways: 1. Numerous primary fragments partly collide, resulting in a change of direction, velocity, and mass of the released single distributed fragments. 2. Blast waves of different sources interact, which may cause locally an accelerating jetting effect. Both phenomena influence the initial impulse on the structure, its failure, and the resulting debris launch into the surroundings. Additionally, the casing properties influence the timing and development of the blast wave inside the structure, hence they affect the magnitude and the transient distribution of the internal pressure. The Klotz Group approaches the investigation of the effects of stacked and cased sources in three steps: In the first step, the primary fragment distribution is analytically predicted to yield the primary fragment impulse on the inside of the storage structure. The second step establishes the transient blast loading and gas pressure development in a numerical hydrocode simulation, including the venting process through coupled fluid-structure interaction modelling. The third step uses the results from the previous two steps to define the initial conditions for another, purely Lagrangian numerical model of the dynamic break-up process of the storage structure. The present contribution focuses on the first two steps...|$|R
