Police also searched the garden for Blakelock's <b>truncheon</b> and helmet. In October 2004 his overalls were retrieved from Scotland Yard's Crime Museum for DNA tests. Nothing was found {{that could be used}} as evidence.|$|E
5|$|The Liberal-Courtier coalition's cabinet, formed upon PedroII's {{assumption}} of full powers, convoked national elections for {{seats in the}} legislature convene in 1842. The voting was accompanied by so much violence and fraud that it became known as Elections of the club (or Elections of the <b>truncheon).</b> For Honório Hermeto, this meant {{the loss of his}} seat as general deputy after his bid for reelection failed. The Liberal-Courtier cabinet did not survive long, however, and its ministers presented their resignations in turn. On 23 March 1841, a new cabinet was nominated that included Aureliano Coutinho from the Courtier Faction and other ministers drawn from the Reactionary Party.|$|E
5|$|Huskisson's coffin {{was placed}} on a trestle table in the Town Hall, draped with black velvet and covered with {{feathered}} plumes. Between 9.00 and 10.00am a stream of mourners were guided to the coffin {{by a group of}} <b>truncheon</b> men. At 10.00 two mutes guided the mourners out of the town hall and mounted horses; the rain and hail had by now eased. The mutes led the procession, followed by the mourners from the town hall and around 1,100 other mourners who had waited outside. These mourners marched six abreast, and were followed by the funeral committee, 28 local clergymen and two more mutes. Behind this group marched Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind them came carriages carrying the pall-bearers, a group of local dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, followed by two more mutes. Behind this pair of mutes was a hearse carrying the coffin, followed by Huskisson's colleagues and his surviving brothers Thomas and Samuel. These in turn were followed by around 900 locals in mourning dress who had decided to join the procession, bringing the cortège to around half a mile (0.8km) in length. The Duke of Wellington, pleading a prior commitment to attend a dinner in Birmingham, did not attend.|$|E

5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden <b>truncheon.</b> Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

5000|$|Eventually {{the police}} {{launched}} another attack {{during which the}} worst of the violence is purported to have taken place. According to The Observer, during this period pregnant women and those holding babies were clubbed by police with <b>truncheons</b> and the police were hitting [...] "anybody they could reach". When some of the travellers tried to escape by driving away through the fields, The Observer states that the police threw <b>truncheons,</b> shields, fire-extinguishers and stones at them in an attempt to stop them.|$|R

25|$|Until the mid-1990s, most {{police forces}} {{utilised}} a 14inch long traditional wooden <b>truncheon.</b> It {{was replaced by}} long American-style batons, but in many places these were short lived, mainly due to their being unwieldy in most operational circumstances.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{the twentieth}} century up to the mid-1990s, male police {{officers}} wore a formal work jacket with polished silver buttons, and black trousers with a sewn in <b>truncheon</b> pocket. No stab vest was worn and much less equipment was carried than is today. Following concerns about the police uniforms' safety it was suggested that the uniform should be changed.|$|E
25|$|A club (also {{known as}} a cudgel, baton, <b>truncheon,</b> cosh, nightstick, or bludgeon) is among the {{simplest}} of all weapons: a short staff or stick, usually made of wood, wielded as a weapon since prehistoric times. There are several examples of blunt-force trauma caused by clubs in the past, including {{at the site of}} Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, described as the scene of a prehistoric conflict between bands of hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago.|$|E
5000|$|At 7pm {{officers}} in riot gear entered {{the field and}} launched a final attack.

When some travellers tried to escape by driving away through the field police allegedly threw <b>truncheons,</b> shields, fire-extinguishers and stones at them to stop them. The Observer and The Independent report that travellers' vehicles were smashed and set on fire.|$|R

25|$|Due {{to public}} fears {{concerning}} {{the deployment of}} the military in domestic matters, Robert Peel organised the force along civilian lines, rather than paramilitary. To appear neutral, the uniform was deliberately manufactured in blue, rather than red which was then a military colour, along with the officers being armed only with a wooden <b>truncheon</b> and a rattle to signal the need for assistance. Along with this, police ranks did not include military titles, with the exception of Sergeant.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Oluwale {{was charged}} with disorderly conduct and assault {{following}} a police raid on a nightclub. He subsequently served a 28-day sentence. In prison it was reported he suffered from hallucinations, possibly because of damage sustained from a <b>truncheon</b> blow during the arrest. He was transferred to Menston Asylum in Leeds (later called High Royds Hospital, now closed) where {{he spent the next}} eight years. He was treated with a variety of techniques, allegedly including electroconvulsive therapy and various drugs (hospital records have since been lost).|$|E
25|$|By tradition, rifle regiments do {{not carry}} colours; {{this goes back}} to their formation, when they were used as skirmishers and sharpshooters. While {{individual}} units may have had banners or pennants to distinguish themselves from other units, regiments as a whole never needed a full stand of Colours. Today, the two rifle regiments in the British Army, The Rifles and the Royal Gurkha Rifles carry their battle honours on their drums, while the Royal Green Jackets also had theirs inscribed on their cap badge; this tradition is maintained by The Rifles, who wear the Maltese Cross badge of the Royal Green Jackets, inscribed with the regimental honours, as the belt badge. In place of a Regimental Colour, the Gurkhas carry the Queen's <b>Truncheon.</b>|$|E
2500|$|From the Metropolitan Police's foundation, {{the force}} had {{relied on the}} use of hand rattles for {{officers}} to signal the need for assistance. In 1884 the Home Secretary invited competition from many companies to invent a [...] "police whistle" [...] to replace the rattle. J.Hudson & Company of Birmingham were awarded the contract for 7,175 whistles at the price of 11d each. At the same time, a competition for the contract to supply the Metropolitan Police with new <b>truncheons</b> was under way. This contract was won by Ross & Company, who supplied the Metropolitan Police with Lignum vitae <b>truncheons.</b> In 1886, during a riot between warring working parties in Hyde Park, many <b>truncheons</b> were damaged or broken, samples were sent off to be tested by the Royal Army Clothing Department, at a cost of 16 shillings per day. In October 1886, 900 pounds worth of Lance and Cocuswood were purchased, to use in place of Lignum vitae that was deemed unsuitable after Army testing.|$|R

25|$|From 1829, to 1839, Metropolitan Police {{officers}} wore blue swallow tail coats {{with high}} collars to counter garroting. This was worn with white trousers in summer, and a cane-reinforced top hat, {{which could be}} used as a step to climb or see over walls. The sleeves of the dark blue coats originally had a pattern of white bars, roughly 6mm wide by 50mm high, set roughly 6mm apart. This immediately distinguished them from naval or maritime personnel. In the early years of the Metropolitan Police, equipment was little more than a rattle to call for assistance, and a wooden <b>truncheon.</b> As the years progressed, the rattle was replaced with the whistle, swords were removed from service, and flintlock pistols were removed in favour of revolvers.|$|E
25|$|From this event, Jaggar {{assumes a}} {{hereditary}} {{right to be}} the leader of Heldon and embarks on a violent crusade for genetic purity, drawing a massive following, staging outdoor rallies and raising an army personally loyal to him. He is elected to the Council and stages a coup d'état when he forces the Council to admit to treason and a Zind plot against Heldon. Confirming his suspicions, the Universalist member of the Council {{turns out to be a}} Dom. Feric summarily executes him with the Great <b>Truncheon.</b> Jaggar coerces the Council into granting him complete executive power and then has them shot. Immediately after assuming power Jaggar puts down an imminent coup by Stopa, who has been corrupted by the fleshly pleasures of Zind.|$|E
25|$|Special Constables {{were first}} {{introduced}} by the Special Constables Act 1831, empowering Magistrates to appoint ordinary citizens as temporary police officers in times of emergency. In 1834, the Act was extended to allow citizens appointed as Specials to act outside of their Parish area. In 1848, 150,000 Specials were sworn in, to assist regular officers in preventing Chartists from reaching Kennington, and then marching to Westminster. In 1912, the Specials were reorganised, scrapping the old system of anyone being liable to be appointed, instead they had to volunteer. In 1934, it was named the Metropolitan Special Constabulary(MSC), a name which it keeps today in its present form. For {{a short period of}} time after the MSC was formed, Specials did not receive uniforms like that of a full-time policeman. Instead, they were issued with armbands which identified them as Special Constables, along with being issued a <b>truncheon</b> and a whistle.|$|E
50|$|Protests {{began on}} 27 February 2013 after the {{opposition}} coalition began {{to encourage and}} stage protests in the capital, Conakry. Thousands of pro-opposition supporters {{took to the streets}} and lashes broke out between rock-throwing youths and security forces armed with <b>truncheons,</b> guns and tear gas grenades. Around 130 people were injured on the first day, including 68 police. Police in anti-riot gear were posted in opposition strongholds in the capital the following day, with the first death reported that day. On Friday, the ethnic clashes commenced, with the pro-opposition Fula and the pro-government Malinke people fighting with knives and <b>truncheons</b> {{on the streets of the}} capital.|$|R

500|$|While on the beat, or in {{the course}} of their normal duties, the {{officers}} of both the City of London and Metropolitan forces were provided with only a short wooden <b>truncheon</b> for protection. When they faced armed opponents—as was the case in Sidney Street—the police were issued with Webley and Bull Dog revolvers, shotguns and small-bore rifles fitted with [...]22 Morris-tube barrels, the last of which were more commonly used on small indoor shooting galleries.|$|E
