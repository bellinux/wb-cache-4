5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry</b> were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E

50|$|In the 1920s, {{prosperity}} {{came to the}} Detroit area, {{because of}} the successes of <b>the</b> U.S. <b>auto</b> <b>industry</b> in that decade.

5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry</b> saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E
5|$|Indiana became {{politically}} {{influential and}} {{played an important}} role in the Union during the American Civil War. Indiana was the first western state to mobilize for the war, and its soldiers participated in almost every engagement during the war. Following the Civil War, Indiana remained politically important as it became a critical swing state in U.S. Presidential elections. It helped decide control of the presidency for three decades. During the Indiana Gas Boom of the late 19thcentury, industry began to develop rapidly in the state. The state's Golden Age of Literature began in the same time period, increasing its cultural influence. By the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong manufacturing state and attracted numerous immigrants and internal migrants to its industries. It experienced setbacks during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, expansion of <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry,</b> urban development, and two wars contributed to the state's industrial growth. During the second half of the 20thcentury, Indiana became a leader in the pharmaceutical industry due to the innovations of companies such as Eli Lilly.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Thai <b>auto</b> parts <b>industry</b> is {{considered}} to be, along with the automotive industry, {{the driving force of}} the nation’s economy. Dating back to the 1960 s, the government has started an initiative to establish Thailand as the “Detroit of Asia”. Foreseeing that <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> parts and automotive industries are two interrelated segments with high value added, various measures and policies are planned by the government to nurture and support the two industries {{so that they can be}} internationally competitive. This paper analyzes interviews conducted with firms in <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> parts and automotive industries along with the secondary data to identify the source of competitive advantage of <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> parts <b>industry</b> and its contribution to the development of the automotive industry. The findings, which utilized the national diamond model, five forces framework, and network theory, has demonstrated an interesting result. The role of the government is much more important than expected. Policies and regulations enforced by the government are the main factor creating competitive advantage for <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> parts <b>industry.</b> Also, <b>the</b> unique production network of <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> parts and automotive industries has significantly shaped and contributed to the competitive advantages of <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> parts <b>industry</b> as well. It is hope that this paper would benefit policy makers in identifying the source of competitive advantages of <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> parts <b>industry</b> and help in designing new policies that will further enhance the performance of the sector, or provide an insight into the development of <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> parts <b>industry</b> to those interested in the industry.
