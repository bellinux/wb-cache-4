Some process requires computer <b>controlled</b> <b>milling,</b> <b>machining</b> and tooling, and as we are using composite materials more now; when we require more precision we are required to use laser based processes. For milling and tooling we need VHM, VDM, CNC machines. And for laser based processes we require laser cutter and engraver. Each of this machine costs more that 25 lacs upwards depending on the precision and size. This increases the capital investment and the time required to complete the job. In our machine, we are combining these two types of machines, which will reduce the investment required and reduce the time to process the job.|$|R

30|$|Historically, {{the modern}} making culture started in 1952 at MIT with the {{development}} of a numerically <b>controlled</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> (Gershenfeld, 2012). While this enabled the technology-oriented aspects of the modern making, social aspects occurred even earlier in history: women met in common spaces for knitting, and they exchanged their knowledge and tools. Furthermore, common space influences social aspects and leads to networking in terms of socializing. Modern maker spaces build on this idea (Dougherty, 2012). Maker fairs are organized either on a national or international level and may potentially lead to a global community of making. Nowadays, there is a huge variety of web communities for exchanging ideas, knowledge and project documentations. The web community “instructables” contains DIY projects from cooking to electric circuits. This twofold character, serving educational and product-oriented purposes, has been picked up in different event-like institutions.|$|R

Computer-aided design systems have not proven more accurate, repeatable, or reliable than traditional plaster of paris methods. Research is limited in design, relates to clinical trials, and is based on opinions and clinical experience. Many outcome measurements are based on qualitative estimations of prosthetic fit or patient feedback rather than quantitative measurements. Research must identify the most accurate, repeatable, and reliable methods for residual-limb shape capture under conditions most likely to enhance socket fit. Measurement is difficult because a reference grid is required for identifying the residual limb's axis for ensuring direct comparison.

40|$|Abstract: According {{to various}} {{advantages}} of {{linear induction motor}} (LIM), such as high starting thrust force, high speed operation and reduction of mechanical losses, more applications have utilized this type of motors. Direct Thrust Control (DTC) technique is considered {{as one of the}} most efficient techniques that can be used for LIM. DTC is preferable to give a fast and good dynamic thrust response. So, to improve the accuracy and robustness of contouring control for CNC machine tools, linear induction motors with a direct thrust control technique are introduced for driving these machines. An industry standard motion control system is applied for reducing the tracking error and improving the desired accuracy. Different loading conditions are simulated to validate the reliability and robustness of the introduced system to match the application field. The proposed system is simulated using the MATLAB/SIMULINK Package; simulation results validated both tracking accuracy and robustness of the proposed motion control system for contouring control for a CNC (Computer Numerical <b>Control)</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{measurements of}} {{the shape of a}} 900 mm long, hand-carved timber blade for a 500 W three-bladed horizontal axis wind turbine. Four blades were hand-carved in Nepal by reference to a master blade cut in Australia on a numerically <b>controlled</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> A high definition three-dimensional scanner was used to determine the surface of one hand-carved blade as a series of profiles at 50 mm intervals along the blade’s length. A surface model generated from these profiles was compared to the designed blade shape in terms of the three fundamental blade design parameters: chord, twist, and profile shape. The measured twist and chord were less that the design values, particularly in the hub region. This is consistent with the poor starting performance of the turbine when mounted with the remaining hand-carved blades. Assessment of the differences in profile shape would require a detailed computational analysis, which has not been undertaken...|$|R
