5|$|Although the {{resolution}} {{was not as}} strong as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office that would <b>take</b> <b>him</b> from Gunston Hall.|$|E
5|$|He {{was never}} booked or sent off {{throughout}} his entire career, and teammate Jimmy Armfield noted that Matthews would never retaliate {{to the many}} extremely physical challenges opponents would often make to try and <b>take</b> <b>him</b> out of the game. Indeed, he ran the full gauntlet of emotions that all footballers run, but always retained a level head on the pitch, never losing his temper or allowing his emotions to affect his game.|$|E

5|$|I needed {{somebody}} who could perform, and {{who also had}} a lot of endurance, because we were shooting in Atlanta at the end of July. Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could <b>take</b> <b>him</b> out between takes. He was in.|$|E

5|$|Mann's next fight (and {{third in}} the Cage Rage organisation) was against top {{domestic}} prospect, Robbie Olivier. The fight saw both fighters neutralise the other's ground game.

5|$|The first {{evidence}} {{that something was}} wrong at Vrbanja Bridge was radio silence from the French post.
