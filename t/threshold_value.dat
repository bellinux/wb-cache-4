5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain <b>threshold</b> <b>value,</b> these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E

25|$|At larger {{gate bias}} still, near the {{semiconductor}} surface the conduction band edge is brought {{close to the}} Fermi level, populating the surface with electrons in an inversion layer or n-channel at the interface between the p region and the oxide. This conducting channel extends between the source and the drain, and current is conducted through it when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. Increasing the voltage on the gate leads to a higher electron density in the inversion layer and therefore increases the current flow between the source and drain. For gate voltages below the <b>threshold</b> <b>value,</b> the channel is lightly populated, and {{only a very small}} subthreshold leakage current can flow between the source and the drain.|$|E
25|$|The {{electroscope}} is {{an important}} tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect. For example, if the electroscope is negatively charged throughout, there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem. If high-frequency light shines on the cap, the electroscope discharges and the leaf will fall limp. This is because {{the frequency of the}} light shining on the cap is above the cap's threshold frequency. The photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from the cap, reducing its negative charge. This will discharge a negatively charged electroscope and further charge a positive electroscope. However, if the electromagnetic radiation hitting the metal cap does not have a high enough frequency (its frequency is below the <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> for the cap), then the leaf will never discharge, no matter how long one shines the low-frequency light at the cap.|$|E
25|$|The {{peripheral}} terminal of {{the mature}} nociceptor {{is where the}} noxious stimuli are detected and transduced into electrical energy.

This leads to the train of events that allows for the conscious awareness of pain. The sensory specificity of nociceptors is established by the high threshold only to particular features of stimuli. Only when the high threshold has been reached by either chemical, thermal, or mechanical environments are the nociceptors triggered. The majority of nociceptors are classified by which of the environmental modalities they respond to. Some nociceptors respond to more than one of these modalities and are consequently designated polymodal. Other nociceptors respond to none of these modalities (although they may respond to stimulation under conditions of inflammation) and are referred to as sleeping or silent.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} which ion current predominantly affects defibrillation outcomes by using specific pharmacologic probes (lidocaine [a sodium channel blocking agent] and cesium [an outward potassium channel blocking agent]) in 26 swine. Background. The effect of a drug on sodium or potassium channel conductance, or both, may affect defibrillation <b>threshold</b> <b>values.</b> However, it is unknown which ion channel predominates. Methods. Each pig was {{randomly assigned to one}} of four treatment groups with two treatment phases: groupI = placebo (D 5 W) in treatment phase I followed by placebo plus cesium in treatment phase II (n = 6); group 2 = lidocaine followed by lidocaine plus placebo (n = 7); group 3 = lidocaine followed by lidocaine plus cesium (n = 7); group 4 = placebo followed by placebo plus placebo (n = 6). Defibrillation <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> and electrocardiographic measurements were obtained at baseline and at treatment phases I and II. Results. Lidocaine increased defibrillation <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> from baseline by 71 % in group 2 (p = 0. 02) and by 92 % in group 3 (p < 0. 01). There were no changes in defibrillation <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> from baseline to D 5 W in groups 1 and 4. When D 5 W was added to lidocaine in group 2 and D 5 W in group 4, there were no significant changes in defibrillation <b>threshold</b> <b>values.</b> However, when cesium was added to lidocaine in group 3, the elevated defibrillation <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> (mean ± SD) returned to baseline values (from 15. 7 ± 3. 46 to 7. 55 ± 3. 19 J, p < 0. 01). Cesium added to D 5 W in group 1 also significantly reduced defibrillation <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> from 7. 10 ± 1. 27 to 4. 14 ± 1. 75 J (p < 0. 01). The effect of cesium on defibrillation <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> was similar between groups 1 and 3, regardless of lidocaine, such that these values were reduced by 40 ± 14 % and 51 ± 18 %, respectively (p = 0. 28). Conclusions. Cesium, through potassium blockade, reverses lidocaine-induced elevation in defibrillation <b>threshold</b> <b>values.</b> The magnitude of defibrillation threshold reduction when cesium was added to lidocaine was similar to the defibrillation threshold reduction when cesium was added to placebo. Thus, inhibiting outward potassium conductance and prolonging repolarization decreases defibrillation <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> independent of sodium channel blockade...|$|R

Distinguishing true particles from noise with a minimum of false positives and false negatives is an important step that will have substantial impact on all further analysis of the data. A common approach is to obtain a plausible set of particles from a larger set of candidate particles by filtering using manually selected <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> for intensity, size, shape, and other parameters describing a particle.

25|$|When a {{negative}} gate-source voltage (positive source-gate) is applied, {{it creates a}} p-channel at {{the surface of the}} n region, analogous to the n-channel case, but with opposite polarities of charges and voltages. When a voltage less negative than the <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> ({{a negative}} voltage for the p-channel) is applied between gate and source, the channel disappears and only a very small subthreshold current can flow between the source and the drain. The device may comprise a silicon on insulator (SOI) device in which a buried oxide (BOX) is formed below a thin semiconductor layer. If the channel region between the gate dielectric and a BOX region is very thin, the channel is referred to as an ultrathin channel (UTC) region with the source and drain regions formed on either side thereof in and/or above the thin semiconductor layer. Alternatively, the device may comprise a semiconductor on insulator (SEMOI) device in which semiconductors other than silicon are employed. Many alternative semiconductor materials may be employed. When the source and drain regions are formed above the channel in whole or in part, they are referred to as raised source/drain (RSD) regions.|$|E

25|$|Lambert et al. (2005) {{examined}} {{the possibility of}} using DNA barcoding to assess the past diversity of the Earth's biota. The COI gene of a group of extinct ratite birds, the moa, were sequenced using 26 subfossil moa bones. As with Hebert's results, each species sequenced had a unique barcode and intraspecific COI sequence variance ranged from 0 to 1.24%. To determine new species, a standard sequence threshold of 2.7% COI sequence difference was set. This value is 10 times the average intraspecies difference of North American birds, which is inconsistent with Hebert's recommendation that the <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> be based on the group under study. Using this value, the group detected six moa species. In addition, a further standard sequence threshold of 1.24% was also used. This value resulted in 10 moa species which corresponded with the previously known species with one exception. This exception suggested a possible complex of species which was previously unidentified. Given the slow rate of growth and reproduction of moa, it is probable that the interspecies variation is rather low. On the other hand, there is no set value of molecular difference at which populations can be assumed to have irrevocably started to undergo speciation. It is safe to say, however, that the 2.7% COI sequence difference initially used was far too high.|$|E
