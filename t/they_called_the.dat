5|$|Burial mounds {{in present-day}} Indian Mounds Park {{suggest that the}} area was {{originally}} inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about two thousand years ago. From the early 17th century until 1837, the Mdewakanton Dakota, a tribe of the Sioux, lived near the mounds after fleeing their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> area I-mni-za ska dan ("little white rock") for its exposed white sandstone cliffs.|$|E
5|$|When the Aryans first {{settled in}} what <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Āryāvarta (or Madhyadesha), Allahabad (then Kaushambi) was an {{important}} part of their territory. The Kurus, rulers of Hastinapur (near present-day Delhi), established the town of Kaushambi near Allahabad. They shifted their capital to Kaushambi when Hastinapur was destroyed by floods.|$|E
5|$|By 1600, {{irrigated}} paddy {{fields were}} developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom, and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an established population <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, {{the spirits of the}} Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.|$|E

5|$|In 1564, René Goulaine de Laudonnière {{arrived to}} build Fort Caroline {{at the mouth}} of the St. Johns River; <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> river Rivière de Mai because they settled it on May 1. An artist named Jacques LeMoyne {{documented}} what he saw among the Timucuan people in 1564, portraying them as physically powerful and not lacking for provisions. Fort Caroline did not last long, though relations with the local Timucua and Mocamas were friendly. The colony was unable to support itself; some of the French deserted. Those who remained were killed in 1565 by the Spanish, led by Pedro Menéndez, when they marched north from St. Augustine and captured Fort Caroline. The river was renamed San Mateo by the Spanish in honor of the Apostle Matthew, whose feast was the following day. Capturing Fort Caroline allowed the Spanish to maintain control of the river.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the {{municipal}} bus company Bergen Sporvei made {{a proposal to}} establish what <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Lightning Tram, from Varden in Fyllingsdalen via a tunnel to Møhlenpris and the city center, then make a 120° turn and return along {{the route of the}} Bergen trolleybus to Birkelundstoppen. The same year, the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature proposed a more extensive system, the Environmental Tram, which more closely resembles the current proposals. From the city center, it would run northwards via Åsane to Flaktveit and southwards via Rådal to the airport (not via Nesttun). The southern section would have branches from Hop to Nesttun and Midttun, and from Minde westwards to Fyllingsdalen and Loddefjord. Later, Bergen Sporvei's successor, Gaia Trafikk, proposed building a bus rapid transit.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{including a}} distant massive planet were also conducted by other groups. Lawler et al. {{found that the}} dynamical effect of Planet Nine would generate a cloud of objects centered around Planet Nine's semi-major axis, with most at greater semi-major axes. A massive planet in a circular orbit at 250 AU {{increased the number of}} high perihelion objects threefold; one at 500 AU with an eccentricity of 0.5 increased these tenfold, and left a significant fraction with inclinations greater than 60°. Simulations conducted by Nesvorny et al. of the giant planet migration described in the Nice model that included Planet Nine in its nominal orbit yield similar results, with roughly 0.3–0.4 Earth masses of an initial 20 Earth mass planetesimal disk remaining in what <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Planet Nine cloud {{at the end of a}} simulation of the last 4 billion years.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese were {{actively}} involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> islands by various names, which finally took the written form Bombaim. The islands were leased to several Portuguese officers during their regime. The Portuguese Franciscans and Jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the St. Michael's Church at Mahim, St. John the Baptist Church at Andheri, St. Andrew's Church at Bandra, and Gloria Church at Byculla. The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the Bombay Castle, Castella de Aguada (Castelo da Aguada or Bandra Fort), and Madh Fort. The British were in constant struggle with the Portuguese vying for hegemony over Bombay, as they recognized its strategic natural harbour and its natural isolation from land-attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD {{was first}} {{discovered by the}} British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor {{was identified as a}} nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1990 David W. Krause and Bonaparte {{argued that}} Gondwanatheria, {{including}} Ferugliotherium (family Ferugliotheriidae), Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica (family Sudamericidae), {{should be placed}} within Multituberculata. Two years later, Krause, Bonaparte, and Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska described additional material of Ferugliotherium (which they tentatively placed in the multituberculate suborder Plagiaulacoidea) and suggested that the supposed upper molars of Vucetichia were in fact heavily worn first lower molariforms (mf1) of Ferugliotherium. In 1993, Krause described an unworn mf1 of Ferugliotherium and confirmed that Vucetichia was based on worn specimens of Ferugliotherium and therefore a synonym of the latter. In the same year, he and Bonaparte argued once again that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica formed a closely related group of multituberculates, which <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> superfamily Gondwanatherioidea. Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte described a lower jaw fragment with a multituberculate-like lower fourth premolar (p4) from Los Alamitos in 1996 and tentatively identified it as Ferugliotherium. On {{the basis of the}} morphological features of the jaw fragment, they argued that gondwanatherians were not closely related to any other multituberculate group, and consequently placed them in a suborder of their own, Gondwanatheria.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese were {{actively}} involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> islands by various names, which finally took the written form Bombaim. The islands were leased to several Portuguese officers during their regime. The Portuguese Franciscans and Jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the St. Michael's Church at Mahim (1534), St. John the Baptist Church at Andheri (1579), St. Andrew's Church at Bandra (1580), and Gloria Church at Byculla (1632). The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the Bombay Castle, Castella de Aguada (Castelo da Aguada or Bandra Fort), and Madh Fort. The English were in constant struggle with the Portuguese vying for hegemony over Bombay, as they recognised its strategic natural harbour and its natural isolation from land-attacks. By the middle of the 17th century the growing power of the Dutch Empire forced the English to acquire a station in western India. On 11 May 1661, the marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal, placed the islands in possession of the English Empire, as part of Catherine's dowry to Charles. However, Salsette, Bassein, Mazagaon, Parel, Worli, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala still remained under Portuguese possession. From 1665 to 1666, the English managed to acquire Mahim, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala.|$|E
