This {{construction is}} meant to produce smooth action without the friction commonly found in classic tremolo systems. With a gear-driven spring <b>tension</b> <b>adjuster,</b> the BB1 can allow regulation of the spring tension without removing the instrument's rear cover plate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pressure}} of the breathing gas supply to a surface supplied diver is set at the gas panel, and does not automatically compensate for small depth changes the way most open circuit scuba first stages operate. To compensate for small variations due to moving around the workplace and variations in posture, the surface supplied demand helmet or full-face mask may be provided with a second stage valve spring <b>tension</b> <b>adjuster</b> screw, {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "dial-a-breath", which allows the diver to make adjustments to compensate for these variations. The knob can usually control cracking pressure from free-flow through to quite hard to breathe, and will usually compensate adequately for depth variations in the order of tens of metres. This skill is also well practiced by most divers, and is used on most dives. The knob is usually first adjusted during the pre-dive checks, and after that whenever the diver feels the need.|$|E

5000|$|The screw {{mechanism}} for changing hair tension is first mentioned in a French shop inventory of 1747. It was not universally accepted {{for over a}} decade as players were perfectly happy with [...] "clip-in" [...] models: a removable frog held in place by hair tension in a mortise carved into the stick, its <b>tension</b> <b>adjusted</b> by shims between hair and frog surface. However, baroque-style bows produced today almost universally adopt the {{screw mechanism}}.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{was of the}} Christie type, {{with long}} helical springs (in tension) angled back to keep the hull sides low. Of the five road wheels each side, four had shock absorbers. The tracks were driven by sprocketed wheels at the rear and <b>tension</b> <b>adjusted</b> at the front idler, this being standard British practice. Some variants were produced with 14 in tracks; later, 15.5-inch tracks were used. As with previous Christie-suspension cruiser tanks, there were no track return rollers, the track being supported instead {{on the tops of}} the road wheels, known as the [...] "slack-track" [...] design. The side of the hull was made up of two spaced plates, the suspension units between them, and the outer plate having cutouts for the movement of the road-wheel axles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} prolong the life of steel worm pair used in track <b>tension</b> <b>adjuster,</b> a test method was {{designed}} to evaluate the effect of hardness on the fretting wear behavior of steel worm gear on a SRV oscillating friction and wear tester. Through this method the fretting wear behavior of 40 CrNiMoA steel- 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel with different hardness matching was studied under dry sliding condition at room temperature. The results show that in the steel worm gear pair composed of 40 CrNiMoA steel and 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel, the fretting wear volume loss of 40 CrNiMoA steel decreased {{and that of the}} 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel worm material increased with the hardness of 40 CrNiMoA steel increasing. When the hardness of 40 CrNiMoA steel is about HRC 49, fretting wear volumes of the worm specimen was equal to that of the worm wheel specimen. Based on the experimental results, reasonable hardness matching for prolonging the life of steel worm pair used in track <b>tension</b> <b>adjuster</b> was proposed...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The tendon {{transfer}} operation {{is the most}} preferred surgical method for chronic extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tendon rupture repair. The key factor in these operations is tension setting of the tendon transfer. In this article, we retrospectively reviewed our extensor indicis proprius (EIP) to EPL transfer cases for chronic EPL ruptures. Methods: Five patients were operated on for chronic rupture of the EPL tendon between December of 2011 and April of 2014. The EIP tendon {{was transferred to the}} EPL tendon using the wide-awake approach in order to optimally set the tension. Results: All five patients were able to extend their thumbs. No second operation was needed for <b>tension</b> <b>adjusting.</b> No complications were encountered postoperatively and during the follow-up period. Conclusion: Tendon transfers using the wide-awake approach provides the benefit of improved tendon tension setting with active movement and minimal risks of complication.

50|$|There {{are three}} ways {{to change the}} pitch of a {{vibrating}} string. String instruments are tuned by varying the strings' <b>tension</b> because <b>adjusting</b> length or mass per unit length is impractical. Instruments with a fingerboard are then played by adjusting {{the length of the}} vibrating portion of the strings. The following observations all apply to a string that is infinitely flexible (a theoretical assumption, because in practical applications, strings are not infinitely flexible) strung between two fixed supports. Real strings have finite curvature at the bridge and nut, and the bridge, because of its motion, are not exactly nodes of vibration. Hence the following statements about proportionality are approximations.|$|R

5000|$|It had an {{integral}} chassis/body made largely of plywood, with a tubular frame {{at the rear}} for the engine and transmission. The engine was a rear-mounted, air-cooled (fan-assisted), 10 hp vee-twin engine made by Precision and equipped with a Degory carburettor. Transmission was via a four speed Jardine gearbox. Final drive to the rear axle was by chain, the rear chain <b>tension</b> being <b>adjusted</b> by moving the axle in the frame. A lever offered a combined exhaust lifter and connection by rod to a [...] "kick-starter".

30|$|To {{verify the}} {{validity}} of Lattice Boltzmann model, it should pass through the primary bubble and contact angle tests, followed by more validation on predicting the Poiseuille flow pattern using simulation of multiphase flow in a channel. In bubble test, the interfacial <b>tension</b> is <b>adjusted,</b> and the model’s ability in relating the pressure difference, radius of curvature, and interfacial tension when a bubble of a fluid is immersed in other fluid is checked. Through the contact angle test, one can check the model’s ability to predict different wetting behavior, controlled by the parameter G ads, and verify the assumption of direct relationship between cohesion and adsorption parameters and the interfacial tension values in Young’s equation. Out of the mentioned conventional validation processes for the Lattice Boltzmann model, only modeling of two-phase flow in a 2 D channel is presented in this paper.|$|R

Fixed wheel bicycles cannot use any form of chain tensioning device, because the lower run of chain is pulled very tight when using the transmission as a brake.|$|R

50|$|Automatic {{release was}} {{accomplished}} by forcing the clips sideways, against the tension of the spring. The shape of the clip and the plates meant that rotating the boot {{in relation to the}} ski would force them outwards.

40|$|Introduction Single-incision {{laparoscopic surgery}} has been {{reported}} to be a safe and feasible technique for colorectal cancer. However, the technique needs skill due to the limitations of the device. An organ retractor is a new grasp device that has the potential to overcome these limitations. Presentation of case A 63 -year-old woman with a tumor palpated in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen presented to hospital. Colonoscopy showed a type 2 mass with nearly complete stenosis, and a biopsy specimen showed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery ileocecal resection was performed using an organ retractor. A 3 -cm incision was placed in the umbilicus, and three conventional ports were inserted. An organ retractor was used for hepatocolic ligament resection, resection of the ileocolic vessels, and resection of the insertion of the mesentery proper. For each resection, the trailer line's <b>tension</b> was <b>adjusted</b> to provide a good operative view. The patient's postoperative course was good, and she was discharged 7 days after surgery. Discussion An organ retractor was effective for single-incision laparoscopic surgery technique not only to maintain a good operative view, but also to change trailer line tension, which enabled safe dissection. Conclusion An organ retractor could facilitate single-incision laparoscopic surgery...|$|R
