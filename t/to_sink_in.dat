5|$|In 1921, Mitchell first {{demonstrated}} {{to the world}} that battleships and other gun dependent vessels could be sunk by aircraft loaded with heavy bombs. In one of his most famous demonstrations, Mitchell convinced the Navy to allow bomb loaded aircraft to attack the German dreadnought , a battleship taken as a prize of war by the United States in 1918. Although the Navy had placed strict rules on the bombing exercise, Mitchell and his men violated the rules and attacked the battleship head on, which caused the vessel <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>in</b> a mere 22 minutes. Although downplayed at the time this would have a dramatic effect on U.S. policy, leading to increased research and development for aircraft.|$|E

25|$|During {{the winters}} of 1941–42 and 1942–43, the T-34 had a marked {{advantage}} over German tanks through {{its ability to}} move over deep mud or snow — especially important in Russia's twice-annual rasputitsa mud seasons — without bogging down. The Panzer IV, its closest German equivalent at that time, used an inferior leaf-spring suspension and narrow track that tended <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>in</b> such conditions.|$|E

High waves pounded the southeast coast, heavily damaging beachfront structures, washing out much of the coastal highway, and piling deep sand drifts on nearby grounds. In the Everglades, many cattle were drowned and the dike on Lake Okeechobee nearly overtopped. Off the west coast, the storm caused a ship to get lost and another <b>to</b> <b>sink.</b> <b>In</b> all, the storm claimed 17 lives and caused $31.6 million in damage.|$|E

25|$|Despite the Roman {{victories}} at sea, the Roman Republic lost countless {{ships and}} crews during the war, due to both storms and battles. On {{at least two}} occasions (255 and 253 BC) whole fleets were destroyed in bad weather; the disaster off Camarina in 255 BC counted two hundred seventy ships and over one hundred thousand men lost, the greatest single loss in history. One {{theory is that the}} weight of the corvus on the prows of the ships made the ships unstable and caused them <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>in</b> bad weather. Later, as Roman experience in naval warfare grew, the corvus device was made attachable and detachable due to its impact on the navigability of the war vessels.|$|E
25|$|Counter punchers usually {{wear their}} {{opponent}}s down by {{causing them to}} miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>in.</b> The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try {{to stay away from}} the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{this lesson}} was slow <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>in</b> {{and at first}} the VOC made the {{strategic}} decision to improve its military position on the Malabar Coast (hoping thereby to curtail English influence in the area, and end the drain on its resources from {{the cost of the}} Malabar garrisons) by using force to compel the Zamorin of Calicut to submit to Dutch domination. In 1710, the Zamorin was made to sign a treaty with the VOC undertaking to trade exclusively with the VOC and expel other European traders. For a brief time, this appeared to improve the Company's prospects. However, in 1715, with EIC encouragement, the Zamorin renounced the treaty. Though a Dutch army managed to suppress this insurrection temporarily, the Zamorin continued to trade with the English and the French, which led to an appreciable upsurge in English and French traffic. The VOC decided in 1721 that it was no longer worth the trouble to try to dominate the Malabar pepper and spice trade. A strategic decision was taken to scale down the Dutch military presence and in effect yield the area to EIC influence.|$|E

By 19:24, the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron had formed up with Beatty's {{remaining}} battlecruisers ahead of the German line. The leading British ships spotted Lützow and Derfflinger, and began firing on them. In the span of eight minutes, the battlecruiser [...] scored eight hits on Lützow; these hits were mainly concentrated in the ship's bow and were the primary cause of the flooding that would eventually cause her <b>to</b> <b>sink.</b> <b>In</b> return, both Lützow and Derfflinger concentrated their fire on Invincible, and 19:33, Lützows third salvo penetrated Invincibles center turret and ignited the magazine; the ship disappeared in a series of massive explosions. From this point onward, Lützow came under no further fire from the British battlecruisers, though she was flooding badly from two of the hits from Invincible that had struck below the waterline.|$|E

500|$|Jordan {{has been}} a medical tourism {{destination}} in the Middle East since the 1970s. A study conducted by Jordan's Private Hospitals Association found that 250,000 patients from 102 countries received treatment in Jordan in 2010, compared to 190,000 in 2007, bringing over $1 billion in revenue. Jordan is the region's top medical tourism destination, as rated by the World Bank, and fifth in the world overall. The majority of patients come from Yemen, Libya and Syria due to the ongoing civil wars in those countries. Jordanian doctors and medical staff have gained experience in dealing with war patients through years of receiving such cases from various conflict zones in the region. [...] Jordan also is a hub for natural treatment methods in both Ma'in Hot Springs and the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea {{is often described as}} a 'natural spa'. It contains 10 times more salt than the average ocean, which makes it impossible <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>in.</b> The high salt concentration of the Dead Sea has been proved as being therapeutic for many skin diseases. The uniqueness of this lake attracts several Jordanian and foreign vacationers, which boosted investments in the hotel sector in the area.|$|E

Shortly after Stivetts' first start of the season, a 10–5loss on April23 in Baltimore, Selee commented that Stivetts will not be pitching much into the future, saying that [...] "he is growing rather stiff, and will not let himself out as {{he did when he}} was at his best, some years ago." [...] His weight was now at 217lbs, so as the team departed on May10 for a western road trip, Selee sent him back to Ashland to get back into proper game condition. Although he was told not to report back to the team until his weight was below 200lbs, he had re-joined the team and played right field in the second game of a doubleheader on May15. His place in the rotation fell behind Nichols, Fred Klobedanz, and Ted Lewis. He made a relief appearance on May18, before having to take some time off for a sore arm. His next start occurred on May31, when Boston defeated St. Louis by a 25–5score. He earned his second consecutive victory on June11, a 12–4win over Louisville.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} notable verses in the song {{discusses}} the harsh effects of drugs, their role in destroying many of Kiedis' relationships, {{and their impact on}} his happiness. Based on one of Kiedis' experiences, the verse of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] illustrates his efforts to enter gang territory under a bridge to purchase drugs. Kiedis pretended that a sister of one of the gang members was his fiancée to be permitted inside. Although he successfully acquired the drugs, Kiedis considers this moment {{to be one of the}} worst of his life as it demonstrated the level to which he was willing <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>in</b> order to feed his addiction. For over 20 years, Kiedis refused to acknowledge the location of the bridge, though he noted that it is in downtown Los Angeles. Using clues provided by Kiedis in his autobiography Scar Tissue, writer Mark Haskell Smith concluded that the bridge that inspired the song was located in the city's MacArthur Park, although this contradicts Kiedis own assertion that the bridge was underneath a freeway. Other possible cited locations have included the Belmont Tunnel about half a mile from MacArthur Park, and more recently, the overpass where Interstate Highway 10 (the Santa Monica Freeway) crosses over Hoover Street close to downtown L.A.|$|E
500|$|After the {{inspection}} was concluded, {{it was determined}} to expend Baden as a gunnery target. In January 1921 {{the first round of}} gunnery tests was ordered. The gunners at HMS Excellent fired the new armor-piercing (AP) shells that had been introduced after the Battle of Jutland. This round of tests was used to determine the most efficient ratio of explosives in the detonator caps; the shells fired at Jutland had a tendency to fragment when striking heavy armor rather than penetrate. The monitor [...] moored some [...] away from Baden to fire her [...] guns from point-blank range. Baden was made to list to starboard by the removal of coal and armor from the port side, to simulate the effect of a shell striking armor from a plunging angle. The forward-most gun turret had by this time been removed. Terror fired 17 shells of various types into the ship. The Royal Navy concluded after these tests that the new shells were sufficiently powerful to penetrate heavy armor, and were much more effective than the previous versions that had been employed at Jutland. Following the tests, heavy seas caused the ship <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> <b>in</b> the shallow water; after three months she was again raised and docked for repairs. The ship was readied for a second round of testing by August 1921.|$|E
500|$|In New Zealand, {{sharks and}} rays appear to be {{important}} prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks and shortfin mako sharks. With sharks, orcas may herd them {{to the surface and}} strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in {{sharks and rays}} by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a [...] female killed a [...] great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it.
