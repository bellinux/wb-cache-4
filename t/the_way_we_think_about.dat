500|$|To Kill a Mockingbird {{has been}} a source of {{significant}} controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963. The book's racial slurs, profanity, and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States. The American Library Association reported that To Kill a Mockingbird was number 21 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 2000–2009. Following parental complaints about the racist language it contains, the novel was removed from classrooms in Virginia in 2016 and Biloxi in 2017, where it was described as making people [...] "uncomfortable." [...] In the Mississippi case, the novel was removed from the required reading list but subsequently made available to interested students with parental consent. Such decisions have been criticised: the American Civil Liberties Union noted the importance of engaging with the novel's themes in places where racial injustice persists. Becky Little of The History Channel and representatives of the Mark Twain House pointed out the value of classics lies in their power to [...] "challenge <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> things" [...] (Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has attracted similar controversy). Arne Duncan, who served as Secretary of Education under President Obama, noted that removal of the book from reading lists was evidence of a nation with [...] "real problems." [...] In 1966, a parent in Hanover, Virginia protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape. Upon learning the school administrators were holding hearings to decide the book's appropriateness for the classroom, Harper Lee sent $10 to The Richmond News Leader suggesting it to be used toward the enrollment of [...] "the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice". The National Education Association in 1968 placed the novel second on a list of books receiving the most complaints from private organizations—after Little Black Sambo.|$|E

[...] Although it was originally intended to serve as a tool to help us to write and communicate with others, it has more recently transformed into a means of providing us with virtual worlds which we can step into and interact with other people. The book discusses how our everyday interactions with computers affect our minds and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> ourselves.|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{says the}} idea of free will [...] "cannot be mapped on to any {{conceivable}} reality" [...] and is incoherent. According to Harris, science [...] "reveals {{you to be a}} biochemical puppet." [...] People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, [...] "emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control." [...] Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{some of the most important}} questions in life.|$|E

2500|$|His Theology in the Flesh: How Embodiment and Culture Shape <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> <b>about</b> Truth, Morality, and God is {{the first}} book to apply the field of {{cognitive}} linguistics to theology. According to cognitive linguistics, the specific types of bodies humans have shape how we interact with and understand our world. We have concepts such as up/down and in/out because we have bodies that can experience these sorts of things. Embodied experience also gives rise much of our metaphorical thinking. For instance, {{we know what it}} is like to go on a journey in which we experience getting to a destination together and perhaps overcoming obstacles on the way. Many, but not all, languages use the experience physical journeys as the framework in which to understand the experience of love. We say, [...] "Our relationship has come a long way together" [...] and [...] "We have overcome many bumps in the road." [...] We reason about our love relationship in terms of a journey. Yet, in English, we also conceive of love in terms of strong physical forces ("He's blown away by love"), magnetism ("She is attracted to him"), and even insanity ("He is crazy about her"). That means that metaphors can be cognitive and not merely rhetorical. We actually think with metaphors.|$|E
2500|$|... "Researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a Department of Energy lab in Tennessee, have {{discovered}} a mechanism for converting carbon dioxide into ethanol. Their method takes advantage of nanotechnology, creating a catalyst that produces ethanol from a solution of carbon dioxide in water. 'We discovered somewhat by accident that this material worked,' said Adam Rondinone, the lead {{author of a new}} study in the journal ChemistrySelect. 'We were trying to study the first step of a proposed reaction when we realized that the catalyst was doing the entire reaction on its own.' The discovery may change <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> carbon dioxide. If it could be captured and turned into a fuel, then carbon dioxide – the earth-polluting byproduct of global dependence on fossil fuels – could help high-energy societies work toward energy independence. Repurposing carbon dioxide could be invaluable for the environment, the researchers say. Converting it into ethanol can turn a greenhouse gas into a gasoline-like fuel source. Ethanol contains one-third less energy than gasoline but produces far fewer byproducts when burned in engines, which can limit further carbon emissions. 'Closing the carbon cycle by utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for currently used commodities, in order to displace a fossil feedstock, is an appropriate intermediate step towards a carbon-free future,” the researchers wrote in the study." ...|$|E
