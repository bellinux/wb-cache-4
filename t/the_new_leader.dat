In September 1921, the Greek defeat {{at the battle of}} Sakarya {{marked the beginning of the}} Greek retreat from Turkey. Resentment among the allies for Constantine's policy during World War I prevented Athens from receiving outside support.

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{frequency}} of leadership transitions and their {{significant impact on}} team and organizational performance, little research has examined why and how teams develop an identification with a <b>new</b> <b>leader</b> or their subsequent receptiveness to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>leader’s</b> change initiatives. Drawing from the contrast and congruence effects and the theoretical perspectives of leader identification, this study empirically tests a model in which <b>the</b> congruence of <b>new</b> leaders’ and their teams’ proactive personalities foster <b>new</b> <b>leader</b> identification, {{as well as the}} team’s behavioral responses to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>leader’s</b> change agenda. This effect is strongest when <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>leader’s</b> proactive personality is higher than that of the former leader’s proactive personality (positive contrast). Our findings of a four-wave “before-and-after” transition survey of 155 hotel employees and 51 <b>new</b> <b>leaders,</b> achieved through polynomial regression analyses, proved very insightful. Essentially, we found that the congruence between a <b>new</b> <b>leader’s</b> and his/her team’s proactive personalities and the positive contrast between a former <b>leader’s</b> and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>leader’s</b> proactive personalities enhanced <b>new</b> <b>leader</b> identification and <b>the</b> team’s shared identification with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>leader’s</b> change agenda, and, thereby led the team to exhibit more behavioral engagement with, and voice behavior about, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>leader’s</b> change agenda...|$|R

5|$|By February 2001 the Workers' Communist Party {{proposed}} making Folkvord <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>leader</b> of the Red Electoral Alliance, since Myhre would resign if he {{was elected}} to parliament. While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters were perfectly aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was started to make him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's opposition was his close ties to the Workers' Communist Party. At the convention Myhre was re-elected the party's party leader, with Folkvord and Chris Hartmann stepping in as the party's new deputy leaders. Myhre did not become a member of parliament.|$|E

5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K.

Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to win the election in a close race.

5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>leader</b> gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Marie Le Pen {{announced}} in September 2008 {{that he would}} retire as FN president in 2010.

She sought to transform the FN into a mainstream party by softening its xenophobic image. Opinion polls showed the party's popularity increase under Marine Le Pen, and in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15% of the overall vote (up from 4.5% in 2008). However, due to the French electoral system, the party only won 2 of the 2,026 seats up for election.|$|E
