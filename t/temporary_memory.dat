Later, Angie learns that Nick had an affair with Julie prior to her attack, but she forgives him for this betrayal. When Julie rejects Danny once more, he attempts suicide by swallowing a large amount of pills. Angie and Nick admit him to the hospital, where he awakens with <b>temporary</b> <b>memory</b> loss and tells Nurse Mona Clark (Maria Cominis), that his name is Tyler. Mona assumes that the family is in the witness relocation program, but Danny fully reveals his family's secret. Mona demands $67,000 from the Bolens in return for her silence but is killed by a plane that makes an emergency landing on Wisteria Lane soon after.|$|E

Zhang hypothesizes that the function of sleep is to process, encode, and transfer the data from the <b>temporary</b> <b>memory</b> store to the long-term memory store. During NREM sleep the conscious-related memory (declarative memory) is processed, and during REM sleep the unconscious related memory (procedural memory) is processed.|$|E

While not malignant, the tumor exerts pressure on certain motor functions, resulting in <b>temporary</b> <b>memory</b> loss, loss of vision and slurring of speech. She decided against elective surgery because the surgery would alter her nasal cavity and permanently modify her voice. To facilitate her care, she announced in April 2011 {{that she had been}} prohibited from taking on new voice acting roles in anime since some time the previous year. She still continued voicing characters for anime that received additional seasons or extended runs. In May 2011, Hirano announced via Twitter that she was no longer performing music for Lantis and has discontinued her music career until further notice. On August 2, 2011, Japanese magazine Bubka confirmed that Hirano was dismissed by Lantis due to a sex scandal involving her sleeping with several band members. Citing a need for a new agency that was more ideal with her career wishes, Hirano announced on August 12, 2011 that she left Space Craft Entertainment. On August 21, Hirano moved to the voice acting agency Grick.

40|$|Until recently, {{research}} on artificial neural networks was largely restricted to systems {{with only two}} types of variable: Neural activities that represent the current or recent input and weights that learn to capture regularities among inputs, outputs and payoffs. There is no good reason for this restriction. Synapses have dynamics at many different time-scales and this suggests that artificial neural networks might benefit from variables that change slower than activities but much faster than the standard weights. These "fast weights" {{can be used to}} store <b>temporary</b> <b>memories</b> of the recent past and they provide a neurally plausible way of implementing the type of attention to the past that has recently proved very helpful in sequence-to-sequence models.

Mandrell told interviewers that the crash made her reassess her priorities; she retired in November 1997, 13 years after the crash, and now spends more time with her family. Mandrell is now a confirmed seat belt advocate, especially because prior to the crash, neither she nor her two oldest children Matthew and Jaime (also involved in the crash) were normally seat belt wearers. Mandrell saw a station wagon in front of her with the tailgate down and children not being restrained in the back, and felt the need to tell her children to buckle up just before the crash.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent to}} which protein {{synthesis}} is involved in working memory was investigated with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (ANI). Rats were trained to perform accurately on a 12 -arm radial maze when delays of 240 min were interposed between choice 6 and choice 7. Bilateral hippocampal cannulas were then implanted. Accuracy on choices 7 - 12 was studied when ANI or saline was injected either 30 min before choice 1 or 5 - 10 min after choice 6 (Experiment 1). Pretrial injection of ANI significantly impaired performance following the 240 -min delay, whereas ANI injected during the delay had no such effect. In Experiments 2 and 3, the ANI-induced amnesia was replicated, and the temporal course of development of the amnesia was determined. Pretrial administration of ANI did not significantly affect reten-tion after a 2 -min delay but did produce amnesia after delays of 15 min or longer. These data suggest that protein synthesis {{is important for the}} forma-tion of <b>temporary</b> <b>memories,</b> provided the retention interval is long enough.
