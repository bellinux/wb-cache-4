40|$|The {{architecture}} of trabecular bone {{is thought to}} be controlled by mechanosensitive bone cells, where hormones provide a background for their responses to mechanical signals. It has been suggested that, in osteoporosis, this response is hampered by changed hormonal levels, thereby increasing the <b>mechanical</b> <b>set</b> point of the cells, which would lead to bone loss. We have investigated if a temporary increase of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>set</b> point causes deterioration of trabecular bone architecture, such as seen in osteoporosis. Furthermore, the effects of a changed loading pattern were investigated for the same reason. For this purpose, we used a computer simulation model, which was based on the regulation of bone architecture by mechanosensitive osteocytes. It was found that a temporary shift of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>set</b> point causes no lasting changes in architecture. Although an increase of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>set</b> point induces bone loss, the mechanism of bone loss (trabecular thinning) differs from what is observed in osteoporosis (loss of whole trabeculae). Hence, a change of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>set</b> point alone cannot explain bone loss as seen in osteoporosis. On the other hand, the removal of load components in a particular direction resulted in irreversible loss of whole trabeculae. These results indicate that such temporary changes in loading patterns could be important risk factors for osteoporosis. [Journal Article; In English; United States...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the shear strength evolution of laser welds. DP 600 steel sheets, with a thin zinc coating, were welded in a lap joint configuration. With the aim of optimisation, {{it has been shown that}} the <b>mechanical</b> <b>set</b> up, i. e. weld gap and clamping force associated with speed and laser power, permit a significant increase in mechanical properties notably in shear strength when the zinc vaporization is optimized. This amelioration required a negative defocusing (− 0. 33 mm) and a minimal weld gap (0. 2 mm) to allow zinc vapour to escape the weld pool and thus avoiding porosity. Equally it has been shown that the shear strength is directly linked to the geometrical properties of the weld bead, particularly at the gap between sheets and principally the control of the zinc vaporization. The relation between welding process parameters, <b>mechanical</b> <b>set</b> up parameters and the nature of the materials have been to control to obtain the best mechanical behaviour. © 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineer...|$|R
