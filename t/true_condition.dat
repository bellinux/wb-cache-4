5|$|Wilson {{began to}} recover {{by the end}} of 1919, but {{remained}} secluded for the remainder of his term, steadfast in his refusal or inability to accept changes to the treaty. Marshall was prevented from meeting with him to ascertain his <b>true</b> <b>condition</b> until his final day in office. It remains unclear who was making the executive branch's decisions during Wilson's incapacity, but it was likely the first lady {{with the help of the}} presidential advisers.|$|E
25|$|He was {{insulated}} by his wife, who selected {{matters for}} his attention and delegated others to his cabinet. Wilson temporarily resumed a perfunctory attendance at cabinet meetings. By February 1920, the President's <b>true</b> <b>condition</b> was publicly known. At issue was Wilson's fitness {{for the presidency}} {{at a time when}} the League fight was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze. No one close to him, including his wife, his physician, or personal assistant, was willing to admit he was unable to perform the duties of the presidency. Because of this complex case, and the subsequent realization of the difficulties that might have been experienced in the nuclear age if, instead of being assassinated in 1963, John F. Kennedy had been left in a permanent vegetative state on account of his brain injuries, the 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967 to allow the voluntary or forcible replacement of an unable or unwilling incumbent.|$|E
500|$|The {{doctors who}} {{attended}} Louise reported she was severely concussed and in shock, and that [...] "it was a wonder her skull was not fractured". Louise's ear {{had been injured}} when her earring caught {{on the side of}} the sleigh, tearing her ear lobe in two. The press played down the story on instructions from Lorne's private secretary, an act that was described by contemporaries as [...] "stupid and ill advised". For example, one New Zealand newspaper reported, [...] "Excepting immediately after the blow, the Princess was perfectly sensible during the whole time..." [...] Knowledge of Louise's <b>true</b> <b>condition</b> might have elicited sympathy from the Canadian people. As it was, one Member of Parliament wrote: [...] "Except the cut in the lower part of the ear I think there was no injury done worth mentioning." [...] Therefore, when Louise cancelled her immediate engagements, people thought she was malingering. News of the accident was also played down in Britain, and in letters home to the anxious Queen Victoria.|$|E
60|$|The view which I take of {{this matter}} is caused by no want of faith in mysteries; but from a deep reverence of the soul, and of the mysteries which it knows within itself, but never transmits to the earthly eye and ear.

2500|$|... has objected that transpersonal {{psychology}} {{fails to}} distinguish between the transpersonal condition of nirvana, which is inherently liberating, those transpersonal conditions which are within samsara and which as such are new forms of bondage (such as the four realms of the arupyadhatu or four arupa lokas of Buddhism, in which the figure-ground division dissolves but there is still a subject-object duality), and the neutral condition in which neither nirvana nor samsara are active that the Dzogchen teachings call kun gzhi, {{in which there is no}} subject-object duality but the <b>true</b> <b>condition</b> of all phenomena (dharmata) is not patent (and which includes all conditions involving nirodhah or cessation, including nirodhah samapatti, nirvikalpa samadhis and the samadhi or turiya that is the supreme realization of Patañjali's Yoga darshana). In the process of elaborating what he calls a meta-transpersonal psychology, Capriles has carried out conscientious refutations of Wilber, Grof and Washburn, which according to Macdonald & Friedman will have important repercussions on the future of transpersonal psychology.|$|E

2500|$|Merman {{began to}} become forgetful with {{advancing}} age, and on occasion, had difficulty with her speech. At times her behavior was erratic, causing concern among her friends. On April 7, 1983, she {{was preparing to}} travel to Los Angeles {{to appear on the}} 55th Academy Awards telecast, when she collapsed in her apartment. Merman was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where doctors initially thought she had suffered a stroke. However, after undergoing exploratory surgery on April 11, Merman was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma. The New York Times reported that she underwent brain surgery to have the tumor removed, but in fact, it was inoperable and her condition was deemed terminal (doctors had given Merman eight and half months to live). The tumor caused Merman to become aphasic, and, as her illness progressed, she lost her hair and her face swelled. According to Merman biographer Brian Kellow, Merman's family and manager did not want the true nature of her condition revealed to the public. Merman's son Robert, Jr., who took charge of her care, later said he chose not to publicly disclose his mother's <b>true</b> <b>condition</b> because Merman strove to keep her personal life private. He stated, [...] "Mom truly appreciated [...] presence and their applause. But you shouldn't attempt to be personal—she drew lines, and she could cut you off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mister Freeze {{appears in}} The New Batman Adventures, {{sporting}} a new, sleeker design. As his mutation slowly destroys his body, Victor Fries kidnapped scientists (voiced by Jeff Bennett and Lauren Tom) {{to try and}} stop the process, only succeeding in saving his head which is supported by four robotic legs built separate from his suit. When a cured Nora Fries married her own doctor and left Gotham permanently, the trauma destroys whatever is left of Fries' humanity. Mister Freeze vows to inflict on others the loss he's suffered in the episode [...] "Cold Comfort" [...] by taking away the things they value most, much to the confusion of Robin and Batgirl. When Freeze is confronted at his hideout by Batman and Batgirl, he reveals his <b>true</b> <b>condition</b> to {{them as well as}} his goal of destroying Gotham City [...] all the Dark Knight holds dear [...] by dropping a 'reverse fusion bomb' that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb. However, he is followed by Batman and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses a grappling gun to hook Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg. Although Freeze is presumed dead, his head is seen to be missing as the episode ends.|$|E

25|$|The first {{contribution}} to this was a large unilateral reduction which began with an announcement by Gorbachev in December 1988; these reductions continued {{as a result of}} the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and in accordance with Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaties. The second reason for the decline was the widespread resistance to conscription which developed as the policy of glasnost revealed to the public the <b>true</b> <b>conditions</b> inside the Soviet army and the widespread abuse of conscript soldiers.|$|R

It has been commonly accepted that the correction equation always has a solution.

A refined Jacobi-Davidson method is proposed to overcome the possible nonconvergence of Ritz vectors by computing certain refined approximation eigenvectors from the subspace. A corresponding correction equation is derived for the refined method. Numerical experiments are conducted and efficiency of the refined method is confirmed...|$|R
