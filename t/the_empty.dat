5|$|Peano {{arithmetic}} is equiconsistent {{with several}} weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of general set theory (extensionality, existence of <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set, and the axiom of adjunction), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.|$|E

40|$|Gastric {{emptying}} of liquids and solids {{was evaluated}} in ten dogs with gastric fistula {{before and after}} either truncal vagotomy, antrectomy, or pyloroplasty. In subsequent operations, the vagotomy group underwent either antrectomy or pyloroplasty, and the antrectomy and pyloroplasty groups were vagotomized. Vagotomy significantly inhibited <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of both liquids and solids (p less than 0. 001) when the pyloric antrum was intact. When the antropyloric mechanism was removed by antrectomy, the effect of vagotomy was to accelerate <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of liquids (p less than 0. 05) but to impair <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of solids (p less than 0. 001). When the pylorus was destroyed by pyloroplasty, vagotomy markedly accelerated <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of liquids but {{had little effect on}} <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of solids. Neither antrectomy nor pyloroplasty had any significant effect on <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of solids. Pyloroplasty caused minor acceleration of emptying of liquids while antrectomy had no effect...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we have {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} the caloric content of a physiological test meal on <b>the</b> gastric <b>emptying</b> kinetics of solids and liquids. 22 healthy male volunteers were studied in two groups matched for age. After an overnight fast, each volunteer underwent the same test procedure; in the first group (G I), 10 volunteers received a meal consisting of bread, 111 In-DTPA water and 1 scrambled egg labeled with 99 mTc-labelled sulphur colloid; in the second group (G II) 12 volunteers were given the same meal but with 2 labeled eggs in order to increase the caloric content of the solid phase meal. Simultaneous anterior and posterior images were recorded using a dual-headed gamma camera. Solid and liquid geometric mean data were analyzed to determine the lag phase, <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> rate and <b>the</b> half-emptying time for both solids and liquids. Solid and liquid gastric half-emptying times were significantly prolonged in G II compared to G I volunteers. For the solid phased, the delay was accounted for by a longer lag phase and a decrease in <b>the</b> equilibrium <b>emptying</b> rate. <b>The</b> <b>emptying</b> rate of <b>the</b> liquid phase was significantly decreased in G II compared to G I. Within each group, no statistically significant difference was observed between solid and liquid emptying rates. We conclude that the caloric content of the solid portion of a meal not only alters <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of <b>the</b> solid phase but also affects <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of <b>the</b> liquid component of the meal. status: publishe...|$|R
