These, abn- 1 and abn- 2, differ from wild type in that their growth rates are greatly reduced and often irregular, aerial hyphae are absent, conidia are extremely rare, and no protoperithecia are formed. Growth was not improved by addition of any nutrients tested, oxygen consumption {{was similar to}} that of wild type, and cytochrome c appeared abnormally high, and b low or absent.

The abn characteristics appear in heterocaryons, and have been transmitted to other genetic strains by means of heterocaryosis followed by plating of conidia. Conidia formed by such heterocaryons typically showed low viability, and gave rise to cultures with great variability in growth rate, morphology, and survival.

Monoallelic expression of these genes is regulated by imprinting control regions (ICRs) and is established in the embryonic germ line through differential DNA methylation.

Cellular fusion of somatic cells with a pluripotent stem cell partner {{can also lead to}} dominant pluripotent reprogramming. Although ES cells (derived from the inner cell mass) and embryonic germ cells (EG, derived from primordial germ cells) can both reprogram, EG cells are unique in being able to erase genomic imprints from the somatic partner. In order to characterize the earliest events in successful reprogramming, as well as EG‐specific DNA demethylation, I generated experimental heterokaryons between B‐lymphocytes and mouse stem cell lines. I showed that ES cells that lack Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC 2) failed to reprogram B cells and were unable to induce two early events that characterise successful B cell reprogramming; a global redistribution of HP 1 α and an increased serine 10 phosphorylation. In the second part of my study I confirmed that EG cells were able to induce DNA demethylation at several ICR in B cells following fusion.

Consequently, daughter cells must inherit an allotment {{of each of these}} subcellular structures before the completion of cell division (Yaffe, 1991 b). This organelle inheritance ensures the continuation of the organelle populations and provisions daughter cells with adequate numbers of organelles to supply metabolic functions early in the cell cycle. This inheritance of organelles is an essential component of cell proliferation, yet little is known of its molecular basis or regulation.

Development was higher in embryos originating from adult ooplasts. Collectively, these results {{support the hypothesis that}} lack of developmental competence of calf oocytes is due to their failure or inability to complete ooplasmic maturation. ^ We hypothesized that the germinal vesicle (GV) stage oocyte was capable of inducing a meiotic like division of the somatic cell nucleus. To test this hypothesis, cumulus cells in G 0, G 1 or metaphase (M) were transferred to GV stage bovine oocytes. Denuded GV oocytes were fused by an electrical pulse and matured in vitro. Chromosome segregation was assessed after staining with Hoechst 33342. All cell stages had similar fusion and survival rates and were capable of undergoing a meiotic-like division on subsequent maturation. Human and mouse fibroblasts and bovine cumulus cells in G 1 were transferred to GV or prometaphase I (PM I) stage bovine oocytes. Human and mouse fibroblasts were also transferred to PM 1 mouse oocytes. Meiotic maturation was assed by staining DNA with Hoechst 333342 and chromosome segregation by FISH analysis for bovine chromosomes 6 and 13 and for human chromosomes X and 18. Fusion and survival rates were better when PM I oocytes were used as recipients. Somatic cells were capable of undergoing a meiotic-like division.

40|$|Introduction: In 1914, Hans Spemann {{demonstrated}} that salamanders had pluripotent nuclei {{up to the}} 16 -cell stage (Spemann, 1938). In this classic study, the author utilized a hair from his son to constrict a newly fertilized salamander zygote, isolating the nucleus on one side. It was observed that the nucleated side cleaved and developed to the 16 -cell stage, at which time the hair was loosened to allow one of the nuclei {{to pass through the}} constriction and into the non-nucleated portion. The ligature was then completely tightened, cutting the embryo in half. Cell division occurred in the newly nucleated portion of the cytoplasm, eventually resulting in twin larvae (Spemann, 1938). Research by other groups {{demonstrated that}} nuclei from early amphibian embryos transferred to appropriate cytoplasm were totipotent (Briggs and King, 1952; Gurdon, 1961, 1962; McKinnell, 1962). However, as researchers transferred nuclei from individuals more advanced developmentally, the success rates decreased. Nuclei from differentiated cells of adult frogs only supported development to tadpoles. During this time, classic research demonstrated that sexual reproduction could be completely replaced by defining necessary conditions for culturing somatic carrot cells (Steward et al., 1958, 1970). These impressive results were followed by a report of a successful nuclear transfer of embryonic nuclei in mice (Illmensee and Hoppe, 1981) by directly injecting inner cell mass (ICM) cell nuclei into enucleated zygotes. However, these results were followed by the reports that full development in mice was not possible after nuclear transfer (McGrath and Solter, 1983 a, 1983 b). Their report in 1983 described the use of the cytoskeletal inhibitor cytochalasin B (CB) and a virus-mediated cell fusion technique that allowed efficient pronuclear transplantation and full-term development in the mouse (McGrath and Solter, 1983 a). Although pronuclear transfer in the mouse resulted in viable offspring the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclei</b> from 2 -cell blastomeres into enucleated zygotes produced very few blastocysts (13 %) and no development to term (McGrath and Solter, 1983 a, 1983 b). It was then concluded that the nuclei of advanced differentiated cells were irreversibly programmed and, in a memorable line, the authors stated: “…the cloning of mammals by nuclear transfer is biologically impossible…”. Even with these discouraging results, other groups still considered this an unanswered point.

Incomplete nuclear reprogramming following the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> donor <b>nuclei</b> into re-cipient oocytes has been implicated as a primary reason for the low {{efficiency of}} the cloning procedure. The mechanisms and factors that affect the progression of the nuclear reprogramming process have not been completely elucidated, but the identifi-cation of these factors and their subsequent manipulation would increase cloning efficiency. At present, many groups are studying donor nucleus reprogramming. Here, we present an approach in which the efficiency of producing viable offspring is improved by selecting recipient oocytes and donor cells that will produce cloned embryos with functionally reprogrammed nuclei. This ap-proach will produce information useful in future studies aimed at further deciphering the nuclear reprogramming process. developmental biology, early development, ovum, pregnancy, re-productive technolog...|$|R

The factors that influence the efficiency <b>of</b> heteronuclear polarisation <b>transfer</b> in multi-pulse experiments, and in that way the quality of spectra are the subject of this thesis. The flow of coherence through pulse sequences can be designed and analysed with the aid of product operator calculations. Results of the study include improvements to quantitative two-dimensional shift-correlated experiments, and demonstration of the benefits of closely spaced 180 ° pulse trains in polarisation transfer steps in long-range correlation experiments and isotope editing filters...|$|R
