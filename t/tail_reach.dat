Proceedings of the Workshop on Pro-poor Intervention Strategies in Irrigated Agriculture in Asia, Islamabad, Pakistan, 23 - 24 April 2003. Lahore, Pakistan: International Water Management Institute (IWMI). Agricultural income occupies significant share of rural households? income. Only ample and reliable supplies of surface irrigation water can guarantee its improvement. As poverty is inversely correlated with improvement in incomes, provided other factors remain the same, the policy makers can use irrigation {{as a tool}} in poverty reduction programs. The inequity in surface water distribution not only affects the rural households across different irrigations but also influences the distribution of income and poverty situation in different reaches of each irrigation system. Since long, it is asserted that households in the <b>tail</b> <b>reach</b> areas have relatively poor access to irrigation water as compared to those situated {{in the head and}} middle reach areas. It is evident that more distance from irrigation source brings more households in the poverty trap are located at the <b>tail</b> <b>reach</b> area. Here, the intensity of poverty would be higher than in the head and middle reach areas. This paper tests this hypothesis with results showing that poverty increases in the <b>tail</b> <b>reach</b> areas as compared to head and middle reach areas. This calls for the need to address current hurdles exercising equity and reliability in irrigation supplies in order to provide this vital input for increasing agricultural productivity of the tail end farm households...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent years, {{there were}} many piers {{constructed}} in <b>tail</b> <b>reach</b> of Yongjiang River. This made river channel in estuarial reach shrank gradually, which in turn influenced the shipping ability of estuarial area. Taking Qingshuipu pier that would be constructed in the left bank of Yongjiang river estuarial reach as an example, a numerical simulation have been done, and resistance parameter had been proved reasonably by author. The flow pattern, backwater height and channel scour-fill intensity near the pier trestle have been studied in different kinds of flood and tidal stencils. In engineering project, the trestle prevents flood from diffusing by dipping into the river. Meanwhile, backwater and deposition occur in the bank, which have impact on flow capacity. If the siltation in the area accumulates, then, point bar could not be scoured adequately in great flood period, which will force mainstream to move towards right bank. Based on the backwater and local scouring and silting situation near the pier trestle, the author puts forward a revised proposal and gains a preferable result. So, reasonable pier arrangement is the important condition for keeping steady and healthy to the <b>tail</b> <b>reach</b> of tidal river. General situation of the river Yongjiang river bend slightly like S-shape and the water surface slope is less than 0. 01 %, which ca...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Further {{details of this}} conference can be found at: [URL] {{performance}} objectives of an irrigation scheme are productivity, equity, adequacy, reliability, surety index and frequency index. These objectives conflict with each other so multiple objectives {{need to be considered}} when making decisions. An approach based on multi criteria decision making (MCDM) technique of compromise programming is presented in this paper. It consists of identifying different performance objectives (POs) (for example, productivity, equity etc.) that contribute to “overall performance index” (OPI) of irrigation management. Weights are assigned to each PO that reflects its relative importance. The values of the indicators are obtained from simulation-optimization modeling and weights are obtained by analytical hierarchical process (AHP). OPIs are obtained for different alternatives and the preferred alternative is the one that is nearest to the ideal point. The applicability of the developed approach is demonstrated with the help of case study from Maharashtra State, India, using the “AWAM” model to estimate the values of POs for different irrigation strategies or alternatives and comparison of POs obtained from the survey of head, middle and <b>tail</b> <b>reach</b> farmers. The results indicated that MCDM generated the same irrigation strategy for head and middle reach farmers; but a different strategy for <b>tail</b> <b>reach</b> farmers, based on their expressed PO weights...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} tube wells {{was carried out}} in a surface {{hydrological}} unit (distributary canal command area) in Rechna Doab of the Punjab, Pakistan and results were compared with a tube well census conducted in the same area 20 years ago to update knowledge of the groundwater abstraction structures and find the changes occurring over two decades. Three water courses, located at the head, middle and tail regions of a distributary, were selected to carry out a survey of tube wells including information about ownership of each well, its installation year, bore depth, suction depth, power source, inner diameter of delivery pipe and discharge (which was determined by the trajectory method). Water table depth was collected twice from 11 hand pumps during the study (after rainy season in summer and in winter), six observation wells were also installed, two each in the command area of every sample watercourse, and monitored biweekly for a year. Electrical conductivity of groundwater samples collected from hand pumps, shallow and deep tube wells was also measured. Results were compared with those of Vander Velde and Johnson (1992) for the same water courses. Results show that number of tube wells increased by four and three folds in the command areas of the head and middle watercourses respectively, while the increase was 1. 5 times at tail over the last two decades. Substantial increase in diesel engine and electric motor tube wells were observed while tractor driven tube wells decreased in number. Density of tube wells per 100 acres of GCA increased 4. 3, 3. 0 and 1. 5 times in head, middle and tail regions respectively. Electric motor operated tube wells have higher discharge. Maximum average water table drop of 16. 81 feet over 20 years was observed in the <b>tail</b> <b>reach</b> of the distributary canal. Shallow tube wells are disappearing from <b>tail</b> <b>reach</b> of the distributary. Most of the ground water pumped by these tube wells was of marginal qualit...|$|E

The main objectives {{of this study are}} (1) To evaluate the operational, agricultural, financial and management performance of the sluices. (3) To compare the performance of three sluices and to prescribe corrective measures for better performance. 24 R sluice from U 8 B of upper reach, 3 L sluice from M 6 of middle reach and 6 L sluice from L 14 council of lower reach are selected and the observations are made. The focus here is on the farmers’ councils and their activities regarding the operational, agricultural, financial, and management performance of the irrigation system. The performances of the system are evaluated using interview schedule and direct field observations. The discharge is measured using float method and seepage loss using ponding method. Average seepage loss is found as 40. 58 m 3 /s/Mm 2 in 24 R sluice. Operational performance is good in 6 L sluice of <b>tail</b> <b>reach.</b> The agricultural performance is good in 24 R sluice of head reach.

The capabilities of SEPICA allow a much more detailed analysis of the charge dis-tributions than previous instrumentation. Over the energy range from 0. 2 to 1 MeV/Nuc a trend is observed that shows charge states increasing with energy, in particular for Mg, Si and Fe. In addition, for Fe a mixed charge state distribution with a distinct peak at lower charge states (10 - 14) is ob-served simultaneously with a <b>tail</b> <b>reaching</b> to charge states up to 20.

40|$|Indus basin {{irrigation}} system (IBIS) {{is one of}} the largest contiguous irrigation systems of the world. The surface canal water supplies are far less than the crop water demands which lead farmers to use groundwater to cope surface water scarcity. Although many studies in the IBIS are conducted to analyze the equitable distribution of canal water, there is hardly any study which comprehensively analyze the equitable use of canal water and groundwater at different spatial and temporal scales. One of the main reasons is lack of reliable information on the volume of groundwater abstraction. The objective of the current study is to develop an approach for estimating the equity of canal water and groundwater use at different spatial (canal command, distributaries, head, middle and <b>tail</b> end <b>reaches)</b> and temporal (daily, monthly and seasonal) scales of Hakra canal command area of IBIS. Results show that canal water and groundwater use to meet actual evapotranspiration is 34 and 42 %, respectively, which makes groundwater as an integral part of the large canal irrigation schemes of IBIS. The canal water and groundwater use varies significantly during the cropping colander. The maximum groundwater use is during May (51 mm) whereas the maximum canal water use is during August (24 mm). Farmers located at the head end reaches of Hakra canal use 42 % groundwater of total groundwater use whereas farmers located at the middle and <b>tail</b> end <b>reaches</b> use only 35 and 23 %, respectively. The canal water use at the head, middle and <b>tail</b> end <b>reaches</b> is 40, 34 and 26 %, respectively. These results show that the farmers located at the head of Hakra canal command area use more canal water and groundwater as compared to those located at the middle and <b>tail</b> end <b>reaches.</b> This methodology can provide guidelines to water managers in the region for equitable use of both canal water and groundwater...|$|R
