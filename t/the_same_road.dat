5|$|Franklin's brigade {{departed}} on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road</b> it used {{to enter}} Wytheville, the road that leads to Tazewell Courthouse (Jeffersonville). It was a good decision to leave, because the Confederate army had already begun an attempt to block their return home. One of the two main roads available for the return trip was occupied by troops {{under the command of}} Colonel John McCausland, and the other road was blocked by the command of Brigadier-General John S. Williams. Two cavalry units were in pursuit, including Major May's cavalry that had harassed the brigade as it approached Wytheville.|$|E
5|$|Catholic priests {{had come}} to Rosendale as early as 1840, and the first mass in the village was held in a cooper's shop. The {{original}} Church of St. Peter was completed {{in the summer of}} 1850, and the first mass in that building was held on August15. The church was not officially incorporated until April29, 1865. A newer, larger building was constructed in 1876, on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road</b> as the village's rail depot. The new building followed an English Gothic architecture style. It was made of bricks, created near the North River, and was ornamented with yellow bricks from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and sandstone from Amherst, New York. The first mass in the new church occurred on December25, 1876; the building's total construction cost was $31,000. The Church of St. Peter {{is the only one of}} the village's churches that still functions as a church.|$|E
5|$|After {{continuing}} into Allegany County, Alt US40 descends Savage Mountain into Frostburg, {{where it}} passes through the town as Main Street. Main Street in Frostburg has the highest traffic density on the route, with an AADT of 15,022. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 between exits 33 and 34 has an AADT of 20,931. In west Frostburg, the highway intersects MD36, which then follows <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road</b> as Alt US40 for about a mile, separating from Alt US40 in east Frostburg. In central Frostburg, Main Street intersects MD936, an old alignment of MD36. Continuing eastward from Frostburg, traffic density decreases, to an AADT of 13,585 at the MD55 intersection, staying between 13,000 and 15,000 {{for the remainder of}} the highway. Alt US40 passes through Eckhart Mines, where it intersects MD638, which connects with MD36 north of Frostburg. In the eastern part of Eckhart Mines, the highway intersects MD743, which is an old alignment of US40 which was bypassed by the roadway which became Alt US40.|$|E

5|$|Organised {{water supply}} in the town began at least by 1883 when it was {{reported}} being carted from the millrace. The river's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish. Five years later Thomas Monds installed hydraulic rams and began pumping water from the river to three iron tanks in the town. He on-sold the water to townspeople, though the mill had priority over river water; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey slowed to a trickle. Westbury Council—local government of the time—called for tenders for Carrick's water supply in 1889. This water supply system was completed in 1890. Water was again pumped from the river near the mill, again by hydraulic rams, to a tank near {{the centre of the}} town which supplied another tank on the main road and some houses on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road.</b> Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{survivors}} of the fire, Maureen Krekian, discussed her ordeal in 2007.

25|$|Two miles (3km) from Reston on Leesburg Pike (Route 7) is the Colvin Run Mill, {{operated}} by the Fairfax County Park Authority. It is a working 1811 gristmill that won a first-place restoration award from the American Institute of Architects in 1973. The miller's house, barn, and historic post office/gift shop provide visitors with a glimpse of nineteenth century rural Virginia life. Daily public tours are offered. A few {{miles to the west}} along <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road</b> there is the historic 1820 Dranesville Tavern, also {{operated by}} the park authority and rented out for weddings, parties, and corporate functions.|$|E
25|$|At 6:14am, as {{the police}} were taking details, {{they were told that}} a man had run into a red Peugeot further ahead on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road.</b> The driver saw Duggan move onto the road in front of him. The car swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but the driver said Duggan leapt in front of the car, arms raised and mouth open. The car hit him, denting the {{passenger}} door and shattering the passenger window and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue Golf, which ran over him. He was certified dead at the scene at 6:35am.|$|E

25|$|Riders {{who have}} chosen to do the Maratona course split off from the Middle course {{in the village of}} Cernadoi. The Maratona dles Dolomites {{proceeds}} from there to the village and uncategorised climb of the Colle Santa Lucia, after which the steepest of all climbs begins: the climb to Giau Pass. From Giau Pass the road goes down to Pocol, from where the course rises to the Falzarego Pass. There it reunites with the Middle course and having crossed Valparola Pass follows <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road</b> through San Ćiascian and La Ila to the finish line in Corvara.|$|E
25|$|Turning {{rules are}} by no means universal. For example, in New Zealand (a drive-on-the-left country) between 1977 and 2012, left turning traffic had to give way to {{opposing}} right-turning traffic wishing to take <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road</b> (unless there were multiple lanes, but then one must take care in case a vehicle jumped lanes). New Zealand abolished this particular rule on 25 March 2012, except at roundabouts or when denoted by a Give Way or Stop sign. Although the rule caused initial driver confusion, and many intersections required or still require modification, the change is predicted to eventually prevent one death and 13 serious injuries annually.|$|E
25|$|The town's parish church, {{dedicated}} to St. James is unusual, being octagonal in shape. A story from Cornwall suggests why these churches are rounded, for the villagers of Veryan built several circular houses {{so that the}} Devil had no corners in which to lie in wait for unsuspecting occupants and these buildings were therefore 'Devil-proof.' The church of St Michael the Archangel is in {{the east of the}} town. St. Scholastica's Abbey, on the road to Dawlish, built in 1864 by Henry Woodyer is a notable Gothic Revival building, and the Roman Catholic Church, on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road,</b> is a late work by Joseph Hansom, the inventor of the hansom cab.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the native}} pharaohs, the whole trade of {{southern}} Egypt with the Red Sea passed over these two roads; under the Ptolemies {{as well as}} in Roman and Byzantine times, merchants followed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roads</b> for purposes of barter at the coasts of Zanzibar and in Southern Arabia, India, and the Far East.|$|R

25|$|He {{was born}} in a slum {{district}} in Grenville Street in Dublin's north inner city, the second of twelve surviving children of Patrick Cahill, a lighthouse-keeper, and Agnes Sheehan. By the time he was in school, Martin and his older brother John were stealing food to supplement the family's income. In 1960, the family was moved to Captain's Road, Crumlin, as part of the Dublin slum clearances. Martin was sent to a Christian Brothers School (CBS) on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road</b> where he lived but was soon playing truant and committing frequent burglaries with his brothers. At 15, he attempted to join the Royal Navy, but was rejected, allegedly after offering to break into houses for them and because he had a criminal record.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of Christian churches on the Island. St Gerard's Catholic Church is located on Miller Road. The United Church is {{situated}} in a timber building erected in 1932 a little further along on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road.</b> Also on Miller Road, nearer to Snug Cove, and meeting in Bowen Court, is Bowen Island Community Church, an affiliate of the Congregational Christian Churches in Canada. Lastly, Cates Hill Chapel is a Christian Brethren church founded in 1991. Its present building on Carter Road was opened in 1999. There are also regular meetings held by Unitarians and Quakers. Bowen Island is home to the Canadian branch of L'Abri, a communal Christian retreat centre where visitors come for self-directed study. Finally, Camp Bow-Isle is a summer camp for Christian Scientists.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} style, Hiroshige is {{especially}} noted for using unusual vantage points, seasonal allusions, and striking colors. In particular, he worked extensively {{within the realm}} of meisho-e (名所絵) pictures of famous places. During the Edo period, tourism was also booming, leading to increased popular interest in travel. Travel guides abounded, and towns appeared along routes such as the Tōkaidō, a road that connected Edo with Kyoto. In the midst of this burgeoning travel culture, Hiroshige drew upon his own travels, as well as tales of others’ adventures, for inspiration in creating his landscapes. For example, in The Fifty-three Stations on the Tōkaidō (1833), he illustrates anecdotes from Travels on the Eastern Seaboard (東海道中膝栗毛 Tōkaidōchū Hizakurige, 1802–1809) by Jippensha Ikku, a comedy describing the adventures of two bumbling travelers as they make their way along <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
