5|$|In July, {{four months}} after leaving England, Simpson rode his first race as a professional, the Tour de l'Ouest in west France.

Finally, the segment polarity genes such as engrailed split each of the 7 bands into two, creating 14 future segments.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is played}} using a single, diagonally mounted four-way joystick.

5|$|After {{a period}} of leave, the {{battalion}} began to reform on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland during February 1944 {{and for the next}} eight months they undertook a number of exercises and training periods as they prepared for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>stage</b> of the war. During this time, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to 803 men of all ranks, as the 3rd Division was converted to the Jungle divisional establishment. On 20 July 1944, the 61st Battalion embarked upon HMAT Katoomba in Cairns and proceeded overseas again. They arrived at Madang in New Guinea four days later. As it was considered that there were still isolated pockets of Japanese in the area, the battalion began patrolling operations almost as soon as they had landed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the club}} could not retain the title the {{following}} year, Shearer again ended the (now 38-game) season as Premier League top scorer, with 31goals in 35games, as Blackburn finished {{seventh in the}} league.

Shearer's only goal in six full Champions League games was a penalty in a 4–1 victory against Rosenborg BK in the final fixture and Blackburn finished third in their group, failing to progress to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
