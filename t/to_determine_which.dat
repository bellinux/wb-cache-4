5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved that it was impossible <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on his behalf, also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex. Little is known of two of these men, and it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, the World Championships {{switched}} to a similar format to what was used at the Olympics. Ten teams played series of round-robin format qualifying rounds were played <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> nations participated in the medal round.

5|$|The {{chemical}} analysis that would definitively identify the dyes used in ancient textiles {{has rarely been}} conducted, and even when a dye such as indigo blue is detected it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> of several indigo-bearing plants was used.

5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>which</b> party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
