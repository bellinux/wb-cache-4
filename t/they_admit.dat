5|$|The Jain {{concept of}} Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It {{does not make}} any {{exception}} for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though <b>they</b> <b>admit</b> that plants must be destroyed {{for the sake of}} food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains {{go out of their way}} so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.|$|E

25|$|In {{a series}} of texts {{published}} in the early 1970s, C.R. Kordig asserted a position somewhere between that of Kuhn and the older philosophy of science. His criticism of the Kuhnian position was that the incommensurability thesis was too radical, and that this {{made it impossible to}} explain the confrontation of scientific theories that actually occurs. According to Kordig, it is in fact possible to admit the existence of revolutions and paradigm shifts in science while still recognizing that theories belonging to different paradigms can be compared and confronted on the plane of observation. Those who accept the incommensurability thesis do not do so because <b>they</b> <b>admit</b> the discontinuity of paradigms, but because they attribute a radical change in meanings to such shifts.|$|E
25|$|In April 1687, James {{ordered the}} fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford {{to elect a}} Catholic, Anthony Farmer, as their president. The fellows {{believed}} Farmer ineligible under the college's statutes and so elected John Hough instead. The college statutes required them to fill the vacancy within a certain time and so could not wait for a further royal nomination. James refused to view Hough's election as valid and told the fellows to elect the Bishop of Oxford. James responded by sending some ecclesiastical commissioners to hold a visitation and install him as president. The fellows then agreed to the Bishop of Oxford as their president but James required that <b>they</b> <b>admit</b> {{they had been in}} the wrong and ask for his pardon. When they refused most of the fellows were ejected and replaced by Catholics.|$|E

500|$|Alan Richardson, {{a scholar}} of 18th-century education, points out that if Wollstonecraft had not written A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, it is {{unlikely}} that Thoughts would have been considered progressive or even worthy of notice. One critic has even said that the text reads as if it were simply trying to please the public. Although some scholars have argued that there are glimmers of Wollstonecraft's radicalism in this text, <b>they</b> <b>admit</b> that the [...] "potential for critique remains largely latent". Thoughts is therefore usually interpreted either teleologically, as a first step towards the more radical Rights of Woman, or dismissed as a [...] "politically naïve potboiler" [...] written prior to Wollstonecraft's conversion to radicalism while she was writing the Rights of Men.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Ephron {{wanted to}} call the film How They Met and went through several {{different}} titles.

In order to get into the lonely mindset of Harry when he was divorced and single, Crystal stayed by himself in a separate room from the cast and crew while they were shooting in Manhattan. The script initially ended with Harry and Sally remaining friends and not pursuing a romantic relationship because she felt that was [...] "the true ending", as did Reiner.

In that fantasy, Sam and Diane are happily married elderly couple with children and grandchildren. Moreover, Diane has not finished her novel but assures Sam that she has no regrets and that abandoning her talents does not affect their marriage and her happiness with him.

500|$|The {{prognosis}} for epilepsy due to trauma {{is worse than}} that for epilepsy of undetermined cause.

Compared to people with similar structural brain injuries but without PTE, people with PTE take longer to recover from the injury, have more cognitive and motor problems, and perform worse at everyday tasks. [...] This finding may suggest that PTE is an indicator of a more severe brain injury, rather than a complication that itself worsens outcome. PTE has also been found to be associated with worse social and functional outcomes but not to worsen patients' rehabilitation or ability to return to work. However, people with PTE may have trouble finding employment if <b>they</b> <b>admit</b> to having seizures, especially if their work involves operating heavy machinery.|$|E
500|$|The Confederate {{point of}} view for the battle was much {{different}} from the reports of the Union officers. Confederate General Jones reported [...] "The information I have is that the expedition started from Kanawha 1,200 or 1,300 strong, and that when it reached Fayetteville, on the return, it numbered but 500, only 300 of whom were mounted. The commander (Colonel Toland) and several other officers were killed, the second in command, Colonel Powell, and other officers wounded and captured. <b>They</b> <b>admit</b> a loss of more than 60 killed and wounded; it was probably much greater.

Wharey, who fought as a citizen of Wytheville during the raid, wrote [...] "...there was no telling what damage they would have done. Had Colonel Toland lived, the lead mines, the salt works, and the railroad bridges near Wytheville would have been at their mercy.

Debbie Lundberg wrote in her 2008book Have a Nice Day Is Not Thank You, and No Problem Is Not You're Welcome that service people should say [...] "thank you" [...] instead of [...] "have a nice day". She argued that [...] "thank you" [...] is shorter and is a [...] "recognition of the ability you have to thank someone", which adds more worth to the purchase than something that will occur in the future. Paul V. Marshall, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem, concurred, writing in the Reading Eagle that he prefers [...] "thank you" [...] to [...] "have a nice day" [...] or [...] "have a great day" [...] even though [...] "thank you" [...] has a [...] "host of socially acceptable responses". He stated that when people say [...] "thank you", <b>they</b> <b>admit</b> that they are dependent on others, {{which leads to a}} healthier, safer society.|$|E

500|$|Marceline and her father, Hunson Abadeer, {{have trouble}} {{accepting}} one another. Initially, Marceline feels {{that her father}} does not care for her, and expresses her feelings through the before-mentioned [...] "Fry Song". Although <b>they</b> <b>admit</b> to loving each other, Abadeer constantly pressures Marceline {{to follow in the}} family business and take over ruling the Nightosphere, a prospective job Marceline does not want. Marceline and the Ice King also have a complicated relationship. In the episode [...] "I Remember You", it is revealed that the Ice King—then, the human man named Simon Petrikov—discovered her crying in the ruins of a city destroyed by the Mushroom Wars. It was Simon who gave little Marceline Hambo and attempted to watch over her. This kind gesture made the Ice King a long-time close friend and father figure to Marceline. However, as the crown's power increased, Simon began to forget more and more about his relationship with Marceline, until he had all but forgotten their friendship. Former storyboard artist and current supervising director for the series Adam Muto explained that Marceline and the Ice King's history {{was not part of the}} series' initial plan, but something that [...] "evolved from [...] original course and it will likely continue to evolve in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1914, Ferrari {{started work}} at the {{obstetrics}} clinic of the Hospital Ramos Mejía of Buenos Aires. [...] She applied to teach obstetrics at the university but was turned down. In {{the proceedings of the}} Honorable Consejo Directivo (HCD) on 23 June 1915, it was stated: [...] "Despite their qualifications, for physiological and psychological reasons people of the feminine sex do not meet the required conditions to be engaged as professors in the Faculty [...] ". The following year, she was permitted to teach at the School of Midwifery, but this lacked the prestige and credentials of a professorship at the university. When an opening for an alternate professorship appeared in 1919, Ferrari reapplied to the university but was met with resistance. The members of the HCD delayed calling together the jurors to fill the vacancy until 1925, altering evidence, ignoring recommendations, and evading a decision. In 1926, she sent a detailed outline of her accomplishments to the committee, stating that she had taught in secondary schools for 20 years and had dedicated 15 years to her field of medicine, and had enrolled in university courses for nine years. One adviser, Dr. Speroni, having read her qualifications, sent a message to the dean imploring that <b>they</b> <b>admit</b> her, on the grounds that she was qualified, had shown dedication and the school was understaffed. It was not until 1927, that the jurors met and her application for an alternate professorship was approved by a vote of thirteen to two. The news of the first female university professor in Latin America made headlines throughout Spanish-speaking countries. Newspapers in Argentina including La Prensa, La Nación, La Razón and others of the capital, El Censor in Gualeguaychú, Los Andes in Mendoza, Buenos Aires Sud in Florencio Varela, and the Italian La Patria degli Italiani and [...] Spanish El Diario Español carried stories of her triumph.|$|E
