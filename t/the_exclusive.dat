5|$|Rule 90 and Rule 102 {{are called}} {{additive}} cellular automata. This means that, if two initial states are combined by computing <b>the</b> <b>exclusive</b> or of each their states, then their subsequent configurations will be combined {{in the same}} way. More generally, one can partition any configuration of Rule 90 into two subsets with disjoint nonzero cells, evolve the two subsets separately, and compute each successive configuration of the original automaton as <b>the</b> <b>exclusive</b> or of the configurations on the same time steps of the two subsets.|$|E
5|$|There are no nontrivial {{reversible}} elementary cellular automata. However, a near-miss {{is provided}} by Rule 90 and other elementary cellular automata based on <b>the</b> <b>exclusive</b> or function. In Rule 90, the state of each cell is <b>the</b> <b>exclusive</b> or of the previous states of its two neighbors. This use of <b>the</b> <b>exclusive</b> or makes the transition rule locally invertible, {{in the sense that}} any contiguous subsequence of states can be generated by this rule. Rule 90 is not a reversible cellular automaton rule, because in Rule 90 every assignment of states to the complete array of cells has exactly four possible predecessors, whereas reversible rules are required to have exactly one predecessor per configuration.|$|E
