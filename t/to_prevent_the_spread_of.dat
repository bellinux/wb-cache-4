5|$|Though they {{maintained}} a formal neutrality policy {{in regards to}} religion, the French colonial administration began to regulate Islamic education in the early 1900s. In addition, fear of a pan-Islamism political rise throughout North Africa and the Sahel led the French to adopt policies that aimed <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> Islam beyond where it already existed and to prevent Muslim leaders from governing non-Muslim communities. Indigenous religions and Christianity existed under less formal policies, and French efforts often used these to balance the spread of Islam in the region.|$|E
5|$|By the {{day after}} Hurricane Lane made landfall, most of the {{evacuated}} people returned to their homes to begin the cleanup process. Some tourists who remained {{in the area for}} the storm continued their vacations, while others tried to leave the area. The federal government {{declared a state of emergency}} for nine municipalities in Sinaloa, allowing emergency funds to give relief support to the affected population. Helicopters were used to distribute foods and locate cut-off residents. The government set up three temporary shelters in Mazatlán for 360people and three shelters in Culiacán for about 1,000affected residents. <b>To</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> Dengue fever, officials sent epidemiologists to 67communities, with 18mobile units and 15Nebulizer units.

5|$|Elmer {{recounts the}} initial violent {{backlash}} by humanity and how Ben hid {{the three of}} them from groups out to kill chickens. This is followed by retaliation against humans by chickens, chicken-rights groups, and eventually recognition of chickens as humans by the United Nations. During this time, Elmer becomes a syndicated columnist in a newspaper and writes about chicken-related topics, both light-hearted and serious. The peace between humans and chickens is disrupted in the late 1980s by an outbreak of bird flu. Millions of healthy chickens are killed by humans <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the disease, and Ben hides Elmer and Helen again. When others come for them, Ben intervenes and is accidentally shot protecting Elmer. Once the flu is contained, humanity expresses regret for its rash actions and Elmer writes a scathing editorial about the panic. His journal entries become less frequent after he and Helen have children.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{from the}} {{hurricane}} was severe and widespread. Initially forecast to remain offshore, the system curved northeast and moved ashore, {{becoming one of}} Mexico's worst natural disasters at the time. Up to 150 boats were submerged. Countless homes in Colima and Jalisco were damaged or destroyed, large portions of the states were inaccessible by flash flooding, and hundreds of residents were stranded. All coconut plantations were blown down during the storm, leaving thousands without work and instating fear {{that it would take}} the economy years to recover. Torrential rainfall across mountain terrain contributed to numerous mudslides that caused hundreds of fatalities. In the aftermath of the cyclone, convoys delivering aid were hindered by the destruction. Residents were vaccinated <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease. Overall, the hurricane inflicted at least $280 million (1959 USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Europe, {{any effort}} to halt {{pregnancy}} was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church, although {{it is believed that}} women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina. Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy. The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640. They were made of animal gut, and were most likely used <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War. Casanova, living in 18th century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The US {{provided}} emergency food, medical care, {{clothing and}} shelter at reception centres in Saigon {{and elsewhere in}} the south. American sources donating through the United States Operations Mission (USOM) were responsible for 97% of the aid. The USOM sent public health professionals to help with sanitation in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease. Doctors and nurses were sent to help train local workers in healthcare procedures, so that they would eventually be {{able to take care of}} the medical needs refugees. In order of contributions to the aid efforts, the US were followed by France, United Kingdom, Australia, West Germany, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Australian sent farming equipment and accompanying technical instructors under the Colombo Plan.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, plants lack {{phagocytic}} cells, {{but many}} plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant. Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When {{a part of}} a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the disease {{to other parts of the}} plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Fanele {{struck the}} country during a series of {{government}} protests, and consequently the national government provided little response to the storm. Instead, United Nations (UN) agencies quickly provided relief to affected citizens. The World Food Programme prepared 87metric tons (MT) of cereal and 13MT of various types of pulses. Five United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) trucks arrived in Morondova on January25 with various supplies. In {{the days after the}} storm, contaminated floodwaters resulted in cases of dysentery. <b>To</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease, UNICEF provided vaccines, de-worming tablets, and water cleaning devices. Within three days of the storm's landfall, the agency also began distributing health kits and bed nets. As many schools were affected, UNICEF set up temporary classrooms in tents, while workers began fixing and cleaning the damaged buildings. Despite the quick response by the UN, thousands of people were left without aid. The Malagasy Red Cross deployed its volunteers to affected areas, although disrupted transportation services and the political situation hindered relief efforts.|$|E

5|$|In {{mainland}} China, officials used {{helicopters to}} airdrop relief goods to Guangdong. By {{three days after}} the storm, workers distributed 2,000tents and 1,000beds. Once the floodwaters dropped, residents returned their homes to clean up the mud and damage. Farm officials in Guangdong used 50tons of disinfectant <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease, while the provincial government allocated ¥240million (CNY, US$35million) for rebuilding. About 1,000soldiers worked to clean debris and animal carcasses from the reservoir providing drinking water to Maoming. The collapsed dam in Guangdong was later torn down due to being structurally deficient. Zijin Mining, the owner of the dam, had to sell a mine to pay for compensation and fines related to the incident, which ultimately totaled ¥245million (CNY, US$38.7million). After the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided ¥1million (CNY, US$148,000) to localities affected hardest by the storm, as well as distributing mosquito nets, water purifiers, food, and clothing.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, Tampico {{was left}} without power or communications. About 15,000people became {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter. Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without power or telephone. Communications were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio. The rail line from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later. Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children. The Mexican government flew medical supplies, food, and clothing from Mexico City to Tampico, while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River. About 10days after Hilda struck Tampico, Hurricane Janet affected the same area, causing further damage and deaths. Collectively, the two hurricanes caused 1,240deaths along their paths, and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico's 1955 national budget. After the two hurricanes, the Mexican government and military worked to assist the affected residents, and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and medical assistance <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|The twin {{impacts of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel {{prompted}} officials in Mexico {{to declare a}} state of emergency in 155municipalities in Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chihuahua. The nation's Health Ministry sent medical crews across the country to affected areas in an effort <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease; the agency also suggested residents boil their water. Officials opened shelters in Tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged, housing about 2,000people in the weeks following the storm. The Mexican food bank sent about 800tons of food to the hardest-hit parts of the country in Guerrero, Veracruz, and Sinaloa. In addition, the Mexican Red Cross delivered 186tons of food to Veracruz alone. Volunteers delivered about 600blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of Pánuco. Following the storms, the National Civil Protection Coordination received the authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding; the law had passed in 2012, but initially lacked the authority to enforce it. Some residents in Tamaulipas complained at the slow pace of receiving aid. In response, the Gulf Cartel brought relief items to Aldama, with one columnist for El Universal suggesting that this was to gain favor with local residents.|$|E
