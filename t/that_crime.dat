5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Big Boo and Doggett's {{friendship}} continues to develop. Seeing that Doggett bears strong {{feelings of guilt}} relating to the six abortions that she has had, Big Boo makes reference to the book Freakonomics, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>crime</b> rates in the 1990s fell because of Roe v. Wade. Following Lorna Morello (played by Yael Stone) being relieved of her duty of driving the prison van, the role is given to Doggett. She comes into contact {{with one of the}} new correctional officers called Charlie Coates (played by James McMenamin). Coates is initially friendly towards Doggett. Despite relationships between prison staff and prisoners being forbidden, Coates kisses Doggett, against her will, after feeding some ducks. Following another outing, Coates gets in trouble with his boss Joe Caputo (played by Nick Sandow) for being late for count and is placed on probation. Doggett apologises for having caused him trouble, and he rapes her {{in the back of the}} prison van.|$|E
5|$|Although the Igor Gouzenko and Elizabeth Bentley affairs {{had raised}} the issue of Soviet espionage as far back as 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply {{increased}} the sense of threat from Communism in the United States. The Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected. That same year, Mao Zedong's Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing Kuomintang. In 1950, the Korean War began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China. The following year also saw several significant developments regarding Soviet Cold War espionage activities. In January 1950, Alger Hiss, a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run out for <b>that</b> <b>crime,</b> but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Great Britain, Klaus Fuchs confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during the War. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 on charges of stealing atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.|$|E

5000|$|Research {{shows that}} fears of {{increasing}} crime {{is often the}} cause of moral panics. Recent studies have shown <b>that</b> despite declining <b>crime</b> rates, this phenomenon, which often taps into a populations' [...] "herd mentality," [...] continues to occur in various cultures. Japanese jurist Koichi Hamai explains how the changes in crime recording in Japan since the 1990s caused people to believe <b>that</b> the <b>crime</b> rate is rising and <b>that</b> <b>crimes</b> were getting increasingly severe.|$|R

25|$|Neither Pliny nor Trajan {{mentions}} {{the crime that}} Christians had committed, except for being a Christian; and other historical sources do not provide a simple answer to what <b>that</b> <b>crime</b> could be, but a likely element may be the stubborn refusal of Christians to worship Roman gods; making them appear as objecting to Roman rule.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{genocide}} and war crimes, {{which have been}} widely recognized and prohibited in international criminal law since {{the establishment of the}} Nuremberg principles, {{there has never been a}} comprehensive convention on crimes against humanity, even though such crimes are continuously perpetrated worldwide in numerous conflicts and crises. There are eleven international texts defining crimes against humanity, but they all differ slightly as to their definition of <b>that</b> <b>crime</b> and its legal elements.|$|E

The initiative was claimed a success when gang-related violence declined almost 90% {{from the start of}} the program to November 2006.|$|E

By 2005, their numbers were estimated at nearly 100 out of a total population of just over 2,000. This has been called 'the land <b>that</b> <b>crime</b> forgot'.|$|E
25|$|The {{main idea}} behind neurocriminology is <b>that</b> <b>crime</b> is only {{partially}} {{a social and}} environmental problem, and biological factors along with medical conditions play a significant role.

Neurocriminology has become mainstream during the past two decades, since contemporary biocriminologists focus almost exclusively on brain due to significant advances in neuroscience. Even though neurocriminology is still at odds with traditional sociological theories of crime, it is becoming more popular in the scientific community.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} suggest <b>that</b> <b>crime</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} concerns in slums. Empirical data suggest crime rates are higher in some slums than in non-slums, with slum homicides alone reducing life expectancy of a resident in a Brazil slum by 7 years than for a resident in nearby non-slum. In some countries like Venezuela, officials have sent in the military to control slum criminal violence involved with drugs and weapons. Rape is another serious issue related to crime in slums. In Nairobi slums, for example, one fourth of all teenage girls are raped each year.|$|E
