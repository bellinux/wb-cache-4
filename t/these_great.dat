5|$|In 1880, Wallace {{published}} the book Island Life as {{a sequel to}} The Geographical Distribution of Animals. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently {{been part of a}} continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like Madagascar) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the lemurs of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased glaciation, may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of <b>these</b> <b>great</b> ice ages. Island Life was considered a very important work {{at the time of its}} publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} maximum population in the millions. The great auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its down feathers from at least the eighth century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives may be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America, as well as from early fifth century Labrador, where the bird seems to have occurred only as stragglers. Early explorers, including Jacques Cartier, and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island were not provisioned with food for the journey home, and therefore, used this vulnerable species as both a convenient food source and bait for fishing. Reportedly, some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony and ran out planks to the land. The sailors then herded hundreds of <b>these</b> <b>great</b> auks onto the ships, where they were slaughtered. Some authors have questioned the reports of this hunting method and whether it was successful. Great auk eggs were also a valued food source, as the eggs were {{three times the size of}} a murre's and had a large yolk. These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands, that preyed upon nests.|$|E
5|$|When the Song dynasty was founded, the {{political}} elites consisted of officials (and their sons) {{who had served}} in the Five Dynasties era, {{as well as those who}} came from prominent families which boasted an aristocratic ancestry and had provided officials for generations. Since the first Song emperors wished to avoid domination of government by military strongmen such as the jiedushi of the previous era, they limited the power of military officers and focused on building a powerful civilian establishment. During the 11th century, the expansion of schools and local academies nurtured a nationwide gentry class which provided most if not all officials. By the late 11th century, the elite marriage strategies of prominent families eroded due to the intense partisan politics surrounding the New Policies (新法; xin fa) of Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086). <b>These</b> <b>great</b> families were replaced by officials representing diverse local gentry lineages throughout the country.|$|E

30|$|The greater {{reduction}} in maxillomandibular relationship in group 1 may be consequent {{to the greater}} number of extractions in the maxillary arch, and increased need for class II elastics or headgear, to reinforce anchorage, that consequently produced a non-significantly greater maxillary retraction [21 – 23], Table  4. Group 1 also had a non-significantly greater increase in mandibular growth. <b>These</b> non-significant <b>greater</b> changes in group 1, when associated, might have contributed for a significantly {{greater reduction}} in maxillomandibular relationship than group 2. Additionally, <b>these</b> associated <b>greater</b> non-significant changes might have also contributed for a greater reduction in skeletal facial convexity in group 1. However, <b>these</b> <b>greater</b> treatment changes of group 1 were not enough to produce intergroup differences at the posttreatment stage (Table  5).|$|R

25|$|There is {{no doubt}} that <b>these</b> <b>great</b> tombs, far more {{impressive}} than would be required of mere repositories for bones, were the centres of ritual activity in the early Neolithic: they were shrines as well as mausoleums.

25|$|Another {{consideration}} was education. Before {{the late}} 1950s and {{the advent of}} the stately home business, very few working-class people had seen the upstairs of <b>these</b> <b>great</b> houses; those that had were there only to clean and serve, with an obligation to keep their eyes down, rather than uplift them and be educated. Thus ignorance of the nation's heritage was a large contributory factor to the indifference that met the destruction.|$|E

25|$|Khosrow's tax {{reforms have}} been praised by several scholars, {{the most notable}} of whom is F. Altheim. The tax reforms, which were started under Kavadh I and {{completely}} implemented by Khosrow, strengthened the royal court by a great deal. Prior to Khosrow and Kavadh's reigns, {{a majority of the}} land was owned by seven Parthian families: Suren, Waraz, Karen, Ispahbudhan, Spandiyadh, Mihran, and Zik. <b>These</b> <b>great</b> landowners enjoyed tax exemptions from the Sasanian empire, and were tax collectors within their local provincial areas.|$|E

25|$|Christ's {{ministers in}} the church are {{stewards}} in the household of God and shepherds of his flock. Some are called and ordained to this occupation as presbyters or deacons.

50|$|To {{ensure that}} the pillars are capable of dealing with <b>these</b> <b>greater</b> forces {{resulting}} from the uneven lengths of spans, the fifth and ninth pillars were built with two parallel walls instead of the ordinary designs used on the other pillars.

In four months of flying. CVG-11 lost over 50 aircraft and had more than 60 men killed, missing-in-action or wounded. Air Group Eleven was replaced by Air Group Seventeen on 1 February 1945. They arrived back in Alameda on 24 February 1945. For these operations, CVG-11 was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E
25|$|Italy {{also became}} a seat of great formal {{learning}} in 1088 {{with the establishment of}} the University of Bologna, the first university in the Western World. Many other Italian universities soon followed. For example, the Schola Medica Salernitana, in southern Italy, was the first medical school in Europe. <b>These</b> <b>great</b> centres of learning presaged the Rinascimento: the European Renaissance began in Italy and was fueled throughout Europe by Italian painters, sculptors, architects, scientists, literature masters and music composers. Italy continued its leading cultural role through the Baroque period and into the Romantic period, when its dominance in painting and sculpture diminished but the Italians re-established a strong presence in music.|$|E
25|$|Yuuyaraq {{defined the}} correct way of {{thinking}} and speaking about all living things, especially the great sea and land mammals on which the Yup'ik relied for food, clothing, shelter, tools, kayaks, and other essentials. <b>These</b> <b>great</b> creatures were sensitive; they were believed able to understand human conversations, and they demanded and received respect. Yuuyaraq prescribed the correct method of hunting and fishing, and {{the correct way}} of handling all fish and game caught by the hunter in order to honor and appease the spirits and maintain a harmonious relationship with the fish and game. Although unwritten, this way {{can be compared to}} Mosaic law because it governed all aspects of a human being's life.|$|E
60|$|Again, in {{the splendid}} power of realisation, which <b>these</b> <b>greatest</b> of artists had reached, {{there was the}} latent {{possibility}} of amusement by deception, and of excitement by sensualism.
