5|$|AMI Stadium was {{significantly}} damaged during the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, with cracks in some stands and <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> surface badly damaged by liquefaction {{as well as}} damage to infrastructure and streets surrounding the venue.

Although the stands at that venue were damaged severely enough that they had to be torn down, infrastructure damage was much less severe than at AMI Stadium, and <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> surface survived relatively intact. The stadium was rebuilt with a permanent capacity of 17,000, with temporary seating allowing for 9,000 more spectators.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>PLAY</b> {{is not a}} game. <b>The</b> <b>PLAY</b> overreaches and connects {{all aspects}} of all games if possible. <b>The</b> <b>PLAY</b> as {{phenomenon}} is existential issue that accompany mankind from its beginnings. Similar to work, fight, love and death (mortality), <b>the</b> <b>PLAY</b> shows men <b>the</b> condition or the frame of their existence. <b>The</b> <b>PLAY</b> is a principle.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> is most {{noted for}} the {{reaction}} of the local authorities following <b>the</b> <b>play's</b> one performance at Toronto's Standard Theatre on December 4, 1933.

5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into a medicine bottle representing <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Each period, {{and after}} each goal scored, play is {{restarted}} with a face-off. If a ball travels {{over the boards}} and outside of <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> area, play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> {{was not as}} {{successful}} as Fielding's Tom Thumb, which ran alongside Rape upon Rape. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> allowed Fielding to express his political views through comedy. Critics have both praised and critiqued <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> but they generally agree that the humour is unsuitable because it is [...] "indelicate". Attempted adaptations of <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> including a musical and a film named after <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> have also been relatively unsuccessful.|$|R
5000|$|Still the censor did {{not approve}} <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> Lermontov then {{undertook}} a major redaction of <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> including a title change from [...] "Masquerade" [...] to [...] "Arbenin". But even in this crippled form, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> did not satisfy the censor, and <b>the</b> <b>play</b> was not produced in Lermontov's lifetime.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> {{was well}} {{received}} {{and was one}} of <b>the</b> most successful <b>plays</b> off-Broadway during <b>the</b> 1968-1969 season. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> is still anthologized and performed around the world.

5|$|If a ball travels {{outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> area, play is {{restarted}} by possession being {{awarded to the}} opponents of the team which last touched the ball, unless the ball goes out of bounds due to a shot or a deflected shot. In that case, possession is awarded to the player that is closest to the ball when it leaves <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> area.|$|E
5|$|Indoor netball is a {{variation}} of netball, played exclusively indoors, in which <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> court is surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net prevents the ball from leaving the court, permitting faster play by reducing playing stoppages.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> was {{successful}} and was performed 15 times during January.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} {{on some of the}} rhetorical aspects of tragedy in order to provide a metatheatrical reading of Seneca’s Medea. To do so, it {{analyzes}} the character of Medea as <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> role of the poet’s alter ego. This analysis makes the division of the plot in two levels possible: on the one hand, there is <b>the</b> <b>play</b> of <b>the</b> poet, i. e. the Medea of Seneca; on the other, there is <b>the</b> <b>play</b> of Medea within <b>the</b> <b>play</b> of Seneca, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>play</b> within <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> This approach should offer the reader some meaningful reflections on the rhetorical nature of <b>the</b> <b>play...</b>|$|R
5|$|Kelly pool {{has long}} been {{associated}} with gambling—so much so, that it was made illegal in some municipalities in the US and Canada. In the state of Montana, for example, <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> of kelly pool was punishable by a $25 fine until the law was repealed in 1964. Likewise, <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> of kelly pool was banned in the Canadian province of Manitoba at least as of 1918. Gambling exploits associated with kelly pool were often depicted in Clare Briggs' comic strip of the same name, which centered on the game. The Kelly Pool strip (panel pictured at right), ran in the New York Tribune's sports section from 1912 to 1917.|$|E

5000|$|However, most of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> isn’t much {{spectacle}} at all. Mostly it {{chronicles the}} everyday {{lives of the}} residents of the boardinghouse.
