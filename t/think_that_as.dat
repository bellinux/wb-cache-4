25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
25|$|Commodity ETFs trade {{just like}} shares, are simple and {{efficient}} and provide exposure to an ever-increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, softs and agriculture. However, {{it is important}} for an investor to realize that there are often other factors that affect the price of a commodity ETF that might not be immediately apparent. For example, buyers of an oil ETF such as USO might <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> long as oil goes up, they will profit roughly linearly. What isn't clear to the novice investor is the method by which these funds gain exposure to their underlying commodities. In the case of many commodity funds, they simply roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This does give exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the term structure, such as a high cost to roll.|$|E
500|$|After {{an alleged}} 2009 Hezbollah plot in Egypt, the Egyptian regime of Hosni Mubarak officially {{classified}} Hezbollah {{as a terrorist}} group. Following the 2012 Presidential elections the new government recognized Hezbollah as a [...] "real political and military force" [...] in Lebanon. The Egyptian ambassador to Lebanon, Ashraf Hamdy, stated that [...] "Resistance {{in the sense of}} defending Lebanese territory... That's their primary role. We... <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a resistance movement they have done a good job to keep on defending Lebanese territory and trying to regain land occupied by Israel is legal and legitimate." ...|$|E

500|$|Strapping Young Lad {{began working}} on their next album, Alien, in March 2004. Feeling that the band's {{previous}} album did {{not live up to}} expectations, Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme. To prepare for the new album, Townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> an artist, in order for me to get to the next plateau, I kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy," [...] he explains. [...] "And Alien was no exception with that." [...] Although Townsend considered the album an [...] "impenetrable mass of technicality", it was well received on its release, selling 3,697 copies in its first week and appearing on several Billboard charts. Around this time, Townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game [...]|$|E
500|$|In May 1999, Nicolas Anelka stated {{his desire}} to leave Arsenal and cited the English media {{as a reason for}} wanting to leave the club as they caused him [...] "enormous {{problems}} on a personal level". Lazio was interested in signing the player, but the Italian club refused to pay Arsenal's asking price of £23million. After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka, a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club, the next day. Arsenal sought to strengthen the squad's attacking options first by signing Davor Šuker from Real Madrid; the player was prepared to take a pay cut to join the club. The club then signed Juventus forward Thierry Henry for a club record fee of £11million. Wenger, who served as the player's protégé at Monaco, believed his best position was as a goalscorer: [...] "He was the top scorer in the Under-17s for France when I first had him and I <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> well as having the qualities of youth, pace and power, he is a good finisher. That is something he has not worked on enough {{in the last two years}} because he has played more wide, but I think he can become a central striker again. That is what we will try to develop together." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{incident}} in 1901 {{had a major}} impact on Barrymore. In March, his father had a mental breakdown as a result of tertiary syphilis, and Barrymore took him to Bellevue hospital. He was later transferred to a private institution in Amityville, Long Island, where he suffered a [...] "rapid descent into madness". The Encyclopedia of World Biography states that Barrymore was constantly [...] "haunted by the bright and dark spell of his father", and his close friend Gene Fowler reported that [...] "the bleak overtone of this breaking of his parent's reason never quite died away in Barrymore's mind, and he was haunted by fears he would suffer the same fate". The same year, Barrymore began an affair with a beautiful artists' model, [...] "Florodora girl" [...] and aspiring actress named Evelyn Nesbit, who was a mistress of architect Stanford White. Barrymore later described Nesbit as [...] "the most maddening woman.... She was the first woman I ever loved", and he proposed marriage to her. Nesbit's mother did not <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> a struggling artist, Barrymore was a good match for her daughter. To break off their relationship her mother sent Nesbit away to school in New Jersey. In 1906, White was shot in public by Nesbit's then-husband, Pittsburgh millionaire Harry K. Thaw. Barrymore expected to testify at Thaw's murder trial on the issue of Nesbit's morality; he worried that he might be asked whether he had arranged for Nesbit to have an abortion, disguised as an appendectomy, even though Nesbit had undergone two previous [...] "appendectomies". Barrymore was never called as a witness because Thaw pleaded {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity.|$|E

He {{looked up at}} her with a lack-lustre eye, and said, [...] "Godolphin is jealous of Salome now. What he really wants is a five-act {{monologue}} that will keep him on the stage all the time. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> it is, she will take all the attention from him." ...|$|R

Everybody listens to music and knows about it. I think that the lyrics can {{have a lot to}} do with influencing whoever you're singing to. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> far as children are concerned, parents should have control over what they listen to. If they don't want them to listen to records that are very sexual or explicit or outrageous, they should have control over that situation. As for adults, they're going to buy whatever kind of music they want to hear, so if they buy music with explicit lyrics, they must like it." ...|$|E
