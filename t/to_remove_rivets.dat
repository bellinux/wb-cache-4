50|$|Such riveted {{structures}} may be {{insufficient to}} resist seismic loading from earthquakes if the structure was not engineered for such forces, {{a common problem}} of older steel bridges. This is because a hot rivet cannot be properly heat treated to add strength and hardness. In the seismic retrofit of such structures it is common practice <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> critical <b>rivets</b> with an oxygen torch, precision ream the hole, then insert a machined and heat treated bolt.|$|R
40|$|Drill-press jig used <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> {{improperly}} installed <b>rivets.</b> Drillpress jig {{makes possible}} to drill accurately-centered, straight holes through rivets. Key component of jig is a drill bushing with spherical recess machined into base. Contour of recess matches contour of rivet head. Operator holds jig handle {{with one hand}} and controls drill with other. Handle and screw head hold drill bit in place over center of rivet so rivet drilled out through its axis. With <b>rivet</b> <b>removed,</b> parts separated and refastened or reused elsewhere...|$|R
5|$|Competitive video gamers and referees {{stress the}} game's {{high level of}} {{difficulty}} compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience {{and the ability to}} accurately time Mario's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging <b>to</b> Pauline); <b>removing</b> <b>rivets</b> from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in DIP switches. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|R
60|$|Returning to the slaves, who {{had been}} left {{standing}} where they were first stopped, {{in a state of}} great surprise and perplexity, he assisted his companions in freeing them. This was easy enough in regard to the women and children, but the gorees on the men were very difficult <b>to</b> <b>remove.</b> Being <b>riveted,</b> as we have said, it became necessary to split the forks with hatchets, an operation which endangered the heads of the poor captives and hurt their galled necks considerably. It was accomplished however {{in the midst of a}} deal of excitement and hurried conversation, while Jumbo and his comrades kindled fires, and Harold bade the women cook the meal--which they had hitherto carried--for themselves and their children. They seemed to consider this too good news to be true, but on being encouraged, began with alacrity.|$|R
60|$|This was my scheme, and my {{reasons were}} good; I was really alienated {{from him in}} the {{consequences}} of these things; indeed, I mortally hated him as a husband, and it was impossible <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> that <b>riveted</b> aversion I had to him. At the same time, it being an unlawful, incestuous living, added to that aversion, and though I had no great concern about it in point of conscience, yet everything added to make cohabiting with him the most nauseous thing {{to me in the}} world; and I think verily it was come to such a height, that I could almost as willingly have embraced a dog as have let him offer anything of that kind to me, for which reason I could not bear the thoughts of coming between the sheets with him. I cannot say that I was right in point of policy in carrying it such a length, {{while at the same time}} I did not resolve to discover the thing to him; but I am giving an account of what was, not of what ought or ought not to be.|$|R
5000|$|At {{a central}} {{location}} near the areas being riveted, a furnace was set up. Rivets {{were placed in}} the furnace and heated to glowing hot (often to white hot) so that they were more plastic and easily deformed. The rivet warmer or [...] "cook" [...] used tongs <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> individual <b>rivets</b> and throw them to a catcher stationed near the joints to be riveted. The catcher (usually) caught the rivet in a leather or wooden bucket with an ash-lined bottom. He placed the rivet into the hole to be riveted, then quickly turned to catch the next rivet. The [...] "holder up or holder on" [...] would hold a heavy rivet set or dolly or another (larger) pneumatic jack against the round head of the rivet, while the riveter (sometimes two riveters) applied a hammer or pneumatic rivet hammer to the unformed head, making it mushroom tightly against the joint in its final domed shape. Alternatively the buck is hammered more or less flush with the structure in a counter sunk hole. Before the use of pneumatic hammers, e.g. in the construction of RMS Titanic, the man who hammered the rivet was known as the [...] "basher". Upon cooling, the rivet contracted and exerted further force, tightening the joint.|$|R
50|$|The swish has {{a higher}} tone than the pang and is washier with a less {{pronounced}} ping, and this difference is accentuated as the swish is generally sold with rivets as a sizzle cymbal, while the pang is sold without rivets. However some drummers <b>remove</b> the <b>rivets</b> from a swish, or add them to a pang, to create intermediate sounds.|$|R
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into four {{different}} single-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final stage occurs at 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong. Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The final stage involves Mario <b>removing</b> eight <b>rivets</b> which support Donkey Kong. <b>Removing</b> the final <b>rivet</b> causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero {{to be reunited with}} Pauline. These four stages combine to form a level.|$|R
40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{conducted}} in the NACA 8 -foot high-speed wind tunnel {{to determine the effect}} of exposed rivet heads and spot welds on wing drag. Most of the tests were made with an airfoil of 5 -foot chord. The air speed was varied from 80 to 500 miles per hour and the lift coefficient from 0 to 0. 30. The increases in the drag of the 5 -foot airfoil varied from 6 %, due to countersunk rivets, to 27 %, due to 3 / 32 -inch brazier-head rivets, with the rivets in a representative arrangement. The drag increases caused by protruding rivet heads were roughly proportional to the height of the heads. With the front row of rivets well forward, changes in spanwise pitch had negligible effects on drag unless the pitch was more than 2. 5 % of the chord. Data are presented for evaluating the drag reduction attained by <b>removing</b> <b>rivets</b> from the forward part of the wing surface; for example, it is shown that over 70 % of the rivet drag is caused by the rivets on the forward 30 % of the airfoil in a typical case...|$|R
