5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or {{can be seen}} as a thinly veiled autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in The Diary of a Seducer treats <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail. Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard's life.|$|E
25|$|The long {{instrumental}} {{is indicative}} of the theme of the music video where the protagonist is serenading his guitar as <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affection.|$|E
25|$|Pepé {{describes}} Penelope {{as lucky}} to be <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affections, and uses a romantic paradigm to explain his failures to seduce her. For example, he describes a hammer blow to his head {{as a form of}} flirtation rather than rejection. Accordingly, he shows no sign of narcissistic injury or loss of confidence {{no matter how many times}} he is rebuffed.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} understand, it is immensely {{important}} {{for the person who}} understands to be located outside <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> or her creative understanding—in time, in space, in culture. For one cannot even really see one's own exterior and comprehend it as a whole, and no mirrors or photographs can help; our real exterior can be seen and understood only by other people, because they are located outside us in space, and because they are others.|$|E
25|$|In Wall, Tristan {{sees the}} star fall and vows to {{retrieve}} it for <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. Tristan learns that his mother is from beyond the wall, and receives a Babylon candle that she had left for him, which instantly takes the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, personified as a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He promptly chains her {{to take her home}} to Victoria.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the book}} loosely follows the {{original}} Phantom of the Opera novel - differing on several points but following the relationship between Erik and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> desire, Christine Daae, and switching {{back and forth between}} their points of view. The relationship between Christine and Erik is explored in greater detail and with greater compassion than the original novel, allowing Erik to finally find love and redemption in a world that has shown him nothing but cruelty since birth.|$|E

25|$|In 1888, August Köhler {{graduated}} with a teaching degree and subsequently taught at gymnasiums in Darmstadt and Bingen before going back to university. He started his academic career as a student, instructor and assistant to professor J.W. Spengel at the Zoological Institute at the University of Giessen, Germany. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctorate thesis was the taxonomy of limpets, a project that depended heavily on microscopic imaging and prompted Köhler into trying {{to improve the quality}} of images taken via photomicrography. The result of this work was published in 1893.|$|E
25|$|Invited (on Ocampo's initiative) by the Amigos del Arte {{society of}} Buenos Aires, Fondane left for Argentina and Uruguay in summer 1929. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> visit was {{promoting}} French cinema {{with a set}} of lectures in Buenos Aires, Montevideo and other cities (as he later stated in a Rampa interview with Sarina Cassvan-Pas, he introduced South Americans to the work of Germaine Dulac, Luis Buñuel and Henri Gad). In this context, Fondane met essayist Eduardo Mallea, who invited him to contribute in La Nacións literary supplement. His other activities there included conferencing on Shestov at the University of Buenos Aires and publishing articles on several subjects (from Shestov's philosophy to the poems of Tzara), but the fees received in return were, in his own account, too small {{to cover the cost of}} decent living.|$|E
25|$|Shaftesbury {{was nearly}} forty before he married, {{and even then}} {{he appears to have}} taken this step at the urgent {{instigation}} of his friends, mainly to supply a successor to the title. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> choice (or rather of his second choice, for an earlier project of marriage had shortly before fallen through) was Jane Ewer, the daughter of a Hertfordshire gentleman. The marriage took place in the autumn of 1709, and on 9 February 1711, was born at his house at Reigate, in Surrey, his only child and heir, the fourth Earl, to whose manuscript accounts we are in great part indebted for the details of his father's life. The match appears to have been happy, though Shaftesbury had little sentiment on the subject of married life.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1583 Paget {{travelled}} from Rouen secretly into England, using the pseudonym Mope. It is alleged that <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> journey was to concert measures for an invasion by the Duke of Guise and the King of Scots. For a time he hid {{in the house of}} William Davies, at Patching, Sussex. On 8 September he had an interview at Petworth with Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland. He was afterwards secretly conveyed to a lodge in the Earl's park called Conigar Lodge, where he stayed for about eight days. His brother, Thomas, was also summoned to Petworth. On 16 September Paget met in a wood, called Patching Copse, with William Shelley, who was subsequently convicted of treason. Paget likely also met at this time with Lord Henry Howard, who had come to Sussex from Norfolk.|$|E
25|$|Mr and Mrs Boffin {{attempt to}} adopt a young orphan, {{previously}} {{in the care of}} his great-grandmother, Betty Higden, but the boy dies before the adoption can proceed. Mrs Higden minds children for a living, assisted by a foundling known as Sloppy. She has a terror of the workhouse. When Lizzie Hexam finds Mrs Higden dying, she meets the Boffins and Bella Wilfer. In the meantime Eugene Wrayburn has obtained information about Lizzie's whereabouts from Jenny's father and has tracked <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affections. Bradley Headstone attempts to enlist the help of Riderhood, now working as a lock-keeper, to find Lizzie. After following Wrayburn up river and seeing him with Lizzie, Headstone attacks Wrayburn and leaves him for dead. Lizzie finds him in the river and rescues him. Wrayburn, thinking he will die anyway, marries Lizzie to save her reputation. When he survives, he is glad that this has brought him into a loving marriage, albeit with a social inferior. He had not cared about the social gulf between them but Lizzie had and would not otherwise have married him.|$|E

500|$|Although [...] own play evades {{the full}} import of this {{complicated}} association, Myrrha's name {{means that it}} [...] cannot be escaped entirely - especially since Ovid's story of Myrrha's incest poses a potential reciprocal to the nightmare Byron invents for Sardanapalus, of sympathy with the son who is <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother's 'incest'.|$|E

500|$|The two heroes {{descend on}} the Goblin Kingdom, and begin {{putting out the}} fire; this, in turn, hurts Flame Princess, both emotionally and physically, judging from her {{shedding}} of a single tear. Finn, horrified at the pain he has caused <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affections, exits his robot and calls for Flame Princess's attention, before crying. The tears alert Flame Princess that Finn is a [...] "water elemental", and that the two will only hurt each other, due to the opposition of their natural states.|$|E
500|$|The {{subject of}} unrequited love {{was one of}} the major ones in Cerna's lyric poems and, Călinescu argues, it evoked his actual {{experience}} with women, as [...] "the regret of not having lived through the great mystery of love." [...] These pieces, the critic notes, point to the influence of Classicist authors such as Eminescu, Dante Aligheri, and Giacomo Leopardi (the latter poet had also been quoted in Cerna's Die Gedankenlyrik).

500|$|O'Hara {{recalled}} that Ford would {{allow her to}} improvise extensively during the filming, but was very much the boss, commenting that [...] "nobody dared step out of line, which gave the performers a sense of security". O'Hara became such good friends with Anna Lee during the shooting that she later named her daughter Bronwyn after Lee's character. The film was lauded by the critics, and was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture. Both O'Hara and co-star Walter Pidgeon, who played the minister, were praised for their performances, with Variety writing that [...] "Maureen O'Hara splendid as <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> unrequited love, who marries the mine owner's son out of pique".|$|E

Upon reawakening the singer finds himself once again in his own bed and once he gets up everything is perfectly normal, while in the kitchen he finds his girlfriend who gives him a good morning kiss. The apartment in which the video was filmed was the true home of Cremonini.|$|R
