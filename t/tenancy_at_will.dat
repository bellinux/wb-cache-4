50|$|After discussing, {{in their}} logical order, other {{freehold}} interests in land, he passes to interests in land that were called by later writers interests less than freehold - namely, tenancies for terms {{of years and}} <b>tenancies</b> <b>at</b> <b>will.</b> With the exception of tenancy from year to year, now so familiar to us, but which was a judicial creation of a date later than the time of Littleton, the first book is a complete statement {{of the principles of}} the common law, as they, for the most part, existed until 1925, governing and regulating interests in lands. The first book concludes with a very interesting chapter on copyhold tenures, which marks the exact point at which the tenant—by-copy-of-court-roll, the successor of the villein, who, in his turn, represented the freeman reduced to villeinage by the growth of the manorial system, acquired security of tenure.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> or {{estate at will}} is a {{leasehold}} {{such that}} either the landlord or the tenant may terminate the tenancy at any time by giving reasonable notice. It usually occurs {{in the absence of}} a lease, or where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern common law, <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> can arise under the following circumstances: ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{estate at will}} (<b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will)</b> - {{leasehold}} for no fixed time or period. It lasts as long as {{both parties}} desire. Termination is bilateral (either party may terminate at any time) or by operation of law.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> is a tenancy which {{either the}} {{landlord}} or the tenant may terminate {{at any time}} by giving reasonable notice. Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn't associated with a time period. It may last for many years, {{but it could be}} ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all. Proper notice, as always with landlord/tenant law, must be given, as set forth in the state's statutes. If there is no formal lease, the <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> is the one that usually exists. In rare cases it may occur where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern common law, a <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> without compensation is very rare, partly because it comes about only if the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is for no rent, commonly where a family member is allowed to live in a home (a nominal consideration may be required) without any formal arrangements. In most residential tenancies for a fixed term, for consideration, the tenant may not be removed except for cause, even if there is no written lease. (However, an oral lease for more than 12 months is not enforceable if the statute of frauds in the jurisdiction includes leases of more than 12 months.) Many residential leases convert to [...] "at will" [...] tenancy subject to 30-days notice. Alternatively, a <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> (without a specific time limit) may exist for a temporary period where a tenant wishes to take possession of a property and the landlord agrees, but there is insufficient time in which to negotiate and complete a new lease. In this case, the <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> is terminated as soon as a new lease is negotiated and signed. The parties may also agree on the basis that if the parties fail to enter into a new lease within a reasonable time period, then the tenant must vacate the premises.|$|E
50|$|A {{newly created}} National Rugby League team {{known as the}} Gold Coast Chargers would take up <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> Carrara Stadium in 1996. The Chargers would only last three seasons before folding in 1998. Now the only team still {{remaining}} at Carrara, the Cougars won the 1998-99 ABL Championship. The ABL would be disbanded following the season and the Cougars were no more. Professional sport returned to the precinct in 2007 when the Gold Coast Titans took up <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> Carrara Stadium. The following year saw the Titans move to their newly created stadium in Robina.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{leasehold}} estates {{can take}} one of four formsthe fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years, the periodic tenancy, the <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will,</b> and the tenancy at sufferance, all discussed below. Forms no longer used include socage and burgage.|$|E
5000|$|Colloquially, [...] "lease" [...] and [...] "leasing" [...] {{are often}} a {{formalization}} of a longer, specific period as compared with a [...] "rental" [...] that created a <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will,</b> terminable or renewable {{at the end of}} a short period.|$|E
5000|$|... {{a tenant}} wishes {{to occupy the}} {{property}} urgently, but there was insufficient time to negotiate and execute a lease. The <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> terminates in this case {{as soon as a}} written lease is completed. If a lease fails to be realized, the tenant must vacate the property.|$|E
50|$|Simply leaving {{property}} {{behind on}} the premises does not constitute possession and thus, a <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> sufferance cannot be established. E.g., Nathan Lane Assocs. v. Merchants Wholesale, 698 N.W.2d 136 (Iowa 2005); Brown v. Music, Inc., 359 P.2d 295 (Alaska 1961).|$|R

5000|$|How much: Rent may be payable monthly, annually, or in advance, or as {{otherwise}} agreed. A typical {{arrangement for}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> is [...] "first and last month's rent" [...] plus a security deposit. The [...] "last month's rent" [...] is rent {{that has yet}} to be earned by the landlord.|$|E

50|$|A <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> sufferance {{is created}} when a tenant wrongfully holds over past {{the end of}} the {{duration}} period of the tenancy (for example, a tenant who stays past the expiration of his or her lease). In this case, the landlord can hold over the tenant to a new tenancy, and collect rent for the period the tenant has held over.A <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> sufferance (sometimes called a holdover tenancy) may exist when a tenant remains in possession of property even after {{the end of the}} lease, until the landlord acts to eject the tenant. The occupant may legally be a trespasser at this point, and the possession of this type may not be a true estate in land, even if authorities recognize the condition to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may be able to evict such tenant at any time, without notice. Action to evict <b>will</b> terminate a <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> sufferance, because the tenant no longer enjoys possession. Some jurisdictions impose an irrevocable election whereby the landlord treats the holdover as either a trespasser, or as a tenant at sufferance. A trespasser is not in possession; but a tenant at sufferance continues to enjoy possession of the real property.|$|R

50|$|Poplar HARCA (Housing and Regeneration Community Association) is {{a housing}} {{association}} in the East End of London, England.

50|$|By {{the late}} 14th century Shropshire's landowners had almost entirely {{withdrawn}} from actual cultivation of the land. Like {{most of their}} peers, the Corbets had rented out most of their demesne lands to tenants by the 1380s, {{under a variety of}} arrangements: <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will,</b> customary tenancies, sharecropping. The times were turbulent and uncertain and the Black death had made labour scarce, expensive, and hard to manage. Landed families were better off with a predictable income from rents than trying to exploit the land for themselves in the face of difficult conditions and volatile markets.|$|E
50|$|In a {{residential}} lease for consideration, a tenant {{may not be}} removed except for cause, {{even in the absence}} of a written lease. If a landlord can terminate the <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will,</b> a tenant by operation of law is also granted a reciprocal right to terminate at will. However, a lease that expressly continues at the will of the tenant ("for as long as the tenant desires to live on this land") does not automatically provide the landlord with a reciprocal right to terminate, even for cause. Rather, such language may be construed to convey to the tenant a life estate or even a fee simple.|$|E
50|$|The term of {{the lease}} may be fixed, {{periodic}} or of indefinite duration. If {{it is for a}} specified period of time, the term ends automatically when the period expires, and no notice needs to be given, in the absence of legal requirements. The term's duration may be conditional, in which case it lasts until a specified event occurs, such as the death of a specified individual. A periodic tenancy is one which is renewed automatically, usually on a monthly or weekly basis. A <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> lasts only as long as the parties wish it to, and may be terminated by either party without penalty.|$|E
50|$|The Cardinals {{ended their}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> Sun Devil Stadium with a 27-21 {{victory over the}} Philadelphia Eagles on Christmas Eve 2005. In 18 seasons, the Cardinals {{compiled}} a 64-80 (.444) record at Sun Devil Stadium, their best home record being 5-3 which they achieved four times: 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2004.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} woman took an immense stride forward last night...

25|$|Eight months later, Lockwood {{returns to}} the area by chance. Given that his <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> Thrushcross Grange is still valid, he decides to stay there again. He finds Nelly living at Wuthering Heights and enquires what has {{happened}} since he left. She explains that she moved to Wuthering Heights to replace the housekeeper, Zillah, who had left.|$|R
5000|$|Subject to any notice {{required}} by law, a <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> also {{comes to an}} end when either the landlord or the tenant acts inconsistently with a tenancy. For example, the changing of locks by the landlord is an indication {{of the end of the}} tenancy, as is the vacation of the premises by the tenant. However, in some jurisdictions, such as California, a landlord is prohibited from using a [...] "self help" [...] remedy, such as changing the locks, to terminate a tenancy, particularly a residential tenancy. Doing so may constitute a [...] "constructive eviction" [...] and expose the landlord to civil and criminal liability.|$|E
50|$|On 11 April 1998 the Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust {{bought the}} route between Wymondham and Dereham for £100,000.

50|$|A typical rental {{is either}} annual or month-to-month, {{and the amount}} of rent may be {{different}} for long-term renters (because of lower turnover costs). Leaving a long-term lease before its expiration could result in penalties, or even the cost of the entire agreed period (if the landlord is unable to find a suitable replacement tenant, after diligent pursuit). If a tenant stays beyond the end of a lease for a term of years (one or more), then the parties may agree that the lease will be automatically renewed, or it may simply convert to a <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>will</b> (month-to-month) at the pro-rated monthly cost of the previous annual lease. If a tenant at will is given notice to quit the premises, and refuses to do so, the landlord then begins eviction proceedings. In many places it is completely illegal to change locks on doors, or remove personal belongings, let alone forcibly eject a person, without a court order of eviction. There may be strict rules of procedure, and stiff penalties (triple damages, plus attorneys' fees) for violations.|$|E
50|$|Coming {{back to the}} Newcastle Road story, {{it could}} be {{that one of the reasons}} that Sunderland moved later than {{intended}} and were desperate to stay at the venue was that if they had left whilst Albion were in existence then the latter could have taken up <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> Newcastle Road, charged a gate and been a real threat to SAFC.|$|R
50|$|The net {{outcome of}} Domvile's actions was to halve the {{population}} of Shankill and Rathmichael during the 1860s.
