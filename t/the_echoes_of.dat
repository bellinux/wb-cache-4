The overlay of color onto the Doppler information lets these images be seen more clearly.|$|E
5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

Between 1908 and 1915, the artist, still heavily indebted {{to the work of}} Henri Fantin-Latour, was focused on creating Symbolist compositions with trees. As he took more risks in his experimentation, he began looking to Cubist Georges Braque for a new way of arranging still lifes. In tandem with such contributions were Realistic works suggesting the influence of Romania's Camil Ressu.|$|E
500|$|García Márquez {{depicts the}} General's body {{itself as a}} labyrinth. His doctor observes that [...] "{{everything}} that enters the body, adds weight, and everything that leaves it is debased." [...] The General's body {{is described as a}} [...] "labyrinth coming to a literal dead end". The labyrinth is also expressed in geographical and architectural imagery. The country's destiny is imagined as a break-up, a folding of north into south. The seas offer the hope of a new life and a new world, but the closer the General is to Colombia, the less chance he has of moving on. García Márquez describes buildings as [...] "daunting, reverberating (if not exactly reiterating) with <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> a bloody past". The portrayal of the General's world as a labyrinth is underlined by his constant return to cities and towns he has visited before: each location belongs to the past {{as well as to the}} present. The General in his Labyrinth blurs the lines between perdition in a man-made world and wandering in the natural world.|$|E

While <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> subgenres such as Euro-house, acid jazz, worldbeat and IDM can be noted, [...] "they hadn't yet broken free from the primal thump of four-on-the-floor house music." [...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum asserts that [...] "even as dance music took on all these new sounds, that basic pulse was still {{the most important thing}} about it, and that pulse reverberates all through Debut." [...] Björk said: [...] "A lot of the songs on my record have dance beats, but I think they're beats that are more reflective of daily life—like life in the middle of the day in a city, as opposed to the night life of the clubs." [...] The [...] "four-on-the-floor" [...] style —typical of house music— is mostly evident in songs such as [...] "Human Behaviour", [...] "Crying", [...] "Big Time Sensuality", [...] "There's More to Life Than This" [...] and [...] "Violently Happy". Björk felt house music was [...] "the only pop music that [...] truly modern," [...] stating in 1993 that it was [...] "the only music where anything creative is happening today." ...|$|E
500|$|The Three-Eyed Raven begins {{transferring}} {{knowledge to}} Bran as {{the army of}} wights arrives. While in a vision of Winterfell, Bran hears the cries of Meera Reed {{who is trying to}} save Bran's body while the Children hold back the wights. The Three-Eyed Raven advises Bran to listen to her, and Bran splits his consciousness by both remaining in the vision of the past and simultaneously warging into Hodor in the present. The Night King enters the cave and kills the Three-Eyed Raven. As Bran, Meera and Hodor make their escape, Leaf and Bran's direwolf, Summer, sacrifice themselves to hold back the wights. Hodor closes the hideout's door behind them, keeping the wights inside while Meera escapes with Bran. Meera repeatedly orders Hodor to [...] "hold the door" [...] shut while they flee, which results in the Wights tearing him apart. In the vision, Bran becomes overwhelmed by the split consciousness and unintentionally wargs into a younger version of Hodor in the vision, then known as Wylis, forging a connection between the past and present. With Bran's consciousness inside his head, Wylis suffers a seizure while hearing <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> Meera's orders and he begins to yell the words [...] "hold the door" [...] over and over, until they slur together and [...] "Hodor" [...] is all that's left that he can say.|$|E

2500|$|The main mix of influences, however, {{comes from}} the iconoclastic {{cultures}} of Secessionist Vienna and the Weimar Republic, with whom Bonciu was personally familiarized.

Furthermore, Crohmălniceanu sees the novel as incorporating elements from a literary branch of the [...] "New Objectivity" [...] movement: Klabund, but also Erich Kästner, as authors of [...] "atrocious, sarcastic, grotesque and brutal realism". Glăvan too sees an analogy between Sinidis' grim reflection on war and landscapes by [...] "New Objectivity" [...] master Otto Dix.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> de-Stalinization {{were still}} faint in Romania, and Gheorghiu-Dej himself was never touched by it. In compensation, Ceaușescu spoke against Drăghici during {{a series of}} {{meetings}} in March 1956, accusing him of taking advantage of his relations with the leader to bring the party under Securitate control. Ceaușescu presented himself as a liberal in contrast with the brutality of the secret police under the command of Drăghici, who was labeled as [...] "fanatical" [...] and [...] "merciless" [...] by political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu. Cautiously, Ceaușescu took distance from the more virulent of Drăghici's critics. So did party boss Emil Bodnăraș, who still made a point of criticizing Drăghici for not sharing his intelligence data with the CC plenum, suggesting to limit Drăghici's monopoly over the Romanian secret agencies.|$|E
2500|$|David Wildermuth of Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania concurred {{with the}} author's {{argument}} regarding the potential danger of [...] "depoliticizing a conflict which {{at its core}} was a war of racial subjugation and conquest". He found the authors' analysis of war-romancing trends to be [...] "deep and compelling", but noted the book's limitations in assuming specialist knowledge, which made it less accessible to the general public. For example, lay readers would {{have benefited from the}} context of the differences between Waffen-SS and Wehrmacht, along with an overview of the war crimes committed by the Waffen-SS, [...] "especially in light of the falsehoods appearing daily in Internet website chatrooms". The reviewer also remarked on the occasional sniping which made palpable the authors' frustrations with romantic notions of a [...] "valiant German military". Despite this minor criticism, Wildermuth commended the book for its [...] "fascinating analysis on how, far removed from its time and place, <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> this war still reverberate".|$|E

2500|$|Although the South-eastern Long-eared Bat is not blind, {{like all}} microbats {{it relies on}} {{echolocation}} to hunt for food and to navigate and they do this with astonishing proficiency. [...] These high frequency sound waves (echolocation calls) are created by the bats pushing air through its vocal cords {{in the same way}} as people speak. These echolocation calls are sent out either through the mouth or the nostrils and the calls rebound back from the nearby objects and the bat's sensitive ears sense <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> their calls. The bat's brain converts these faint echoes into information about the distance, size and texture of the nearby objects. [...] These bat high frequency calls are defined by the number of vibrations per second and are more technically referred to as hertz (Hz). [...] It is noted that the number of vibrations of a normal bat call is 50000Hz or 50 kilohertz (kHz) which matches to a wavelength of 6.5mm, which is a perfect scale for gauging the size of small insects. [...] A bat will send out an echolocation call, it will then strike an insect or an obstacle and then some of it will return as an echo, the time taken for the echo to return will indicate how far away the insect or obstacle is.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Eyre, Agnes Grey, then The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Shirley, Villette {{and even}} The Professor present a linear {{structure}} concerning {{a character who}} advances through life after several trials and tribulations, to find a kind of happiness in love and virtue, recalling the works of religious inspiration of the 17thcentury such as John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress or his Grace abounding to the Chief of Sinners. In a more profane manner, the hero or heroine follows a picaresque itinerary such as in Miguel de Cervantes (1547–16), Daniel Defoe (1660–1731), Henry Fielding (1707–1764) and Tobias Smollett (1721–1771). This lively tradition continued into the 19thcentury with the rags to riches genre to which almost all the great Victorian romancers have contributed. The protagonist is thrown by fate into poverty and after many difficulties achieves a golden happiness. Often an artifice is employed to effect the passage from one state to another such as an unexpected inheritance, a miraculous gift, grand reunions, etc. and in a sense, it is the route followed by Charlotte's and Anne's protagonists, even if the riches they win are more those of the heart than of the wallet. Apart from its Gothic elements, Wuthering Heights moves like a Greek tragedy and possesses its music, the cosmic dimensions of the epics of John Milton, {{and the power of}} the Shakespearian theatre. One can hear <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> King Lear as well as the completely different characters of Romeo and Juliet. The Brontës were also seduced by the writings of Walter Scott, and in 1834 Charlotte exclaimed, [...] "For fiction, read Walter Scott and only him – all novels after his are without value." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, Editura Minerva {{published}} {{a volume of}} Izabela Sadoveanu's critical essays, Impresii literare ("Literary Impressions"). The book earned the attention of critics, and was reviewed in the national press. In Luceafărul, a tribune of the Romanians in Austria-Hungary, fellow writer Ion Duma contrasted Impresii literare with another work of [...] "impressionistic" [...] criticism, that of traditionalist journalist Ilarie Chendi: while Sadoveanu's text demanded didacticism and morality in literature, Chendi, a Sămănătorul dissident, was writing in favor of art for art's sake. As noted by Duma, Sadoveanu's pronouncements defended writers for their moral mission, even {{to the detriment of}} art, equally praising Sofia Nădejde and novelist Constantin Sandu-Aldea for their sense of [...] "pity [...] for those less fortunate". The same reviewer also claimed that Sadoveanu, [...] "a womanly character", lacked an understanding of extrovert and [...] "combative" [...] traditionalists like Sandu-Aldea and Luceafărul poet Octavian Goga. Another Luceafărul chronicler, academic Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică, contrarily asserted that Sadoveanu was [...] "rather the warrior", but described Impresii... as inconsistent: [...] "Yes and no; neither here nor there; this, that and the other. And yet it carries a note that ought to be signaled." [...] From his traditionalist standpoint, Bogdan-Duică argued that Sadoveanu erred in reaching beyond [...] "impressions" [...] to consider herself a professional critic, and to advocate the [...] "primacy of the senses" [...] in art: [...] "Ms. Sadoveanu-Evan has a philosophy, even though she is a woman." [...] Reviewing <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> Sadoveanu's contributions in 2002, publisher and literary historian Cornelia Ștefănescu argued: [...] " [...] sparked bitter polemics and denials more than appreciations, even though N. Iorga and G. Ibrăileanu, objectively or not, had a privileged view of her".|$|E
