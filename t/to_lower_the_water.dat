25|$|Floodgates, {{also called}} stop gates, are {{adjustable}} gates {{used to control}} water flow in flood barriers, reservoir, river, stream, or levee systems. They may be designed to set spillway crest heights in dams, to adjust flow rates in sluices and canals, {{or they may be}} designed to stop water flow entirely as part of a levee or storm surge system. Since most of these devices operate by controlling the water surface elevation being stored or routed, they are also known as crest gates. In the case of flood bypass systems, floodgates sometimes are also used <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> levels in a main river or canal channels by allowing more water to flow into a flood bypass or detention basin when the main river or canal is approaching a flood stage.|$|E

2500|$|The central bridge {{crosses the}} River Gowy. [...] Formerly the three bridges and causeways were {{necessary}} {{because the whole}} area was too marshy to be crossed by any other means. [...] However, in the 20th century a scheme was carried out <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level of {{the whole of the}} River Gowy to prevent possible flooding of Stanlow Refinery, which is situated near the junction of the river with the Mersey. As a consequence, the marshes were drained and the footings of the central bridge were raised on a concrete foundation.|$|E

2500|$|Eucalypts draw a {{tremendous}} amount of water from the soil through the process of transpiration. They have been planted (or re-planted) in some places <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table and reduce soil salination. Eucalypts have also been used as a way of reducing malaria by draining the soil in Algeria, Lebanon, Sicily, elsewhere in Europe, in Caucasus (Western Georgia), and California. Drainage removes swamps which provide a habitat for mosquito larvae, but can also destroy ecologically productive areas. This drainage {{is not limited to the}} soil surface, because the eucalyptus roots are up to [...] in length and can, depending on the location, even reach the phreatic zone.|$|E
2500|$|Funding to {{excavate}} the pond was acquired in 1984. The buried bones were [...] or deeper {{beneath the surface}} of the peat at the bottom of the pond, under 3 to [...] of water. Researchers used a network of 160 wells around the pond <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table enough to permit excavation of the peat. The workers used shovels and hand tools to remove the peat until the level of the burials was reached. One of the lead archaeologists compared excavating the peat to trying to dig chocolate mousse under water. Only half of the pond was excavated, with the remainder left undisturbed for future investigation.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s two {{leakages}} occurred {{that made it}} necessary <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level in the canal and this, coupled with mining subsidence, caused its unofficial closure in 1932. By 1948 the canal was completely unnavigable but it did remain in water.|$|E
30|$|When {{the streams}} flow from higher <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> areas, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> drags, carries and {{deposits}} various materials which distracts from the crust leading {{them through a}} declining surface resulting in aggradations in the lowlands. Corrosive action that is created from water transformation consists {{one of the major}} geo-morphological factors which creates serious problems in humans (Potouridis 2009).|$|R
50|$|The Reddalsvannet, a {{fresh water}} lake, is located {{along the south}} side of the village area. It is also a {{protected}} nature reserve. In order to gain additional farmland in Reddal, a canal was built in 1877 <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> lake's <b>water</b> level by 4 m. This <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> down <b>to</b> sea level. The Reddal Canal (Reddalskanalen) connects the Reddalsvannet and Landviksvannet lakes to the sea. Today, the canal is popular with small boats.|$|R

Captain Edmunds (Gary Cooper), the young skipper of the yacht, follows after her in another motor boat. After catching up to her, Edmunds makes a daring leap into her boat. Just then a storm engulfs the small boat and the helpless couple end up swept ashore and marooned on a desert island in the Pacific.|$|R
50|$|Many grazing marshes {{have been}} {{converted}} into arable land, often using pumped drainage <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> levels enough to grow crops. The low ditch levels and agricultural runoff combine to remove much of the aquatic wildlife, although the arable fields may still be used by some wintering wildfowl.|$|E
50|$|Groundwater aquifer {{dewatering}} <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{table for}} access to additional aggregate would be allowed.

50|$|Alongside Lovewell Pond, off Route 113, lies Evergreen Spring. This {{spring is}} owned and {{operated}} by Nestlé and provides <b>water</b> for <b>the</b> Poland Spring <b>water</b> bottling company. <b>The</b> Lovewell Pond Corporation has had several arguments with Nestlé over their being allowed to take so much water. It was thought <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>water</b> level, therefore reducing the amount of fresh <b>water</b> entering <b>the</b> pond. Nestlé won the battles and has not changed their obtaining habits.|$|R
50|$|In hydroponics, pumps, {{lights and}} ambient heat can warm the {{reservoir}} water temperatures, leading to plant root and health problems. For ideal plant health, a chiller {{can be used}} <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> temperature below ambient level; 68°F (20°C) is a good temperature for most plants. This results in healthy root production and efficient absorption of nutrients.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the year}} 1305, two monks are {{supposed}} to have taken stones from the wall, because they wanted <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level, presumably {{in order to make the}} water further from their fields. The wall no longer withstood the weight of the water; apparently, a breach appeared and grew ever larger, until the wall finally gave way.|$|E

50|$|The Perry Aqueduct {{crosses the}} River Perry, and was {{replaced}} during restoration. The old aqueduct was a three-arch aqueduct, but due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>water</b> level <b>the</b> new aqueduct was built as a single span to avoid impeding the river's flow.|$|R
50|$|The canal {{passes through}} a peat bog, which has been drained since the {{construction}} of the canal. This lowering of the water level has meant that during restoration the canal had to be lined to prevent leakage, and a new lock was required <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level. This lock was named Graham Palmer Lock, after the founder of the Waterway Recovery Group.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007, the Lido reopened. One of the schools in Droitwich, Westacre Middle School, {{was the first to}} be able to go into the pool. Although the diving area has been filled-in <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> heating costs, the {{original}} 1930s fascia was left intact and the water still uses the salt that is the reason for the existence of Droitwich Spa itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} the lake is from 1686, when Robert Plot wrote about it in The Natural History of Staffordshire. According to this text, the pond used to be much larger than its current diameter of 50 meters. There is some evidence of an artificial trench dug towards its eastern shore which could be the remnants of an attempt <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level.|$|E
50|$|After the 2013 Alberta floods, as a {{temporary}} partial solution to mitigate flood damage, during those months {{when there is a}} greater risk of rising water that might cause flooding, the government pays TransAlta Corporation $2 million <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> level of <b>water</b> on its Ghost Reservoir.|$|R

50|$|The tunnel was punched {{through on}} Saturday, July 21, 1906 at 9 pm. It {{was found to}} be off by less than three inches. The Frostburg Mining Journal of September 15, 1906, proclaimed, “The Great Work Complete.” Inside the mines, the pumps were silenced, and gravity took over <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level. It is {{estimated}} that 9,000,000 gallons of water were drained in 24 hours.|$|E
50|$|Swamps were {{drained and}} farms were tiled <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table. The swamp {{northwest}} of the I-94 and US-23 intersection, and areas within Waterloo Recreation Area still appear as they did to early settlers. As productive farms became established, the local deer herds grew. In the 1820s and 1830s, the events surrounding the independence of Greece from Turkey inspired construction of Greek Revival buildings, {{and the names of}} townships, towns, and children.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 the UGRH {{presented}} plans <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{level by}} 15 meters {{to decrease the}} risk of flooding. At the same time, the national government rescinded responsibility for glacier lakes from the UGRH and transferred it to the regional authorities. Since the regional authorities did {{not come up with}} the funds to implement the measures proposed by the UGRH, six drainpipes were installed in 2011 which reduced the water level by three meters by July 2013.|$|E
60|$|The Eaglet {{had already}} heaved to, and two rowboats manned by the sailors and {{commanded}} {{by the first}} mate and a boatswain were soon <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> While this was being done, the boys, led by Phil and Dave, rushed to a third rowboat.|$|R
50|$|The {{effects of}} changes in {{atmospheric}} pressure upon water levels observed in wells {{has been known for}} many years. The effect is a direct one, an increase in atmospheric pressure is an increase in load on <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in <b>the</b> aquifer, which increases <b>the</b> depth <b>to</b> <b>water</b> (<b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level elevation). Pascal first qualitatively observed these effects in the 17th century, and they were more rigorously described by the soil physicist Edgar Buckingham (working for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)) using air flow models in 1907.|$|R
50|$|Chimo was a Casco-class, light-draft monitor {{intended}} for {{service in the}} shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the Confederacy.
