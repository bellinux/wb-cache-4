5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E
5|$|Yagan's skull {{was handed}} over to the Noongar {{delegation}} at a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 31 August 1997. In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, earlier that day: <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> nature goes... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer. Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments. Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.|$|E

The {{one thing on}} which Aunt Martha troubled herself to insist <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they must all go to church, rain or shine. <b>How</b> they <b>were</b> dressed, or if they were dressed at all, never {{concerned}} her. But go they must. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> Aunt Martha had been brought up seventy years ago, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> she meant to bring them up.|$|R
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E

25|$|According to Eleanor Womer, Dugal Campbell (Mary's brother) {{accompanied}} Colonel Bouquet to the Muskingum.

The girl was Mary Campbell, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> she was recovered.

25|$|In Canada {{the figure}} is 1 per cent, but applies only to the period of {{official}} campaigning. (Mr Burton is proposing a cap of 2.5 per cent or $60,000 for 10 months.) In both Britain and Canada, third parties are required to register with the official electoral regulators; both countries also restrict the contributions of foreign donors to third parties; and both require the identity of third party donors to be made public. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> modern democracies conduct themselves.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to most other sauropods, brachiosaurids had an inclined back, {{due to their}} long forelimbs. Therefore, if the neck exited the body in a straight line, it already pointed upwards. The exact angle is influenced by how the pectoral girdle is reconstructed, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the shoulder blades are placed on the ribcage. The mobility of the neck was reconstructed as quite low by Stevens and Parrish, while other researchers like Paul and Christian and Dzemski argued for more flexible necks.|$|E
25|$|Reinhold Messner was {{the first}} climber to break the bottled oxygen {{tradition}} and in 1978, with Peter Habeler, made the first successful climb without it. In 1980, Messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route. Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen, many purists then took {{the next logical step}} of insisting <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> it should be climbed.|$|E

25|$|In the club's first season, 1887–88, {{they won}} the Fylde Cup and the Lancashire Junior Cup. In the second competition, Blackpool faced Preston St. Joseph's at Preston North End's Deepdale ground, a venue that the seaside club argued was not neutral. The match took place on 24 March 1888. Blackpool went a goal down after 35 minutes, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the score {{remained}} at half-time. Two minutes into the second half, Joe Nelson equalised. T. Parr scored the winner in the final minute.|$|E
25|$|The GRN {{is created}} from a graph with the desired topology, {{imposing}} in-degree and out-degree distributions. Gene promoter activities {{are affected by}} other genes expression products that act as inputs, {{in the form of}} monomers or combined into multimers and set as direct or indirect. Next, each direct input is assigned to an operator site and different transcription factors can be allowed, or not, to compete for the same operator site, while indirect inputs are given a target. Finally, a function is assigned to each gene, defining the gene's response to a combination of transcription factors (promoter state). The transfer functions (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>how</b> genes respond to a combination of inputs) can be assigned to each combination of promoter states as desired.|$|E
25|$|At {{the behest}} of our leader Herzl, I came to Basle to make {{preparations}} for the Zionist Congress. Among many other problems that occupied me then was one that contained something of {{the essence of the}} Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck me. We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.|$|E
