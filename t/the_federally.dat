Diplomatic relations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai improved after Musharraf's departure and Zardari's rise to power. The Obama administration's AfPak policy, through AfPak envoy Richard Holbrooke, reflected the unified approach the United States took in dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late-1940s, the Menominee tribe was {{considered}} {{by a government}} survey to identify tribes for termination, {{a process in which}} federal recognition of the tribe would be withdrawn and the tribe would no longer be dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to support them. The Menominee were thought to be a tribe that could be terminated because they were one of the richest tribes in the nation. The federal government thought that termination would allow the tribal members to be assimilated into mainstream American culture, becoming hard-working, tax-paying, productive citizens. In 1954, Congress terminated <b>the</b> <b>federally</b> recognized status of the tribe with the Menominee Indian Termination Act. According to the terms of the Termination Act, <b>the</b> <b>federally</b> recognized status was to end in 1958. The tribe and the state of Wisconsin successfully lobbied for a delay in the implementation of termination until 1961. The tribe was opposed to termination for a number of reasons; their concerns included the loss of tribal culture, the loss of land due to tax liens, the possibility of bankruptcy and loss of the tribal timber industry, and the lack of tribal members who were trained to run a county government. The state of Wisconsin was concerned that with no industry for the tribe to tax, the state would be responsible for the large financial outlay that would be required to maintain governmental operations for the former reservation.|$|E

The ruling states that while the senior user of the state service mark or trademark has prior usage of the common law marks, federal statute overrides the earlier, state service mark and prohibits the senior user from preventing the junior user from exercising the use of <b>the</b> <b>federally</b> registered mark outside a defined geographic reach of the senior user.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} {{had major}} implications {{for a large}} segment of the population, economy, and politics of the entire United States. It has prompted a Congressional review of the Army Corps of Engineers and the failure of portions of <b>the</b> <b>federally</b> built flood protection system which experts agree should have protected the city's inhabitants from Katrina's surge. Katrina has also stimulated significant research in the academic community into urban planning, real estate finance, and economic issues in the wake of a natural disaster.|$|E
5|$|The larger US dams {{are owned}} and {{operated}} by the federal government (some by the Army Corps of Engineers and some by the Bureau of Reclamation), while the smaller dams are operated by public utility districts, and private power companies. <b>The</b> <b>federally</b> operated system is known as the Federal Columbia River Power System, which includes 31dams on the Columbia and its tributaries. The system has altered the seasonal flow of the river in order to meet higher electricity demands during the winter. At the beginning of the 20thcentury, roughly 75percent of the Columbia's flow occurred in the summer, between April and September. By 1980, the summer proportion had been lowered to about 50percent, essentially eliminating the seasonal pattern.|$|E

5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a few places where <b>the</b> <b>federally</b> threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2006 Canadian census, {{there were}} 10,994 {{people living in}} 4,650 {{households}} within the city (the official provincial estimate was 11,093 people). Of <b>the</b> <b>federally</b> surveyed households, 33% were one-person households, slightly above the 28% average provincewide; households consisting of couples with children, at 26%, were {{very close to the}} provincial average; and households of couples without children, at 24%, were below the provincial average of 30%. Among its 3,000 census families, Dawson Creek had a smaller proportion of married couples than the province, 62% compared to 73%, but the same average number of persons per family, 2.9. With 92% of Dawson Creek residents being Canadian-born, and 93% speaking only English, the city has few visible minorities. Only 17% of residents aged 35–64 had a university certificate or diploma, compared to the provincewide rate of 29%. Among those aged 25–64, 20% did not have a high school certificate or equivalent, much higher than the 12% provincewide rate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1955, the eastern United States {{experienced}} generally hot and dry weather, leading to drought conditions and decreased water levels. When Hurricane Connie struck, its rainfall moistened the soil and heightened creeks throughout the Mid-Atlantic and New England. Hurricane Diane struck North Carolina just five days later and affected the same general area. After floods in 1936, the United States federal government enacted plans to prevent future devastating floods, although they made no progress by the time Connie and Diane struck in 1955. Along the Delaware River in the 1930s, state legislatures in New Jersey and Pennsylvania had established a commission that worked to clean up polluted water, but the legislators and commission blocked federal help, comparing it to European socialism; this was in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>federally</b> funded Tennessee Valley Authority, which mitigated flooding along the Tennessee River.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{route of}} US-50 {{was created in}} 1976. This {{iteration}} of US-50 has its origins {{in a dispute over}} the route of Interstate 70 in Utah. While I-70 was in the planning stage Colorado lobbied for an extension of the original proposal to run across Colorado and into Utah. Utah supported an extension using then US-6/50 to connect Denver, Colorado with Salt Lake City. However, federal planners did not see value in this route and instead supported a route {{that could be used to}} connect Denver with Los Angeles, California. I-70 was built using <b>the</b> <b>federally</b> selected route. In 1976, US-50 was changed again to a routing mostly concurrent with I-70. The portion of modern US-50 between Delta and Scipio had been previously numbered State Route 26, and the portion between Scipio and Salina had been numbered State Route 63, with the SR-63 portion being transferred to SR-26 in 1971.|$|E
