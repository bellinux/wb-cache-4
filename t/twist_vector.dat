40|$|Abstract — We {{model the}} full {{dynamics}} of a rigid part in three-point frictional sliding {{contact with a}} flat rigid 6 -degree-offreedom plate. Given a periodic plate motion and the geometric, inertial, and frictional properties of the part, we define an asymptotic twist field mapping each part configuration to a unique part twist (linear and angular velocity). Asymptotic twist vectors in the field approximate the part’s cycle-averaged twist at each configuration and are independent of time or the system’s initial state. Simulations and experiments show that the trajectory of the part’s configuration as it slides on the plate is well described by the field. With the ability to program arbitrary plate motions, part manipulation reduces to finding plate motions that generate asymptotic twist fields to accomplish desired tasks. Several simple fields useful for manipulation tasks (e. g., sensorless part alignment) are verified in simulation and experiment. For the special case of a rigid part with infinitesimal thickness, we show that the part’s cycle-averaged twist for any configuration asymptotically converges to a unique asymptotic <b>twist</b> <b>vector.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} concept of a Morphing Upper Torso, an inno-vative pressure suit design that incorporates robotic elements to enable a resizable, highly mobile and easy to don/doff spacesuit. The torso is modeled as a system of interconnected, pressure-constrained, reduced-DOF, wire-actuated parallel ma-nipulators, that enable the dimensions of the suit to be reconfigured to match the wearer. The kinematics, dynamics and control of wire-actuated manipulators are de-rived and simulated, along with the Jacobian transforms, which relate the total <b>twist</b> <b>vector</b> of the system to the vector of actuator velocities. Tools are developed that allow calculation of the workspace for both single and interconnected reduced-DOF robots of this type, using knowledge of the link lengths.

These tools allow analysis of the full Morphing Upper Torso design, in which the back hatch of a rear-entry torso is interconnected with the waist ring, helmet ring and two scye bearings.

To this end, we use results due to Labourie and Fock-Goncharov on the existence of an equivariant flag curve associated to Hitchin representations, of which convex real projective surfaces are an example.

40|$|Robotics {{research}} has made {{extensive use of}} techniques based on the Moore-Penrose inverse, or generalized-inverse, of matrices. Recently, it has been pointed out how non-invariant results may, in general, be obtained applying these techniques to some areas of robotics, namely hybrid control and inverse velocity kinematics. Unfortunately, the problems are not restricted to just these particular areas in robotics, but, rather, are connected with misleading definitions of the metric properties of the six dimensional wrench and <b>twist</b> <b>vector</b> spaces used in robotics. The current definitions lead to inconsistent results, i. e. results which are not invariant with respect {{to changes in the}} reference frame and/or changes in the dimensional units used to express the problem. As a matter of fact, given a linear system u = A x, where the matrix A may be singular, the Moore-Penrose theory of generalized-inverses may be properly and directly applied only when the vector space U of vectors u and the vector space X of vectors x are inner product spaces. Arbitrary assignment of Euclidean inner products to the space U and X when the vectors u and x have elements with different physical units can lead to inconsistent and non-invariant results. In this paper, the problem of inconsistent, non-invariant solutions x s to u = A x in robotics is briefly reviewed and a general theory for computing consistent, gauge invariant solutions to non-homogeneous systems of the form u = A x is developed. In addition, the dual relationship between rigid-body kinematics and statics is defined formally as a particular, linear algebraic system whose solution system is also a dual system.

40|$|We offer here a {{more direct}} {{approach}} to twisted K-theory, based {{on the notion of}} <b>twisted</b> <b>vector</b> bundles (of finite or infinite dimension) and of twisted principal bundles. This is closeely related to the classical notion ot torsors and bundles of modules over an algebra bundle. Twisted K-theory is simply defined as the Grothendieck group of <b>twisted</b> <b>vector</b> bundles (with a given twist). The usual operations on vector bundles (exterior powers, Adams operations) are easily extended to this twisted framework. Graded twisted K-theory, which is important for the definition and proof of the Thom isomorphism in this framework, is defined with the same formalism. We also define a twisted Chern character with target "twisted cohomology". Although there are many definitions of this character in the literature, our method is more elementary and is based on the classical definitions of the Chern-Weil theory, via connections and curvatures. In this way, we get explicit formulas very much in the spirit of Steenrod's coordinate bundles. Comment: 41 page...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the study of {{families}} of open-closed topological field theories parameterized by a manifold with multiplication and their relationships with <b>twisted</b> <b>vector</b> bundles. Open-closed field theories were axiomatized by G. Moore and G. Segal in &# 91; 51 &# 93;. The study of families of such theories led us to the definition of Calabi-Yau and Cardy fibrations; these are fibred categories (in fact stacks) over the base manifold with multiplication which generalize the definition of Moore and Segal in the sense that when the base manifold is a one-point space, we recover the original definition. A careful study of their properties (that is, a detailed proof showing that these categories are additive, pseudo-abelian and enjoy an action of the category of locally free modules) led us to a relationship between these families of open-closed field theories and 2 -vector bundles (as defined by Baas, Dundas and Rognes in &# 91; 10 &# 93;), thus providing an affirmative answer to a suggestion given by G. Segal in &# 91; 57 &# 93;. Moreover, we also found a relationship between the transition homomorphisms of Cardy fibrations and Higgs bundles. The last part deals with global objects (that is, objects of the category over the whole base space). A functorial link between the category of modules over the spectral cover and the category of modules over the tangent sheaf of the manifold is obtained. We also show that Azumaya algebras, in the sense of A. Grothendieck &# 91; 29 &# 93;, appear naturally in the study of Cardy fibrations: given an object a of the fibred category defined over the whole base space, the space of arrows a!a can be defined as the pushout of a certain Azumaya algebra along the spectral projection S ! M. On the other hand, as was proved by M. Karoubi in &# 91; 35 &# 93;, <b>twisted</b> <b>vector</b> bundles are closely related to these Azumaya algebras.

In brief, a software package was developed which functions a common denominator of CAD/CAM surface types.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} constructing a structured quadrilateral grid inside a given four-sided 2 D region by a particular boundary-conforming mapping scheme – Hermite Interpolation Mapping (HIM). When the four given boundary curves are concave and convoluted, all boundary-conform mapping methods suffer from potential self-overlapping problem. Under HIM, the geometry of the grid depends on both the four boundary curves and the tangent vector functions associated with the curves. While the four boundary curves are fixed, the tangent functions in HIM can be varied to suit the need of controlling {{the characteristics of the}} mesh inside the given region so to prevent self-overlapping.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this thesis is to {{determine}} the best methods for controlling the interpolation of NURBS curves and surfaces. The various factors that affect the quality of the interpolant are described, and existing methods for controlling them are reviewed. Improved methods are presented for calculating the parameter values, derivative magnitudes, data point spacing and <b>twist</b> <b>vectors,</b> with the aim of producing high quality interpolants with minimal data requirements. A new technique for obtaining the parameter values and derivative magnitudes is evaluated, which constructs a C^ 1 cubic spline with orthogonal first and second derivatives at specified parametric locations. When this data is used to create a C^ 2 spline, the resulting interpolant is superior to those constructed using existing parameterisation and derivative magnitude estimation methods. Consideration is given to the spacing of data points, which has {{a significant impact on the}} quality of the interpolant. Existing methods are shown to produce poor results with curves that are not circles. Three new methods are proposed that significantly reduce the positional error between the interpolant and original geometry.
