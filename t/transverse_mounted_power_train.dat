50|$|These were {{built-up}} guns {{with two}} tubes, full-length wire winding, a jacket, and Welin breech block with hand operated Asbury mechanism. The mounting was a CP Mk V a hand-operated central pivot <b>mount</b> with additional <b>power</b> <b>training</b> and elevation {{provided by a}} 10HP electric motor and hydraulic pump. Elevation was +30 degrees to -5 degrees and loading was possible up to +10 degrees. The total weight of the mount including its 1in open-backed shield was 45.975 tons. They used two cloth bags each containing 14 kg (31 pounds) of cordite to fire a 200-pound (91-kg) projectile up to 19 kilometres at their maximum elevation of 30 degrees. Useful life expectancy was 650 effective full charges (EFC) per barrel.|$|R
50|$|The gun <b>mounts</b> had {{electrically}} <b>powered</b> <b>training,</b> elevation, hoists, rammers and {{the guns}} {{shared a common}} cradle. Improvements in ammunition handling meant {{that the rate of}} fire for the Model 1929 was nearly twice as fast as the Model 1926. Loading was at +20° for the Model 1926, while the model 1929 could be loaded at any angle up to 45°. These guns suffered from dispersion problems so the original muzzle velocity of 1000 m/s was reduced to 850 m/s with AP shells. Shell weight was also reduced from 50 kg to 47.5 kg in an attempt to resolve these problems, but were only partially successful. The main reason for the dispersion problem was because the guns were mounted too close together on a common cradle, which also complicated loading of the guns.|$|R
50|$|These {{guns were}} of {{built-up}} construction with a fixed liner, autofretted barrel, and a Welin breech block. The gun <b>mounts</b> had electrically <b>powered</b> <b>training,</b> elevation, hoists and rammers. There was no swinging arm, and shell hoists were of pusher type with loading at +15°. These guns suffered from dispersion problems (due to the turret {{design of the}} Trento-class cruisers), so the original muzzle velocity of 905 m/s was reduced to 840 m/s for armor-piercing shells. Shell weight was also reduced from 125.3 kg to 118 kg {{in an attempt to}} resolve these problems, but these efforts were only partially successful. The main reason for the dispersion problem was because the guns were mounted too close together on a common cradle, which together with a narrow 4.52 m ball track complicated loading of the guns.|$|R

The Model 1934's made by Ansaldo were of monobloc construction with a horizontal sliding breech block, while the Model 1936's made by OTO Melara were constructed of two tubes, a loose liner and a horizontal sliding breech block. Both models fired the same quick firing separate loading ammunition. The gun <b>mounts</b> had electrically <b>powered</b> <b>training,</b> elevation and hoists.

[...] These guns were considered a significant improvement over the earlier 152 mm /53 Models 1926 and 1929 guns in {{that they had a}} lower muzzle velocity, were more widely spaced in the turrets and had separate gun cradles. Dispersion was still a problem, but the problem wasn't inherent flaws in the guns or their mounts. Instead poor shell aerodynamics and poor ammunition quality control was at fault.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effects of 6 weeks strength vs. ballistic-power (<b>Power)</b> <b>training</b> on shot put throwing performance in novice throwers. Seventeen novice male shot-put throwers were divided into Strength (N = 9) and Power (n = 8) groups. The following measurements were performed before and after the training period: shot put throws, jumping performance (CMJ), Wingate anaerobic performance, 1 RM strength, ballistic throws and evaluation of architectural and morphological characteristics of vastus lateralis. Throwing performance increased significantly but similarly after Strength and <b>Power</b> <b>training</b> (7. 0 - 13. 5 % vs. 6. 0 - 11. 5 %, respectively). Muscular strength in leg press increased more after Strength than after <b>Power</b> <b>training</b> (43 % vs. 21 %, respectively), while <b>Power</b> <b>training</b> induced an 8. 5 % increase in CMJ performance and 9. 0 - 25. 8 % in ballistic throws.

40|$|<b>Power</b> <b>training</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a more effective type of resistance training for older adults for functional performance. It is not yet known whether older adults respond appropriately to instructions for <b>power</b> versus strength <b>training.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the velocity during strength and <b>power</b> <b>training,</b> with elastic resistance bands, in older adults attending a geriatric rehabilitation day program. It was hypothesized that <b>power</b> <b>training</b> would be faster than strength training, but that there would be large interindividual differences. Nine older patients (70 to 86 years) performed <b>power</b> and strength <b>training</b> of the ankle dorsiflexor and plantar flexor muscles using elastic resistance bands.

However, a wide variation was observed between participants in the training velocities. Older adults attending geriatric rehabilitation do have the potential to develop faster contractions during <b>power</b> <b>training</b> as compared to strength training. Nevertheless, the actual velocities achieved differed between individuals. This could explain some of the mixed findings of studies on <b>power</b> <b>training.</b> Hence, researchers should monitor velocity when comparing different types of resistance training...|$|R
40|$|Background. Age-related {{decline in}} muscle power {{may be an}} early {{indicator}} of balance deficits and fall risk, even in nonfrail adults. This study examined the dose-dependent effect of <b>power</b> <b>training</b> on balance performance in healthy older adults. Methods. One hundred twelve community-dwelling healthy older adults (69 6 6 years) were randomized to 8 – 12 weeks of <b>power</b> <b>training</b> at 20 % (LOW), 50 % (MED), or 80 % (HIGH) of maximal strength, or a nontraining control (CON) group. Participants trained twice weekly (five exercises; three sets of eight rapid concentric/slow eccentric repetitions) using pneumatic resistance machines. Balance, muscle performance (strength, power, endurance, contraction velocity), and body composition were measured. Results. <b>Power</b> <b>training</b> significantly improved balance performance (p. 006) in participants who underwent <b>power</b> <b>training</b> compared to controls. Low intensity <b>power</b> <b>training</b> produced the greatest improvement in balance performance (p. 048). Average contraction velocity at low load (40 % one repetition maximum [1 RM]) at baseline independently predicted improvement in balance following training (r. 29, p. 004). Conclusions. <b>Power</b> <b>training</b> improves balance, particularly using a low load, high velocity regimen, in older adults with initial lower muscle power and slower contraction.
