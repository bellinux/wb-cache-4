25|$|The third {{match was}} between Crowbar and Terry Funk for the WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started when Funk ambushed Crowbar backstage. They fought inside a truck, and Funk sent Crowbar through {{a table with}} a hip toss. Crowbar {{attacked}} Funk with a car door, and slammed a door into Funk's head. Funk performed a low blow, and slammed the door into Crowbar's head repeatedly. Funk handcuffed Crowbar, and attacked him with <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> a steel chair. Crowbar fought back with the chair, and performed a slingshot splash to Funk through a table. Funk fought back with chair shots, and pinned Crowbar after a piledriver on the car door to win the match and the title.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of November 8, Bundy approached 18-year-old telephone operator Carol DaRonch at Fashion Place Mall in Murray, Utah, {{less than a mile}} from the Midvale restaurant where Melissa Smith was last seen. He identified himself as [...] "Officer Roseland" [...] of the Murray Police Department, told DaRonch that someone had attempted to break into her car, and asked her to accompany him to the station to file a complaint. When DaRonch pointed out that Bundy was driving on a road that did not lead to the police station, he immediately pulled to the shoulder and attempted to handcuff her. During their struggle, he inadvertently fastened both handcuffs to the same wrist, and DaRonch was able to open <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> escape. Later that evening, Debra Jean Kent, a 17-year-old student at Viewmont High School in Bountiful, [...] north of Murray, disappeared after leaving a theater production at the school to pick up her brother. The school's drama teacher and a student told police that [...] "a stranger" [...] had asked each of them to come out to the parking lot to identify a car. Another student later saw the same man pacing in the rear of the auditorium, and the drama teacher spotted him again shortly before the end of the play. Outside the auditorium, investigators found a key that unlocked the handcuffs removed from Carol DaRonch's wrist.|$|E

2500|$|Tatchell {{researched}} the Gukurahundi attacks in Matabeleland in the 1980s, when the Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade attacked {{supporters of the}} Zimbabwe African Peoples Union. He became convinced that Mugabe had broken international human rights law during the attack, which is estimated to have involved the massacre of around 20,000 civilians. Then in 1999, journalists Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto were tortured by the Zimbabwe Army. The arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London seemed to him a precedent that human rights violations could be pursued against a head of state, thanks {{to the principle of}} universal jurisdiction. On 30 October 1999 Tatchell and three other OutRage! activists approached Mugabe's car in a London street and attempted to perform a citizen's arrest. Tatchell opened <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> grabbed Mugabe. He then called the police. The four OutRage! activists were arrested, on charges including criminal damage, assault and breach of the peace; charges were dropped on the opening day of their trial. Mugabe responded by describing Tatchell and his OutRage! colleagues as [...] "gay gangsters", a slogan frequently repeated by his supporters, and claimed they had been sent by the United Kingdom government.|$|E
2500|$|Minutes {{after midnight}} on March 4, 1957, Kastner was shot as {{he arrived at}} his Tel Aviv home. The attack {{was carried out by}} a three-man squad from a group of {{veterans}} from the pre-state right-wing militia Lehi led by Yosef Menkes and Yaakov Heruti. Menkes had also {{been a member of the}} post-independence terrorist group Kingdom of Israel. The assassination squad consisted of Menkes (the leader), Ze'ev Eckstein (the shooter), and Dan Shemer (the driver). The three men had waited in a jeep parked outside Kastner's house. Eckstein disembarked and approached Kastner as he locked his car, and asked him if he was Rudolf Kastner. When Kastner confirmed, Eckstein pulled out a handgun and fired three times. The first shot was a spent bullet, the second hit <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> the third hit Kastner in the upper body, critically wounding him. Kastner attempted to escape, but died of his injuries on March 15. In Gaylen Ross' 2008 film [...] "Killing Kasztner", Ze'ev Eckstein presented a very different sequence of events and implied that someone else fired a fatal third bullet. See section [...] "Documentary" [...] below.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2003, Travis {{escaped from}} the Herolds' car and held up traffic at a busy intersection, {{and was on the}} loose for several hours. [...] The {{incident}} began after a pedestrian threw something at the car that went through a partially open window and struck Travis while they were stopped at a traffic light. [...] Startled, Travis unbuckled his seat belt, opened <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> chased the man, but did not catch him. [...] When police arrived, they lured the chimpanzee into the car several times only to have Travis let himself out of another door and occasionally chase the officers around the car. [...] The 2003 incident led to the passing of a Connecticut law prohibiting people from keeping primates weighing more than 50 pounds as pets and requiring owners of exotic pets to apply for a permit. The new law took effect in 2004, and as of Travis's death, no one in the state had applied to adopt a chimpanzee. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection did not enforce the law on the Herolds because they had owned 200-pound Travis for so long and because the DEP did not believe Travis posed a public safety risk.|$|E
50|$|North American {{police cars}} were once noted for being painted black <b>and</b> white, with <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> roof painted white, while the trunk, hood, front fenders and rear quarter panels were painted black. The fleet {{vehicles}} {{that were used}} typically came painted in a single color, most commonly white or black, from the factory and were used as such. The contrasting black or white color was added to make the vehicle stand out from civilian vehicles. In 2007, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) began converting its fleet back to a black-and-white scheme after decades of using other colors.|$|R
5000|$|After World War II, {{the term}} fell into disuse. However, landau became a model name when Nash Motors {{introduced}} the Rambler in 1950. <b>The</b> new compact <b>car</b> was available {{during its first}} year of production only as a [...] "convertible landau". The Rambler's canvas top opened from the windshield header {{all the way to}} the back and stowed in the trunk area. This unique convertible design featured steel framed roof rails called a [...] "bridge beam" [...] around <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> side windows. <b>The</b> Rambler's strong body structure eliminated the internal bracing that was normally needed on other open cars. Essentially it was a cabrio coach.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{almost all}} {{traditional}} convertibles {{of the era}} that used frame-free side windows, the Rambler retained the fixed profile including <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> rear-side window frames. This metal structure served as the side guides or rails for the retractable waterproof canvas top. This design allowed Nash to utilize its unibody construction on its new compact. It made the body very rigid for an open-top car, without additional bracing. The convertible top was cable-driven and electrically operated. The design is similar to other fixed-profile convertibles including the 1936 Fiat 500 [...] "Topolino", Nissan Figaro (1991), Citroën 2CV (1948–1990) and the 1957 Fiat 500 (1957) {{as well as its}} 2007 Fiat 500 successor.|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{technology}} plays a {{vital role}} in modern era. In the emerging trend of speech technologies, speech/non-speech detection is an unsolved problem, which affects numerous speech related applications. One of the major reasons for these thefts is the unauthenticated access to <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> engine. Recently <b>the</b> Remote keyless system emerged for users to operate their cars without keys. For identifying the speech signal, Automatic speech recognition is used. It identifies the signal from the particular person with the help of Voice Active Detector (VAD). It is widely used within the field of speech communication for achieving high speech coding efficiency and low-bit rate transmission. These identify the signal and prioritize the unwanted noise signal using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In our system, we propose a novel way for keyless entry enabled through mobile phone.
