5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift {{them away from}} the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E

Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music, it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause hearing impairments. Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers.

5|$|Studies {{related to}} {{vocabulary}} development show that children's language competence depends upon {{their ability to}} hear sounds during infancy. Infants' perception of speech is distinct. Between six and ten months of age, infants can discriminate sounds used in the languages of the world. By 10 to 12 months, infants can no longer discriminate between speech sounds that are not used in the language(s) to which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed.</b> Among six-month-old infants, seen articulations (i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking) actually enhance their ability to discriminate sounds, and may also contribute to infants' ability to learn phonemic boundaries. Infants' phonological register is completed {{between the ages of}} 18 months and 7 years.|$|E

Utilizing a qualitative study, the researcher interviewed twelve undergraduate students who were studying at a large southeast Christian university in the United States with eight primary questions and five sub-questions. The ages of the interviewees {{in this study were}} from 18 to 22 years old. The results of the current study indicated that Chinese students experienced cognitive dissonance when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to Christianity in the United States. The three themes that emerged from those twelve interview responses were awareness, uncertainty, and denial. In addition, those Chinese students tended to reduce their cognitive dissonance either by ignoring the new beliefs or by changing their existing beliefs and accepting Christianity...|$|R

Bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E

Artyom escapes and races Pavel's forces to locate the Dark One and Anna, who has been kidnapped by Lesnitsky, an ex-Ranger and Red Line spy. En route, he finds a contingent of Red Line forces massacring the inhabitants of a station, supposedly to contain a mysterious epidemic.

Cuomo. In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, in the New York Review of Books. Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story. The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy. The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed her belief that the story's reporting was sound.|$|E

5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed,</b> followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E

The most recent state-produced geologic map of Georgia, by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources is 1:500,000 scale, and was created in 1976 by the department's Georgia Geological Survey. It was generated from a base map produced by the United States Geological Survey. The state geologist and Director of the Geological Survey of Georgia was Sam M. Pickering, Jr. Since 1976, several geological maps of Georgia, featuring the state's five distinct geologic regions, have been produced by the federal government.|$|E

25|$|These {{results show}} that {{at the age of}} 6 months infants are {{sensitive}} to how often certain sounds occur in the language <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to and they can learn which cues are important to pay attention to from these differences in frequency of occurrence.

All of this occurs before infants are aware of the meaning of any of the words <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to, and therefore the phenomenon of statistical learning has been used to argue for the fact that infants can learn sound contrasts without meaning being attached to them.|$|E
25|$|Babbling {{is assumed}} to occur in all {{children}} acquiring language. Particularly it has been studied in English, Italian, Korean, French, Spanish, Japanese and Swedish.

Infants mimick the prosody of the language(s) <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to. They use intonation patterns and timing that matches the characteristics of their parent language. Infants also babble using the consonants and vowels that occur most frequently in their parent language.
