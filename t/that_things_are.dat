5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's wife Shelly {{is having}} breakfast with her lover Bobby Briggs; the two roleplay {{the idea of}} {{shooting}} Johnson, while they toy with Shelly's pistol. When Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) arrives to enquire about Johnson, Briggs hides and Shelly attempts to make Johnson seem deeply involved in Laura's death and Renault's disappearance. Elsewhere, lovers Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) and Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) meet to discuss their spouses. Jennings' husband Hank (Chris Mulkey) has been released from prison, while Hurley's volatile wife Nadine is increasingly becoming mentally unwell. Jennings leaves, feeling <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> going nowhere, leaving Hurley crestfallen. Meanwhile, Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) is interviewed for a job at her father's department store and blackmails the interviewer into giving her a position at the shop's perfume counter—where Laura and Ronette Pulaski worked before their abduction.|$|E

Both these latter views are untrue to experience.|$|R

Plevna...gave the Ottoman Empire another forty years of life.|$|E

Upon his return to their home, he is upset {{by the fact that}} Helen is not at home. In Helen's suite, she is {{confused}} by the effect that McKenzie's attention is having on her. Putting him off, she tells him that she will give him an answer in the morning. After he leaves, she is afraid of her feelings, and she heads back to her home. After she arrives, she and Henry realize that the two really love each other, and they reconcile.|$|E
500|$|The Tantric {{approach}} to Kāli is to display courage by confronting her on cremation grounds {{in the dead}} of night, despite her terrible appearance. [...] In contrast, the Bengali devotee appropriates Kāli's teachings adopting the attitude of a child, coming to love her unreservedly. [...] In both cases, the goal of the devotee is to become reconciled with death and to learn acceptance of the way <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are.</b> [...] These themes are well addressed in Rāmprasād's work.|$|E

500|$|These electoral successes {{tap into}} the [...] complex {{politics}} of these countries. Viewed from afar, they are all open, successful, externally orientated. Seen from inside, they address a fear <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not as they were, {{that a combination of}} immigration and membership of the European Union poses a challenge to the traditions of the Nordic way of life. In some way the fact that Finland has joined the EU demonstrates that the country is no longer just the small, poor, well-behaved neighbour of the Nordic block.|$|E
500|$|Later that night, under a full moon, Captain Corcoran reviews his concerns: his [...] "kindly crew rebels", his [...] "daughter to a tar is partial", {{his friends}} seem to desert him, and Sir Joseph has {{threatened}} a court-martial. Little Buttercup offers sympathy. He tells her that, {{if it were}} not for the difference in their social standing, he would have returned her affection. She prophesies <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not all as they seem and that [...] "a change" [...] is in store for him, but he does not understand her cryptic warning.|$|E
500|$|Killen {{said that}} writing the pilot episode's script {{was one of}} the more-difficult {{components}} of creating the show. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result they created outlines, distinguishing the separate realities with green or red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. Stating <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> [...] "initially confusing to us when we are just trying to break story," [...] he hoped that when viewers watched the pilot episode, they would be immediately oriented in the reality on screen at the time.|$|E

500|$|After a day's rest, the marchers' {{main event}} on Tuesday {{was a public}} meeting in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street. Among the guest {{speakers}} was the Rev. Canon Dick Sheppard, [...] founder of the Peace Pledge Union. He told the marchers: [...] "You have so aroused {{the conscience of the}} country <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> bound to happen". Sir John Jarvis, without prior warning, then revealed plans for a steel tubes mill on the Palmers site. The impression that Jarrow's problems could be solved thus, without government action, disconcerted the listening marchers. Wilkinson commented that such plans were in the future, and were no substitute for the town's requirement for immediate government intervention.|$|E
500|$|The {{length of}} time between album {{releases}} has led to rumours in the media concerning her health or appearance. In 2011 Bush told BBC Radio 4 {{that the amount of}} time between album releases is extremely stressful, noting: [...] "It's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do... I wish there weren't such big gaps between them". In the same interview Bush denied she was a perfectionist in the studio, saying: [...] "I think it's important <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> flawed... That's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that's wrong or the mistake you've made that's led onto an idea you wouldn't have had otherwise", and reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{originally}} titled [...] "Urine Trouble", a joking pun on [...] "You're in trouble." [...] The episode's title {{refers to a}} phrase said by both Veronica and Wallace, indicating <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> supposedly [...] "normal," [...] though they are not. The episode was written by series creator Rob Thomas and directed by John T. Kretchmer. This episode marks Thomas's fourth writing credit for the series (after [...] "Pilot", [...] "Credit Where Credit's Due", and [...] "Leave It to Beaver") and Kretchmer's fourth directing credit for the series. In the episode, Logan mentions that producers wanted Tara Reid to play Trina Echolls (Alyson Hannigan) in casting for the film adaptation of the Echolls' story. During casting {{of the role of}} Trina, Reid was actually almost cast in the part.|$|E

500|$|In {{the album}} closer, [...] "Street Choir", Morrison repeats the questions, [...] "Why did {{you let me}} down / And now <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> better off / Why do you come around". Because of these lyrics Heylin wrote that [...] "such songs [...] were spawned by an {{increasing}} awareness of just how badly ripped off he had been". Ken Brooks {{has said that the}} lyric [...] "Move On Up" [...] is another reference on the album to a Curtis Mayfield song. The track prominently features Keith Johnson's trumpet and Morrison's harmonica. Writer Brian Hinton described the lyrics as perversely bitter, while Jon Landau wrote that [...] "Street Choir" [...] was one of the [...] "two or three finest songs" [...] of Morrison's career because of its [...] "musical and poetic energy".|$|E
500|$|... "Dress You Up" [...] was {{the last}} track {{to be added to}} the album as it was {{submitted}} late by songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale. Although Rodgers rejected it as there was no time to compose a melody and record it for the album, Madonna pushed for the song's inclusion on Like a Virgin, as she particularly liked its lyrics. The song is a drum beat-driven dance track featuring instrumentation of guitars and vocals from a choir. The lyrics are an extended metaphor for fashion and sex, comparing dressing up with passion. [...] "Shoo-Bee-Doo" [...] contains homage to Motown music. Beginning with a slow introduction, the song is in the doo-wop genre and resembles the songs of early Sixties girl groups like The Shirelles or The Crystals. The saxophone breakdown is played by Lenny Pickett. The lyrics discuss relationship problems, and are phrased as clichés in the coda. [...] "Pretender" [...] starts with the chorus and then moves to the verse. It talks about seduction and the insecurity felt by a woman who feels <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> moving too quickly for her with her man. [...] "Stay" [...] is the final track on the album. Using triple-rhythms and double-tracked vocals, the song includes a noise resembling someone slapping a microphone and a spoken sequence which fades away in the end.|$|E
500|$|The {{record was}} {{produced}} by Vives under the executive production of his wife, Claudia Elena Vasquez. The recording of Pombo Musical took two years in four music studios in Colombia. The album comprises songs {{from a variety of}} Colombian folk genres like vallenato, bambuco, joropo and cumbia. Some songs mix genres such as Latin pop and pop rock. Opening track, [...] "El Modelo Alfabético" [...] ("The Model Alphabetical"), is a rock-stylized cumbia and vallenato song performed by Vives, the Dúo Huellas, Eduardo Arias and Karl Troller, about being a real gentleman, such as having good manners, and also teaches the alphabet to children. [...] "El Renacuajo Paseador" [...] ("The Tadpole Walker"), is a bambuco song performed by Andrea Echeverri, Lucia Pulido, Iván Benavides, Carlos Ivan Medina, Bernardo Velasco, Ernesto Ocampo, Dúo Huellas, Fundación Batuta Chorus, and Vives. It tells the story about a tadpole named [...] "Rin Rin", that left his home without the approval of his mother [...] "Rana" [...] ("Frog"), and subsequently dies when he hides in the mouth of a duck. In this song, Echeverri added additional lines to it. Juanes performs on [...] "El Gato Bandido" [...] ("The Bandit Cat"), a pop rock song about a cat that rebels against his family and leaves home, discovering <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not easy by yourself, and returns feeling repentant. Aterciopelados performs on [...] "Mirringa Mirronga", which is about a feline mega-party.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2015, Silviu Stahie {{noted in}} Softpedia that Chromebooks were eating into Microsoft's market share.

When Corrado finally arrives, the two sing a duet that captures both the serenity of their love and the uncertainty of their future. Medora pleads with Corrado not to leave, but finally he departs to confront the Pasha.|$|E
