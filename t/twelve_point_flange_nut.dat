50|$|The <b>flange</b> <b>nuts</b> are {{sometimes}} {{provided with a}} swivel flange which helps in creating a more stable structure without affecting finished product like a serrated <b>flange</b> <b>nut.</b> Swivel <b>flange</b> <b>nuts</b> are mostly used in joining wood and plastic. Sometimes both faces of the nut are serrated, permitting either side to lock.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} on axially loaded columns, made of fiber-reinforced composite materials are presented. Experimental load/deflection plots at <b>twelve</b> <b>flange</b> <b>points</b> and three web points allow for an accurate description ofthe deformations, including the post-critical behavior. Data processing by two methods is described and a comparison is {{made between the}} two methods. In one method, the incipient buckling data are used, while in the second method, the post buckling data are used. The effect of damage accumulation is illustrated. The beha~ vior, including the curvature of the post-critical path, is predicted by using stability theory. Comparisons between predicted and measured values of critical load and postcritical path curvature are presented. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|A <b>flange</b> <b>nut</b> is a nut {{that has}} a wide flange at one end that acts as an integrated, {{non-spinning}} washer. This serves to distribute {{the pressure of the}} nut over the part being secured, reducing the chance of damage to the part and making it less likely to loosen {{as a result of an}} uneven fastening surface. These nuts are mostly hexagonal in shape and are made up of hardened steel and often coated with zinc.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of speed nuts, mostly dependent on the shape of the nut, how it attaches to the workpiece, and what type of screw can be used. Most types are designed for either machine screws or sheet metal screws. Some nuts do not attach to the workpiece. These are usually shaped as either a rectangle, a <b>flange</b> <b>nut,</b> or a hex nut; the rectangular speed nut is also known as a flat-style speed nut. Speed nuts that attach to the workpiece usually are some form of a J-nut or U-nut.|$|R

The size range of the connector varies from 1/2" [...] to 4", or the equivalent metric sizes, the size is denoted in the internal diameter of the connectors.|$|R

40|$|Performance of air {{operated}} valves {{is a major}} maintenance concern in process industries. Anecdotal information indicates that reliability of some high maintenance valves has been improved by using an ion deposition process to achieve engineered surfaces on selected components. This project compared friction for various surface treatments of selected valve components. Results indicate valve performance may be slightly more consistent when an engineered surface is applied in the valve packing area; however surface treatment in this area {{does not appear to}} have a dominant affect on reducing valve friction. Results indicate a linear relation between stem friction and torque applied to packing <b>flange</b> <b>nuts,</b> and even after a valve is in service, controlled packing adjustments can be made without significantly changing valve stroke time...|$|R
