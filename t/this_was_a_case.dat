5|$|López de Zúñiga, {{known as}} Stunica, {{one of the}} editors of Ximenes Complutensian Polyglot, reproached Erasmus that his text lacked part of the 1 John 5:7-8 (Comma Johanneum). Erasmus replied {{that he had not}} found it in any Greek manuscript. Stunica {{answered}} that Latin manuscripts are more reliable than Greek. In 1520 Edward Lee accused Erasmus of encouraging Arianism. Erasmus replied that he had not found any Greek manuscript that contained these words, he answered that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> not of omission, but simply of non-addition. He showed that even some Latin manuscripts did not contain these words.|$|E
5|$|The French team, {{representing}} the Racing Club de France, included 3 {{players who were}} later part of the gold-winning rugby team for France. Jean Collas, Charles Gondouin, and Émile Sarrade were all part of both teams, while it is often misreported that another of their rugby teammates, the Haitian-born Constantin Henriquez was also on the tug of war team, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of mistaken identity due to their similar names, with Colombian-born Francisco Henríquez de Zubiría {{taking part in the}} tug of war. The other two members of the tug-of-war team were Raymond Basset and Joseph Roffo. The combined Scandinavian team featured three athletes from each of Sweden and Denmark. The Swedish competitors were August Nilsson, who also took part in the pole vault and shot put, Gustaf Söderström, who was competing in the shot put and the discus throw, and Karl Staaf, who did the pole vault, triple jump, standing triple jump and hammer throw. Only one of the three Danish pullers took part in any other events; Charles Winckler competed in the shot put and discus throw. Dane Edgar Aabye was at the Games as a journalist for the Politiken newspaper, but was recruited into the team to make up the numbers as one of the original entrants was injured. Eugen Schmidt, the sixth member of the team, had competed in the 100 metres sprint and the 200 metre rifle shooting at the 1896 Games, and founded the Danish Sports Federation that same year.|$|E

Kewanee and Wayanda {{are known to have}} done some convoy escort before the end of hostilities, while Kewanee also did some cruising for privateers. The only exchange of gunfire known to have involved any of the ships during the war occurred in November 1864, when a shore battery at Castine, Maine opened fire on Mahoning, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of mistaken identity.|$|E
25|$|James is {{the first}} member of the Working Families Party to win office in New York State, and the first {{third-party}} member to be elected to the city council since 1977. (She has since changed back to the Democratic party.) In 2005, James became involved in advocating against the proposed Brooklyn Nets Arena in her district, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> that put her against her Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Borough President Marty Markowitz and developer Bruce Ratner. James opposed the use of eminent domain to evict her constituents, selling the MTA's Atlantic Yards property below its market value, and keeping the planning of the project away from the New York City Council. Bertha Lewis, a founder of the Working Families Party and the New York City affiliate of Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), on the other hand, endorsed the stadium development once Ratner accepted her plan for affordable housing.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> filed before The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division {{on behalf}} of the Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America against University of Michigan – Michigan Stadium {{claiming}} that Michigan Stadium violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its $226-million renovation by failing to add enough seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms, concessions and parking. Additionally, the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue, with nearly all the seats being provided in the end-zone areas. The U.S. Department of Justice assisted in the suit filed by attorney Richard Bernstein of The Law Offices of Sam Bernstein in Farmington Hills, Michigan, which was settled in March 2008. The settlement required the stadium to add 329 wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by 2010, and an additional 135 accessible seats in clubhouses {{to go along with the}} existing 88 wheelchair seats. This case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the DOJ the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules. The agreement now is a blueprint for all stadiums and other public facilities regarding accessibility.|$|E
500|$|Rutherford's Liberal {{party was}} elected, with a {{majority}} of the popular vote and a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly in the province's first election, the 1905 Alberta election. [...] The north-central constituency boundaries radiated out from Edmonton and some say <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of gerrymandered electoral boundaries. Rutherford emerged from the March 1909 election leading another formidable majority, that clearly reflected the broad popular support he and his government enjoyed. He would resign as premier 14 months later, in May 1910, after his government was implicated in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal.|$|E
500|$|There is some {{speculation}} that Ruisdael {{was also a}} doctor. In 1718, his biographer Houbraken reports that he studied medicine and performed surgery in Amsterdam. Archival records of the 17th century show the name [...] "Jacobus Ruijsdael" [...] {{on a list of}} Amsterdam doctors, albeit crossed out, with the added remark that he earned his medical degree on 15October 1676 in Caen, northern France. Various art historians have speculated that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of mistaken identity. Pieter Scheltema suggests it was Ruisdael's cousin who appeared on the record. The Ruisdael expert Seymour Slive argues that the spelling [...] "uij" [...] is not consistent with Ruisdael's own spelling of his name, that his unusually high production suggests there was little time to study medicine, and that there is no indication in any of his art that he visited northern France. However, Slive is willing to accept that Ruisdael may still have been a doctor. In 2013, Jan Paul Hinrichs agreed that the evidence is inconclusive.|$|E

[...] In rejecting Ledbetter's appeal, the Supreme Court said that [...] "she could have, and should have, sued" [...] when the pay decisions were made, instead of waiting beyond the 180-day statutory charging period.|$|E

The group, led by James Cromitie, was tried and all four were convicted. It was later brought to light that the four men were actually encouraged into participating in the plot by the FBI.

2500|$|One {{research}} group reported {{a case study}} of a single individual with piriformis syndrome whose symptoms were entirely resolved through physical therapy sessions that worked to strengthen the hip abductors, external rotators and extensors. This treatment involved three phases: non-weight bearing exercises, weight bearing exercises, and ballistic exercises. The purpose of non-weight bearing exercises is to focus on isolated muscle recruitment. Ballistic and dynamic exercises consists of plyometrics. [...] As <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study of a single individual, however, its statistical significance is meaningless and it may indicate nothing important regarding piriformis syndrome.|$|E

When explaining the art of our epoch, [...] "his work {{will be one of the}} surest documents". Metzinger's paintings contained their own 'explanation'. For Apollinaire <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> [...] "unique in the history of art". For Apollinaire, Metzinger had purity; [...] "his meditations take beautiful forms whose harmony tends to approach the sublime... entirely stripped of all that was known before him. [...] Each one of his pictures contains a judgment of the universe and his entire work resembles a nocturnal firmament when it is clear, free from all clouds and trembling with adorable lights. There is nothing incomplete in his works, poetry ennobles the smallest details." ...|$|E
