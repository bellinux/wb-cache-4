5|$|Zinfandel {{is grown}} across the {{continental}} United States, although California grows the largest proportion. U.S. producers make wine in styles {{that range from}} late harvest dessert wines, rosés (White Zinfandel) and Beaujolais-style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine {{in the style of}} port. The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate, location, and age of <b>the</b> <b>vineyard</b> in which they are grown, as well as the technology employed by the winemaker.|$|E

When he receives word that a plague has broken out and his bond Ares is one of the victims, he heads down to help with yet another of Bartholomew of Sandwich's prophecies. His mother, however, hates the Underland and only allows Boots and Gregor below on the condition that she comes with them. The humans' plague expert, Dr. Neveeve, explains that there is a plant called starshade growing deep in <b>the</b> <b>Vineyard</b> of Eyes which can be distilled into a cure.

5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over <b>the</b> <b>vineyard,</b> caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less than ideal climate of the wine region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), <b>the</b> <b>vineyard</b> sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in the wine market. The grape is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine. It {{can be in the}} eastern Mediterranean wine regions of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>vineyards</b> {{were planted}} with Sauvignon blanc in 1983. The {{name comes from}} the alteni, small stone walls {{that in the past}} {{surrounded}} the orchards in the area, and brassica, yellow flowers that cover <b>the</b> <b>vineyards</b> in <b>the</b> spring.|$|R

40|$|In two {{wine-growing}} {{areas with}} different climatic characteristics 12 cultivars {{intended for the}} production of white wines were studied.

Elements of buds fruitfulness (6 features in total), yield, cluster mass, sugar quantity and grape quality were observed in both localities. In <b>the</b> <b>vineyards</b> of Grocka and Kutina high yielding varieties Ugni blanc and Dimyat can be grown with great success. Italian Riezling produced higher yields and better quality of unfermented grape juice in <b>the</b> <b>vineyards</b> of Grocka in comparison with <b>the</b> <b>vineyards</b> of Kutina.

Not all Greek viticulture techniques were widely adopted by other wine regions. Some Greek vineyards used mysticism to ward off disease and bad weather.

The marlstone of the region is made up of the marl, clay, sand and gravel fragments that came from the weathering of old mountain chains in the area such as the Ardennes.
