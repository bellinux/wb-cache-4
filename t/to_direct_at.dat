5|$|The {{shooting}} {{of the film}} En Thangai began with Tiruchi Loganathan, then a popular playback artist, playing the lead role of the sacrificing brother. However, he was eventually replaced by actor M. G. Ramachandran. Meanwhile, film distributor P. A. Perumal of National Pictures, with the patronage of A. V. Meiyappan of AVM Productions, bought the film rights of Parasakthi. M. Karunanidhi, who would later become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, was signed to write the script. The duo Krishnan–Panju were signed on <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>at</b> Meiyappan's suggestion, and Ganesan, the stage actor of En Thangai was chosen to play the hero, making his cinematic acting debut. It was Perumal who, in 1950, gave Ganesan a flight ticket to Madras for the screen test for Parasakthi. Ganesan had simultaneously shot for the Telugu-Tamil bilingual film Paradesi / Poongothai, {{which was supposed to}} be his actual film to release first, but released much later after Perumal requested its co-producer Anjali Devi to let Parasakthi release first, and she agreed. Ganesan had earlier dubbed for actor Mukkamala in the 1951 Tamil film Niraparadhi.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Yates was {{confirmed}} <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>at</b> {{least the first}} film {{in a series of}} five instalments based on J. K. Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a book which is set in the world of Harry Potter. The first three films were given release dates in 2016, 2018, and 2020. David Heyman and Harry Potter screenwriter Steve Kloves joined Yates and J. K. Rowling in developing the screenplay. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, released in November 2016, received generally positive reviews and stars Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, Dan Fogler, Colin Farrell, and Johnny Depp.|$|E

Hollywood luminaries such as actors John Garfield and Mickey Rooney {{invested in the}} production, and Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles offered <b>to</b> <b>direct.</b> <b>At</b> one performance though, Garfield insisted Herb Jeffries, who was light-skinned, should wear make-up. Ellington objected in the interval, and compared Jeffries to Al Jolson. The change was reverted, and the singer later commented that the audience must have thought he was an entirely different character {{in the second half}} of the show.|$|E

25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted <b>to</b> <b>direct.</b> <b>At</b> the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
25|$|Frank Whiting, the {{director}} of the University of Minnesota Theater introduced Guthrie to the arts community in the Twin Cities and helped gather support that persuaded Guthrie to locate his theater in Minneapolis. With the help of the newly founded Tyrone Guthrie Theater Foundation a fundraising effort raised over US$2 million. The new theater was completed in 1963 in time for the May 7 opening of Hamlet. During its first season the Guthrie featured well known stage actors Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy and Zoe Caldwell and featured a group of younger actors including George Grizzard, Ellen Geer and Joan van Ark. Tyrone Guthrie served as Artistic Director until 1966 and continued <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>at</b> the theater he founded until 1969, two years before his death. In 1966 Douglas Campbell was named Artistic Director.|$|E
25|$|The fame of the Vieux-Colombier {{seemed to}} reach its apogee in the 1922/1923 season. The house was filled for every {{performance}} and visitors to Paris complained of the impossibility of getting tickets to any of its offerings. Copeau organized a touring company to the provinces. Invitations to play in {{other countries in the}} off-season abounded. When Konstantin Stanislavski, the director of the Moscow Art Theatre, came to Paris in December 1922, he and his troupe were warmly received on the stage of the Vieux-Colombier. The influence of Copeau's principles to which he held without flinching was felt throughout Europe and the United States. Despite the fame, conflict arose. Jouvet, who understood the economics of the theatre better than Copeau, knew that a larger theatre and a more profitable pricing system were needed. His proposal fell on deaf ears. When he was asked <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>at</b> the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, he chose his freedom. Even Romains decided that the Right Bank theatres were more hospitable to his work after Copeau rejected one of his plays. Despite the problems at the theatre, the school continued to thrive. Copeau allowed his young charges to appear in a production of Gide's Saül as the masked demons that taunt the king played by Copeau himself. The critical reaction was quite positive. The season ended, as the previous ones had, with the Vieux-Colombier in debt.|$|E

These included former Star Trek alumni, such as LeVar Burton, aka Geordi La Forge from The Next Generation, and Robert Duncan McNeill, who played Tom Paris on Voyager. Roxann Dawson was also announced <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>at</b> {{the start of the}} series, having previously played B'Elanna Torres, also on Voyager. She went on to direct ten episodes of the series. Following the first season, the majority of the writers on the series were fired by Braga with the exception of Chris Black. He was promoted for the second season to co-executive producer, and former The X-Files and The Lone Gunmen writer John Shiban joined the writing team and was also named co-executive producer. Berman called the recruitment of Shiban a [...] "coup" [...] for the series. Shiban stayed for the second season, while Black left after the third.|$|E
2500|$|Although a [...] "boycott" [...] was {{not what}} Ayckbourn said word-for-word, the effect was broadly the same. The {{following}} year, Ayckbourn suggested he might return to the West End on condition that plays were staged on his terms, and this was interpreted {{as a sign that}} his latest play, Sugar Daddies, would get a West End performance. But this did not happen, and the closest performance to London was at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford. In 2005, Private Fears in Public Places also omitted the West End from its run, instead choosing to perform at the Outer London venue of the Orange Tree Theatre, in Richmond. Ayckbourn has continued to criticise the West End frequently, and has said he does not expect <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>at</b> the West End again (except, if asked, at the National Theatre where he spent a two-year sabbatical).|$|E
