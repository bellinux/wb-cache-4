500|$|Several of the church's pews {{date from}} 1857 {{and remain in}} use. The pews, quite simple in form, have a [...] "minimalist appearance". Each pew {{consists}} of a long wooden plank {{that serves as the}} seat, with a thin rail supported by three spindles as <b>the</b> <b>backrest.</b> The pews are supported by three arched supports joined to the seat by a mortise and tenon joint and reinforced with nails. The newer pews exhibit identical design elements but are constructed with modern nails and timber. Though most of the pews are arranged against the church's west elevation with a center aisle, two are along the north elevation and four are along the south elevation. The pulpit is situated at the east elevation. There is an upright piano in the northeastern corner of the church.|$|E

2500|$|The Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Squadra Corse was {{a limited}} (50 units, 15 in USA, 3 in Canada) street-going {{version of the}} Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Super Trofeo 2013. [...] It has a {{removable}} engine hood with quick-release system, rear wing and the hood made from carbon composite material, carbon-ceramic brake system, e-gear six-speed transmission with steering wheel paddles, decal strip along the flank displays green, white and red, {{the colors of the}} Italian flag; choice of 4 body colours (Giallo Midas (yellow), Bianco Monocerus (white), Grigio Thalasso (grey), in Rosso Mars (red)), matte black rear wing with contrasts in body color, hood, front air intakes, rear diffuser and 19-inch forged wheels in high-gloss black; choice of three brake calliper colours (red, black, yellow), carbon fiber (at door panels, racing seats and center console cover, handbrake frame, the middle of the center console, the lower rim of the steering wheel, the trim around the main and secondary instrument panels, the door handles, and the handle for opening the glove box) and Alcantara (at underside of the dashboard, central panel of the seat cushion and <b>the</b> <b>backrest)</b> interior upholstery, bucket seats (optional comfort seats). The rear wing was reported to produce three times more downforce than the standard Gallardo's spoiler.|$|E
2500|$|The core of {{the flat}} frame {{fuselage}} was formed with a horizontal beam about [...] long, to which two other [...] converging struts were attached, making overall a vertical A-frame. The downward sloping extremities of these beams carried a slightly deeper horizontal box structure below the cross beam, with the open pilot's seat and controls upon it. On some later aircraft there was an extra vertical member for the lower cross beam to the wing root to provide the pilot with a backrest. [...] Others enclosed him or her in a simple, light, short nacelle between the nose and <b>the</b> <b>backrest</b> strut. The rear part of the fuselage frame was based on two longer beams reaching to the tail. [...] The upper one was horizontal and attached to both converging A-frame beams, near but not at its apex. The lower one sloped upwards and {{was attached to the}} rear sloping part of the A-frame just below the cross-member. [...] These two rear fuselage beams were cross braced with three more struts, one vertical about halfway to the tail, forming two bays which were crossed diagonally by the other two struts. [...] There was another, short vertical strut in the rear bay between the upper and diagonal members. [...] For landings a skid ran between three projecting ends of the forward and lower A-frame.|$|E
2500|$|A {{deliberate}} attempt to introduce [...] "modern car lines", the Mark E introduced semi-monocoque construction, both {{to improve the}} resilience {{of the car and}} to allow full-height doors to be fitted on both sides. As announced, the prototype car was completely flat-sided and as with previous models used light alloy for all exterior panels. Beneath the skin, there were two main steel frames, one which made up the principle support for the floor, rear suspension and doors and a second which carried the steering assembly and engine. This second frame was described as [...] "semi-floating" [...] to allow the damping out of engine vibrations and to prevent fractures. Further strength was obtained by separating the bonnet from the front grill, allowing the grill frame to add rigidity {{to the front of the}} car. Track and overall width of the car were the same as the Mark D, but the wheelbase was extended by [...] Though not appreciated at the time, this fundamentally affected the car's stability and made it liable to overturn. Weather protection was more sophisticated, the hood now including a front section that could be rolled back as a sunroof while the detachable side screens incorporate sliding windows. The seat was still a single bench, but <b>the</b> <b>backrest</b> was now split, one third allowing for adjustment to suit driver comfort, whilst the remainder hinged forward to allow access to the boot. Lighting was improved with larger headlamps, flashing indicators and rear number plate light. The fuel tank was increased in size to , but the car retained the Villiers 9E/3 engine with three-speed gearbox. Deliveries of the new car were expected to begin in May 1957.|$|E
2500|$|Seats were spaced [...] apart {{before the}} refurbishment, and <b>the</b> <b>backrests</b> could be {{reclined}} up to 40 degrees. Each car was designed {{in one of}} three different sets of colors for carpets and seat covers.|$|R

40|$|<b>Backrests</b> {{influence}} <b>the</b> {{comfort of}} seated people. With 21 subjects sitting with three backrest heights (no backrest, short backrest, high backrest) discomfort caused by lateral, roll, and fully roll-compensated lateral oscillation was investigated at frequencies between 0. 25 and 1. 0 Hz. With lateral oscillation, <b>the</b> short <b>backrest</b> reduced discomfort at frequencies less than 0. 63 Hz and <b>the</b> high <b>backrest</b> reduced discomfort at frequencies less than 1. 0 Hz. With roll oscillation, <b>the</b> high <b>backrest</b> reduced discomfort at frequencies less than 0. 63 Hz, but increased discomfort at 1. 0 Hz. With fully roll-compensated lateral oscillation, <b>the</b> short <b>backrest</b> reduced discomfort at 0. 4 Hz and <b>the</b> high <b>backrest</b> reduced discomfort at 0. 5 and 0. 63 Hz. As predicted by current standards, a backrest can increase discomfort caused by high frequencies of vibration. However, a backrest can reduce discomfort caused by low frequencies, {{with the benefit}} depending on the frequency and direction of oscillation and backrest height. </p...|$|R
50|$|The Eameses {{constantly}} {{made use}} of new materials. The pair's first plywood chair—the Eames Lounge Chair Wood (LCW)—{{made use of}} a heavy rubber washer glued to <b>the</b> <b>backrest</b> {{of the chair and}} screwed to the lumbar support.

This technology was brought back in the 670 Lounge chair. <b>The</b> <b>backrest</b> and headrest are screwed together by a pair of aluminum supports. This unit is suspended on the seat via two connection points in the armrests. The armrests are screwed to shock mounts which are connected only via glue to the interior of <b>the</b> <b>backrest</b> shell, allowing <b>the</b> <b>backrest</b> and headrest to flex when the chair is in use. This is part of the chair's unusual design, as well as its weakest link. The shock mounts have been known to tear free causing catastrophic collapse and damage.|$|E

40|$|The {{transmission}} of vibration through a seat depends on various {{characteristics of the}} seat and the dynamic response of the human body. The dynamic response of the body can be represented by its apparent mass, but {{the effect of the}} seat on the apparent mass of the body is not well understood. This study was designed to quantify the effect of foam and rigid <b>backrests</b> on <b>the</b> vertical apparent mass of the human measured at the seat surface supporting the body. The apparent masses of 12 subjects were measured during exposure to random vertical vibration (1. 0 ms? 2 rms from 0. 125 to 40 Hz) in a seat with a rigid <b>backrest,</b> in <b>the</b> same rigid seat with three thicknesses of foam backrest (50, 100 and 150 mm), and in the same seat with no <b>backrest.</b> <b>The</b> <b>backrests</b> were inclined at various angles: 0 °, 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 °, 25 ° and 30 ° for the rigid and 100 mm foam backrests, and 0 °, 10 °, 20 ° and 30 ° for the 50 and 150 mm foam backrests. With all vertical backrests (i. e., 0 ° inclination), there were resonances in the apparent mass of the body around 5 and 10 Hz. With no <b>backrest,</b> <b>the</b> apparent mass was increased at frequencies less than the resonance frequency but decreased at frequencies between 8 and 20 Hz, relative to the apparent mass with the vertical rigid and foam <b>backrests.</b> With <b>the</b> rigid <b>backrest,</b> <b>the</b> primary resonance frequencies in the apparent mass increased with increasing <b>backrest</b> inclination. With <b>the</b> foam <b>backrests,</b> <b>the</b> resonance frequencies decreased with increasing backrest inclination. At frequencies less than the primary resonance, the apparent mass decreased with increasing backrest inclination, particularly with <b>the</b> rigid <b>backrest.</b> Between 8 and 15 Hz, the apparent mass decreased with increasing inclination, most notably with <b>the</b> foam <b>backrests.</b> At inclinations less than 30 °, there was little effect of foam thickness on the apparent mass, but at 30 ° an increase in the thickness of the foam decreased the frequency of the first resonances. Since contact with <b>backrests</b> and <b>the</b> characteristics of <b>backrests</b> influence <b>the</b> vertical apparent mass of <b>the</b> seated body, <b>backrests</b> should be expected to influence the {{transmission of}} vertical vibration through a supporting seat cushion...|$|R
50|$|Through {{extensive}} {{trial and}} error, Charles and Ray arrived at an alternate solution: create two separate pieces {{for the seat}} and backrest, joined by a plywood spine and supported by plywood legs. The result was a chair with a sleek and honest appearance. All of the connections were visible and the material was not hidden beneath upholstery. The seat was joined to the spine and legs {{with a series of}} four heavy rubber washers with nuts embedded in them (later these came to be called 'shock mounts'). The shock mounts were glued to the underside of the seat, and screwed in through the bottom of the chair. <b>The</b> <b>backrest</b> was also attached using shock mounts. From the front and top the seat and back are uninterrupted by fasteners. The rubber mounts were pliable, allowing <b>the</b> <b>backrest</b> to flex and move with the sitter. This unique technology {{is also one of the}} chair's greatest flaws. The shock mounts are glued to the wooden backrest, but may tear free for various reasons. A common response to this problem was to drill directly through <b>the</b> <b>backrest</b> and insert fasteners between <b>the</b> <b>backrest</b> and the lumbar support. This greatly devalues the chair, since it changes the original aesthetic of smooth, uninterrupted wooden forms.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the effect of a movable {{backrest}} on vibration transmission through the trunk during driving and on the physiological consequences thereof. Eleven healthy male subjects drove for about 1 h on normal roads with a movable and with a fixed backrest while surface electromyography (EMG) was measured at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra (L 5) and vertical accelerations were measured at <b>the</b> seat, <b>backrest</b> and at <b>the</b> spine at the levels of the second sacral vertebra (S 2) and seventh cervical vertebra (C 7). <b>The</b> movable <b>backrest</b> significantly reduced accelerations at C 7 by up to 11. 9 % at the 5 Hz frequency band. <b>The</b> movable <b>backrest</b> also significantly reduced the coherence and transmission between S 2 and C 7 accelerations, but not the differential motion between these sensors. EMG at both sides of L 5 was on average 28 % lower when using <b>the</b> movable <b>backrest.</b> Spinal shrinkage was unaffected by backrest type. It is concluded that a movable <b>backrest</b> reduces <b>the</b> transmission of vibration through the trunk and that it reduces low back EMG. Car driving is associated with the risk of developing low back pain and this may be related to exposure to whole body vibration. This study found an effect of a simple ergonomics measure on the transmission of vibration through the trunk as well as on back muscle activation...|$|R
