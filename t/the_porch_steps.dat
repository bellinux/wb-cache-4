25|$|Other {{than the}} {{construction}} of the garage, there have been few other alterations to the house. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> have been rebuilt and a handrail added. The porch itself has been enclosed.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Bopp {{was born}} October 15, 1949 in Denver, Colorado. The {{following}} year his family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio. It was there that, {{at the age}} of three, his father Frank Bopp introduced him to astronomy on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> of the family home as they watched a meteor shower. Frank began to teach him about planets, constellations and the aurora borealis. At the age of ten he received his first telescope, a four-inch reflector.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{was sitting}} on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> when Stephen Irving came down the lane and across the garden.|$|E
60|$|On {{receiving}} {{this answer}} the Cossack officer, {{who had been}} standing in <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> <b>stepped</b> into <b>the</b> house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's fine," [...] replied Slone, rather awkwardly, as he {{sat down}} on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>step.</b> What could Holley want with him? This old rider was above curiosity or gossip.|$|R
60|$|When {{they arrived}} at the cabin Fay turned on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>step</b> and, with her face nearer a level with his, white and sweet in the moonlight, with her eyes shining and unfathomable, she was more than beautiful.|$|R
60|$|Flo {{accompanied}} her {{as far as}} <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps.</b> A queer-looking individual was slouching along with ax over his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Madeline {{advanced}} to <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps.</b> And Stewart, {{after taking a}} parcel of papers from a saddle-bag, turned toward her.|$|E
60|$|Eunice did not pause. She went boldly {{through the}} yard and up <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps.</b> He retreated before her and held the door.|$|E
60|$|The hunter {{nodded his}} reply, and, pausing at <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>step,</b> he pressed {{her hand to}} make his {{assurance}} stronger. His reward was instant. In the bright starlight she stood white and eloquent, staring down at him with dark, wide eyes.|$|R
60|$|Passing {{under the}} {{detached}} gateway, they entered <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> porter <b>stepped</b> forward, knocked heavily and waited.|$|R
60|$|Marilla, just {{home from}} Mrs. Lynde's, {{was sitting on}} <b>the</b> back <b>porch</b> <b>step</b> when Anne {{returned}} to the house.|$|R
60|$|Lenore {{met him at}} <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps,</b> {{seeing in}} him, feeling as she embraced him, that he {{radiated}} a strange triumph and finality.|$|E
60|$|Then a {{crowd of}} players trooped noisily {{out of the hotel}} lobby and swept Sheldon and Carroll down <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> toward the waiting omnibus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{tell me all}} the Avonlea news," [...] said Anne, {{sitting down}} on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps,</b> where the evening {{sunshine}} fell over {{her hair in a}} fine golden rain.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} when the villagers dispersed to their homes and left the colonel to his own circle. With his strong, dark face beaming, he mounted <b>the</b> old <b>porch</b> <b>step.</b>|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of {{the residence}} of Harry Schoenbum in Hollywood, June 28, 1926. The two-story Spanish-style house {{can be seen at}} left. It has light-colored walls and a terracotta tile roof. A wooden balcony can be seen on the second floor, while a set of steps lead from the front yard to <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> <b>Stepping</b> stones {{can be seen in the}} grass at right. Several trees can be seen in the front yard at center and right...|$|R
60|$|She {{could see}} old Boxer asleep on <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> <b>step</b> and Lucy Ellen's white cat {{stretched}} out on the parlor window-sill. There was no other sign of life about the place. Cecily drew a long, leisurely breath of satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|As the old {{man went}} heavily down <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> he muttered to himself: [...] "I was feared o' sumfin like dis; I done feel it in my bones." ...|$|E
60|$|Theodosia {{went out}} and stood looking inscrutably on, while Wesley and Irving hoisted the trunk into the wagon and tied it. Then Wesley came up <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> and looked at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't {{do it for}} play, exactly," [...] he replied, {{taking a}} seat on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> and smiling up at Edith. [...] "I can't stand cows; I like horses, though. Of course, if I were foreman of the dairy, that would be another thing." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the last}} buggy had driven away, Felicity set {{a batch of}} bread, {{and the rest of}} us sat around <b>the</b> back <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> in <b>the</b> cat's light and ate cherries, {{shooting}} the stones at each other. Cecily was in quest of information.|$|R
60|$|Two snowed-up {{figures were}} {{standing}} on <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> As they <b>stepped</b> in, the Josephs recognized one of them as Mr. Ralston, a wealthy merchant {{in a small town}} fifteen miles away.|$|R
60|$|When the {{procession}} reached {{the domain of}} Miss Harriet Corvey, there was gathered inside the yard {{quite a number of}} the usual attendants on mail days, awaiting the arrival of Wesley Green with his waddling horse and leather bag. But all interest in the coming of the mail was lost in the surprise and admiration excited by the astounding apparition of old Aunt Patsy in the ox cart, attended by her retinue. As the oxen, skilfully guided by Uncle Isham's long prod, turned into the yard, everybody came forward to find out the reason of this unlooked-for occurrence. Even old Madison Chalkley, his stout legs swaddled in home-made overalls, dismounted from his horse, and Colonel Iston raised his tall form from <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>step</b> where he had been sitting, and approached the cart.|$|R
60|$|Nothing had altered. But Carley seemed {{returning}} {{after many}} years. Slowly she dismounted--slowly she climbed <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps.</b> Was there {{no one at}} home? Yet the vacant doorway, the silence--something attested to the knowledge of Carley's presence. Then suddenly Mrs. Hutter fluttered out with Flo behind her.|$|E
60|$|It {{might have}} been {{interesting}} to tarry there within ear-shot, but I {{wanted to get back}} to the road to intercept Steele. Scarcely had I retraced my steps and seated myself on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> when a very tall dark figure loomed up in the moonlit road.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if he didn't he's a grand fibber," [...] replied Kathleen. [...] "But he did. You can't fool me. I thought I'd {{never get}} {{him back to the}} house." [...] Then, as she tripped up <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps,</b> she shook a finger at Dorn. [...] "Remember!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{evening after}} the funeral Janet and Anne were sitting on <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> at sunset. <b>The</b> wind had fallen asleep in the pinelands and lurid sheets of heat-lightning flickered across the {{northern}} skies. Janet wore her ugly black dress and looked her very worst, her eyes and nose red from crying. They talked little, for Janet seemed faintly to resent Anne's efforts to cheer her up. She plainly preferred to be miserable.|$|R
50|$|Private Tommy. R. Bullock Age 53 (C. Company), 21 September 1972. He and his Wife {{were shot}} {{at home as}} they watched TV by the IRA. Mrs Bullock was shot dead at <b>the</b> front <b>porch,</b> <b>The</b> gunmen <b>stepped</b> over her body and went inside to kill her husband.|$|R

60|$|Never had he spoken a softer, more drawling speech, nor {{gazed at}} Bo more mildly. Roy seemed thunderstruck. Helen {{endeavored}} heroically to restrain her delicious, bursting glee. Bo's wide eyes {{stared at her}} lover--darkened--dilated. Suddenly she left the mustang to confront the cowboy where he lounged on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps.</b>|$|E
60|$|Spencer {{went off}} to put up his horse, and Estella waited for him on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps,</b> {{wondering}} if any other girl {{in the world could}} be quite so happy as she was, or love anyone as much as she loved Spencer. She did not see how it could be possible, because there was only one Spencer.|$|E
60|$|She rode {{back across}} the mesa and down the trail, and, once more upon the flat, she called to the horse and made him run. His spirit seemed to race with hers. The wind of his speed blew her hair from its fastenings. When he thundered to a halt at <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> Madeline, breathless and disheveled, alighted with the mass of her hair {{tumbling}} around her.|$|E
50|$|Ramses {{commands}} that Horus {{be taken}} to the hall of the pharaohs, there to await his last words and the royal ring. Amid the moonlight, Horus seats himself on <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> whose <b>steps</b> lead down to the River Nile, and watches the crowds gathering to greet their soon-to-be new pharaoh. As Horus contemplates the reforms {{that he would like to}} introduce, something stings his leg; he thinks it was a bee. A courtier remarks that it is fortunate that it was not a spider, whose venom can be deadly at this time of year.|$|R
50|$|On new construction, a zero-step {{entrance}} {{can usually}} be incorporated without an obvious “ramp” per se, i.e. without a structure that has 90-degree dropoffs at the edges and rails at the sides. In most cases, grading and landscaping can make a ramp unnecessary. Deliberately grading to permit the sidewalk to meet <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> without a <b>step</b> creates access with an invisible modification.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad," [...] said Anne dreamily. [...] "There are so {{many things}} I want to do. I want to sit on <b>the</b> back <b>porch</b> <b>steps</b> and feel <b>the</b> breeze blowing down over Mr. Harrison's fields. I want to hunt ferns in the Haunted Wood and gather violets in Violet Vale. Do you {{remember}} the day of our golden picnic, Priscilla? I want to hear the frogs singing and the poplars whispering. But I've learned to love Kingsport, too, and I'm glad I'm coming back next fall. If I hadn't won the Thorburn I don't believe I could have. I COULDN'T take any of Marilla's little hoard." ...|$|R
