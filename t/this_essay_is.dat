One contest had participants writing an essay about an event that impacted them the most to win a makeover that included a Hannah Montana wig, flight for four to Albany, New York, and four tickets to the January9,2008 concert held at the Times Union Center in Albany. The winner, a 6-year-old girl from Garland, Texas, had won with an essay stating the girl's father had died April17,2007 in a roadside bombing in Iraq during the Iraq War. However, the girl's mother, Priscilla Ceballos, later admitted that the essay and the military information she provided about her daughter's father were untrue. [...] "We did the essay and that's what we did to win. We did whatever {{we could do to}} win, but when [...] asked me if <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> true, I said 'No, <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> not true,'" [...] Ceballos said. The prizes were awarded to the runner up. The mishap garnered much attention from the media because it exemplified parents' desperate long to please their children.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the focus}} in <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> {{largely on the}} {{character}} of Prince Hamlet, Hazlitt also comments on the movement of the dramatic action. Shakespeare lends all the characters and settings an air of verisimilitude, so that the reader might consider [...] "the whole play [...] an exact transcription of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark, at the remote period of time fixed upon, before the modern refinements in morals and manners were heard of. [...] the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. There is no set purpose, no straining at a point." ...|$|E
500|$|The peace {{following}} {{the battle of}} Mons Badonicus is attested partly by Gildas, a monk, who wrote De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae or On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain {{during the middle of}} the sixth century. [...] <b>This</b> <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> a polemic against corruption and Gildas provides little in the way of names and dates. [...] He appears, however, to state that peace had lasted from the year of his birth to the time he was writing. [...] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is the other main source that bears on this period, in particular in an entry for the year 827 that records a list of the kings who bore the title [...] "bretwalda", or [...] "Britain-ruler". [...] That list shows a gap in the early sixth century that matches Gildas's version of events.|$|E

In Aug 2013 an indication that such an idea can be acceptable to the Palestinians was given by Mahmud Abbas in a meeting with Meretz MK-s.

6000|$|This article {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in the volume Memories and Portraits (1887). It was divided into three parts. The interest of <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> almost wholly autobiographical, telling us, with more or less seriousness, how its author [...] "learned to write." [...] After Stevenson became famous, this confession attracted universal attention, and {{is now one of}} the best-known of all his compositions. Many youthful aspirants for literary fame have been moved by its perusal to adopt a similar method; but while Stevenson's system, if faithfully followed, would doubtless correct many faults, it would not of itself enable a man to write another Aes Triplex or Treasure Island. It was genius, not industry, that placed Stevenson in English literature.|$|E
60|$|The {{object of}} <b>this</b> <b>Essay</b> <b>is</b> to explain {{as clearly as}} I am able, the grounds of an opinion which I have held from the very {{earliest}} period when I had formed any opinions at all on social or political matters, and which, instead of being weakened or modified, has been constantly growing stronger by the progress of reflection {{and the experience of}} life: That the principle which regulates the existing social relations between the two sexes--the legal subordination of one sex to the other--is wrong in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; and that it ought {{to be replaced by a}} principle of perfect equality, admitting no power or privilege on the one side, nor disability on the other.|$|E
6000|$|This {{need was}} seen to exist a century ago by the Hon.

[...] This is a curious anticipation of the main idea on which <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> founded.

60|$|The {{subject of}} <b>this</b> <b>Essay</b> <b>is</b> not the {{so-called}} Liberty of the Will, so unfortunately {{opposed to the}} misnamed doctrine of Philosophical Necessity; but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. A question seldom stated, and hardly ever discussed, in general terms, but which profoundly influences the practical controversies of the age by its latent presence, and is likely soon to make itself recognised as the vital question of the future. It is so far from being new, that in a certain sense, it has divided mankind, almost from the remotest ages; but in the stage of progress into which the more civilised portions of the species have now entered, it presents itself under new conditions, and requires a different and more fundamental treatment.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{my purpose}} in the earlier portion of <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> to suggest that certain {{phenomena}} of human nature, apparently as trivial as the sparks rubbed out of a deer's hide in a dark night, may indicate, and may be allied to a force or forces, which, like the Aurora Borealis, may shine {{from one end of}} the heavens to the other, strangely illumining the darkness of our destiny. Such phenomena science has ignored, as it so long ignored the sparks from the stroked deer-skin, and the attractive power of rubbed amber. These trivial things were not known to be allied to the lightning, or to indicate a force which man could tame and use. But just as the Indians, by a rapid careless inference, attributed the Aurora Borealis to electric influences, so (as anthropology assures us) savages everywhere have inferred the existence of soul or spirit, intelligence that ...|$|E

60|$|John Armstrong, {{the son of}} a Scotch minister, {{was born}} in the parish of Castleton, in Roxburghshire. The date of his birth has not been ascertained, nor is there any thing known {{concerning}} the earlier part of his education. The first we hear of it is, that he took a degree in medicine at Edinburgh, on the fourth of February, 1732; on which occasion he published his Thesis, as usual, and chose De Tabe Purulenta for the subject of it. A copy of a Latin letter, which he sent to Sir Hans Sloane with <b>this</b> <b>essay,</b> <b>is</b> said to be in the British Museum. In an advertisement prefixed to some verses which he calls Imitations of Shakspeare, he informs the reader that the first of them was just finished when Thomson's Winter made its appearance. This was in 1726, when he was, he himself says, very young. Thomson having heard of this production by a youth, who was of the same country with himself, desired to see it, and was so much pleased with the attempt, that he put it into the hands of Aaron Hill, Mallet, and Young. With Thomson, further than in the subject, there is no coincidence. The manner is a caricature of Shakspeare's.|$|E
60|$|As {{the purpose}} of <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> mainly logical, I may point out the {{existence}} of a fallacy not marked, I think, in handbooks of Logic. This is the fallacy of saying that an opponent 'admits' what, on the contrary, he has been the first to point out and proclaim. He is thus suggested into an attitude which is the reverse of his own. Some one--I am sorry to say that I forget who he was--showed me that Fontenelle, in De l'Origine des Fables, {125a} briefly stated the anthropological theory of the origin of myths, or at least of that repulsive element in them which 'makes mythology mythological,' as Mr. Max Muller says. I was glad to have a predecessor in a past less remote than that of Eusebius of Caesarea. 'A briefer and better system of mythology,' I wrote, 'could not be devised; but the Mr. Casaubons of this world have neglected it, and even now it is beyond their comprehension.' {125b} To say this in this manner is not to 'admit that we have not got much beyond Fontenelle.' I do not want to get beyond Fontenelle. I {{want to go back to}} his 'forgotten common-sense,' and to apply his ideas with method and criticism to a range of materials which he did not possess or did not investigate.|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> {{not written}} for the first twenty critics of literature, nor for that rare twenty-second who has just been mentioned, but for the admirer of a poem here or there, whose {{appreciation}} is capable of yielding him a larger return. If the reader is already at the stage where he can maintain at once the two propositions, [...] "Pound is merely a scholar" [...] and [...] "Pound is merely a yellow journalist," [...] or the other two propositions, [...] "Pound is merely a technician" [...] and [...] "Pound is merely a prophet of chaos," [...] then {{there is very little}} hope. But there are readers of poetry who have not yet reached this hypertrophy of the logical faculty; their attention might be arrested, not by an outburst of praise, but by a simple statement. The present essay aims merely at such a statement. It is not intended to be either a biographical or a critical study. It will not dilate upon [...] "beauties"; it is a summary account of ten years' work in poetry. The citations from reviews will perhaps stimulate the reader to form his own opinion. We do not wish to form it for him. Nor shall we enter into other phases of Mr. Pound's activity during this ten years; his writings and views on art and music; though these would take an important place in any comprehensive biography.|$|E
