Cement of 4 and 8 % of dry mass of <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> was added to improve its suitability as building block and structural pavement material. To know the influence of waste plastic fiber on cement stabilized <b>red</b> <b>earth,</b> 1 % fiber was also added to the mixture. It is shown that the compressive strength of cement stabilized <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> blocks was improved with seven days of curing. The addition of cement to <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> enhanced soaked CBR value. The soaked CBR value of fiber reinforced cement stabilized <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> was about 1. 3 to 1. 5 times that of unreinforced cement stabilized <b>red</b> <b>earth...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tropical soils {{include a}} wide variety of pedogenic {{materials}} common to the tropical regions of the world, of which the material properties and engineering behaviour may vary significantly. These soils in many ways have unique characteristics that can mainly be ascribed to the compositions and micro-structures of a material developed under hot, wet soil-forming conditions. Due to the variation in their properties and behaviour, the classification of soils formed under such conditions as distinct and well-defined soil types appears to have been avoided in the past. Unfortunately, this has brought about the grouping and classification of materials of significantly varying chemical, geological and/or geotechnical properties and engineering behaviour under a single, all-encompassing term of <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils. The unique pedogenic environment and soil characteristics further mean that conventional soil mechanics concepts and geotechnical investigative procedures, developed almost exclusively from work completed on temperate soils, do not necessarily apply to soils formed in tropical environments. This research reviews the typical and unique characteristics and behaviour of <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils as summarised in the existing literature, including the application of existing soil classification systems and the possible ambiguity existing in the classification and nomenclature pertaining to soils formed in tropical environments. Significant inconsistencies in the identification and classification of <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils and laterites were observed to exist throughout the available literature, with frequently overlapping ranges of geological, geotechnical and chemical properties reported for both lateritic and <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soil types. Much has been written in the existing literature regarding the unique material characteristics and engineering behaviour of <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils and the inapplicability of conventional soil mechanics concepts. The majority of the available results, conclusions and recommendations in the existing literature refer to residual <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils only, with very little information regarding the characteristics and behaviour of transported <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils being reported. The characteristics and behaviour of a number of transported <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soil horizons, from a selected area in the Mayoko region of the Republic of the Congo, were evaluated through conventional and specialised testing regimes during the completion of this study. A large number of disturbed and undisturbed samples were collected from the study area and submitted to geotechnical laboratories in South Africa to establish the chemical-, mineralogical-, index and mechanical properties of these soils. The test results, sample preparation and test procedures and effect of these on the engineering behaviour of the material were evaluated and compared to the typical results reported for residual <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils in the literature. A number of the findings from this study, particularly the sensitivity of <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils to change in moisture content and effect of the dispersing agent on the reported particle size distribution of such soils, confirmed the findings which {{have been reported in the}} literature for residual <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils. However, the transported <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils were also found to differ markedly from residual <b>tropical</b> <b>red</b> soils in certain aspects, most notably in terms of the apparent effect of the lack of remnant structure on the material mechanical properties, permeability, sample disturbance and relevance of tests completed on remoulded test specimens.

In this study, an attempt has been made to utilize locally available soil <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> as liner material. The collected <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> contains mostly quartz and kaolinitic minerals. Studies have shown that bentonite content higher than 20 % by weight is not usually required. This study aims to assess the <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> with 20 % by weight of bentonite as liner material. Further the studies are being carried out to improve the amended material by stabilizing the mixture with 1 % by weight of lime. The relative merits of the Ne materials under different physico-chemical environments are studied. The assessment of the liner material is based on their basic and geotechnical properties. The studies reveal that the geotechnical properties of <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> with 20 % by weight bentonite stabilized with 1 % by weight of lime enhanced,particularly after curing for sufficient period. The pore fluids suchas HCl and $CCl_{ 4 }$ increased volume change. The hydraulic conductivity of soils, which increased on treating with lime initially, decreased withcuring. However, the hydraulic conductivity, of stabilized soilincreased in the presence of HCl and $CCl_{ 4 }$. The strength of stabilized soil is affected with the fluids NaCl and HCl solutions...|$|R

40|$|Locally {{available}} soils amended {{with sufficient}} bentonite are generally used {{for construction of}} liners for water and waste retention facilities. The amount of bentonite required to keep the hydraulic conductivity low varies {{with the nature of}} the local soil. Many studies have shown that bentonite content higher than 20 % by weight is not usually required. This is also the case with Indian <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> containing predominantly quartz and kaolinite minerals. Incorporating bentonite, though keeps the hydraulic conductivity of soil low, increases the swelling and shrinkage potential; increases the loss of strength due to reduction in cohesion. This paper aims to improve the geotechnical properties of <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> and bentonite mixture with lime or cement. The studies reveal that the geotechnical properties of <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> with 20 % by weight bentonite stabilised with 1 % by weight of lime or cement are greatly enhanced, particularly after curing for 28 days. {{it has been shown that}} the early gain in strength is better with cement whereas its long-term strength gain is better with lime...|$|R

40|$|A clay-like deposit {{known as}} 'red earth' is widely {{distributed}} over the terraces and high {{lands of the}} Yangtze River valley in southeast China. Its typical pedo-stratigraphical features have attracted the interest of pedologists and geologists for many years, although its origin is still debated. Here we report an analyses of the grain-size distributions, rare-earth element (BEE) patterns and upper continental crust (UCC) -normalised major elemental composition of the <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> and compare them {{with those of the}} loess and other aeolian deposits in northern China. The results show that the <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> in southeast China has two or three end-member grain-size distributions similar to the sedimentary characteristics and geochemical composition of aeolian deposits found in northern China. Together with other evidence from field observations, these results suggest that the <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> is probably of acolian origin. On the basis of these data, we suggest that thick aeolian dusts were also deposited in the wet subtropics and that the effect of the winter monsoonal winds upon the dust transport in eastern China was more important than previously believed.
