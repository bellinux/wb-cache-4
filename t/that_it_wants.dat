60|$|This {{is one of}} {{the strongest}} {{instances}} of the particular kind of evil that arises from our English form of the worship of athletics. It concentrates too much upon the success of individuals. It began, quite naturally and rightly, with wanting England to win. The second stage was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> some Englishmen to win. The third stage was (in the ecstasy and agony of some special competition) <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> one particular Englishman to win.

An anti-piracy coalition known as Combined Task Force 150 established a Maritime Security Patrol Area in the Gulf of Aden, aided by India and Russia. By 2010, these patrols were paying off, with a steady drop in the number of incidents. As of October 2017, there were no major vessels or hostages remaining in pirate captivity.|$|E

500|$|Andre Dellamorte of Collider called Item 47 [...] "silly". William Bibbiani of Crave Online said, [...] "The short {{is largely}} a success: [...] Hernandez, [...] Bradford and [...] Caplan are all in fine form although, [...] Welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue, {{particularly}} in regards to Coulson, which doesn’t entirely sell." [...] Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, [...] " [...] is easily the best one they've done, and I think that {{can be attributed to}} its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush to show us everything <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to - we get a clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view." ...|$|E

Fatemeh Fakhraie, founder of Muslimah Media Watch, a diversity advocacy group, told Al Jazeera America that [...] "She {{is going to be}} a window into the American Muslim experience" [...] and that she [...] "normalizes this idea of the American experience as Muslim." [...] Brett White of Comic Book Resources said, [...] "With Kamala Khan, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants living in Jersey City, Marvel Comics has shown yet again <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to include groups of the American population that have yet to be personally inspired by their heroes." [...] Hussein Rashid writing for CNN said, [...] "The character of Kamala Khan has the opportunity to offer something new to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims. She is born in the United States, appears to be part of the post-9/11 generation and is a teenager." [...] Muaaz Khan of The Guardian compared Kamala Khan to Malala Yousafzai and indicated that the rest of entertainment industry should follow Marvel's example. However, Dr. Leon Moosavi of the University of Liverpool felt that the character's family would reinforce the stereotype of restrictive Muslim parents and that her shape-shifting ability resembled several anti-Muslim stereotypes, especially taqiyya: a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are at risk of significant persecution. Political satirist Stephen Colbert joked about Marvel's decision to introduce a Muslim superhero on his television show. Comedian Conan O'Brien also made a joke via Twitter, linking the character's religion to polygamy, but later removed it due to public backlash.|$|E

2500|$|Columbia University {{received}} $1 {{million in}} Hanban funds over five years, {{to begin a}} CI. Professor Robert Barnett, {{the director of the}} Modern Tibetan Studies Program, described a [...] "strange silence about Tibet and other sensitive issues when it comes to Columbia, academics, and talks of China." [...] Barnett said, [...] "The issue is not China wants to promote itself and pay for Chinese to be taught.
