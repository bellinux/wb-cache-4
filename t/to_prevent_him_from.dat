5|$|Upon the Doom Slayer's {{return to}} Mars, Hayden confiscates the Crucible, which {{he plans to}} use in his research. Despite all that has happened, Earth is too desperate for energy to give up. Hayden says he cannot kill the Doom Slayer; <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> interfering, Hayden teleports him to an {{undisclosed}} location, saying that they will meet again.|$|E
5|$|After Henry's death, the Welsh {{attempted}} {{to drive out}} the Norman lords who had been extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign. Pain was with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from June to August 1136, early in the king's reign. Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain, and kept him at the siege to more easily monitor his actions, and <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> defecting to Matilda's cause.|$|E
5|$|At Philadelphia Mutual Savings Bank, a {{group of}} men led by Agent Mitchell Loeb break in and use a machine that makes it {{possible}} to walk through the bank's wall. Several men pass through the wall and steal a safe deposit box numbered 610. One of the men is unable to make it back through however before the wall solidifies again, and he is left stuck inside the wall; Loeb shoots him in the head <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> talking, and they leave.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} trap Williams, Power asked Williams {{to meet him}} at Moorgate Street Station the {{following}} day. Police were lying in wait and arrested both Power and Williams at the Moorgate station. Police covered Williams's head with an apron <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> being photographed and thus possibly influencing witnesses. However, no one had glimpsed the murderer's face, and no one selected Williams from an identity parade. Power was immediately released.|$|E
5|$|Symeon Magister {{records the}} death of Helena on 14 January 940, and on 2 February of the same year, Constantine married his second wife, Theophano Mamas. Constantine had a son, named Romanos, {{but it is not}} {{recorded}} by which of his two wives. This Romanos was castrated in 945, after the Lekapenoi lost power, <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> claiming the Byzantine throne. He nevertheless pursued a career in the court, eventually reaching the rank of patrikios and the post of Eparch of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{family would}} have {{preferred}} him to have remained at Charterhouse for two more years {{and then go on}} to Cambridge University. They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling it would be wrong <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E
50|$|In 1891, Rabbi Avrohom {{sent his}} son to Palestine to {{purchase}} land for a Hasidic colony. However, the Turkish ban on selling land <b>to</b> foreigners <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> accomplishing this goal.|$|R
50|$|The {{by-election}} attracted six candidates. Local businesswoman and long-standing Liberal Party member Margaret Sheen nominated as an Independent Liberal, {{while the}} Labor Party nominated lawyer Ian Temby QC, {{who had been}} prominent in assisting the Labor Party with court challenges to the government's electoral legislation. Temby accused local real estate agents of discriminating against him with a view <b>to</b> <b>preventing</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> obtaining a campaign office. The Australian Democrats, perennial independent candidate Alf Bussell and another independent who had also stood at the 1977 and 1980 elections also nominated.|$|R

5|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{carried out at}} an Auckland emergency department found that BZP presentations only made a minor contribution to their overdose database with most cases not producing any significant toxicity. Several cases where BZP individually or combined with alcohol or other medicines or illicit drugs resulting in complications exist. One such example is the well publicised case {{of a combination of}} BZP and MDMA by a 23-year-old from Greymouth, New Zealand. Ben Rodham, a DJ, ingested a combination of BZP and MDMA in February 2007, which nearly resulted in his death. Rodham was put into an induced coma in an effort <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> dying. He later recovered.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{grew up on}} {{the family}} farm in North Carolina. He was educated at home and {{received}} little, if any, formal education. Exposed to slaves throughout his childhood, he sympathized with their condition. According to his own account, Coffin became an abolitionist at the age of seven when he asked a slave who was in a chain gang why he was bound. The man replied that it was <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> escaping and returning to his wife and children. The event disturbed Coffin, who considered the impact of a father being taken away from his family.|$|E
5|$|Ishikawa {{attended}} Federal Way High School in Federal Way, Washington, {{where he}} lettered in baseball, leading {{his team to}} the Washington State Class 4A Title as a junior in 2001 and to the title game as a senior in 2002. He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants. The Giants gave him a $955,000 bonus <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> attending Oregon State University. The bonus was the highest back then for a non-first-round player, cued on by the organization's approaching signing deadline. The Giants could afford to pay a 21st-round pick that much because their higher picks had signed quickly for routine bonuses.|$|E
50|$|Asahel Collins Beckwith (1827-1896) was {{a senator}} from Wyoming. A Democrat, {{he was born in}} Mentor, Ohio, and was {{appointed}} to serve in Washington from 1893 to 1895 in the 53rd United States Congress, but his resignation due <b>to</b> investigation <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> taking office.|$|R

5|$|On March 30, 2008, at WrestleMania XXIV, Hardy {{made his}} {{televised}} return to WWE programming in the Money in the Bank ladder match by {{cutting through the}} crowd, and attacking MVP <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> winning the match. He made his official in-ring return the next night on Raw, losing a singles match to WWE Champion Randy Orton. On the April 4 episode of SmackDown!, Hardy faced MVP in a non-title match, which he won, re-igniting their storyline rivalry. On April 27, 2008, Hardy defeated MVP to win the United States Championship at Backlash, and successfully retained his title against MVP five days later on Smackdown.|$|E
5|$|Plume {{harvesting}} {{became a}} dangerous business. The Audubon Society became {{concerned with the}} amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> hunting. Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903.|$|E
5|$|As Cayman-Global attacks Eurocorp's New York HQ, Kilo and Lily head towards Denham's office <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> {{activating}} {{the kill}} switch on their DART chips. Kilo has {{to fight off}} both Eurocorp and Cayman-Global forces, {{as well as several}} EuroCorp agents. At the top of the tower, he is forced to fight Merit and two other agents, who are under Denham's orders to kill him. Kilo defeats the agents, and overpowers and kills Merit. Kilo then heads towards Denham's office but finds Denham has activated his kill switch, which starts to affect Kilo's movements. Weakened, Kilo confronts Denham, who justifies abducting him as a child. Kilo manages to fight against the kill-switch order and corners Denham, who lets himself fall over a ledge to his death. As the game ends, Eurocorp lies in ruins and Lily gives Kilo a pistol, telling him that he is free from anyone's control.|$|E
50|$|On 14 October 1915, Fierro {{died after}} being thrown from {{his horse and}} landing in quicksand. At the time, Fierro was marching toward Sonora when he {{encountered}} the quicksand at the Casas Grandes Lagoon. The weight of his belt, loaded with gold coins and material is said <b>to</b> have <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> being able <b>to</b> escape.|$|R

50|$|Pearson almost faced {{impeachment}} in 1870, {{after he}} was perceived by Democrats as acquiescing to Gov. William W. Holden's actions against the Ku Klux Klan. But the presence of many of Pearson's former students in the legislature is believed <b>to</b> have <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> being impeached. Instead, Pearson presided over Holden's impeachment trial, {{the only one in}} North Carolina history.|$|R
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{developed}} a new ploy for the 1967–68 season by {{standing next to the}} goalkeeper during corners <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> coming out to collect the ball; this created havoc for opposition defences and is still a frequently used tactic in the modern era. However, for the second successive season Leeds finished fourth and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals, this time losing 1–0 to Everton at Old Trafford. They finally won major honours though by beating Arsenal 1–0 in the final of the League Cup; Terry Cooper scored the only goal of the game despite allegations that Charlton pushed goalkeeper Jim Furnell in the build up to the goal. Leeds then went on to lift the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after beating CA Spora Luxembourg, FK Partizan (Yugoslavia), Hibernian (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland) and Dundee (Scotland) to reach the final with Hungarian club Ferencvárosi. They won 1–0 at Elland Road and drew 0–0 in Budapest to claim their first European trophy.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles {{had failed to}} control Washington. During the trial, {{numerous}} players and coaches {{who were at the}} game testified, while Washington sat at the defense table, listening to himself be portrayed as a dangerous rogue. Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.|$|E
25|$|Lane {{returned}} to Australia in 2009. An {{article in the}} Australian Women's Day stated that his father's deteriorating health brought him back <b>to</b> Australia and <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> returning <b>to</b> Europe despite some lucrative offers.|$|R
50|$|Liston said he {{quit the}} fight {{because of a}} {{shoulder}} injury, {{and there has been}} speculation since about whether the injury was severe enough <b>to</b> actually <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> continuing. Immediately after the fight, Liston told broadcasters that he hurt the shoulder in the first round. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician for the Miami Beach Boxing Commission, diagnosed Liston with a torn tendon in his left shoulder.|$|R

5|$|His lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl, felt Hess {{was too old}} {{and frail}} to have managed to kill himself. Wolf Rüdiger Hess {{repeatedly}} claimed {{that his father had}} been murdered by the British Secret Intelligence Service <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> revealing information about British misconduct during the war. Abdallah Melaouhi, who served as Hess's medical orderly from 1982 to 1987, was dismissed from his position at his local district parliament's Immigration and Integration Advisory Council after he wrote a self-published book on a similar theme. According to an investigation by the British government in 1989, the available evidence did not back up the claim that Hess was murdered, and Solicitor General Sir Nicholas Lyell saw no grounds for further investigation. Moreover, the autopsy results support the conclusion that Hess had killed himself. A report released in 2012 again raised the question of whether Hess was murdered. Historian Peter Padfield claims the suicide note found on the body appears to have been written when Hess was hospitalised in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Marshall's vice {{presidency}} is most remembered for a leadership crisis following a stroke that incapacitated Wilson in October 1919. Because {{of their personal}} dislike for him, Wilson's advisers and wife Edith sought to keep Marshall uninformed about the president's condition <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> assuming presidential powers and duties. Many people, including cabinet officials and Congressional leaders, urged Marshall to become acting president, {{but he refused to}} forcibly assume the presidency for fear of setting a precedent. Without strong leadership in the executive branch, the administration's opponents defeated the ratification of the League of Nations treaty and effectively returned the United States to an isolationist foreign policy. Marshall is also the only known Vice President of the United States to have been exclusively targeted in an assassination attempt while in office.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{a certain}} phase in John Mitford's {{character}} which {{had not yet been}} discovered by his friends, and was known only to his wife. He was romantic--powerfully so. To wander through unknown lands and be a discoverer had been the dream of his youth. He was naturally reticent, and had never said so to any one but Peggy, who, being the reverse of romantic, was somewhat awe-stricken by the discovery, and, in an imbecile way, encouraged him to hope that, [...] "one of these days he'd 'ave 'is desires gratified, as there was nothink <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>'im</b> <b>from</b> goin' <b>to</b> Novazealand--if that was the right way to pronounce it--or to Van Demons land--not in a sinful way of course, for they had given up transportin' people there now--though wherever they transported 'em to she couldn't imagine--anyhow, there was nothink <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> his tryin'."
