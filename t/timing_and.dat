5|$|The {{control of}} migration, its <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> {{response}} are genetically controlled {{and appear to}} be a primitive trait that is present even in non-migratory species of birds. The ability to navigate and orient themselves during migration is a much more complex phenomenon that may include both endogenous programs as well as learning.|$|E
5|$|Within a population, it {{is common}} for {{different}} ages and/or sexes to have different patterns of <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> distance. Female chaffinches Fringilla coelebs in Eastern Fennoscandia migrate earlier in the autumn than males do.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males and}} most adult females start their pre-winter moult before {{returning}} south, but complete most feather replacement on the wintering grounds. In Kenya, males moult 3–4 weeks {{ahead of the}} females, finishing before December, whereas females typically complete feather replacement during December and early January. Juveniles moult from their first summer body plumage into winter plumage during late September to November, and later undergo a pre-breeding moult similar in <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> duration {{to that of the}} adults, and often producing as brightly coloured an appearance.|$|E

5|$|Bakshi {{received}} a pay raise, {{but was not}} as satisfied with his career advancement as he had anticipated; Rasinski had died in 1965, Bakshi did not have creative control over The Mighty Heroes, and he was unhappy {{with the quality of}} the animation, writing, <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> voice acting. Although the series' first 20 segments were successful, Bakshi wanted to leave Terrytoons to form his own company. In 1967, he drew up presentation pieces for a fantasy series called Tee-Witt, with help from Anzilotti, Johnnie Zago and Bill Foucht.|$|E

The Naval Ordnance Laboratory handled the blast measurement tests, while the Naval Research Laboratory conducted the radiation measurement experiments, and Argonne National Laboratory did gamma ray measurements.

On October 18, 2010, The Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3, with Disney, Marvel, and Paramount announcing a May 3, 2013 release date for the film.|$|E
5|$|In December 1903 Mark Twain, {{who opposed}} vivisection, {{published}} a short story, A Dog's Tale, in Harper's, written {{from the point}} of view of a dog whose puppy is experimented on and killed. Given the <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> Twain's views, the story may have been inspired by the libel trial, according to Mark Twain scholar Shelley Fisher Fishkin. Coleridge ordered 3,000 copies of A Dog's Tale, which were specially printed for him by Harper's.|$|E
5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E

5|$|Operation Overlord was {{the name}} {{assigned}} {{to the establishment of}} a large-scale lodgement on the Continent. The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune. To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies undertook a bombing campaign (codenamed Operation Pointblank) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields. Elaborate deceptions, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, were undertaken {{in the months leading up}} to the invasion to prevent the Germans from learning the <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> location of the invasion.|$|E
5|$|The 32X is {{considered}} a commercial failure. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price {{of the system and}} power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.|$|E
5|$|The Phase 2 {{budget was}} {{originally}} $1.5 billion, {{which would be}} used to start construction of the tunnels; the MTA reduced the amount of money allocated in the budget, projecting that the agency {{would not be able to}} start construction by the end of the 5-year cycle in 2019. Although the MTA previously expressed concerns about funding the Capital Program, a spokesman stated that the reduction in funding was a result of uncertain <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> not money problems. The delay had upset politicians and residents of East Harlem, who objected to the 3-to-4-year delay.|$|E

This success was underpinned by the Ottoman infantry's ability to make the gruelling march across the Sinai Peninsula and be fit enough to then launch attacks with force and determination.|$|E
5|$|A {{role-playing}} game, it {{centers on}} a battle system {{different from that of}} traditional games of the genre, with emphasis on <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> more elaborate attacks.

Superstar Saga was critically acclaimed, and IGN named it the twelfth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in their feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's lifespan. A remake of the game for Nintendo 3DS, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, was released on October 6, 2017.|$|E
5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E

5|$|As one on an {{official}} mission, Wright {{would probably have}} offered greetings to Leopold's ambassador extraordinary in London, the Marqués de Lede, and to Alonso de Cárdenas, the regular Habsburg ambassador, who had also been engaged since 1649 in art procurement for the Spanish Monarch. The lack of records means that the <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> duration of this visit remain uncertain. However, de Lede left in late June, and de Cárdenas {{a few weeks later}} – as relations between Cromwell and the Habsburgs deteriorated – so Wright probably arrived back in Flanders, with any acquisitions he had made, just in time to learn of the Archduke's impending departure – and that of his huge art collection – from Brussels in the autumn of 1655.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1917, the British and French were still searching {{for a way to}} achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the river Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.|$|E
5|$|Botha, who {{had been}} asked by the Union's first Governor-General Viscount Gladstone to form a government, began to make {{policies}} and speeches that appeared to Coghlan to be unfair to South Africans of British origin. The Attorney-General J. B. M. Hertzog interpreted the convention {{in a way that}} Coghlan considered to be to the detriment of English-speakers. Coghlan came to the conclusion in 1910 that Southern Rhodesia's joining the Union was much further off than he had previously thought, though he still saw it as the territory's inevitable destiny, whose <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> terms the local electorate must determine. At this time, he rejected the notion of responsible government—self-government while retaining colonial status—on the grounds that he thought it would take up to two decades to achieve. He was furthermore against the idea of keeping Rhodesia for English-speaking settlers, seeing in that end the same racial discrimination he perceived the Dutch-speakers to be displaying against the British in the Union.|$|E
