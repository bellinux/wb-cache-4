5|$|Braithwaite had {{a further}} period {{in command of}} the {{division}} while Russell was on sick leave in late October and in early December led his brigade in attacks on Polderhoek Chateau. The brigade suffered heavy losses and the attack was regarded as a failure. At <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Braithwaite was one of the longest serving brigade commanders of the NZEF. Worn down by stresses of command, his health was so poor it forced his evacuation to England.|$|E
5|$|Combined Operations {{examined}} {{a number of}} options while planning {{the destruction of the}} dock. At <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war the British government still tried to avoid civilian casualties. This ruled out a bombing attack by the RAF, which at the time did not possess the accuracy needed to destroy the dock without serious loss of civilian life.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fighting}} that James Llewellyn Davies earned the Victoria Cross (VC). Davies, alone, attacked a German machine gun position after previously failed efforts {{had resulted in}} numerous British deaths. He killed one German and captured another {{as well as the}} gun. Although he was wounded, he then led an attack to kill a sniper who had been harassing his unit. Davies subsequently died of his wounds.|$|E

5|$|The 1991–92 FA Cup third-round {{match between}} Wrexham and Arsenal was {{played at the}} Racecourse Ground, Wrexham on 4 January 1992. Billed as a {{potential}} cup upset by the media, the visitors went into the match as favourites given the gulf in divisions that separated the two teams. Arsenal entered the FA Cup in the third round, as they participated in the Football League First Division, while Wrexham of the Fourth Division won their first two ties to reach <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Tobruk {{marked a}} rare defeat for German {{armoured}} forces at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. For {{his part in}} the battle, Morshead was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 6 January 1942. He was also awarded the Virtuti Militari by the Polish government in Exile and was decorated by Generał broni Władysław Sikorski on 21 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|The HVO, {{supported}} by Croatian Army artillery deployed {{north of the}} river, managed to withstand the offensive and the front line remained unchanged from the commencement of the battle. This demonstrated the changed balance of power at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. At the commencement of the war, the VRS had greater military capabilities than its opponents, particularly in terms of heavy weapons and organisation, but over three years from mid-1992 its capabilities had been matched by its adversaries.|$|E

5|$|The {{explosive}} phreatomagmatic eruptions {{caused by}} the easy access of water to the erupting vents threw rocks up to a kilometre (0.6mi) away from the island, and sent ash clouds as high as 10km (6mi) up into the atmosphere. The loose pile of unconsolidated tephra would quickly have been washed away had the supply of fresh magma dwindled, and large clouds of dust were often seen blowing away from the island during <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eruption.|$|E
5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, it generates thermal {{energy in the}} dense core region through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium. During <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes {{its way to the}} surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{operations}} of 21–23 August, the frontline had been established to the east of the Albert-Arras railway line with {{all but one of the}} ridges to the south and west of Bapaume held by IV Corps. However, the 5th Division had been unsuccessful in its attacks which left the ridge running from Loupart Wood to Grévillers and then onto Biefvillers still in the hands of the Germans. Although over 2,000 prisoners of war had been taken during this period along with 25 field guns, the 5th Division had suffered 1,600 casualties by <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle.|$|E

5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Braithwaite, {{a popular}} commander, was {{temporarily}} {{in charge of}} the division while Russell was on leave. The last of the brigade commanders who had embarked with the NZEF in 1914, he was worn out and in January was evacuated to England for treatment. On recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division. There were rumours amongst the soldiers of the division that this was a punishment for his refusal to carry on with the 12 October attack at Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|Austrian {{troops were}} also promised, to be {{dispatched}} from the Austrian Army fighting the French in Northern Italy. These troops could only reach Toulon by sea, scheduled to embark {{from the city}} port of Genoa, capital of the Italian state of the Republic of Genoa, which at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war was officially neutral. Genoa was however, in common with other Northern Italian cities, {{in a state of}} political upheaval. The French Revolution had inspired similarly-minded revolutionaries in Italy to support Republican ideas, and there was a substantial Republican faction in the Genoese government which supported France's cause. Food supplies were regularly shipped from Genoa to the Republican armies in Southern France, and the demands of Francis Drake, Ambassador to Genoa, that this trade cease went unheeded.|$|E
5|$|Bosanquet {{was one of}} the few bowlers in the MCC team not to {{have some}} success in the opening two matches of the tour, {{although}} he impressed Warner. In addition, he scored 79 runs with the bat in the second game. The third match of the tour was against New South Wales; Bosanquet took four for 60, and his googly caused many problems, particularly for Australia's opening batsman Reggie Duff. He continuously defeated the batsmen, maintaining his length effectively through the innings. By <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tour, Warner believed that Bosanquet was potentially the best bowler in a strong attack if he could bowl a good length, particularly on hard, fast pitches which normally would favour the batsmen. However, Bosnaquet's bowling form remained erratic; in a minor match against a weak side, the opposing captain made a joke about his team's bowling being no worse than Bosanquet's.|$|E

50|$|Ternina {{appeared}} at the 1899 Bayreuth Festival in <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> Kundry in Parsifal. According to Oxford's concise operatic dictionary, this {{would prove to be}} her sole appearance at Bayreuth. On January 27, 1900, Ternina made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City as Elisabeth in Tannhäuser. During her fruitful association with the Met she sang Kundry in Parsifal's first American performance. Because <b>this</b> <b>staging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opera was not authorized by the Wagner family, she was never again invited to appear at Bayreuth, despite her stature as an artist.|$|R

5|$|By <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insurgency, the MNLA {{had largely}} split into {{small groups of}} guerrillas, which existed by basing {{themselves}} in a chosen rural area, subverting local villagers and accumulating from them manpower and supplies. The lot of any security forces posted nearby was to play a constant game of hide-and-seek with the communists, whereby the army would indefinitely search for and destroy any base camps and food caches the MNLA set up. The Commonwealth leaders surmised that the MNLA could not possibly resist such a campaign forever, and would, in time, simply give up attempting to regroup.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, Allied {{submarine}} attacks effectively cut off {{the supply}} of oil from Southeast Asia to Japan and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S.Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by loading drums of oil on freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle {{manager in}} February 2006, Bruce was again {{linked with the}} job, which {{ultimately}} went to Glenn Roeder. By <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2005–06 season, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed {{to climb out of}} the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} nearly six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Great Britain was {{waging war}} against Italian forces in North Africa and their allies, Rommel's Afrika Korps. Malta was {{critical}} to this campaign During <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Malta was critically short on munitions, food and aviation fuel. Attempts to run the blockade and resupply Malta {{proved to be a}} failure; previous convoys such as Harpoon (from Gibraltar) and Vigorous (from Alexandria, Egypt) had lost most of their merchantmen and their escorts had been damaged. A new convoy was hence planned for mid-August, and named Pedestal.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Cole handed NWA over to Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth. At <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the Allies were {{advancing}} {{north and}} the tempo of operations in the Darwin area had decreased. Charlesworth raised concerns regarding No.80 Wing, warning higher command that its morale would drop {{if it was not}} either given {{a more active role in}} the war or transferred to southern Australia for rest. By October, the wing had received orders to depart NWA for Morotai to join the First Tactical Air Force; this left NWA with twelve squadrons at its disposal, including one Liberator unit and three other Spitfire squadrons. In the meantime, NWA supported the assault on Leyte with attacks on enemy ports, oil facilities, and shipping in the Dutch East Indies using Beaufighters, Mitchells, and Liberators. These operations continued through November and December. By then, NWA headquarters staff numbered 651, including 156 officers.|$|E
5|$|In the FA Cup, Rovers {{have reached}} the quarter-final stage on three occasions.

The second time they reached the quarter final was in 1957–58, when they lost to Fulham, and the most recent appearance at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition was during the 2007–08 season, when they faced West Bromwich Albion. They were the first Division Three team to win an FA Cup tie away to a Premier League side, when in 2002 they beat Derby County 3–1 at Pride Park Stadium.|$|E
