5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: {{a device that}} would further refute the principle of horror vacui.

5|$|Large lengths, such as {{the radius}} of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often {{expressed}} in terms of the astronomical unit — approximately equal to the mean distance between <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 million miles). In 2012, the IAU defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.|$|E

NASA continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003), Cassini(1997–2017), and Juno (2011–).|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} a star is {{expressed in terms of}} its apparent magnitude.

5|$|The first comet whose orbit {{had been}} found to take it {{extremely}} close to the Sun was the Great Comet of 1680.

5|$|The {{impact of}} scenes is {{heightened}} by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm face of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> depths of dark space, {{the chaos and}} unpredictability of the debris field, and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect.

5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E

5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day. Using the new high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce {{the gap between the}} two countries.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} located {{approximately}} 350 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Piscis Austrinus, orbiting the star HD 205739. This planet has a minimum mass 37% more than Jupiter and orbits 90% of the distance between <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sun. The planet has a very elliptical orbit, which has led its discoverers to postulate that the planet's surface temperature varies by about 100 K along the entire orbit. This planet was reported on September 5, 2008 after its discovery at Las Campanas Observatory, where the planet was observed for years by the N2K Consortium while using the Magellan Telescopes. Follow-up observations collected the radial velocity measurements necessary to confirm the candidate as a planet.|$|E

He received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1962 and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1990, and was the last surviving member of the Mercury Seven.|$|E

5|$|In 1871 {{he became}} the first Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge. Maxwell was put in charge of the {{development}} of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus.

5|$|In this treatise, Archimedes {{counts the}} number of grains of sand that will fit inside the universe. This book {{mentions}} the heliocentric theory {{of the solar system}} proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas about the size of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that {{the number of}} grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. The Sand Reckoner or Psammites is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Its {{estimated}} mass is over 23.04 {{times that of}} Jupiter. Additionally, HIP 78530 b orbits its host star at an estimated average distance of 710 AU, which is 710 times the average distance between <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sun assuming the brown dwarf has a circular orbit. The average distance between dwarf planet Pluto and the Sun is 39.482 AU, meaning that HIP 78530 b orbits its host star nearly eighteen times further than Pluto orbits the Sun. In accordance with the data, HIP 78530 b would complete an orbit approximately every 12,000 years, although the actual orbital motion of HIP 78530 b is most likely smaller than 710 AU, {{but it has not}} been directly observed long enough to know definitively.|$|E
