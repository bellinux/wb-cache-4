25|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} work of anthropologists seems <b>to</b> <b>single</b> <b>out</b> clearly a domain of knowledge that heretofore has not been treated by any other science.

25|$|Since organic chemists are {{particularly}} interested in molecular structures, it might be useful to be able <b>to</b> <b>single</b> <b>out</b> individual molecular units interactively from the drawing. Organic molecular units need to be given both as 2D structural formulae and full 3D molecular structures. Molecules on special-symmetry positions need to be reconstructed from the asymmetric unit. Protein crystallographers are interested in molecular structures of biological macromolecules, so that provisions {{need to be made}} to be able to represent molecular subunits as helices, sheets, or coils, respectively.|$|E

In the boardroom, in spite of criticising their contributions, Paul refused <b>to</b> <b>single</b> <b>out</b> Saira or Rachel to be fired, annoying Sir Alan further. However Paul survived due to the fact that Rachel failed to deliver a successful pitch despite her experience, and had an inferior track record over him.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, a three digit code is {{attached}} to the recipe number by hyphenation. The first digit of this code represents the year the cake was produced, and the other two numbers indicate the production number within that year. For instance, the seven digit sequence 8653-602, would indicate the second production in 2006 of factory recipe 8653. Some productions of cakes are valued over others because production numbers can indicate if a tea was produced earlier or later in a season/year. This information allows one to be able <b>to</b> <b>single</b> <b>out</b> tea cakes produced using a better batch of máochá.|$|E

While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to rescind the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a simple majority. Additionally, such proposals could not be filibustered.|$|E

25|$|Marshall's {{tribunal}} {{declared that}} no extraordinary {{decision was made}} <b>to</b> <b>single</b> <b>out</b> Dresden (e.g. {{to take advantage of}} the large number of refugees, or purposely terrorize the German populace). It was argued that the intent of area bombing was to disrupt communications and destroy industrial production. The American inquiry established that the Soviets, pursuant to allied agreements for the United States and the United Kingdom to provide air support for the Soviet offensive toward Berlin, had requested area bombing of Dresden to prevent a counterattack through Dresden, or the use of Dresden as a regrouping point after a strategic retreat.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, {{it became}} the {{standard}} to build mathematical theories on axiomatic set theory. The creation of axiomatically founded generalized theories, such as the general topology, served among other things <b>to</b> <b>single</b> <b>out</b> the common structural core for various specific cases or regions and then set up an abstract theory, which contained all these parts as special cases. This brought a great success {{in the form of}} simplification and harmonization and ultimately brought on economy of thought with itself. Hausdorff himself highlighted this aspect in the Principles. The topological chapter the basic concepts are methodologically a pioneering effort, and they showed the way for the development of modern mathematics.|$|E
25|$|The {{thylacine}} was exclusively carnivorous. Its {{stomach was}} muscular, and could distend {{to allow the}} animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce. Analysis of the skeletal frame and observations of it in captivity suggest that it preferred <b>to</b> <b>single</b> <b>out</b> a target animal and pursue that animal until it was exhausted. Some studies conclude that the animal may have hunted in small family groups, with the main group herding prey {{in the general direction}} of an individual waiting in ambush. Trappers reported it as an ambush predator.|$|E

25|$|One {{advantage}} of group living can be decreased predation. If {{the number of}} predator attacks stays the same despite increasing prey group size, each prey may have a reduced risk of predator attacks through the dilution effect. Additionally, a predator that is confused by a mass of individuals can find it more difficult <b>to</b> <b>single</b> <b>out</b> one target. For this reason, the zebra's stripes offer not only camouflage in a habitat of tall grasses, but also the {{advantage of}} blending into a herd of other zebras. In groups, prey can also actively reduce their predation risk through more effective defence tactics, or through earlier detection of predators through increased vigilance.|$|E
25|$|As head of JPMorgan Chase, Dimon {{oversaw the}} {{transfer}} of $25 billion in funds from the U.S. Treasury Department to the bank on October 28, 2008, under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This was the fifth largest amount transferred under Section A of TARP to help troubled assets related to residential mortgages. It has been widely reported that JPMorgan Chase was in much better financial shape than other banks and did not need TARP funds but accepted the funds because {{the government did not}} want <b>to</b> <b>single</b> <b>out</b> only the banks with capital issues. JPMorgan Chase advertised in February 2009 that it would be using its capital-base monetary strength to acquire new businesses.|$|E

It is the string-course, a protruding ornament that circumscribes the median part of the façade and is made of various materials: stone, brick, plaster. At first sight it appears to be an agreeable, ingenious aesthetic solution, since the horizontal line it emphasizes enters into a pleasant dialogue with the vertical arches, windows, pillars and other upright elements.
