50|$|The {{station has}} three {{platform}} tracks, which are numbered 2-4, {{as the former}} track 1 was not intended for passenger services. Track 1 has been abandoned and only the track bed and a <b>track</b> <b>indicator</b> board mark its location. The freight loading track ended at {{the eastern part of}} the station and was accessible via a platform adjacent to the entrance building warehouse; this allowed loading end-on and from the south side. The warehouse had loading ramps for trucks on its south side; it is now used for a restaurant. Following the dismantling of track 1, marshalling and stabling tracks were abandoned on the eastern apron of the station as well as some loading ramps. In their place a station parking area was built east of the station forecourt. The loading tracks that formerly connected to the premises of Imperial (now part of Miele) and other companies in Ennigloh (which is north of the station), are no longer available. There is still a connecting track to a building material establishment, but this has not been used for several years. Formerly, there was also a track 5 on the north side; this was also not intended for passenger operations.|$|E
40|$|Although {{work-life balance}} {{programs}} in the United States have become increasingly popular through the years, {{there is still a}} need to understand the contributions of these programs on employee performance. The purpose of this case study was to explore the work-life balance programs that nonprofit school leaders utilize to improve employee performance at a charter school organization. The job demands-resources model formed the conceptual framework for this study. Data were collected through semistructured interviews from a purposeful sample of 10 managers and 10 non-managerial employees working at a charter school organization in Harlem, New York. Data collection also included organizational performance <b>track</b> <b>indicator</b> documents on employee absenteeism, turnover, motivation, productivity, job satisfaction, and retention, archived organizational records on WLB programs, and current WLB programs and policies guidelines. Through methodological triangulation, a number of themes emerged. These themes included work-life balance programs 2 ̆ 7 effectiveness, the importance of a supportive work environment, employee commitment and motivation, employee well-being and productivity, employee job satisfaction and quality work life, organizational culture change, and low utilization of the job sharing program. According to the study results, work-life balance programs could help improve organizational culture and employee overall performance.

The result shows that the <b>track</b> geometry <b>indicators</b> like vertical curve radius, gradients and static geometric deviation under temperature load and wind load are better than the indicators under train load.

However, these indicators invariably give mixed signals at each point in time, thereby hampering attempts at prediction. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for forecasting the global electronics cycle by constructing a VAR model that captures the economic interactions between putative leading indicators representing expectations, orders, inventories and prices. The ability of the indicators to presage world semiconductor sales is first examined by Granger causality tests. Subsequently, an impulse response analysis confirms the leading qualities of the selected indicators. Finally, out-of-sample forecasts of global chip sales are generated from two parsimonious variants of the VAR model, viz., the Bayesian VAR (BVAR) and Bayesian ECM (BECM), and compared with predictions from a bivariate model which uses a composite index of the leading indicators and a univariate autoregressive model.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{significance}} of environmental art {{in the context of}} an increased scientific and technological surveillance of nature. An artefact is often classified as a work of environmental art if it is an artistic artefact that addresses environmental themes or issues regardless the medium, style, and advocacy chosen by the artist. What are the functions that set works of environmental art apart from the functions of scientific enquiry into natural phenomena and environments? How can we identify such functions? A framework is proposed that addresses these questions. In contrast to ahistorical conceptions, we expand historical and psycho-historical theories of artefact functions to explain effects of environmental artworks that are reproduced over history. Reproduced effects are identified that tend to cluster together in environmental art: broadcasting and surveillance of environmental facts, emotions-manipulating processes, and reflection-triggering functions. In contrast to views that assume the axiological neutrality of environmental art, our account predicts that the core functions of environmental arts tend to be tied to normative attitudes. To illustrate this normativity, we discuss how environmental arts can help us <b>track</b> <b>indicators</b> of environmental crises, and how artists can act as agents of psychological, historical, and political environmental change. 11 page(s...|$|R
