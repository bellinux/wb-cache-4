5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic of it, but <b>though</b> <b>I</b> still hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and <b>though</b> <b>I</b> know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E

6000|$|... ‘Why, no, I don’t {{know him}} by that name,’ {{returned}} Flamwell, {{in a low}} tone, and {{with an air of}} immense importance. ‘I have no doubt <b>I</b> know him, <b>though.</b> <b>Is</b> he tall?’ ...|$|R
5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats <b>though</b> <b>I</b> do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
6000|$|ZOO. You {{are getting}} out of my depth: I dont {{understand}} a word you are saying. Married and questionable taste convey nothing to me. Stop, <b>though.</b> <b>Is</b> married an old form of the word mothered? ...|$|R

60|$|Well, never mind! The {{description}} sounds excellently; almost over-romantic, <b>though.</b> <b>Is</b> there steadiness, do you think, and depth, and reliableness altogether? What impression does he make {{among those}} who have known him longest? Dearest Fanny, do nothing in haste.|$|R
5|$|The {{next day}} saw the notable loss of Hauptmann Karl-Heinz Weber, {{commander}} of III./JG 1 {{who was shot}} down and killed by Mustangs. It was from Le Mans that JG 1 started to perform fighter-bomber (Jagdbomber or Jabo) missions, even <b>though</b> <b>I.</b> nor II./JG 1 had any specialised training. On 8 June 1944 both gruppen were sent off on ground-attack missions. 25 Fw 190s of II./JG 1 attacked Allied shipping off the Normandy coast unmolested. RAF aircraft bombed Le Mans airfield {{on the night of}} 9 June, resulting in II./JG 1 losing seven aircraft and five damaged. Oberleutnant Rüdiger von Kirchmayr flew back to 4./JG 1 after hospitalization on 12 June in Störmede, and en route he was attacked by Spitfires over Flers, claiming an unconfirmed kill as a result. There was a follow-up bombing attack on 15 June resulting in a loss of two more Fw 190s.|$|E
25|$|Delivering a eulogy for a {{close friend}} and for someone who was so much admired is never a happy occasion. <b>Though</b> <b>I</b> must confess I would be quite happy to deliver a eulogy for a certain media {{personality}} who's tried the second Kennedy assassination of our time... and failed.|$|E
25|$|In {{two days}} after the {{execution}} of Robespierre, the whole commune of Paris, consisting of about sixty persons, were guillotined in less than one hour and a half, in the Place de la Revolution; and <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was standing above a hundred paces from the place of execution, the blood of the victims streamed under my feet.|$|E

25|$|In Nashville, I {{was running}} eight miles a day, {{hanging out with}} my friends, walking around eating chocolate-chip cookies and playing a lot of drums, which I enjoyed. Life was easy. I was never {{frustrated}} – even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> wasn't fulfilling my contract obligations. If you are failing in Nashville, at least your standard of living is nice. Nashville is {{a nice way to}} fail.|$|E
25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.' I mean, I do not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> would not be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E
25|$|If I say a {{whole system}} must be upset for me to win, I am saying that I cannot sit in the game, and that safer rules {{must be made to}} give me a chance. I {{repudiate}} that. If others are in there, deal me a hand and let me see what I can make of it, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> know some in there are dealing from the bottom and cheating like hell in other ways.|$|E

25|$|With {{reference}} to rumours which I believe were {{at one time}} afloat, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> know not with what degree of currency: and also with {{reference to}} the times when I shall not be here to answer for myself, I desire to record my solemn declaration and assurance, as in the sight of God and before His Judgement Seat, that at no period of my life have I been guilty of the act which is known as that of infidelity to the marriage bed.|$|E
25|$|The {{one that}} {{finished}} my career was when I got hit in my eye by John Maguire from Queensland...He got one to really rear up, and I {{got back to}} hook and it went between the visor and the top part of the helmet and smashed in my eye. That finished me. After that, I didn't want to be there. I thought of other things I wanted to do in life. Even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> continued playing on in Shield {{for two or three}} years, I just didn't want to be there.|$|E
25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

25|$|Next, {{a girl of}} twenty-one {{lay dying}} on a stretcher. The father, a big, gentle Boer {{kneeling}} beside her; while, next tent, his wife was watching a child of six, also dying, and one of about five drooping. Already this couple had lost three children {{in the hospital and}} so would not let these go, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> begged hard to take them out of the hot tent. I can't describe what it is to see these children lying about in a state of collapse. It’s just exactly like faded flowers thrown away. And one has to stand and look on at such misery, {{and be able to do}} almost nothing.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know why}} {{people call me}} a jazz singer, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> guess people {{associate}} me with jazz because I was raised in it, from way back. I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E
25|$|In 839 Jang proved {{instrumental}} in the seizure of power by Silla's King Sinmu following the overthrow of King Minae. Kim Ujing (later King Sinmu) approached Jang for help in taking the throne from the usurper who had killed Ujing‘s father. Jang is purported to have replied, “The ancients had a saying, ‘To see {{what is right and}} not to do it is want of courage.’ <b>Though</b> <b>I</b> am without ability, I shall follow your orders.” Thereupon Jang dispatched a force of 5000 men under the command of his closest companion and adviser Jeong Yeon (who had since also returned from Tang) in support of Sinmu's claim. The success of Sinmu's power grab won Jang Bogo the post of Prime Minister.|$|E
