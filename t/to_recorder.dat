5000|$|In January 1879, McGlory {{was indicted}} {{for running a}} disorderly house. When he {{failed to show up}} in court the {{following}} month, his $500 bail was forfeited but no further action was taken. It was the robbery of a contractor, Bernard Lee, and others that prompted District Attorney John McKeon to search for untried indictments against McGlory. He found three and took them <b>to</b> <b>Recorder</b> Frederick Smythe who then ordered McGlory to appear before the General Sessions court. Though McGlory's lawyer requested bail be set at $500, McKeon raised an objection which was supported by Recorder Smythe and raised to $1,000. As a result of this trial, McGlory spent time in The Tombs and thereafter in the penitentiary on Blackwell's Island. He was freed August 13, 1884. During the time of his trial and subsequent imprisonment, McGlory became a member of The Salvation Army and claimed to support the Temperance movement, however upon release from prison he said that he would not take up the temperance cause as he was an [...] "awful example." ...|$|E

At {{the time of the}} trial, Maria was unable to speak or understand English. Maria admitted everything: how she slit his throat and how he ran after her, but couldn’t reach her and had dropped dead.

50|$|Changes in {{dynamics}} {{are not easy}} to achieve on the recorder if the player is accustomed to other wind instruments. The general belief is that if the player blows harder to play louder, or more softly to play softer, the pitch changes and the note goes out of tune, and unlike the transverse flute, the player cannot change the position of the mouth in relation to the labium in order to compensate, and that therefore the recorder is not capable of dynamic changes. This is misleading. Subtle changes in wind pressure are possible if the player has a good ear for tuning and knows how hard the instrument can be pushed before pitch changes become noticeable. But this is not the correct approach <b>to</b> <b>recorder</b> dynamics. On the recorder it is better to think of the breath controlling pitch, and the fingers controlling dynamics; for example by resting the fingers lightly on the holes breath leaks around them, lifting the pitch; and the resulting instinctive change in breath pressure to bring the pitch back also drops the volume. The recorder is notable for its sensitivity to articulation; in addition to its obvious use for artistic effect skilled players can also use this sensitivity to suggest changes in volume.|$|E

40|$|The often {{opportunistic}} {{nature of}} biological recording via citizen science leads to taxonomic, {{spatial and temporal}} biases which add uncertainty to biodiversity estimates.

We found most volunteers contributed few records and were active for just one day. Each dataset had its own taxonomic and spatial signature suggesting that volunteers’ personal recording preferences may attract them towards particular schemes. There were also patterns across datasets: species’ abundance and ease of identification were positively associated with number of records, as was plant height. We found clear hotspots of recording activity, the 10 most popular sites containing open water. We note that biases are accrued {{as part of the}} recording process (e. g. species’ detectability) as well as from volunteer preferences. An increased understanding of volunteer behaviour gained from analysing the composition of records could thus enhance the fit between volunteers’ interests and the needs of scientific projects...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1993 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaLow cost {{recording}} devices for telemetry {{and other data}} acquisition applications are of vital importance in light of today's shrinking budgets and project cut-backs. The desire to replace large, expensive, multi-channel recorders with smaller, less expensive recorders is becoming commonplace in government and industry. Many of these small recorders {{in the past have}} been limited to a single recording channel, and to one particular data type, due <b>to</b> <b>recorder</b> architectures. The 8 millimeter (8 mm) tape cartridge recorder has been looked at in the past as a low cost recording device, however products utilizing this technology have been strictly limited in the number of channels, and data types. In response to this need, Veda has developed a new data acquisition recorder utilizing an 8 mm recorder packaged in a small, flight qualified rugged enclosure with modular, and interchangeable, input channels. These microprocessor controlled inputs are capable of accepting PCM telemetry, MIL-STD- 1553, voice, IRIG time, and ARINC 429 / 629 data. The new architecture allows for multiplexing of multiple channels onto the single channel tape medium as well as direct playback from the recorder for certain data types.

40|$|Background and Study Aims. The {{presence}} of an implantable electromechanical cardiac device (IED) has long been considered a relative contraindication {{to the performance of}} video capsule endoscopy (CE). The primary aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the safety of CE in patients with IEDs. A secondary purpose was to determine whether IEDs have any impact on images captured by CE. Patients and Methods. A retrospective chart review of all patients who had a capsule endoscopy at Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, AZ, USA, or Rochester, MN, USA, (January 2002 to June 2010) was performed to identify CE studies done on patients with IEDs. One hundred and eighteen capsule studies performed in 108 patients with IEDs were identified and reviewed for demographic data, method of preparation, and study data. Results. The most common indications for CE were obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (77 %), anemia (14 %), abdominal pain (5 %), celiac disease (2 %), diarrhea (1 %), and Crohn’s disease (1 %). Postprocedure assessments did not reveal any detectable alteration on the function of the IED. One patient with an ICD had a 25 -minute loss of capsule imaging due <b>to</b> <b>recorder</b> defect. Two patients with LVADs had interference with capsule image acquisition. Conclusions. CE did not interfere with IED function, including PM, ICD, and/or LVAD and thus appears safe. Additionally, PM and ICD do not appear to interfere with image acquisition but LVAD may interfere with capsule images and require that capsule leads be positioned as far away as possible from the IED to assure reliable image acquisition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{development}} of the electroacoustic genre has presented modern recorder players with a myriad of new and exciting repertoire, but many acoustic musicians are reluctant to explore these new works due to the barriers of technology. Many different electronic devices are used in composition and performance, and this can be daunting for a performer with no previous experience in the field. This resource is designed to assist the performer in the transition from acoustic to electroacoustic performer, and aims to reach performers and teachers of the recorder to encourage more performances of works in this exciting genre. This thesis is primarily of interest <b>to</b> <b>recorder</b> players, but is also useful for composers interested in using recorders in an electroacoustic context. It examines aspects of the recorder which make the instrument particularly well suited to the electroacoustic genre, including acoustics and timbre shifting potential of recorders, and provides information about some compositional ideas which {{are relevant to the}} performer. An understanding of the importance of audience perception and the expression of gesture and texture in the electroacoustic genre creates a more sensitive performance, where the performer is aware of their role {{within the context of the}} music. A discussion of repertoire is arranged in a progression of least to most complicated electronics; this is to assist the performer in learning to use various electronic devices in performance. All recorders and electronics required for performance of selected works are described in relation to each piece, and performance notes are included as well. This knowledge can be applied to the performance of other electroacoustic works, and it is hoped the thesis will encourage performers and composers to collaborate in the production of new works to contribute to the huge body of electroacoustic repertoire for recorders...|$|E
