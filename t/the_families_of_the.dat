2500|$|Once {{discussions with}} <b>the</b> <b>family</b> are {{complete}} and satisfactory {{information about the}} woman is acquired then <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man will proceed to appoint marriage negotiators. It is these very negotiators that will travel to <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman to make known {{the man and his}} intentions. Once <b>the</b> negotiators reach <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman they will be kept in <b>the</b> kraal, inkundla, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman's <b>family.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>family</b> do not possess a kraal they will simply be kept outside the household as they {{will not be allowed to}} enter the household without the acknowledgement and acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman's <b>family.</b> It is here where the lobola (dowry) negotiations will begin. <b>The</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman will give them a bride-price and a date for which they must return to pay that price. The bride-price is dependent on numerous things such as her level <b>of</b> education, <b>the</b> wealth status <b>of</b> her <b>family</b> in comparison to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man's <b>family,</b> what <b>the</b> man stands to gain in the marriage and <b>the</b> overall desirability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman. <b>The</b> payment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bride-price could be in either cattle or money depending on <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman. <b>The</b> modern Xhosa <b>families</b> would rather prefer money as most are situated in the urban cities where there would be no space nor permits for livestock.|$|R
5|$|Muslim women, {{particularly}} {{those from the}} Ayyubid family, the families of local governors, and <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ulema ("religious scholars") took {{an active role in}} Ayyubid architecture.
