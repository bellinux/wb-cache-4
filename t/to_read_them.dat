5|$|Finding himself totally {{alone in}} a {{shattered}} world with food to last him a lifetime but no one to share it with, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that he has {{all the time in the}} world <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> without interruption.|$|E
5|$|Many German radio {{messages}} were encoded using the Enigma machine and other enciphering techniques and the codes were changed frequently. A team of code breakers stationed at Bletchley Park worked to break codes {{as quickly as}} possible to provide advance information on German plans and troop movements. British military intelligence code-named this information Ultra intelligence as it could only be provided to the top level of commanders. The Enigma code used by Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, Oberbefehlshaber West (Supreme Commander West; OB West), commander of the Western Front, was broken by the end of March. German intelligence changed the Enigma codes right after the Allied landings of 6 June but by 17 June the Allies were again consistently able <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rhys {{gives his}} mother her ring {{back and she}} realises that he still loves Vanessa. Rhys {{receives}} a letter from his father, Eddie (Ned Manning), but refuses to open it. Eddie calls the house, but Rhys is short with him. While Rhys is choosing whether to see his father or not, Elaine gives him all the letters he ever wrote to him and tells him <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> first. Rhys later decides to see his father. During Sonya and Toadie's wedding reception, a gas bottle explodes destroying the marquee. Rhys is initially trapped inside, but he manages to pull himself out. He suffers some minor injuries and broken ribs. Elaine comes to see him {{at the hospital and}} she tells him that she supports his decision to see his father. Rhys discharges himself, against Karl's wishes. He then collapses in the car park and dies from an undetected blood clot.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} {{was reported in}} September in Courrier de l'Égypte, the official newspaper of the French expedition. The anonymous reporter expressed a hope that the stone might one day {{be the key to}} deciphering hieroglyphs. In 1800, three of the Commission's technical experts devised ways to make copies of the texts on the stone. One of these experts was Jean-Joseph Marcel, a printer and gifted linguist, who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the Egyptian Demotic script, rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time, rather than Syriac as had originally been thought. It was artist and inventor Nicolas-Jacques Conté who found a way to use the stone itself as a printing block to reproduce the inscription. A slightly different method was adopted by Antoine Galland. The prints that resulted were taken to Paris by General Charles Dugua. Scholars in Europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

At last Rollo said they would go and get their mother <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> So they went together to her room, and Rollo said that they could not get along very well in rending themselves, and asked her if she would not be good enough <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The term sonnet {{sequence}} {{might be}} rephrased as series or cycle of sonnets. Sonnets become more significant {{when they are}} read in the order that the poet places <b>them,</b> as opposed <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>them</b> at random. Thus, the most unusual aspect of such a sequence {{is the sense of}} a “unity within a larger unity." ...|$|R

This modification added a set of vertical antennas and a new elevation-measuring CRT <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>them,</b> along with a radiogoniometer that allowed the vertical angle to be accurately measured. Mk. I*'s with GL/EF began to deploy in early 1941, just as The Blitz was reaching a crescendo.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson {{was not an}} {{outstanding}} orator and preferred to communicate through writing or remain silent if possible. Instead of delivering his State of the Union addresses himself, Jefferson wrote the annual messages and sent a representative <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> aloud in Congress. This started a tradition which continued until 1913, when President Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921) chose to deliver his own State of the Union address.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} that the newsstand might go out of business, principally because its unique function of supplying yesterday's newspapers was made obsolete by the ability <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> online. The physical structure also required {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in repairs. In January 2009, a new owner, Muckey's Corporation, won a bidding competition and signed a lease to take over the newsstand. Muckey's diversified the stand's offering with more typical magazines and convenience store fare, but maintained the original name.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} above, however, {{only two}} of the megillot are traditionally read in all Jewish communities, Esther on Purim and Lamentations on the Ninth of Av. The practice of reading the other three books on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals is widespread but by no means universal. <b>To</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> is a venerable custom among Ashkenazim, but many Sephardic Jews do not associate the three books with the three festivals. The association is thus weaker also among Hasidic Jews who were influenced by Sephardic customs.|$|E

25|$|Chamlee moved for new {{trials for}} all defendants.

Chamlee offered judge Hawkins affidavits to that effect, but the judge forbade him <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> out loud. The defense argued that this evidence proved that the two women had likely lied at trial. Chamlee pointed to the uproar in Scottsboro that occurred when the verdicts were reported as further evidence that the change of venue should have been granted.|$|E

He was feeble in body (Pes. 108a), but had, nevertheless, an iron will and great energy (Men. 95b), and {{although}} he was blind he was compensated by a very retentive memory, for he knew by heart the entire body of tannaitic tradition, as well as its amoraic interpretations (Shebu. 41b).

25|$|In a 1939 essay titled When Fiction Lives in Fiction, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges {{described}} Flann O'Brien's masterpiece as follows, I have enumerated many verbal labyrinths, {{but none}} so complex {{as the recent}} book by Flann O'Brien, At Swim-Two-Birds. A student in Dublin writes a novel about the proprietor of a Dublin public house, who writes a novel about the habitués of his pub (among them, the student), who in their turn write novels in which proprietor and student figure along with other writers about other novelists. The book consists of the extremely diverse manuscripts of these real or imagined persons, copiously annotated by the student. At Swim-Two-Birds {{is not only a}} labyrinth; it is a discussion of the many ways to conceive of the Irish novel and a repertory of exercises in prose and verse which illustrate or parody all the styles of Ireland. The magisterial influence of Joyce (also an architect of labyrinths, also a literary Proteus) is undeniable, but not disproportionate in this manifold book. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that dreaming and wakefulness are the pages of a single book, and that <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> in order is to live, and to leaf through them at random, is to dream. Paintings within paintings and books that branch into other books help us sense this oneness.|$|E
