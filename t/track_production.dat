5|$|After {{negotiations}} with Mančevski fell through, Mark Rydell was contracted {{to direct the}} biopic in February 1996. Rydell was also close friends with Dean; the two studied together at Actors Studio in Manhattan, New York during the early 1950s. DiCaprio {{dropped out of the}} lead role entirely when his asking price was determined to be too high after the actor's success with Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997). Meanwhile, Rydell worked with Horovitz on another rewrite, and Warner Bros. planned to fast <b>track</b> <b>production.</b> Don Was was hired to write and compose the film score, but he was later replaced by John Frizzell. Shortly after Rydell's hiring, Stephen Dorff entered discussions to portray James Dean. Ethan Hawke would later turn down the role.|$|E
500|$|Usher {{wanted to}} work with Swedish {{electronic}} dance music trio Swedish House Mafia since their joint performance at the American Music Awards in 2011. The group later agreed to work with the singer, where they intended to travel to Atlanta to work on <b>track</b> <b>production,</b> writing, and to [...] "move the ball forward." [...] Steve Angello, a member of Swedish House Mafia, told MTV News that the group hung out with Usher in Ibiza after the awards ceremony; they worked with him in Atlanta for five days. They produced the final tracks [...] "Numb", [...] "Euphoria" [...] and [...] "Way to Count", with the latter not making the final cut.|$|E
500|$|With the {{box office}} success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. {{immediately}} commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided {{it was best to}} fast <b>track</b> <b>production</b> for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the [...] episode [...] "", written by Paul Dini.|$|E

500|$|While Chris O'Donnell reprises {{the role}} of Robin, Val Kilmer decided not to reprise {{the role of}} Batman from Batman Forever. Schumacher {{admitted}} he had difficulty working with Kilmer on Forever. [...] "He sort of quit," [...] Schumacher said, [...] "and we sort of fired him." [...] Kilmer {{said he was not}} aware of the fast <b>track</b> <b>production</b> and was already committed to The Saint (1997). Schumacher originally had a strong interest in casting William Baldwin in Kilmer's place, but George Clooney was cast instead. Schumacher believed Clooney could provide a lighter interpretation of the character than Michael Keaton (in Batman and Batman Returns) and Kilmer. The shooting schedule allowed Clooney to simultaneously work on ER without any scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|... "Drunk in Love" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Detail and Jay-Z, who appears as the {{featured}} artist on the <b>track.</b> <b>Production</b> of the song was handled by Boots and Beyoncé as well as Detail. [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] was recorded at Jungle City Studios and at Oven Studios in New York City. Detail approached Beyoncé with a beat he had created called [...] "Drunk" [...] inspired by different situations from being affected by alcohol. Beyoncé further helped {{in the production of}} the song, adding elements that Detail had missed. She and Jay-Z later free-styled their verses for the song and Timbaland contributed keyboards. J-Roc, Dre Moon, Brian Soko and Rasool Ricardo Diaz contributed to the production of the song. Elaborating on the conception of the song, Beyoncé said: [...] "We just kinda had a party. It was so great, because it wasn't about any ego, we weren't trying to make a hit record [...] we were just having fun...and I think you can hear that in the record." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton chose Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as {{his primary}} filming {{location}} for Metropolis, while start dates for filming were pushed back. A minor {{piece of the}} Krypton set was constructed but then destroyed, and Cage had even attended a costume fitting. The studio was also considering changing the title Superman Lives back to Superman Reborn. Deeming Wesley Strick's script too expensive, Warner Bros. {{enlisted the help of}} Dan Gilroy to rewrite it into something more economically feasible. Gilroy lowered the $190million budget set by Strick's draft to $100million. However, the studio was still less willing to fast <b>track</b> <b>production,</b> due to financial reasons with other film properties, having Gilroy turn in two drafts. Ultimately, Warner Bros. chose to put the film on hold in April 1998, and Burton left to direct Sleepy Hollow. At this point in production, Warner Bros had spent $30million on developing the film. Burton, citing various differences with Peters and the studio, said, [...] "I basically wasted a year. A year is a long time to be working with somebody that you don't really want to be working with." ...|$|E

500|$|Schumacher and {{producer}} Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of Batman & Robin on Warner Bros.' decision to fast <b>track</b> <b>production.</b> [...] "There {{was a lot}} of pressure from Warner Bros. to make Batman & Robin more family-friendly," [...] Schumacher explained. [...] "We decided to do a less depressing Batman movie and less torture and more heroic. I know I have been criticized a lot for this, but I didn't see the harm in that approach at all." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized the toyetic approach and Mr. Freeze's one-liner jokes in his two-star review of the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times believed the film [...] "killed" [...] the Batman film series, and felt Batman & Robin depended too much on visual effects. Desson Thomson of The Washington Post largely disapproved of Schumacher's direction and Akiva Goldsman's script. Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, said, [...] "George Clooney is the big zero of the film, and should {{go down in history as}} the George Lazenby of the series." [...] However, Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave a positive review. She praised Uma Thurman's acting, as well as the production and costume design.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{commissioned}} {{husband and}} wife duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney to write a script for a Justice League film in February 2007, halting development for the Superman Returns sequel. The Justice League script was submitted to Warner Bros. the following June, which prompted the studio to immediately fast <b>track</b> <b>production.</b> Singer went on to film Valkyrie the following month, and George Miller signed to direct Justice League: Mortal in September 2007. The script would have featured a different Superman in a separate continuity from Singer's film; Routh was not approached to reprise his role for Justice League: Mortal, which ended up going to D. J. Cotrona. The film nearly went into production in March 2008, but the Australian Film Commission denied Warner Bros. their 40 percent tax rebate and Catrona's options eventually expired. With Justice League: Mortal canceled, Singer renewed {{his interest in the}} Superman sequel that same month, stating that it was in early development. Paul Levitz, president of DC Comics, still expected Routh to reprise the title role, but Routh's contract for a sequel expired in 2009. [...] "Superman Returns didn't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to," [...] Warner Bros. President of Production Jeff Robinov admitted in August 2008. [...] "It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had Superman worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009. Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all." ...|$|E

5000|$|Typically, {{when working}} with living animals, a race track is {{prepared}} {{and covered with a}} substrate, which allows for the production of footprints, i.e. sand of varying moisture content, clay [...] or mud. [...] After preparation, the animal is lured or shooed over the race track. This results in the production of numerous footprints that constitute a complete track. In some cases the animal is filmed during <b>track</b> <b>production</b> in order to subsequently study the impact of the animal’s velocity or its behavior on the produced track. This poses an important advantage of working with living animals: changes in speed or direction, resting, slippage or moments of fright become visible in the produced tracks. After <b>track</b> <b>production</b> and prior to reuse, the track can be photographed, drawn or molded. Changes in the experimental setup are possible throughout the experiment, i. e. regulation of the moisture content of the substrate. As an alternative, also tracks of free living animals can be studied in nature (i.e. nearby lakes) and without any special experimental setup. However, without the standardized environment of the lab, matching the tracks with the behavior of the animal during <b>track</b> <b>production</b> is undoubtedly harder.|$|E

50|$|Ripatti {{has been}} {{involved}} in the ambient music, glitch, house, and techno genres. His method of <b>track</b> <b>production</b> involves a mixture of synthesizing, vocal recording and live reprocessing. Many tracks have an organic feeling, conjured through rolling, dubby basslines and processed vocal snippets, often from his partner Antye Greie. Their daughter was born in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} 2 main data {{processing}} hubs, the L1 and L2, also divided the UK into 2 areas deemed the Northern <b>Track</b> <b>Production</b> Area (NTPA) and the Southern <b>Track</b> <b>Production</b> Area (STPA). The L1 primarily looked after the STPA with inputs from four main sites, these were, RAF Neatishead in Norfolk, RAF Staxton Wold in Yorkshire, RAF Boulmer in Northumberland and RAF Bishops Court in Northern Ireland. To this {{there were also}} inputs from 6 Civilian Radars at Ash, Ventnor, Clee Hill, Burington, London 1 and London 2. It was understood {{from the start that}} the L1 site, above ground and made largely of glass, was subject to air attack; as the second [...] "L2" [...] site originally planned to be built underground at Prestwick was never carried out elements of the air defence system were devolved out to use the standby capabilities of the radar sites. That Standby capability was the Standby Local Early Warning and Control (SLEWC) systems at RAF Neatishead and RAF Boulmer.|$|E
