40|$|<b>Thoracic</b> <b>disk</b> herniations {{are more}} easily detected, in respect to the past, with the {{increasing}} availability of MR scanners. However, in several cases, the time interval between {{the onset of the}} symptoms and the diagnosis is still long, due to the variability and non-specificity of the clinical pattern and to the good functional compliance of the spinal cord to slowly progressive compression. We describe two cases of non-traumatic calcified <b>thoracic</b> <b>disk</b> herniation with variable extension in the spinal canal, which were not suspected at the initial diagnostic work-up. In the first case, long-standing but subtle disturbances of gait and lower limb sensitivity were associated with a large calcified central disk herniation, which occupied almost all the spinal canal at the T 8 -T 9 level. The lesion was detected with MR of the thoracolumbar spine and further studied with CT for a better definition of the calcified part and its relationship with the nucleus polposus of the corresponding disk. In the second case, a hyperdense mass was observed in the right lateral recess of the T 10 -T 11 intersomatic space during a CT scan of the abdomen, performed in a patient with clinical suspicion of gallbladder stones. The lesion was further studied with MR scan of the thoracic spine for evaluation of the compression on the spinal cord. The literature review and our cases confirm that non-traumatic <b>thoracic</b> <b>disk</b> herniation is a possibility seldom considered in the clinical evaluation, and that, although MR is certainly the optimal diagnostic modality, in our opinion, in cases of herniated disk calcification, a CT scan remains useful, especially when a surgical approach is planne...|$|R
50|$|In five {{traumatic}} cases, the {{vertebral column}} was often but not invariably fractured and could compress the cord.

Although Gretzky came back to score 16 goals and 49 assists, good for 65 points in just 45 games, Robitaille still lead the team's scoring with 63 goals and 62 assists (125 points) in 84 regular season games, setting new NHL all-time records for goals and points scored by a left winger in a single season. The Kings finished with a 39-35-10 record (88 points), clinching third place in the Smythe Division.|$|R
30|$|Cat scratch {{disease is}} an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} bacteria Bartonella henselae [1] and is transmitted by cat scratches or exposure to cat saliva. The spectrum of its ocular manifestations includes Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome, iritis, vitritis, neuroretinitis, panuveitis, retinitis appearing as small white intraretinal infiltrates, and choroidal white lesions [1, 2]. B. henselae {{is reported to be}} {{the most common cause of}} neuroretinitis; typically characterized by optic disk edema in association with a partial or complete macular star. The majority of infected patients presenting with neuroretinitis reported in the literature are treated with antibiotics. In some cases steroids were added. However several reports showed that even patients who did not receive treatment had an excellent visual outcome [1]. We describe here a paradoxical response to treatment in a young female presenting with bilateral neuroretinitis and inflammatory optic <b>disk</b> <b>lesions.</b>|$|R

40|$|Radiographic {{demonstration}} of calcification within spinal canal tumors is rare [1]. The most common lesion {{of this type}} showing calcification is a meningioma. Other lesions showing calcification include neurofibromas, hemangioblastomas, neu-roblastomas, ganglioneuromas, and herniated <b>thoracic</b> <b>disks.</b> Very rarely is calcification seen within neurilemomas [2, 3], and, if present, it may be noted histologically but not radi-ographically [2]. Our case is the first reported computed tomographic (CT) myelography {{demonstration of}} a rare, cal-cified, thoracic, extradural neurilemoma. Case Report A 47 -year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 20 year history of mid and lower back pain that had recently increased in severity leaving her with a "heavy sensation " in her back.

25|$|Melrose {{would help}} the Kings reach new heights in the 1992–93 season, even if Gretzky missed 39 games with a career-threatening herniated <b>thoracic</b> <b>disk.</b> Led by Luc Robitaille, who filled in as captain on Gretzky's absence, the Kings {{finished}} with a 39–35–10 record (88 points), clinching third place in the Smythe Division. Heavily contested series at the 1993 playoffs had the Kings eliminating the Flames, Canucks and Leafs en route to their first berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. In the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, the Kings faced the Montreal Canadiens. After winning the opening game 4–1, the Kings suffered a turnaround during Game 2. Late in the contest, with the Kings leading by a score of 2–1, Canadiens coach Jacques Demers requested a measurement of Kings defenseman Marty McSorley's stick blade. His suspicions proved to be correct, as the curve of blade was too great, and McSorley was penalized. The Canadiens pulled their goalie, Patrick Roy, giving them a two-man advantage, and Eric Desjardins scored on the resulting power play to tie the game. Montreal {{went on to win}} the game in overtime on another goal by Desjardins, and the Kings never recovered. They dropped the next two games in overtime, and lost Game 5, 4–1, giving the Canadiens the 24th Stanley Cup in franchise history.|$|R
40|$|Forty-eight Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR {{examinations}} {{of the spine}} were performed in 40 patients referred for MR because of clinically suspected spinal tumor or for further evaluation of an expanded cord. The study group consisted of 32 patients with spinal tumors (seven ependymomas; seven astrocytomas; four hemangioblastomas; two arteriovenous malformations; two unidentified intramedullary neoplasms; four meningiomas; and single cases of metastatic breast carcinoma, cavernous hemangioma with associated hematomyelia, neurinoma, angiolipoma, drop metastasis from medulloblastoma, and epidermoid and diastematomyelia). In the remaining eight patients, other diagnoses were established: <b>thoracic</b> <b>disk</b> herniation (two patients), lumbosacral meningocele (one), syringomyelia secondary to arachnoiditis (four), and expanded cord secondary to gliotic tissue (one). All but two diagnoses were proved histologically by biopsy, surgery, or autopsy; in the two patients with arteriovenous malformations, the definitive diagnosis was made by spinal angiography. Contrast enhancement occurred in 30 of the 32 spinal tumors, and Gd-DTPA-enhanced T 1 -weighted images proved helpful in defining and outlining intra- and extramedullary spinal neoplasms. All ependymomas and astrocytomas (including low-grade astrocytomas) enhanced. In meningiomas, an immediate and uniform contrast uptake was demonstrated. Additional advantages of Gd-DTPA MR include the differentiation of solid tumor components vs syrinx or cyst or pseudotumoral areas of cord expansion, and the differentiation of residual or recurrent tumor from scar tissue in postoperative patients. Our results suggest that IV-injected Gd-DTPA improves MR sensitivity and specificity {{in the evaluation of}} spinal lesions. SCOPUS: NotDefined. j[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to check the balance between tumor {{necrosis}} factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) in well-developed end-stage disk disease in the disk itself as well as in paradiskal spine. In 6 domestic pigs the cranial bony end plate of the L 4 vertebra was perforated to the nucleus pulposus. At 3 months the degenerated experimental and contiguous control disks, together with the adjoining bony and cartilaginous vertebral end plates, bone marrow, and spinal ligaments, were excised and used for immunohistochemical analysis. In general, there were more TNF-a and in particular IL- 10 positive cells in the degenerated disks than in the control disks, whereas the number of IL- 6 labeled cells did not differ among sites or between control and experimental intervertebral disks. These results suggest that TNF-a and IL- 10 are involved in the late reparatory phases of the experimental <b>disk</b> <b>lesion.</b> Use of an experimental model showed that strictly disk-directed manipulation and degeneration are also reflected in the contiguous vertebrae, including adjoining cartilage, bone, marrow, and ligaments.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{significance}} of postoperative nerve root changes (enhancement, thickening, and displacement) {{is still a}} topic of debate. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the association between nerve root changes and residual or recurrent symptoms after lumbar surgery with contrast-enhanced MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients with 140 postoperative lumbar <b>disk</b> <b>lesions</b> causing residual or recurrent pain underwent contrast-enhanced MR imaging. The levels at which diskectomies had been performed were retrospectively evaluated for nerve root enhancement (NRE), thickening, and displacement. Association between nerve root changes and corresponding clinical presentations were statistically assessed. Nerve root changes in recurrent disk herniation (RDH) and postoperative epidural fibrosis (PEF) were also evaluated with clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Ninety-two (65. 7 %) of the 140 disks demonstrated NRE. Regarding the association with clinical symptoms, the sensitivity was 91. 7 %, the specificity was 73. 2 %, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 83. 7 %, and the negative predictive value was 85. 4 % (P. 000). Nerve root thickening and displacement were significantly associated with the clinical symptoms, especially when NRE was combined (PPV, 87. 7 % and 87. 2 %, respectively). When RDH was combined with all 3 nerve roo...|$|R
40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that transcription of the Drosophila homeotic gene Antennapedia results in four major RNA species which differ in long 5 '- and 3 '-untranslated sequences. The protein-coding portion of these transcripts, however, {{is located in}} exons common to all. Using RNase protection assays and further cDNA clone isolation, we have now detected two alternative splicing events between exons of this region. These result in four RNA variations which, if translated, would encode a family of Antennapedia proteins. By analyzing transcripts from various developmental stages and isolated tissues, we show that alternative splicing is under strict temporal and spatial regulation. For example, while similar patterns of splicing were found for all wild-type <b>thoracic</b> imaginal <b>disks</b> examined, these differed distinctly from the patterns observed in neural tissues. Our results suggest that individual RNAs {{may be associated with}} different biological roles, and provide molecular evidence that the Antennapedia gene is involved in multiple functions...|$|R
