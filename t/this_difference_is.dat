5|$|The {{mitochondrial}} genome in the medusozoan cnidarians, {{unlike those}} in other animals, is linear with fragmented genes. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E
5|$|Herbal medicines, as a whole, {{are poorly}} {{supported}} by evidence. The herbal treatments Devil's claw and white willow {{may reduce the}} number of individuals reporting high levels of pain; however, for those taking pain relievers, <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> not significant. Capsicum, in the form of either a gel or a plaster cast, has been found to reduce pain and increase function.|$|E
5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb long and has 37 genes. The genes, while highly conserved, may vary in location. Curiously, {{this pattern is}} {{not found in the}} human body louse (Pediculus humanus). Instead, this mitochondrial genome is arranged in 18 minicircular chromosomes, each of which is 3–4 kb long and has one to three genes. This pattern is also found in other sucking lice, but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to occur between the minichromosomes. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> not known.|$|E

30|$|Children anemic at PICU {{discharge}} already {{exhibited a}} lower median Hb at PICU admission {{as compared with}} children who were not anemic at PICU discharge, and <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> still significant at hospital discharge (Fig.  2 a). Children transfused with RBCs during their PICU stay had a lower median Hb at PICU admission than non-transfused children, but <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> reduced (even though still significant) at PICU discharge and was no longer significant at hospital discharge (Fig.  2 b).|$|R
30|$|Results: The mean {{duration}} of treatment was 8.1  min in the ESS 205 group and 6.6  min in the ESS 305 group. <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> not statistically significant (p[*]=[*] 0.12, two-tailed t-test). The VAS scores were 4.1 and 3.4 respectively and <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> also not statistically significant (p[*]=[*] 0.22, two-tailed t-test). Problems with release and detachment occurred five times in the ESS 205 group, but never with the new device (ESS 305), which was appraised positively by nurses and physicians.|$|R
5|$|The primary {{driver of}} <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> due to {{cultural}} standards that give women little leverage {{in the selection}} of their partner. Elder family members must find suitable husbands for young females in the households. If women are known to have adverse previous medical histories, their ability to find a partner is significantly reduced. This difference leads to diverging health outcomes for men and women.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|Octaphenylrhodocene, , is {{the first}} rhodocene {{derivative}} to be isolated at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous cobalt complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state {{as compared to the}} cobalt(II) state. The reduction potential for the + cation (measured in dimethylformamide relative the ferrocenium / ferrocene couple) is −1.44V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the C5HPh4 ligand compared with the C5H5 or C5Me5 ligands. Cobaltocene is a useful one-electron reducing agent in the research laboratory as it is soluble in non-polar organic solvents, and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an internal standard in cyclic voltammetry. No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to be used in a similar way.|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) in monocytes from 13 healthy control subjects and in 16 patients with discoid psoriasis was measured. The mean basal monocyte AHH {{activities of the}} control and psoriatic groups were 3. 4 +/- 0. 47 and 4. 46 +/- 0. 55 respectively (pmol 3 -OHBP h- 1 10 (- 6) cells). <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> not significant. The mean induced monocyte AHH activities in the control and psoriatic groups were 56. 4 +/- 10. 8 and 77. 8 +/- 16. 0 pmol 3 -OHBP h- 1 10 (- 6) cells respectively but <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> not significant. The mean induction ratios in the control and psoriatic groups were 16. 5 +/- 1. 8 and 20. 4 +/- 3. 6 respectively. Again, <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> not significant. We conclude therefore, that monocyte aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity is not reduced in psoriasis...|$|R

5|$|The {{nature of}} the European Parliament is better {{compared}} with the United States House of Representatives than with the national parliaments of the European Union. This is notable {{in terms of the}} committees being of greater size and power, political parties being very decentralised and it being separated from the executive branch (most national governments operate under a parliamentary system). A difference from all other parliaments is the absence of a Parliamentary legislative initiative. However, given that in most national parliaments initiatives not backed by the executive rarely succeed the value of <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> in question. Equally, its independence and power means that the European Parliament has an unusually high success rate for its amendments in comparison to national parliaments; 80% average and 30% for controversial proposals.|$|E
5|$|The {{second source}} of over-provisioning {{comes from the}} manufacturer, {{typically}} at 0%, 7% or 28%, based on {{the difference between the}} decimal gigabyte of the physical capacity and the decimal gigabyte of the available space to the user. As an example, a manufacturer might publish a specification for their SSD at 100, 120 or 128GB based on 128GB of possible capacity. <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> 28%, 7% and 0% respectively and is the basis for the manufacturer claiming they have 28% of over-provisioning on their drive. This does not count the additional 7.37% of capacity available from the difference between the decimal and binary gigabyte.|$|E
5|$|Among Uranus's moons, Titania is {{intermediate}} {{in brightness}} between the dark Oberon and Umbriel {{and the bright}} Ariel and Miranda. Its surface shows a strong opposition surge: its reflectivity decreases from 35% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 25% at an angle of about 1°. Titania has a relatively low Bond albedo of about 17%. Its surface is generally slightly red in color, but less red than that of Oberon. However, fresh impact deposits are bluer, while the smooth plains situated on the leading hemisphere near Ursula crater and along some grabens are somewhat redder. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter by 8%. However, <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> related to the smooth plains and may be accidental. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering caused by bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Titania is more likely related to accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would be deposited predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
