40|$|In cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNGA 1) channels, in the {{presence}} of symmetrical ionic conditions, current-voltage (I-V) relationship depends, in a complex way, on the radius of permeating ion. It has been suggested that both the pore and S 4 helix contribute to the observed rectification. In the present manuscript, using <b>tail</b> and <b>gating</b> current measurements from homotetrameric CNGA 1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we clarify and quantify the role of the pore and of the S 4 helix. We show that in symmetrical Rb(+) and Cs(+) single-channel current rectification dominates macroscopic currents while voltage-dependent gating becomes larger in symmetrical ethylammonium and dimethylammonium, where the open probability strongly depends on voltage. Isochronal tail currents analysis in dimethylammonium shows that at least two voltage-dependent transitions underlie the observed rectification. Only the first voltage-dependent transition is sensible to mutation of charge residues in the S 4 helix. Moreover, analysis of <b>tail</b> and <b>gating</b> currents indicates that the number of elementary charges per channel moving across the membrane is less than 2, when they are about 12 in K(+) channels. These results indicate the existence of distinct mechanisms underlying rectification in CNG channels.

It is aimed for maintaining water level in the river at + 137. 5 to + 138. 5 m (MSL) and flow to the irrigation canals based on a gravity system since July 2009. It might leach some saline soil spots from underground to soil surface if {{lack of understanding of}} the conjunctive surface water and groundwater behaviors. This research has been conducted by continuously the observing of both shallow and deep groundwater level and quality from existing observation wells. The simulation of surface water was carried out using a hydrologic modeling system (HEC-HMS) to compute the ungauged side flow catchments as the lateral flows for the river system model (HEC-RAS). The constant water levels in the upstream of the operated gate caused a slight rising up of shallow groundwater level when compared to the water table. However, the groundwater levels in the confined aquifers remained less impacted than in the shallow aquifers but groundwater levels in late of wet season in some wells were higher than the phreatic surface. This causes salinization of the groundwater at the soil surface and might affect some crops.

40|$|AbstractSustained Na+ or Li+ {{conductance}} is {{a feature}} of the inactivated state in wild-type (WT) and nonconducting Shaker and Kv 1. 5 channels, and has been used here to investigate the cause of off-gating charge immobilization in WT and Kv 1. 5 -W 472 F nonconducting mutant channels. Off-gating immobilization in response to brief pulses in cells perfused with NMGi+/NMGo+ {{is the result of a}} more negative voltage dependence of charge recovery (V 1 / 2 is − 96 mV) compared with on-gating charge movement (V 1 / 2 is − 6. 3 mV). This shift is known to be associated with slow inactivation in Shaker channels and the disparity is reduced by 40 mV, or ∼ 50 % in the presence of 135 mM Csi+. Off-gating charge immobilization is voltage-dependent with a V 1 / 2 of − 12 mV, and correlates well with the development of Na+ conductance on repolarization through C-type inactivated channels (V 1 / 2 is − 11 mV). As well, the time-dependent development of the inward Na+ <b>tail</b> current and <b>gating</b> charge immobilization after depolarizing pulses of different durations has the same time constant (τ= 2. 7 ms). These results indicate that in Kv 1. 5 channels the transition to a stable C-type inactivated state takes only 2 – 3 ms and results in strong charge immobilization in the absence of Group IA metal cations, or even in the presence of Nao+. Inclusion of low concentrations of Csi+ delays the appearance of Na+ tail currents in WT channels, prevents transition to inactivated states in Kv 1. 5 -W 472 F nonconducting mutant channels, and removes charge immobilization. Higher concentrations of Csi+ are able to modulate the deactivating transition in Kv 1. 5 channels and prevent the residual slowing of charge return...|$|R
40|$|Scaling down of MOS device {{dimensions}} {{is accompanied}} by a decrease in gate-oxide thickness and an increase in substrate doping density. When gate oxide thickness becomes less than 2 nm, a subtantial current follows through gate-oxide due to direct tunneling. In order to reduce this current, International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) has suggested replacement of SiO 2 gate insulator layer by high-K dielectrics. For a given equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), high-K dielectrics offer greater physical thickness. The direct tunneling (DT) current and the gate capacitance for an inverted n-MOS device with different dielectrics used as gate insulator is studied. Coupled Schrodinger’s and Poisson’s equations are solved self-consistently. Open boundary conditions, taking account the wavefunction <b>tail</b> inside the <b>gate</b> dielectric within the self-consistent loop are used to solve Schrodinger’s equation. DT current increases exponentially with the decrease of conduction band offset for electrons travelling from silicon substrate to dielectric. As general trend of dielectrics is to decrease of conduction band offset with the increase of dielectric constant, use of high-K material as gate insulator results in prominent influence of direct tunneling of carriers on potential profile. Therefore in DT current calculation effect of wavefunction penetration on potential profile is incorporated within self-consistent loop. Results of this simulation is compared with published experimental results and also with the results of the simulation where penetration effect on potential profile is neglected. Results show that neglect of wavefunction penetration effect on potential profile causes underestimation of DT current. A comprehensive analysis of the effect of wavefunction penetration on the gate capacitance of the MOSFETs with high-K dielectrics is also done. Gate capacitance from conventional modeling is found to be independent of dielectric materials for a given EOT. The study reveals that accounting for wavefunction penetration into the gate dielectric causes gate capacitance to vary from material to material for a given EOT. Consequently wavefunction penetration effects must be considered to determine properties of future generation devices where high-K dielectrics will be employed as gate insulator...|$|R

50|$|Gate {{roads are}} {{driven to the}} back of each panel before {{longwall}} mining begins. The gate road along one side of the block is called the maingate or headgate; the road on the other side is called the tailgate. Where the thickness of the coal allows, these gate roads have been previously developed by continuous miner units, as the longwall itself is not capable of the initial development.The layout of Longwall could be either 'advancing' type or of 'retreat' type. In the advancing type, the gate roads are formed as the coal face advances. In thinner seams the advancing longwall mining method may be used. In the retreat type, the panel is formed by driving maingate, <b>tail</b> <b>gate</b> and a face connecting the both.Only the maingate road is formed in advance of the face. The tailgate road is formed behind the coal face by removing the stone above coal height to form a roadway that is high enough to travel in.

The cavity behind the longwall is called the goaf, goff or gob.|$|E

Various strata control issues relate to stress distribution around the longwall panels at depths approaching 900 m {{in different countries}} was discussed. Extent of abutment loading and need of advance support for more distances away from the longwall faces as compared to conventional practices at shallow depths is emphasized. Innovative design of barrier pillars at high stress conditions with yield pillars is illustrated. Mining options for various coalfields in India are presented. Issues regarding mining techniques, or need of innovative techniques is critically evaluated based on the experiences of different countries and the design implemented for safe and economically viable mining for the extraction of seams at greater depths.
