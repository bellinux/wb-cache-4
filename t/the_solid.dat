5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. <b>The</b> <b>solid</b> support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{oligonucleotide}} synthesis {{was carried}} out manually in solution or on solid phase. <b>The</b> <b>solid</b> phase synthesis was implemented using, as containers for <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> phase, miniature glass columns similar in their shape to low-pressure chromatography columns or syringes equipped with porous filters.|$|E

50|$|As gas {{velocity}} in the annulus {{depends on a}} calculated velocity of <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> ejected from bubbles, {{it is more difficult}} for <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> coming from <b>the</b> annulus with increasing velocity in the nozzle to penetrate into the central gas jet under a constant fluidization velocity.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a semi-batch process for the {{intermittent}} treatment of effluent containing dissolved heavy metals was proposed. Like the high density sludge (HDS) process, heavy metals are removed by precipitation {{in the presence of}} other <b>solids.</b> <b>The</b> effects of cycling, neutralization rate, temperature, and solution composition were investigated. Sludge density, percent solids, sludge viscosity, and settling velocity of <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> generated were used to characterize the system. Experiments were performed on iron (III) and zinc solutions. For the iron system, it was shown that <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> generated were in the form of aggregates rather than discrete particles. Both cycling and lower neutralization rates tended to improve <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> settling velocity. This was attributed to aggregate restructuring under turbulent mixing conditions, and to the local supersaturation conditions created under different neutralization rates. A critical addition rate of 7. 5 mL/min was identified, below which little benefit was realized. A modified form of the Richardson-Zaki correlation was developed. With this function, it was shown that the settling velocity of <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> could be described using volume fraction as the single independent variable. This was unexpected, and identifies particle interactions as the dominant factor in determining the settling characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>solids.</b> <b>The</b> zinc system exhibited improvements in the settling velocity with mixing time, while none were realized with <b>the</b> iron <b>solids.</b> <b>The</b> main effect of higher temperatures was to decrease the viscosity of the suspending fluid, giving increases in <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> settling velocity. However, this effect did not fully explain the increase that was found with <b>the</b> zinc <b>solids</b> at higher temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Incineration is {{combustion}} in {{the presence}} of air. Incineration of wastewater solids takes place in two steps.
