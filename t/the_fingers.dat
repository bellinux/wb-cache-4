5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Three {{dimensional}} solid-fluid interaction {{numerical analysis}} models of both <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> seal with herringbone-grooved pad and <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> seal with herringbone-grooved rotor {{were established in}} order to study the performance of hydrodynamic <b>finger</b> seal. <b>The</b> models investigated fluid radial under pad force and fluid leakage {{as a function of}} both the rotor speed and the high- to low-pressure differential. It was shown that <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> seal with herringbone-grooved structure in pad or in rotor could bring lift force under <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad so as to keep <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> seal in non-contacting status. For the two types of finger seal, their load carrying ability and fluid leakage varying with the pressure differential were almost same. In the same velocity of rotor surface, the load carrying capacity of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> seal with herringbone- grooved rotor was greater and the leakage was less than that of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> seal with herringbone-grooved pad respectively. With the conditions of rotor structure allowing, it is suggested to select <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> seal with herringbone-grooved rotor first for designing <b>the</b> hydrodynamic <b>finger</b> seal with herringbone-grooved structure...|$|R

5|$|In major-thirds tuning, the {{chromatic}} scale is arranged on three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets. This four-fret arrangement facilitates the left-hand technique for classical (Spanish) guitar: For each hand position of four frets, the hand is stationary and <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> move, each finger {{being responsible for}} one fret. Consequently, three hand-positions (covering frets 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) partition the fingerboard of classical guitar, which has exactly 12 frets.|$|E
5|$|Like other primates, lemurs groom {{socially}} (allogroom) to ease {{tensions and}} solidify relationships.

30|$|Unlike the simulation, the {{sticking}} did {{not occur}} at every cycle of the vibration of the contactor. Furthermore, the observed friction was always positive, defined as being {{in the direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> motion. In <b>the</b> simulation previously mentioned in Fig.  7, the velocity of the contactor exceeded that of <b>the</b> <b>finger,</b> and <b>the</b> friction acted in the opposite direction of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> movement; however, these phenomena were not observed in the experiments for every stimulus condition. In the simulation, we assumed that <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> and contactor exerted sufficient force to realize their intended or programmed motions. In the actual experiment, these assumptions did not hold mainly because of the external forces applied by <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> to <b>the</b> contactor system, which led to the discrepancies between the experiment and the simulation. In the phase in which the contactor was to exceed <b>the</b> <b>finger,</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad and contactor could have stuck owing to the high level of friction.|$|R
30|$|One of the accelerometers {{was fixed}} {{to the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> by using {{adhesive}} tape. This attachment of the accelerometer does not alter either the stiffness or the viscosity of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad, and does not lead to any subjective influences on the textures experienced by wearers. Another was mounted on the contactor on which <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad was placed, to measure the acceleration of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad’s deformation. <b>The</b> displacement of the vibrating contactor was small, being a maximum of ± 2.5  mm, for which <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad does not slip on the contactor. Hence, the displacement of the contactor is in good agreement with that of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad. <b>The</b> sensitivity of the accelerometers was set along the X-axis. The outputs from both accelerometers were recorded at 8  kHz.|$|R
40|$|Frostbite {{occurs when}} body tissues freeze after {{being exposed to}} extreme cold and wind. It?s most likely to occur on body {{extremities}} ? fingers, nose, ears, and toes ? areas far from the warm body core and exposed to the elements. We have modeled tissue freezing in a finger in order to predict combinations of wind speed and temperature {{likely to lead to}} frostbite. Our model incorporates different tissue layers in <b>the</b> <b>finger,</b> sources of heat, transient properties, and heat transfer through convection and conduction. Such a model is valuable because it accurately predicts the existence and extent of tissue freezing. The model uses two tissue layers in <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> because of their disparaging material properties. It also contains a region attached to <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> to simulate heat flux from the hand to <b>the</b> <b>finger.</b> Heat generation was ignored, and heat transfer to <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> from blood flow was accounted for by a source term. The model is axi-symmetric, with radial heat flow into <b>the</b> <b>finger.</b> <b>The</b> edges of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> have a convection boundary condition, and the region attached to <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> was perfectly insulated. The far edge of the region attached to <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> was set to a constant temperature equal to average body temperature.

30|$|We did not {{restrain}} <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> joints during <b>the</b> measurement {{in experiment}} 3. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> could rotate in ab/adduction at the metacarpophalangeal joint. Ideally, such rotation {{should be removed}} throughout the experiments. One may say {{that the effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> ab/adduction is minor. According to a study [38] in which the mechanical impedance of <b>the</b> index <b>fingers</b> in abduction was measured, the resonance point of the ab/adduction motion is a few tens of Hertz, above which the rotational vibration is reduced. This also indicates that <b>the</b> whole <b>finger</b> vibration may be magnified at low frequencies and adversely affects the estimation based on the accelerometer at <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> side. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> pad deformations estimated by the accelerometer were greater than those resulting from the shear force at low frequency ranges, as shown in Fig.  10. Bracing the MP joint may lead to the two types of estimates being more congruent.|$|R

Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and big toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the distal phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E

40|$|Interdigitated finger {{capacitance}} of a continuous-wave terahertz photomixer {{is calculated}} using the finite element method.
