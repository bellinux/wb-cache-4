Ely Callaway explained the company’s product development objectives as follows: [...] "We have combined all of the performance benefits into one ball so players {{no longer need to}} sacrifice control for distance, or feel, or durability. Each Rule 35 ball contains a unique synergy of distance, control, spin, feel and durability characteristics.
