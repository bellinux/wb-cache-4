On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a pass that fell incomplete, <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> ball over on downs. As {{a result of}} pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E
5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} {{expressed}} that the amendments were not seeking {{to replace the}} common law of judicial review. Instead, they borrowed from the common law by <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> clock back, and merely clarified the limits of judicial power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E
5|$|Arak is a Levantine {{alcoholic}} spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof) {{from the}} anis drinks family, common in Israel {{and throughout the}} Middle East. It is a clear, colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink (also labeled as an Apéritif). It is often served neat or mixed with ice and water, which creates a reaction <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> liquor a milky-white colour.

5000|$|I {{have asked}} dozens of bicycle riders how they <b>turn</b> to <b>the</b> left. I have never found {{a single person}} who stated all the facts {{correctly}} when first asked. They almost invariably said that to <b>turn</b> to <b>the</b> left, they <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar {{to the left and}} as a result made a <b>turn</b> to <b>the</b> left. But on further questioning them, some would agree that they first <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar a little to the right, and then as the machine inclined to <b>the</b> left, they <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar to the left and as a result made the circle, inclining inward.|$|R

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|At kickoff, a {{light breeze}} was blowing from the {{northeast}} at , the air temperature was , and the weather was foggy with a light rain. Rain had been falling for several hours, <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance. Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due to the poor weather {{and the fact that}} the stadium was half-empty through much of the game.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles {{have been}} constructed, for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> handlebars {{to the left}} causes the front wheel {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa. It is possible to ride such a bicycle, but it has been found that riders experienced with normal bicycles find it very difficult to learn, if they can manage it at all.|$|E

5|$|Current {{practice}} {{involves a}} celebrity <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> lights on in mid- to late-November, and they remain lit until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 {{due to the}} assassination of John F. Kennedy and in 1989 to fit Kylie Minogue's touring commitments. In 2015, the lights were switched on earlier, on Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic.|$|E
5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E

5|$|Having {{been held}} south of Romani, the German and Ottoman force {{attempted}} a further outflanking manoeuvre to the west, concentrating 2,000 troops around Mount Royston another sand dune, south-west of Romani. At 05:15, the Ottoman 31st Infantry Regiment pushed forward; then the 32nd and the 39th Infantry Regiments swung around {{the left and}} into the British rear. This outflanking movement was steadily progressing along the slopes of Mount Royston and <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> right of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, whose third regiment, the Wellington Mounted Rifles, was now also committed to the front line.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{after failing}} to get his Lake Calumet Airport and having {{received}} harsh criticism {{for the idea of}} <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> airport into an industrial park, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley announced the Midway Airport Terminal Development Program, which was launched the following year. At the time, it was the largest public works project in the state. The Midway Airport parking garage opened in 1999, bringing covered parking to the airport for the first time. The garage is connected to the Midway terminal building for convenient access to ticket counters and baggage claim areas.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an outline of}} the changes in linguistics that gave rise to historical pragmatics in the 1990 s and that have shaped its development over the twenty years of its existence. These changes have affected virtually all aspects of linguistic analyses: the nature of the data, the research questions, the methods and tools that are being used for the analysis, as well as the nature of the generalizations and findings that result from these investigations. We deal with the changes in terms of shifts in thought styles and discuss seven different turns: <b>the</b> pragmatic <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> socio-cultural <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> dispersive <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> empirical <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> digital <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> discursive <b>turn</b> and <b>the</b> diachronic <b>turn.</b> We also deal with some long-standing, recent or emerging interfaces where historical pragmatics interacts with other disciplines and we discuss some future challenges, such as the multimodality and fluidity of communication and the problem of combining big data with pragmatic micro analyses...|$|R
