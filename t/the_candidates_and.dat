5|$|The all-pairs widest path {{problem has}} {{applications}} in the Schulze method for choosing a winner in multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>and</b> every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a pairwise contest between the two candidates it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, {{and the winner is}} the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. The results of an election using this method are consistent with the Condorcet method – a candidate who wins all pairwise contests automatically wins the whole election – but it generally allows a winner to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{feature of}} the early polls was the high {{percentage}} of people intending to cast a blank vote (voto en blanco), usually between 20% and 30%.

I analyzed Facebook users’ comments derived from one of <b>the</b> <b>candidate’s</b> Facebook pages, Prabowo Subianto, by employing a thematic analysis to examine an official posting’s comments on June 19, 2014 where a group of celebrities supported Prabawo Subianto. Comments were extracted from June 20, 2014 to July 8, 2014, which was 20 days before election day. Results indicated that {{the construction of}} a <b>candidate’s</b> image involved <b>the</b> relationship between the perceived attributes of <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>and</b> national identity; <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>and</b> his supporters; <b>the</b> perceived personality traits of <b>the</b> <b>candidate,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ability of supporters to identify with <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> on a personal level.

25|$|In 1856, Congressman Rust became drew public {{attention}} {{for his efforts}} to oppose Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts, who appeared likely to become Speaker of the House. Banks opposed further extension of slave territory, unlike Rust and his constituents. According to the Rust family history, Rust introduced something labeled a compromise resolution, which New York Tribune newspaperman Horace Greeley characterized Rust’s {{as an attempt to}} make it appear that the contest over the speakership was about personal rivalries among <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>and</b> not about principles. Greeley believed its true purpose was to oppose Banks's candidacy. After Congress adjourned, on the day The Tribune reached Washington, Rust accosted Greeley on the Capitol grounds and felled him with his cane. A few days later, Rust again struck Greeley again on the streets of Washington.|$|E
25|$|The next {{election}} of a Polish king had occurred in 1386, with the selection of Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila), Grand Duke of Lithuania, as the first king of Poland's second dynasty. The electors chose Władysław II Jagiełło as king, and he married a daughter of Louis I, Jadwiga of Poland, but had no promise that his dynasty would continue on the throne. He would need to issue more privileges to the nobility to secure the guarantee that upon his death, {{one of his sons}} would inherit. The royal council chose <b>the</b> <b>candidates,</b> <b>and</b> the delegates of nobility and towns confirmed them during the sejm. The principle of election continued in effect throughout the nearly two centuries of the Jagiellon Dynasty, but just as in Piast times, it actually amounted to mere confirmation of the incoming heir.|$|E

500|$|Finally, {{symmetrical}} positions may {{be difficult}} for the white player for psychological reasons. Watson writes that anyone who tries the Exchange French, [...] "even if he thinks he is playing for a win, assume a psychological burden. White has already ceded the advantage of the first move, and knows it, whereas Black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative." [...] Two famous examples of White losses in the Exchange French are M. Gurevich–Short and Tatai–Korchnoi. In M. Gurevich–Short, a game between two of the world's leading players, White needed only a draw to qualify for the Candidates Matches, while Black needed to win. Gurevich played passively and was outplayed by Short, who achieved the necessary win, qualified for <b>the</b> <b>Candidates,</b> <b>and</b> ultimately went on to challenge Kasparov for the World Championship. In Tatai–Korchnoi, the Italian IM fell victim to Korchnoi's whirlwind mating attack, losing in just 14 moves.|$|E

500|$|The market cross {{also served}} as {{the focal point of}} Norfolk's {{parliamentary}} elections. Candidates would bring large crowds of voters in by cart from the surrounding countryside and ply them with large quantities of free alcohol to ensure their support. Candidates would pay for lodgings for the voters, but, in closely fought elections, more voters than usual would be shipped in and every inn in the city would fill, forcing voters to sleep in and around the cross. Sir Thomas Browne described the voters around the market cross as [...] "like flocks of sheep" [...] during the unusually close elections of 1678, {{at the height of the}} Exclusion Crisis. Following the counting of the vote, the winning candidate would be carried three times around the market, followed by torch-bearers and trumpeters. By this time, the crowds would generally be extremely drunk on the liquor provided by <b>the</b> <b>candidates,</b> <b>and</b> elections would often degenerate into drunken revelry or fighting.|$|E
