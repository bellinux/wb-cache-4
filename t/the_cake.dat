40|$|Abstract: The use {{of biomass}} for fuel {{required}} {{understanding of its}} chemical nature and thermal characteristic for maximum and effective utilisation, thus seed cakes of Lagenaria vulgaris, Lagenaria ladle and Cucurbita pepo were analyzed for their thermal and chemical properties. The thermal behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> was determined using thermo-gravimetric method and proximate compositions of <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were deduced from the thermogram. The percentage of fixed carbon (FC) were {{within the range of}} 22. 534 and 37. 009 %, while volatile matter of <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were 57. 758 % for Lagenaria ladle, 56. 303 % for Lagenaria vulgaris and 54. 882 % for C. pepo. Major organic elements in <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were measured using CHNS- 923 elemental analyzer. Calorific values and oxygen required for the combustion of <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were quantified using bomb calorimeter and stoichiometric equation respectively. The results showed the co-firing potential of <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> in furnaces and boilers as well as their potentiality of being viable feedstock for biogas production...|$|R

5|$|Applesauce cake {{tends to}} be moist due to the liquid content present in the apple sauce. However, using a chunky-style apple sauce {{can result in a}} cake with less moisture, {{compared}} to using standard apple sauce.

40|$|The fresh {{mushroom}} and mushroom powder were {{analysed for}} their composition. Mushroom powder was incorporated in <b>the</b> formulations of <b>cake</b> at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 % by weight. The effect of {{various levels of}} mushroom powder on the physico-chemical properties and nutritional quality of cakes had been observed. Mushroom powder at 15 % addition level significantly improved colour, flavour and texture of cake. Cakes were also prepared by incorporating various levels (0 - 20 %) of mushroom powder in plane cake formulations to evaluate optimum level of powder addition. It was observed that in achieving acceptable cake quality, {{in terms of volume}} significantly higher amount (10 - 15 %) of mushroom powder could be incorporated in cake formulations. Compositional analysis of cake showed that cake containing mushroom powder had higher protein and fat content and lower carbohydrate content than <b>the</b> control <b>cake.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cakes</b> containing various levels of mushroom powder were evaluated for their sensory attributes by a panel of 10 tasters. The results revealed that the colour and flavour of cake containing mushroom powder was significantly different from <b>the</b> control <b>cake.</b> <b>The</b> texture of <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> with mushroom powder was equally acceptable to <b>the</b> control <b>cake.</b> <b>The</b> overall acceptability of <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> with mushroom powder was equally acceptable to <b>the</b> control <b>cake...</b>|$|R

5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th birthday cake. No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> to a local nursing home. He used this incident {{as the title of}} his 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards. He had mistaken the room for that of a friend.|$|E
5|$|The Roar {{missed the}} finals {{in the first}} two A-League seasons, {{finishing}} sixth in 2005–06 and fifth in 2006–07 on goal difference to Sydney FC, who finished fourth. In the 2007–08 season the roar finished in 4th placed in the regular season and 3rd place after the finals series, and in 2008–09 the team finished 3rd on the ladder but again were eliminated in the finals, finishing 3rd. The Roar would suffer their worst season to date in 2009–10, finishing 2nd last on the ladder of 10 teams. This would all change a season later, where the Roar would do the double by winning both the premiership and championship, topping <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> with an Australian sporting record of 28 unbeaten games {{at the end of the}} season, which continued into the 2011–12 A-League season, ending at 36 games.

5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} {{of the game and}} of its characters led Valve to develop merchandise for Portal made available through its online Steam store. Some of the more popular items were the Weighted Companion Cube plush toys and fuzzy dice. When first released, both were sold out in under 24 hours. Other products available through the Valve store include T-shirts and Aperture Science coffee mugs and parking stickers, and merchandise relating to the phrase <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> is a lie, which has become an internet meme. Wolpaw noted they did not expect certain elements of the game to be as popular as they were, while other elements they had expected to become fads were ignored, such as a giant hoop that rolls on-screen during the final scene of the game that the team had named Hoopy.|$|E
5|$|A {{paramedic}} is let into a {{house to}} the sounds of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a party for the 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela moves a cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat—a practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)—by hiding under <b>the</b> <b>cake.</b> Maggie, Carol and Pat—the latter wearing a wolf mask—arrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge—something Jim had asked Angela to prevent—and secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a sunscreen bottle while ostensibly unblocking the toilet after her mother could not flush it. Angela is proud that the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the food on the table, and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake—under which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out the candles. The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated.|$|E

5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle changes, such as the flavor of <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> changing, and a painting {{given to him by}} Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that reality has changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} matches on the under-card was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H {{would have to}} defend the title against the fans' choice of three possible opponents: Chris Benoit, Edge, or Shawn Michaels. At Unforgiven, Raw's previous pay-per-view event, Triple H defeated Randy Orton to capture the World Heavyweight Championship. The following night on Raw, Triple H had a celebration thrown in his honor, complete with women, confetti, streamers and a giant cake. Orton, however, sought revenge by coming out of <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> and assaulting the three members of Evolution, Triple H's stable with Ric Flair and Batista, which Orton had previously been a part of. On the October 4 episode of Raw, {{it was announced that}} because Orton has not won the opportunity to challenge Triple H, fans would be able to choose between three potential contenders for Triple H's World title at Taboo Tuesday. Chris Benoit and Edge were revealed as two of the candidates. Shawn Michaels, however, competed in a qualifying match, which saw him defeat Christian, to become the third candidate. On the October 18 episode of Raw, a standard match involving three wrestlers, called a Triple Threat match, was scheduled between Benoit, Edge, and Michaels. Edge won the match after he pinned Benoit by using the ring ropes for unfair leverage. During the match, Michaels legitimately injured his left knee, tearing his meniscus.|$|E
5|$|Ranked {{lieutenant}} in the Permanent Military Force (PMF), Pollard was appointed adjutant/quartermaster of the 17th Battalion (Citizens Military Forces), headquartered at North Sydney, in July 1925. He married Daisy Ethel Potter, a typist, at St Andrew's Anglican Church, Strathfield, on 31 October; The Bathurst Times reported that Daisy cut <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> with her husband's Sword of Honour. Pollard departed for India on attachment to the British Army in September 1927, serving with the Royal Fusiliers and the York and Lancaster Regiment. He returned to Sydney in November the following year and was posted as adjutant/quartermaster to, successively, the 18th Battalion (CMF) and, in September 1932, the 44th Battalion (CMF). In December 1932, while serving with the 44th in Western Australia, {{he was promoted to}} captain. Pollard was camp commandant of the National Rifle Association of Western Australia from 1934 to 1936. He was transferred to Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in October 1936. His next posting, in July 1938, was as General Staff Officer Grade3, Training and General Duties, at the 2nd District Base, Sydney. In November 1938, Pollard travelled to England to attend Staff College, Camberley; he graduated in September 1939, the planned two-year course having been curtailed owing to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
