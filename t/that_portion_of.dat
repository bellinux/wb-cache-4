5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 44 was {{replaced}} by US 130 north of the Delaware Memorial Bridge approach in Deepwater and by Route 49 south of there. However, US 130 was moved to new freeway alignments around Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville. The bypassed alignments of US 130, originally unnumbered, eventually became Route 44. After I-295 {{was built in the}} 1960s, it bypassed the portion of the US 130 freeway in Bridgeport and was designated along the US 130 freeway north to Westville and around Carneys Point. US 130 was moved back onto its old alignment in Carneys Point, replacing <b>that</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> Route 44.|$|E
5|$|Two federal cavalry {{divisions}} {{encountered the}} remnants of General Early's army at Waynesboro, Virginia, on March 2. Most of Early's army was killed or captured, although Early evaded capture. Custer's division did the fighting. His 1st Brigade dismounted and attacked as infantry, then the 3rd Brigade charged and cut off over half of Early's force—which forced <b>that</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the rebels to surrender. All of Early's headquarters equipment was captured, as were 11 pieces of artillery. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry captured 200 wagons loaded with supplies {{that were supposed to}} be sent to Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Early's army was eliminated from the war.|$|E
5|$|Flora Duffy {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in the Beijing Olympics based on her performance in the qualification competitions. Participating on the August 18 event, Duffy competed in the women's triathlon. Duffy swam the 1.5kilometers portion of the distance in 20:26minutes, ranking 41st out of 55 in <b>that</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the event, behind Luxembourg's Liz May (40th) by under a second and ahead of Hungary's Zita Szabó by two seconds. In this portion of the event, Duffy was 37 seconds behind the United States' Laura Bennett, who finished the swimming portion of the event first at 19:49. Duffy took 33 seconds to make the transition from swim to cycling, the second part of the event, tying with Mak So Ning of Hong Kong at 52nd place out of 55. Duffy, however, was lapped on the bike leg and was disqualified before reaching the running portion or completing the event.|$|E

5|$|Harvey caused minor {{flooding}} in south Florida because {{of light to}} relatively heavy rainfall in <b>that</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the state and at least 34houses and businesses in southern Florida were flooded. There were sporadic reports of tropical storm-force winds throughout the state, {{as well as two}} tornadoes. Damage estimates in Florida reached about $15million (1999USD). Throughout the rest of the United States, impact was limited, confined to light rainfall in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Heavy rainfall was reported in Atlantic Canada and Harvey became the wettest tropical cyclone on record in that country. Significant flooding, especially to roads and houses, was reported due to the heavy rainfall and damage throughout Atlantic Canada totalled several million dollars.|$|E
5|$|Normally, upon {{completion}} of the new I-80 south of downtown, the old alignment over the Tower Bridge and through downtown would be relinquished. The legislature recognized that it might be useful to keep a state highway to the Capitol, and so in 1966 it passed a concurrent resolution requesting that the California Highway Commission delay relinquishment west of 9th Street until {{the last day of the}} 1967 legislative session. During that session, a new Route 275 was created from <b>that</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> former Route 80. This consisted of the eastern part of the West Sacramento Freeway, the Tower Bridge, and Capitol Mall up to 9th Street, just west of the capitol building. The portion in Sacramento, east of the bridge, was not to be beautified with state highway funds. Due to the cancellation of a replacement of the North Sacramento Freeway, I-80 was moved to former I-880 around the city in 1981, giving the West Sacramento Freeway three numbers: I-80, US 50, and SR 275.|$|E
5|$|The Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings {{are used}} to {{determine}} the qualification of the players for the tournament. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, each singles tournament had 38 competitors, while each doubles tournament had 16 pairs. All players or pairs from the top 16 places on the BWF rankings automatically qualify, although each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can send less than three players or pairs in each tournament. The top 64 then qualify with the caveat that each NOC can send only two players/pairs from <b>that</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the list. Players and pairs ranked below the 64th place only qualify if they are the highest-ranked competitor from their nation. Two places each in the men's and women's singles will be determined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Tripartite Commission. The host nation, if it has not already qualified two competitors, receives at least either two singles players or one pair. The rules used in the tournament are the same as the BWF rules.|$|E

5|$|With the {{creation}} of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, present-day MD 97 north of Westminster became a part of US 140. MD 97 was first designated by 1933 from MD 27/MD 410 (now US 29) in Silver Spring to north of US 40 in Cooksville. Two portions of the route between Cooksville and Westminster became MD 570 in 1939. In 1956, MD 97 was extended north from Cooksville to the Pennsylvania border northwest of Emmitsburg, Frederick County. It replaced the two sections of MD 570 and replaced the MD 32 designation between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border. MD 97 was rerouted to bypass Westminster in 1960 and was moved to a new alignment between Westminster and Taneytown in 1965; both former alignments became MD 32. In 1961, the route was realigned between MD 26 and MD 32, with the former segment becoming MD 854. MD 97 was rerouted to its current northern terminus in 1979, replacing <b>that</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> US 140, while the former route between Westminster and northwest of Emmitsburg became part of MD 140.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Route 17S was legislated {{along the}} current route {{followed}} by Route 44 today, running between Penns Grove and Westville. The only portion of Route 17S ever built ran from Penns Grove to Salem. Route 44 was designated in 1927 to replace Route 17S between Penns Grove and Westville. By the 1940s, Route 44 was extended south to Salem and US 130 was designated concurrent with the route north of Penns Grove. Several spurs of Route 44 had existed or were planned prior to 1953, including Route S44, which ran concurrent with US 322 to the ferry between Bridgeport and Chester, Pennsylvania; Route S44A, a never-built bypass of Camden; and Route 44T, {{which was to}} run from a tunnel under the Delaware River in Paulsboro east to Route 42. In 1953, Route 44 was replaced by US 130 north of Deepwater and by Route 49 south of there. After two bypasses were built for US 130 around Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville, Route 44 was redesignated along the former US 130. After I-295 was completed in the 1960s, US 130 returned to its original alignment in Carneys Point and replaced <b>that</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> Route 44.|$|E
5|$|Then, in 1957, {{the northernmost}} part of present SR57 {{was added to}} the state highway system as part of Route 240, which the {{legislature}} designated along the route planned for I-210. This became part of the proposed Temescal Freeway, later the Corona Freeway; a southerly extension of the Orange Freeway to Legislative Route 60 (SR 1) near Huntington Beach was added in 1959 as Route273. Also in 1959, the legislature created Route272, extending the line of the Orange Freeway north from the Pomona Freeway to the Temescal Freeway, completing the proposed freeway corridor that is now SR57. When the entire route, except Route240 which was still part of I-210, was redesignated SR57 in the 1964 renumbering, none of these proposed freeways had been built; the only constructed segment was the old surface road from Fullerton towards Pomona. The part of old Route19 east of Route272 became part of SR 60. As part of the same renumbering, Route180 on State College Boulevard became Route250, which was amended the next year to provide for its deletion once <b>that</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the SR57 freeway was completed (between I-5 and SR 91).|$|E
