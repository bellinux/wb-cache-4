However, a popular legend says that wherever {{you may go}} in the world, {{if you see a}} hole in the ground, you'll find a Cornishman at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Several Cornish mining words are in use in English language mining terminology, such as costean, gunnies, and vug.|$|E
25|$|The Proto-Indo-Europeans {{may have}} {{believed}} {{in some kind}} of world tree. It is also possible that they may have believed that this tree was either guarded by or under constant attack from some kind of dragon or serpent. In Norse mythology, the world ash tree Yggdrasil is tended by the three Norns while the dragon Nidhogg gnaws at its roots. In Greek mythology, the tree of the golden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides is tended by the three Hesperides and guarded by the hundred-headed dragon Ladon. In Indo-Iranian texts, there is a mythical tree dripping with Soma, the immortal drink of the gods and, in later Pahlavi sources, an evil lizard is said to lurk at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Jeremiah Bitsui sprained {{his ankle}} during filming {{of the scene}} when Walter and Jesse shoved his corpse into a barrel to dispose of it with {{hydrofluoric}} acid. Following that scene, Jesse lifts the barrel with a forklift and it is lit {{in a way that}} the barrel can be seen through. This was accomplished by back-lighting the barrel and tying [...] to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> which staff members then moved and twisted outside of the view of the camera to create the lighting effect.|$|E

500|$|The {{reconciliation}} of the father-son relationship between Edward and William {{is the key}} theme in Big Fish. Novelist Daniel Wallace's interest in {{the theme of the}} father-son relationship began with his own family. Wallace found the [...] "charming" [...] character of Edward Bloom similar to his father, who used charm to keep his distance from other people. In the film, Will believes Edward has never been honest with him because Edward creates extravagant myths about his past to hide himself, using storytelling as an avoidance mechanism. Edward's stories are filled with fairy tale characters (a witch, mermaid, giant, and werewolf) and places (the circus, small towns, the mythological city of Spectre), all of which are classic images and archetypes. The quest motif propels both Edward's story and Will's attempt to get to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Wallace explains: [...] "The father's quest is to be a big fish in a big pond, and the son's quest is to see through his tall tales." ...|$|E

[...] The book contains ten chapters. The first few chapters make a case that there is almost certainly no God, while the rest discuss religion and morality.|$|E

So we're going to get to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and then we're going {{to do everything we can}} to work to prevent it from happening again." [...] Regarding the different explanations afterward for what had happened, she said, [...] "In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion. And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens." ...|$|E

There is one large railway carriage, able to accommodate about 50 passengers... There are two inclines on the railroad near to the town of Dunfermline and a third at the shore. The coals are conveyed by a locomotive engine from the pits {{to the top of the}} first incline at the Colton station, [...] east end of Golf Drum Street, and from <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> they are drawn a short distance by horses, to the top of the second incline, which commences a little south of Pittencrieff toll-bar, and are afterwards conveyed by another locomotive, which takes also goods and passengers from the Netherton (sic) station in the town of Dunfermline to the steamboats that ply between Stirling and Granton [...] pier.|$|E
2500|$|Johan Derksen {{claimed in}} VI that Cambuur had paid {{a large sum}} of money to keep Oeki Hoekema from being suspended. According to Derksen Vlaardingen player and chief witness of the case Herman den Haag had {{received}} a few banknotes for the trouble {{out of the hands}} of a Cambuur official whilst on the toilet. De Volkskrant wanted to get to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and called KNVB official Van Zon, who stated he had laughed very hard when he heard the claims. [...] "Money handed out on the toilet? How did he come up with that? I have seen it with my own eyes: the Cambuur representative gave the cash to the witnesses. No, not on the toilet but in public in the bar of our restaurant. It wasn't much money either, If I recall correctly it was fl. 50. Those few ten-guilder notes aren't even enough to cover the witnesses' expenses, since all the witnesses had to travel from Rotterdam to here. The KNVB pays fl. 0.35 per kilometre." [...] "Quite a crappy story indeed, Derksen wrote, but then again, that's what we're accustomed to. You wanna know who were present in court at the time? Me, another journalist and a man with a tape recorder. Derksen wasn't there. Probably on the toilet." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{appears in}} the Kingdom Hearts game series as the queen of Disney Castle, with Mickey serving as the king and her husband. She, at the {{suggestion}} of a letter left by the missing King, sends Donald Duck and Goofy on their mission to find Mickey and the Keyblade Master, Sora. During Kingdom Hearts II, when Pete's tampering of the past causes the Heartless to appear in Disney Castle, Minnie is forced to fall back to the library to get to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> until Sora and company arrive. While Donald and Goofy head to get the other residents to safety, Sora serves as the Queen's bodyguard to get her to the Cornerstone where. During this time, Minnie shows powers as a sorceress of white magic, casting a holy light on the Heartless that attack as well as a powerful combination with Sora that unleashes a huge beam of light all around her. In the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, she oversees the annually held Dream Festival in Disney Town, where Pete causes mischief until she banishes him to another dimension as punishment. She appears in [...] in a role mirroring that in the film , where she is referred to as Princess Minnie and rules a world called the Country of the Musketeers. By this, it is inferred that she, not Mickey, is the rightful ruler of Disney Castle, which is why he leaves her in charge.|$|E
