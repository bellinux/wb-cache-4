500|$|Both Dozier and Yuricon {{president}} Erica Friedman {{wrote about}} the sexual nature of Honey, including the lesbian desire of the Jewel Princess (one of Honey's enemies) {{for her in the}} second episode. Friedman—who had looked for such [...] "implied yuri" [...] in Cutie Honey manga—called the Princess's appearance [...] "*just* what I was hoping for", and praised Honey's change to her S Queen form in response. Ross said about the series: [...] "It's seemingly exploitative, it's incredibly sexist, and the female members of my household - you'd expect them to be indignant, but, no, they were laughing <b>their</b> <b>butts</b> off because it was so blatant, and yet Honey was actually never objectified in the whole series." [...] He further writes, [...] "Honey Kisaragi is an extremely strong character who is no damsel in distress. If anyone needs help in this series, it's the guys!" [...] Toole said that Jessica Calvello [...] "gives the character a growling, tough-girl charm that was conspicuously absent from the original version", while Dozier said that Calvello captured [...] "the combination of innocence and bravado [...] that is both so confusing and yet so appropriate". Beveridge said the [...] "fight sequences are pretty well done and provide some fun moments watching Honey battle the various demonic forms", but concluded that Honey main goal is to showcase the lead heroine's changes: [...] "Oh, lets face it. it's all about the half to completely naked transformation sequences. They're grrreat!" ...|$|E
500|$|Starship Troopers is {{generally}} considered to promote militarism, the glorification of war and of the military. Scholar Bruce Franklin referred to it in 1980 as a [...] "bugle-blowing, drum-beating glorification" [...] of military service, and wrote that militarism and imperialism were the explicit message of the book. Science fiction writer Dean McLaughlin called it [...] "a book-length recruiting poster". In 1968 science fiction critic Alexei Panshin called Starship Troopers a militaristic polemic and compared it to a recruiting film, stating that it [...] "purports to show {{the life of a}} typical soldier, with a soundtrack commentary by earnest sincere Private Jones who interprets what we see for us." [...] Panshin stated that there was no [...] "sustained human conflict" [...] in the book: instead, [...] "All the soldiers we see are tough, smart, competent, cleancut, clean-shaven, and noble." [...] Panshin, a veteran of the peacetime military, argued that Heinlein glossed over the reality of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid conflict existed simply because, [...] "Starship troopers are not half so glorious sitting on <b>their</b> <b>butts</b> polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack of anything else to do." [...] Literature scholar George Slusser, in describing the novel as [...] "wrong-headed and retrogressive", argued that calling its ideology militarism or imperialism was inadequate, as these descriptions suggested an economic motive. Slusser instead says that Heinlein advocates for a complete [...] "technological subjugation of nature", of which the Arachnids are a symbol, and that this subjugation itself is depicted as a sign of human advancement.|$|E
2500|$|West's rhetoric won him both {{support and}} {{condemnation}} from differing groups along the American political spectrum. Members {{of the conservative}} movement viewed him as a [...] "torch bearer" [...] and [...] "conservative icon," [...] with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent both suggesting him for vice president, and Glenn Beck supporting him for president. In January 2013, U.S. Representatives Paul Broun (R-Georgia) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) both voted for West as Speaker of the House, {{even though he was}} no longer a member of Congress. [...] Some of his statements include calling President Barack Obama [...] "an abject failure", ordering both pro-Palestinian demonstrators and the views of [...] "chicken men" [...] Democrats to [...] "get the hell out" [...] of the United States, opining that drivers with Obama bumper stickers are [...] "a threat to the gene pool", and pronouncing that African American Democrats are trying to keep African Americans [...] "on the plantation", while casting himself as the [...] "modern-day Harriet Tubman" [...] ferrying them to rescue. In a critical summation of West's style, the liberal magazine Mother Jones opined that [...] " [...] every sentence is a proxy war in the larger struggle between patriots and the 'people in this world that just have to have <b>their</b> <b>butts</b> kicked.'".|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} dealing with devil figures in Danish church frescos, which is pictured with a head on <b>their</b> <b>butt,</b> dated back to the Middle Ages. We wish to {{investigate}} {{if there is a}} link between these devil figures and if they have anything in common. To comment on these matters, we construct a test, consisting of an analysis and statistic calculations. Our analysis starts by using art historian Erwin Panofsky's image analysis method. We use this method to gain knowledge about devil figures in Danish church frescos in general, which can be used when we execute our analysis on our special chosen devils. Based on this analysis and on data from the website [URL] we perform some statistic calculations in order to answer our main problem. Based on our test we can conclude that devils, which are pictured with a head on <b>their</b> <b>butt,</b> with 95 % confidence is associated with hell. We can furthermore conclude that these devils are used in the period from 1300 - 1550, but we can’t say anything about where this trait comes from...|$|R

This periodical {{is placed}} within {{a tradition of}} satirical works that downplay <b>their</b> <b>butt</b> {{through the use of}} ambivalence, a tradition that is besides shown to have a special connection with the Enlightenment. Through a close-reading of several passages and one illustration, it becomes clear that ambivalence is indeed an important characteristic of De Lantaarn, thus being a product not just of its own time, but also of the aforementioned tradition...|$|R

In fact, the poem for its graphic truth; its nice discrimination; its terse good sense, and its shrewd knowledge of the world, must have electrified the club almost as much as the first appearance of The Traveler, and let them still deeper into the character and talents of the man they had been accustomed to consider as <b>their</b> <b>butt.</b> Retaliation, in a word, closed his accounts with the club, and balanced all his previous deficiencies.|$|R
