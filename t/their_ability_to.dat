5|$|Around 120,000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{described}} by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood. A 2017 estimate suggests there may be between 2.2 and 3.8 million species. In mycology, species have historically been distinguished {{by a variety of}} methods and concepts. Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as {{the size and shape of}} spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy. Species may also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.|$|E

Some focus on animals for pack and draft work, which are conformationally distinct from those bred for work under saddle, which are carefully selected for <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform the traditional Icelandic gaits. Others are bred solely for horsemeat. Some breeders focus on favored coat colors.|$|E

5|$|In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach had set {{his sights}} on Russell, {{thinking}} his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess were the missing pieces the Celtics needed.

5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, and <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
