40|$|Early adopters {{of digital}} <b>color</b> <b>printing</b> have {{consistently}} {{been told that}} they need to educate the advertising agency market to drive digital <b>color</b> <b>print</b> volume. Experience has yielded mixed results for digital color printers who have taken this approach. There have been several hypotheses suggested why agency education has had limited value, including: the price/value equation for digital <b>color</b> <b>printing,</b> limited availability of accurate data for targeted marketing campaigns, and relative lack of use of return on investment metrics for one-toone marketing. As part of the industry analysis effort for the digital <b>color</b> market, the <b>Printing</b> Industry Center at RIT embarked on a research initiative to gain an understanding {{of the relationship between the}} advertising agency, the corporate marketing executive, and the print services provider.
