5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E

500|$|Tsakalotos {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "Marxist", and Ovenden has written that [...] "While Keynes is the main economic reference point for Varoufakis, who opposed the Brussels deal, for Tsakalotos, who signed it, Marx is more that guide to economic and political analysis." [...] Paul Mason described Tsakalotos as a [...] "classic Marxist of the New Left," [...] continuing that [...] "Tsakalotos comes from that school of Marxism which learned from the 1970s onwards to make compromises with capitalist reality." [...] In an interview with the Financial Times in September 2015, following his re-appointment, he said: [...] "I’m one of the government’s most left-wing ministers, politically speaking. However, I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> the recapitalisation of the banks. I can do things that aren’t particularly left-wing." ...|$|E
500|$|According to guitarist Marty Friedman, it {{took the}} band a year to prepare the record [...] "from note one to mixing". A lot of the {{material}} was written during the tour {{and some of it}} afterwards. As Friedman said, the songs came together naturally because the band wasn't rushed to get a record out. The album was produced by Dann Huff, who had his producing debut with Megadeth. The band chose to work with Huff because they were not satisfied with Max Norman, the producer of their previous record. Mustaine explained why he decided to quit the collaboration with Norman: [...] "Max came up with this bullshit formula that every song had to be 120 beats per minute to get on the radio. When people make drastic decisions <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that and it backfires, it usually ends up, in one way or another, costing them their jobs." ...|$|E

500|$|The Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey {{was more}} positive, stating that [...] "the funniest stuff {{comes from the}} kind of {{situational}} misfires that can happen when dudes try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> catch aliens, that they are clearly not cut out to do". She considered that Schaffer's previous experience directing short comic videos for Saturday Night Live was partially responsible for individual comic moments broken up by transitions where [...] "things tend to fall apart". Screencrushs Matt Singer was positive, calling the film funny and praising the improvisational feel of the scenes and [...] "ingenious" [...] set-pieces, but was critical of the promotion of Costco and Costco products throughout. Boxoffices James Rocchi offered a positive stance, stating that the [...] "plot moves, the supporting cast is lively and the action stays small-scale and intimate, never overwhelming the laughs"; he felt that the profanity and vulgarity never became [...] "stale". Rocchi, however, commented that the film was forgettable and [...] "disposable".|$|E

Bochkay, [...] "If we are going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> this, we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side."

She told the Wall Street Journal: [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> torture myself to keep people watching" [...] her YouTube videos. To this end, she made a popular cinnamon challenge video in character as Miranda, Until March 2013, Ballinger' YouTube audience was modest, but in that month, her Miranda Sings channel's audience reached 150,000 subscribers, and both of her YouTube channels began to expand far more rapidly. Ballinger offers merchandise on her mirandasings.com website, {{and some of the}} videos contain brand endorsements.

It's allowed us <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> push security patches that go through the whole enterprise that's on NMCI. If you look at NMCI historically, it was probably the first step for the Navy to move into what was then called Joint Vision 2010 and now is Joint Vision 2020. It's actually done that, and it's moving the Navy toward the U.S. Defense Department's goal of information superiority. So, I see {{a lot of good things}} with NMCI." ...|$|E

6000|$|But Cicero {{was forced}} to fight, not {{altogether}} unwillingly--not with the Parthians, but with tribes which were revolting from Roman authority because of the Parthian success. [...] "It has turned out as you wished it," [...] he says to Cælius--"a job just sufficient {{to give me a}} small coronet of laurel." [...] Hearing that men had risen in the Taurus range of mountains, which divided his province from that of Syria, in which Bibulus was now governor, he had taken such an army as he was able to collect to the Amanus, a mountain belonging to that range, and was now writing from his camp at Pindenissum, a place beyond his own province. Joking at his own soldiering, he tells Cælius that he had astonished those around him by his prowess. [...] "Is this he whom we used to know in the city? Is this our talkative Senator? You can understand the things they said.[92] * * * When I got to the Amanus I was glad enough to find our friend Cassius had beaten back the real Parthians from Antioch." [...] But Cicero claims to have done some gallant things: [...] "I have harassed those men of Amanus who are always troubling us. Many I have killed; some I have taken; the rest are dispersed. I came suddenly upon their strongholds, and have got possession of them. I was called 'Imperator' at the river Issus." [...] It is hardly necessary to explain, yet once again, that this title belonged properly to no commander till it had been accorded to him by his own soldiers on the field of battle.[93] He reminds Cælius that it was on the Issus that Alexander had conquered Darius. Then he had sat down before Pindenissum with all the machinery of a siege--with the turrets, covered ways, and ramparts. He had not as yet quite taken the town. When he had done so, he would send home his official account of it all; but the Parthians may yet come, and there may be danger. [...] "Therefore, O my Rufus"--he was Cælius Rufus--"see that I am not left here, lest, as you suspect, things should go badly with me." [...] There is a mixture in all this of earnestness and of drollery, of boasting and of laughing at what he was doing, which is inimitable in its reality. His next letter is to his other young friend, Curio, who has just been elected Tribune. He gives much advice to Curio, who certainly always needed it.[94] He carries on the joke when he tells Atticus that the [...] "people of Pindenissum have surrendered." [...] "Who the mischief are these Pindenissians? you will say. I have not even heard the name before. What would you have? I cannot make an Ætolia out of Cilicia. With such an army as this do you expect me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> a Macedonicus?[95] * * * I had my camp on the Issus, where Alexander had his--a better soldier no doubt than you or I. I really have made a name for myself in Syria. Then up comes Bibulus, determined {{to be as good as}} I am; but he loses his whole cohort." [...] The failure made by Bibulus at soldiering is quite as much to him as his own success. Then he goes back to Laodicea, leaving the army in winter-quarters, under the command of his brother Quintus.|$|E
