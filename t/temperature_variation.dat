5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme <b>temperature</b> <b>variation</b> between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E
5|$|Some climate {{scientists}} have theorized that aircraft contrails (also called vapor trails) are implicated in global dimming, but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant {{that this could}} not be tested. The near-total shutdown of civil air traffic during the three days following the September 11, 2001 attacks afforded a unique opportunity in which to observe the climate of the United States absent from the effect of contrails. During this period, an increase in diurnal <b>temperature</b> <b>variation</b> of over 1°C (1.8°F) was observed {{in some parts of}} the U.S., i.e. aircraft contrails may have been raising nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more than previously thought.|$|E
40|$|<b>Temperature</b> <b>variations</b> in the {{tropical}} tropopause layer (TTL) {{play an important role}} in dehydration in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Equatorial Kelvin waves associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) are known to induce remarkable <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> in the TTL. In this study, the influence of topography on <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> in the TTL is investigated by using radiosonde data, satellite data, reanalysis data, and numerically simulated data. When MJO convection passes over the radiosonde sites, <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> near mountainous regions are larger than those measured in regions of lower elevation. The difference in temperature amplitude reaches similar to 1 - 2 K. Large <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> over mountainous regions were also found in other data sets. Numerically simulated data from the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) are also used to investigate the <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> in the TTL. The results show that the <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> associated with Kelvin waves become large over mountainous regions. A sensitivity test using the stretched version of NICAM gave two important results: (i) the height of mountains affects the magnitude of the <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> in the TTL, and (ii) the terrain-following coordinate system used in the model produces the artificially high-temperature variation in the TTL. When Kelvin waves pass over mountainous regions, topographic gravity waves are excited and superimposed on the Kelvin waves, thereby producing large <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> over these regions. The mountainous region of the Indonesian Maritime Continent is a favorable location for large <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> in the TTL...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It {{is argued}} that an {{important}} fraction of PNe present large <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> that are not due to observational errors nor to incomplete atomic physics. Seven possible causes for these variations are reviewed, {{one of them is}} presented for the first time. 1. Overview Photoionization models for chemically homogeneous gaseous nebulae of constant density predict an almost constant temperature and consequently very often observers assume a constant temperature to determine chemical abundances. There is growing observational evidence that indicates the presence of large <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> in gaseous nebulae, in contradiction with the models mentioned above. Consequently the relevance of <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> in the abundance determinations has to be considered in detail. In section 2 we review the observational evidence in favor of large <b>temperature</b> <b>variations.</b> In section 3 we review different possible explanations for the observed variations. In section 4 we discuss the implications of the <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> in the abundance determinations, these implications depend on the source of the <b>temperature</b> <b>variations.</b> Recent reviews on the temperature structure of gaseous nebulae are thos...|$|R
5|$|Temperature: The species {{appears to}} require the cool, mild {{temperatures}} and relatively constant conditions provided by the waterfalls and the mist they generate. Water volume and flow rates within the Chittenango Creek watershed influence {{the size of the}} waterfall as well as the mist-zone and the actual temperature at the site. Active Novisuccinea chittenangoensis are generally found at temperatures from 12 to 20°C. During warmer periods, snails retreat to cool areas provided by the moist rock and moss, or aestivate in the vegetation. During cold winter temperatures, it is believed that the snails at the Falls retreat into cracks or fissures in the rocks and remain inactive. Various temperature readings were gathered during the summers of 1980-1982. In the spray zone, the rock surface temperatures averaged 16°C, the moss averaged 14°C, and the combined temperatures of the substrate, water, and vegetation averaged 16°C. Seasonal and daily <b>temperature</b> <b>variation</b> has been monitored for 2 years using data loggers that record temperature every hour, but this data has not yet been analyzed (Breisch, unpublished data).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The hot-wire {{anemometer}} is a famous thermal transducer for turbulence measurements. The fundamental principle of {{hot-wire anemometer}} {{is based on}} the convective heat transfer, since the heat transfer is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the sensor and the fluid, hence ambient <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> {{are one of the most}} important error sources in the measurements with the hot-wire anemometers. Many methods have been proposed to compensate for the ambient <b>temperature</b> <b>variations.</b> In such methods the effect of temperature drift is only considered and the effect of Nusselt number is ignored. In the present research the effect of air flow <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> on the response of constant temperature anemometer has been studied experimentally. Furthermore, with the basis of air flow velocity and ambient <b>temperature</b> <b>variations,</b> the percentage errors in velocity measurements have been estimated. Finally, based on achieved results, an accurate method has been proposed to compensate the air flow <b>temperature</b> <b>variations...</b>|$|R

30|$|Attempts {{to reduce}} the <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> and thereby {{mitigate}} {{the effect of the}} temperature sensitivity on the raw accelerations are hampered by the lack of thermal insulation of the accelerometer and insufficient capability of the on-board heaters, which were designed to prevent the temperature from dropping below the lower operating limit. Extensive in-orbit testing was performed using the nominal and redundant heater together. The tests revealed that the peak-to-peak <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> at the orbital period can be reduced at best by 0.4  ^∘C. Since the observed <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> at the orbital period range from 0.4  ^∘C during full sun phase to 1.7  ^∘C during eclipse phase, <b>temperature</b> <b>variations</b> cannot be avoided most of the time. Consequently, the temperature sensitivity of the accelerometers needs to be modeled in the data processing on-ground.|$|R
