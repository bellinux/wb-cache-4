5|$|The route {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} in the modern history of the race, with substantial criticism that it was simply too hard for a three-week-long race. Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at Grossglockner in Austria, the exceptionally steep Monte Zoncolan, and a tall and steep peak near the Fascia Valley in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> the Nevegal. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Morten Thrane Esmark found a black mineral on Løvøya island, Telemark county, Norway. He was a Norwegian {{priest and}} amateur {{mineralogist}} {{who studied the}} minerals in Telemark, where he served as vicar. He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such as <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>to</b> his father, Jens Esmark, a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the University of Oslo. The elder Esmark determined {{that it was not}} a known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure sample by reducing KThF5 with potassium metal. Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery and named the source mineral thorite.|$|E

25|$|By round twelve, Schmeling was {{far ahead}} on the judges' scorecards. Finally, he landed a right to Louis' body, {{followed}} by another right hand, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> the jaw. Louis fell near his own corner, and was counted out by Donovan. This was Louis' only knockout defeat during his prime: the only other knockout happened when Rocky Marciano knocked Louis out fifteen years later. By then, Louis was considered a faded champion and Marciano a rising star.|$|E
25|$|Nothing {{is known}} about his origin, but he first appears in the cathedral of Chartres as a boy singer in 1462. He became choirmaster of {{the boys in the}} Chartres choir school in 1469, which makes a birthdate of 1450 a fair approximation. In 1472 he became a canon. Between March and November 1483 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, being {{replaced}} in his duties at Chartres by the young Antoine Brumel (this is the earliest mention of this renowned composer). The following year Mureau made another pilgrimage, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> Santiago de Compostela.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, Brady threw his second {{interception}} of the game, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> Drayton Florence at the New England 49-yard line. San Diego then moved {{the ball to the}} 4-yard line, but on 3rd and 1, linebacker Junior Seau tackled Michael Turner for a 2-yard loss and the Chargers had to settle for Kaeding's fourth field goal. New England responded with a drive to the San Diego 2-yard line, with Maroney gaining 39yards on four running plays, but Chargers cornerback Antonio Cromartie ended the drive by intercepting Brady in the end zone.|$|E

25|$|Princess Royal, {{launched}} in 1786, was an East Indiaman. She made two complete trips to India for the British East India Company (EIC) {{and was on}} her third trip, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> China, when French privateers or warships captured her on 27 September 1793. The French Navy took her into service in the Indian Ocean as a 34-gun frigate under the name Duguay Trouin. The Royal Navy recaptured her and she returned to British merchant service. In 1797 she performed one more voyage for the EIC. She received a letter of marque in July 1798 but was captured in October 1799 {{off the coast of}} Sumatra.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half, Seattle {{finally got a}} scoring {{opportunity}} when Hawkins fumbled {{the ball on the}} first play from scrimmage and the Seahawks recovered. However, all they got from this was Krieg's third interception, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> linebacker Matt Millen on the first play after the fumble. At this point, Krieg was benched and replaced by backup Jim Zorn. Meanwhile, LA drove to the Seahawks 9-yard line. Defensive back Gregg Johnson intercepted a pass from Plunkett in the end zone to keep his team in the game, but even {{this turned out to be}} insufficient. Just two plays later, Davis recorded his second interception of the day, this one on the Seattle 46. On the next play, Allen took off for a 43-yard burst, and then caught a 3-yard touchdown pass to make the score 27–0.|$|E
25|$|An {{exchange}} of punts brought the teams {{into the second}} quarter, where on the third play of a Patriots drive Cassel threw his second interception of the day, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> Nate Clements on the 49ers' 6-yard line on a deep pass intended to Moss. The 49ers went three-and-out, leading to a 13-play, 40-yard Patriots drive where a third down sack of Cassel in the red zone set up a 35-yard Gostkowski field goal that trimmed the 49ers' lead to 14–10. The 49ers punted again on their next possession, giving the Patriots the ball on their own 20-yard line with just over three minutes remaining in the first half. 11 plays later, the Patriots faced a 2nd and goal from the 49ers' 2-yard line, where a Faulk touchdown run gave the Patriots a 17–14 lead at halftime.|$|E

25|$|For {{their third}} night game {{in as many}} weeks, the Patriots flew to M Bank Stadium to face the 4–7 Ravens. On the first drive of the game, a 42-yard Stallworth {{reception}} and three Ravens penalties helped set up a 1st and goal from the Ravens' 3-yard line. The Patriots next four plays gained a net of zero yards, and Gostkowksi kicked a 21-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 3–0 lead. After an exchange of punts, the Ravens took the lead with Kyle Boller completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason after a 70-yard drive. In the second quarter, Baltimore increased its lead when kicker Matt Stover converted a 29-yard field goal to cap a 12-play, 55-yard drive. On the ensuing drive, the Patriots responded with a 9-play, 60-yard drive that included two more Stallworth receptions and two more Ravens penalties and ended in a 1-yard Evans touchdown run. Two possessions later, with 56seconds remaining the first half, Brady threw his fifth interception of the season, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> safety Ed Reed, who proceeded to fumble on the return. Watson recovered the fumble and the Patriots went into halftime in a 10–10 tie.|$|E
25|$|Minnesota {{got off to}} a bad {{start and}} never recovered. After the opening kickoff, Collins led the Giants 74 yards in just four plays, {{throwing}} a 46-yard touchdown pass to Hilliard to give them a 7–0 lead less than two minutes into the game. Then Giants defensive back Lyle West recovered a fumble from kick returner Moe Williams on the Vikings 18-yard line and Collins capitalized with an 18-yard touchdown pass to fullback Greg Comella on the next play, giving New York a 14–0 lead before the Vikings offense had even stepped onto the field. Minnesota eventually got a chance to score when defensive back Robert Tate intercepted a pass from Collins and returned it to the Giants 37-yard line. But Culpepper soon returned the favor with a pass that was intercepted in the end zone by Emmanuel McDaniel. Collins threw another interception on New York's following drive, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> Don Morgan on the Vikings 12-yard line. However, Minnesota could not advance the ball, and Mitch Berger's 26-yard punt gave the Giants great field position on the Minnesota 41-yard line. Collins then threw a 22-yard pass to Amani Toomer that set up a Brad Daluiso field goal on the first play of the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} bye week, the Patriots {{traveled}} to Candlestick Park {{to face the}} 49ers {{in the first of}} two straight West Coast games for the Patriots. After a 49ers punt on their first series started the game, Cassel's second pass of the game was intercepted by linebacker Takeo Spikes to give the 49ers the ball at the Patriots' 45-yard line. On the next play, 49ers quarterback J. T. O'Sullivan threw an interception of his own, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> Meriweather at the Patriots' 4-yard line. A three-and-out for the Patriots on their ensuing drive ended in a 35-yard Chris Hanson punt that gave the 49ers the ball at the Patriots' 30-yard line to begin their next drive. A defensive holding penalty on Patriots cornerback Deltha O'Neal on third down extended the drive, leading to a 16-yard touchdown catch by running back Frank Gore that gave the 49ers a 7–0 lead. On the Patriots' next drive, a fumbled snap by Cassel set up 3rd and 8 from the Patriots' own 34-yard line; Cassel then threw a deep pass to Moss, which was caught at the 49ers' 21-yard line and run in for a 66-yard touchdown that tied the game at 7–7. A 38-yard Isaac Bruce reception from O'Sullivan on the 49ers' ensuing possession backed the Patriots' defense up to their own 22-yard line, and two plays later, O'Sullivan and Bruce again connected on a pass, this one a touchdown from 6 yards out to give the 49ers a 14–7 lead.|$|E

25|$|On {{the third}} {{play of the}} second half, Welker's six catch of the game made him the first player in NFL history to record six catches {{in the first nine}} games of a season. The ensuing 13-play drive culminated with a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal that gave the Patriots a 13–3 lead. An {{exchange}} of punts gave the Bills the ball at their own 19-yard line to begin their next drive, which advanced to the Bills' 45-yard line before Edwards' second interception of the day, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> O'Neal, gave the Patriots the ball back at their own 41-yard line for the final play of the fourth quarter. Five plays later, Cassel was sacked for the only time in the game at the Bills' 44-yard line by defensive lineman Marcus Stroud and safety George Wilson; Stroud forced a fumble in the process and Wilson recovered it at the spot of the sack. The Bills' next drive ended in a Brian Moorman punt that the Patriots the ball at their own 8-yard line with just over 11 minutes remaining in the game. The Patriots then embarked on a 19-play, 92-yard drive that tied a franchise record set in 2002 for number of plays in a single drive; it was also the Patriots' NFL-leading 22nd drive of ten or more plays. It ended with a 1-yard Green-Ellis touchdown run that extended the Patriots' lead to 20–3 with 1:57 remaining in the game. The Bills responded on the ensuing kickoff with an 85-yard return by Leodis McKelvin, setting up a 14-yard touchdown catch by fellow rookie James Hardy on the next play to cut the Patriots' lead to 20–10. The Bills then attempted an onside kick, which appeared to be recovered by the Bills but was then ruled to be dead at the spot as it had been touched by a Bills player before traveling the necessary 10 yards. Three kneeldowns by the Patriots gave them a 20–10 win to better their record to 6–3.|$|E

AllMusic reviewer Eugene Chadbourne awarded the album {{three and a}} half stars, and cited [...] "Like a Surgeon" [...] and [...] "Dare to Be Stupid" [...] as some of Yankovic's best songs.

As Smith was aware of how his Doctor would act in the following episodes, he used <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> establish the character. The plan was to retain traces of Smith's predecessor, but the executive producers wanted Smith to be [...] "stranger". The episode was directed by Adam Smith, who was attracted to the [...] "brilliant script" [...] and working with Matt Smith after seeing him on stage. Smith was asked to direct [...] "the same but make it a bit different– the producers didn't want it to be radically different, but they did want it to be different".

Both writers had desired {{to write a story}} wherein Lincoln's ghost haunts the White House and Mulder and Scully investigate. Morgan explained that he had [...] "done a lot of research and I had always wanted to write a feature about Lincoln’s ghost". However, due to the massive amounts of rewrites the two were forced to do for [...] "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man", both Morgan and Wong lost interest in the story. Morgan explained, [...] "I felt they didn’t want my heart and soul anymore, so I wouldn’t give <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> them". The two later crafted [...] "Never Again" [...] in its place. Years later, Frank Spotnitz said that he [...] "always wondered about" [...] the story and what the finished product would have been like.|$|E
