With the help of her mother's former lover Kuan (Henky Solaiman), she discovers the true ownership of the house.|$|E
5|$|I now intervened {{to settle}} this dispute, at one moment quite heated.

5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E

5|$|The {{residents}} of Milwaukee Avenue {{and the surrounding}} Seward neighborhood formed the Seward West Project Area Committee (PAC) {{in order to try}} to save the Milwaukee Avenue homes.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether or not <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market is efficient is posed by an increasing number of economists, policymakers, homebuyers, and homesellers. This article tests the efficiency hypothesis on data from <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market in Oslo over the period 1991 - 2002, employing the Case-Shiller time-structure test on a repeat-sales house price index and returns to housing. We demonstrate <b>that</b> both <b>the</b> repeat-sales <b>house</b> price index and returns contain time structure and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market is characterized by inefficiencies.

5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston.

The signpost at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> had a terraced garden and greenhouse.

5|$|It {{is clear}} from several sources that Donnchadh made these grants on the {{condition}} that the Abbey of Paisley established a Cluniac house in Carrick, but that the Abbey did not fulfil this condition, arguing that it was not obliged to do so.

5|$|Jane Howard found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> had {{previously}} been called Lemmons, and decided to restore that name.

5|$|Morrissey {{was born}} in the Kensington area of Liverpool, the son of Joe, a cobbler, and Joan, who worked for Littlewoods.

For National Museums Liverpool's Eight Hundred Lives project, Morrissey wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> had been in his family since {{around the turn of the}} 20th century.

A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1801.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{versions}} the {{two houses}} had passed were not identical, the bill {{returned to the}} House of Representatives, where on May 25, Arizona's Carl Hayden successfully moved <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> agree to the Senate amendment.

5|$|Tchernov argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> sparrow {{and related}} species have {{undergone}} considerable morphological changes in adapting to a commensal relationship with humans, with the beak becoming longer and narrower. He wrote that P.predomesticus was intermediate {{between the house}} sparrow and Spanish sparrow (Passer hispaniolensis), and suggested {{that it may be}} a primitive relative of the ancestor of the house sparrow that did not become dependent on humans. In a 1984 paper, Tchernov suggested that the period in which the house sparrow and P.predomesticus could have separated was the Würm glaciation 70,000–10,000 years ago. Markus found that the fossil species was closest to living house sparrows from Palestine and to the great sparrow (P.motitensis), and proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> sparrow evolved in Africa. In a 1977 account of the evolution of the house sparrow, American zoologists Richard F. Johnston and William J. Klitz considered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> sparrow evolved with the beginning of agriculture, dating any fossils that could even be assigned to the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows as more recent than P.predomesticus. In his 1988 work The Sparrows, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith considered that P.predomesticus was roughly contemporary with the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows and that all present-day Palaearctic Passer species evolved later. Drawing on more recent studies of molecular data, Ted R. Anderson stated in his 2006 Biology of the Ubiquitous House Sparrow that all Passer species have a long evolutionary history, with speciation possibly occurring as early as the Miocene.|$|E

5|$|The {{design has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Architectural historian David Watkin described {{the house as}} 'large, irregular and rather featureless' and of a 'dull design'. On the other hand, historian, archivist and Maltravers Herald Extraordinary John Martin Robinson, in The architecture of Northern England, noted the 'complex building history' of the hall, describing it as a 'substantial and elegant Georgian house'. In his early 19th century work 'Views of the Seats, Mansions, Castles, Etc. of Noblemen and Gentlemen of England, Scotland and Ireland', John Preston Neale noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is 'large and handsome'.|$|E
