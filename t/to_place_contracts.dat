40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} economic appraisal in the U. K. National Health Service with particular emphasis {{on the impact of}} the recent reforms. A number of agencies, including the Department of Health, research councils, health authorities and industry, fund appraisals, the majority of which are carried out by academic researchers. To date there is little formal documentation of the impact of appraisals. The recent reforms should, in principle, increase the opportunities and demand for economic appraisal. The reforms establish an internal market for health care with separate roles for purchasers and providers. There are opportunities for using appraisals in deciding whether or not <b>to</b> <b>place</b> a <b>contract,</b> in deciding on the contract specification and in monitoring the prescribing budgets of general medical practitioners. The new NHS research and development strategy also places particular emphasis on research into the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of health technologies, and on getting the results of research used in decision making. cost-effectiveness analysis decision-making technology diffusion incentives...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the major objectives of the reforms of the NHS. However, this begs the question of how efficiency will be assessed, since one cannot necessarily assume that the adoption of market principles will automatically lead to efficiency. This paper discusses the methods for assessing the efficiency of health care programmes and treatments, the ways in which the reforms are likely to encourage assessment of efficiency and the monitoring systems that should be put in <b>place</b> <b>to</b> assess that more efficient health care provision has been secured as a result of the reforms. It is concluded that while there has been relatively little formal assessment of the efficiency of alternative programmes and treatments to date, the reforms present new opportunities. Efficiency assessments could be used by purchasing authorities in deciding whether or not <b>to</b> <b>place</b> a <b>contract</b> and in deciding upon the contract specification. They could also help providers decide upon the most appropriate treatment technologies. In the primary care sector, efficiency assessments of drug therapy could assist in the monitoring of the indicative prescribing scheme. NHS, efficiency...|$|R

The manufacturers also express concern that certain contracting strategies to obtain better prices have the potential to limit competition when practiced by GPOs with a large share of the market. GAO was asked to examine certain GPO business practices. It focused on seven large GPOs serving hospitals nationwide regarding (1) their processes to select manufacturers' products for their hospital customers and the level of administrative fees they receive from manufacturers, (2) their use of contracting strategies to obtain favorable prices from manufacturers, and (3) recent initiatives taken to respond to concerns about GPO business practices. ...|$|R

It was the first Indian organization to utilize the laws in <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>contract</b> an education for their children. Eventually, the AIPC was able to leverage complete control of the school and curriculum. In 2001, with the passing of the SFIS Act, the school took ownership of the land.

As part of the annual marine mammal surveys of the critical habitat for Endangered Species Act (ESA) -listed Southern Resident Killer Whales (Orcinus orca), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries mobilized a winter research survey during 16 February to 06 March 2012.

40|$|The {{internal}} {{market in the}} NHS is meant to ensure that provider units compete {{on the basis of}} price and quality and that money follows patients into efficient units. But the example of what happened to one local ophthalmology unit suggests what may go wrong when entrepreneurial activity is applied in a market that does not work perfectly. In 1991 - 2 the unit had a high workload but also comparatively high prices (because of crude pricing in the local hospital); because of pressure of work the waiting times lengthened and general practitioners increasingly complained about the service. The staff in the unit reopened a longstanding debate about the need for a third consultant ophthalmologist, but neither the purchasers (including fundholders) nor the provider unit were able to fund the post. Fundholders in a neighbouring district, however, together with that district health authority, decided <b>to</b> <b>place</b> their <b>contracts</b> elsewhere for the following year. Although the withdrawal of contracts jeopardised the clinical and financial viability of the ophthalmic unit, patients continued to use the service. When general practitioners in the district realised that their local service might collapse they pressed to keep the service open. The fundholders and the host purchaser finally agreed to fund a third consultant and drew up standards for the service. As a result the waiting times fell and the service is now described as "excellent. " Short term market decisions may have unforseen long term implications for services to patients. This needs to be addressed as part of the evolution of the reformed NHS...|$|R
