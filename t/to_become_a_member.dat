5|$|Murray had {{repeatedly}} refused <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>Member</b> of Parliament, {{saying he had}} no interest in politics.

5|$|Basset {{probably}} died in 1127, and {{was certainly}} dead in 1130. He {{is said to}} have taken ill at Northampton, and to have been clothed in a monk's habit while on his deathbed. He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a cartulary, records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem to have been held by Basset as a sub-tenant, four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not very valuable, and Basset can not be considered a baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E
