5|$|Responses are {{polyclonal}} {{in nature}} as each clone somewhat specializes in producing antibodies against a given epitope, and because, each antigen contains multiple epitopes, {{each of which}} in turn can be recognized {{by more than one}} clone of B cells. To be able to react to innumerable antigens, as well as multiple constituent epitopes, the immune system requires the ability to recognize a very great number of epitopes in all, i.e., <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great diversity of B cell clones.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations.

Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas {{was estimated to be}} 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E
5|$|In 1766, John Gwynn {{complained in}} his work London and Westminster Improved {{that there was a}} lack of {{planning}} throughout the West End and that it would be useful to construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now Regent's Park) with the Prince Regent's Carlton House. John Fordyce was appointed as Surveyor-General to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1793 and concluded that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park ran out and ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link Pall Mall and the Haymarket, of which has since declined in quality. A further problem was increased congestion around Charing Cross, which would benefit from road improvements.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} plans {{involving a}} rapid transit circle line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital Rikshospitalet {{with the rest}} of the city. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. In the local newspaper Aftenposten Aften there was a debate on whether <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> ring line from Berg along the National Road 150 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet, or whether the Ullevål Hageby Line should be extended from John Colletts plass to Rikshospitalet, thereby creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station Forskningsparken. In the first plans, Berg was meant to be a station on the new ring line. This plan was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns. Even though Berg was not made a station on the Ring Line, noise shields were put up along the Sognsvann Line.|$|E

5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between {{cases where the}} courts have found that an applicant has standing to represent identifiable individuals (associational standing), and cases where the applicant purports to represent the public interest (public interest standing). Under this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> two-track system for standing. An applicant should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{brought with}} it {{the end of the}} {{consensus}} among English Protestants that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> single church imposed by the state, though there was still not complete freedom of religion. The ideals of the dissenting brethren of the Assembly were significant in the rise of denominationalism, the doctrine that the church is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched the idea that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode {{had a lot of}} potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E

5|$|Under the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a {{ceremonial}} role with no governmental power; the first President was Canaan Banana. Mugabe had previously offered {{the position to}} Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs. Although working together, there remained an aura of resentment and suspicion between Mugabe and Nkomo. Mugabe gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more. In contrast, some ZANU-PF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state. Tekere and Enos Nkala were particularly adamant that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> crackdown on ZAPU. After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in Entumbane, street clashes {{between the two parties}} broke out in the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1799 Joseph Fox {{started to}} give a series of lectures on dental surgery at Guy’s Hospital, and was {{appointed}} dental surgeon in the same year. Thomas Bell succeeded Fox as dental surgeon either in 1817 or 1825. Frederick Newland Pedley, who was appointed assistant dental surgeon at Guy’s Hospital in 1885, advocated {{the establishment of a}} dental school within the hospital, and he flooded the two dental schools in London, the Metropolitan School of Dental Science and the London School of Dental Surgery, with patients to prove that a further hospital was needed. In December 1888, Guy’s Hospital Dental School was established. Guy’s Hospital Dental School was recognised as a school of the University of London in 1901. In the 1970s, since there was a decline in the demand for dental services, the Department of Health of the UK suggested that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{decrease in the number of}} dental undergraduate students as well as the duration of all courses. In response to the recommendations, Royal Dental Hospital of London School of Dental Surgery amalgamated with the Guy’s Hospital Dental School of the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals on 1 August 1983.|$|E
5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E
