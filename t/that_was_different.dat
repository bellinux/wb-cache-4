5|$|Gaiman {{described}} {{writing the}} series as odd, {{since he had}} not written comics in half a decade; the story was trimmed down significantly as the size went from six 36-page chapters to eight 22-page segments. He also {{wanted to write a}} comic <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from The Sandman, his most recognized work. The profits of the series went to help fund his Marvels and Miracles LLC company, which is fighting for the rights to Marvelman.|$|E
5|$|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom {{satisfied}} both {{of these}} categories. Aside from the original arcade version, the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum system had released ports of the arcade game in 1987. By December 1988, the Nintendo Entertainment System had already seen two separate editions of the Temple of Doom game. The first version, distributed by Tengen, came in a black cartridge <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from Nintendo's traditional grey colour format. By this point, however, Tengen had split from Nintendo and was producing unlicensed games that attempted to circumvent {{the need for a}} 10NES lockout chip. Nintendo filed suit and Tengen lost, forcing it to remove its NES games from the market. The officially licensed version was released by Mindscape {{in the form of a}} standard Nintendo cartridge. Aside from the differences in cover art and cartridge form, however, the actual software of the two games is identical. After the NES version, the game was subsequently released for Atari ST and MSX in 1987, and Amiga, DOS, and Apple in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The temple {{therefore}} bears {{witness to}} a desire to construct something <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from other such buildings, doubtless {{in response to the}} constraints created by the terrain. The dedication in the temple sheds light on its construction: the inscription, which has been very precisely dated to 214 CE, consecrates the temple to the personification of victory, Victoria, here specifically in connection with the emperor’s campaigns in Germany, for the welfare of Caracalla and of his mother Iulia Domna.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{developed}} {{new cultural}} traits. Their language developed into Old English, a Germanic language <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from the languages previously spoken in Britain, {{and they were}} pagans, following a polytheistic religion. Differences in their daily material culture changed, as they stopped living in roundhouses and constructed rectangular timber homes {{similar to those found}} in Denmark and northern Germany. Their jewellery began to exhibit the increasing influence of Migration Period Art from continental Europe.|$|E
25|$|At {{a meeting}} of Commonwealth prime ministers in 1952 {{following}} the death of King George VI, it was agreed that the new Queen Elizabeth could have a royal style and title <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> in each dominion, but with an element common to all the dominions. New Zealand was thus an independent Commonwealth realm. In 1953 the New Zealand Parliament passed the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953, which formally recognised Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen of the United Kingdom and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|From the makams of {{the royal}} courts to the melodies {{of the royal}} harems, a type of dance music emerged <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from the oyun havası of fasıl music. In the Ottoman Empire, the harem was that part of a house set apart for {{the women of the}} family. It was a place in which non-family males were not allowed. Eunuchs guarded the sultan's harems, which were quite large, {{including}} several hundred women who were wives and concubines. There, female dancers and musicians entertained the women living in the harem. Belly dance was performed by women for women. This female dancer, known as a rakkase, hardly ever appeared in public.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} year Tarkovsky also began the {{production}} of the film The First Day (Russian: Первый День Pervyj Dyen′), based on a script by his friend and long-term collaborator Andrei Konchalovsky. The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of Peter the Great and starred Natalya Bondarchuk and Anatoli Papanov. To get the project approved by Goskino, Tarkovsky submitted a script <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from the original script, omitting several scenes that were critical of the official atheism in the Soviet Union. After shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors. Tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film.|$|E
25|$|Gray's {{defenders}} {{would later}} argue that Gray simply practiced a management style <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> {{from that of}} Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director, and some felt Gray's visits did much to raise {{the morale of the}} agents working in those field offices. Furthermore, Gray's leadership style seemed to mirror what he had learned in the US Navy, in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading. Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction and showed a lack of leadership. He was sure he {{was not the only one}} of the FBI leaders who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} recent experiment demonstrates {{several aspects of}} bee learning. Foragers were trained to enter a simple Y-shaped maze that had been marked at the entrance with a particular color. Inside the maze was a branching point where the bee was required to choose between two paths. One path, {{which led to the}} food reward, was marked with the same color that had been used {{at the entrance to the}} maze, while the other was marked with a different color. Foragers learned to choose the correct path, and continued to do so when a different kind of marker (black and white stripes oriented in various directions) was substituted for the colored markers. When the experimental conditions were reversed, rewarding bees for choosing the inner passage marked with a symbol <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from the entrance symbol, the bees again learned to choose the correct path. Variations in the length of the tunnel between the stimulus markers showed that bees retain information in working memory for about 5 seconds, equivalent to the short-term memory of birds. Altogether, the experiments demonstrated that bees can to choose between alternatives, determine if a stimulus is the same or different than one seen earlier, remember the earlier one for a short period, and generalize this performance to new pairs of stimuli.|$|E
