5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and <b>tridymite,</b> which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E
5|$|Fumarolic {{activity}} affects {{surrounding rocks}} and pyroclastics. Carbonates, opal, and white covers of possibly aluminum sulfate and calcium sulfate have been formed. Gypsum formed from the sulfur {{of the volcano}} {{is found in the}} form of crystals in the upper valleys of Taftan. Sinter and hydrothermally altered rocks are found farther down. Minerals formed by alteration processes include alunite, calcite, cristobalite, illite, jarosite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, quartz, smectite, sulfur and <b>tridymite.</b> Some epithermal mineralizations have been identified around Taftan. Other secondary factors at Taftan include lahars.|$|E
5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and <b>tridymite.</b> Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
25|$|Silicosis {{is due to}} {{deposition}} of fine respirable dust (less than 10 micrometers in diameter) containing crystalline silicon dioxide {{in the form of}} alpha-quartz, cristobalite, or <b>tridymite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crystalline silica {{exists in}} 7 {{different}} forms (polymorphs), {{depending upon the}} temperature of formation. The main 3 polymorphs are quartz, cristobalite, and <b>tridymite.</b> Quartz {{is the second most}} common mineral in the world (next to feldspar).|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{a mineral}} may change its crystal {{structure}} {{as a consequence}} of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting. For example, quartz will change into a variety of its SiO2 polymorphs, such as <b>tridymite</b> and cristobalite at high temperatures, and coesite at high pressures.|$|E
25|$|Amorphous silica {{consists}} of kieselgur (diatomite), from the skeletons of diatoms, and vitreous silica, produced by heating and then rapid cooling of crystalline silica. Amorphous silica is less toxic than crystalline, but not biologically inert, and diatomite, when heated, can convert to <b>tridymite</b> or cristobalite.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tridymite</b> and {{cristobalite}} are high-temperature polymorphs of SiO2 {{that occur}} in high-silica volcanic rocks. Coesite is a denser polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites and in metamorphic rocks formed at pressures greater than those typical of the Earth's crust. Stishovite is a yet denser and higher-pressure polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites. Lechatelierite is an amorphous silica glass SiO2 which is formed by lightning strikes in quartz sand.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, smoky quartz, morion, amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as <b>tridymite</b> and cristobalite, as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Most {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} silica {{are made of}} infinite arrangements of {SiO4} tetrahedra connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, α-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different Si–O distances (159.7 and 161.7pm) with a Si–O–Si angle of 144°. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual α-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537°C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar β-quartz, with a change of the Si–O–Si angle to 155° but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867°C results in another reversible phase transition to β-tridymite, in which some Si–O bonds are broken {{to allow for the}} arrangement of the {SiO4} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence <b>tridymite</b> occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120°C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to α-tridymite, similarly to the transition from α-quartz to β-quartz. β-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic β-cristobalite at about 1470°C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200–280°C to α-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. β-cristobalite melts at 1713°C; the freezing of silica from themelt is quite slow and vitrification, or the formation of a glass, is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica, the {SiO4} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt β-quartz (1550°C) or β-tridymite (1703°C). Silica boils at approximately 2800°C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following lightning strikes, forming glassy lechatelierite. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO4} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to silicon disulfide (SiS2) and silicon diselenide (SiSe2): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.|$|E
2500|$|The only stable form {{under normal}} {{conditions}} is alpha quartz, in which crystalline silicon dioxide is usually encountered. In nature, impurities in crystalline α-quartz can {{give rise to}} colors (see list). [...] The high-temperature minerals, cristobalite and <b>tridymite,</b> have both lower densities and indices of refraction than quartz. Since the composition is identical, {{the reason for the}} discrepancies must be in the increased spacing in the high-temperature minerals. As is common with many substances, the higher the temperature, the farther apart the atoms are, due to the increased vibration energy.|$|E
2500|$|Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, quartz (SiO2) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity. Quartz has several polymorphs, including <b>tridymite</b> and cristobalite at high temperatures, high-pressure coesite, and ultra-high pressure stishovite. The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been composed {{so much that it}} had changed from a silicate structure to that of rutile (TiO2). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is α-quartz. Its counterpart, β-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to α-quartz below 573°C at 1 bar). These two polymorphs differ by a [...] "kinking" [...] of bonds; this change in structure gives β-quartz greater symmetry than α-quartz, and they are thus also called high quartz (β) and low quartz (α).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tridymite</b> is a {{high-temperature}} polymorph of silica {{and usually}} occurs as minute tabular white or colorless pseudo-hexagonal crystals, or scales, in cavities in felsic volcanic rocks. Its chemical formula is SiO2. <b>Tridymite</b> was first described in 1868 {{and the type}} location is in Hidalgo, Mexico. The name is from the Greek tridymos for triplet as <b>tridymite</b> commonly occurs as twinned crystal [...] (compound crystals comprising three twinned crystal components).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tridymite</b> {{can occur}} in seven {{crystalline}} forms. Two {{of the most common}} at standard pressure are known as α and β. The α-tridymite phase is favored at elevated temperatures (>870 °C) and it converts to β-cristobalite at 1470 °C. However, <b>tridymite</b> does usually not form from pure β-quartz, one needs to add trace amounts of certain compounds to achieve this. Otherwise the β-quartz-tridymite transition is skipped and β-quartz transitions directly to cristobalite at 1050 °C without occurrence of the <b>tridymite</b> phase.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} of low-pressure polymorphs of anhydrous silica consist of frameworks of fully corner bonded tetrahedra of SiO4. The higher temperature polymorphs of silica cristobalite and <b>tridymite</b> are frequently {{the first to}} crystallize from amorphous anhydrous silica, and the local structures of microcrystalline opals also appear {{to be closer to}} that of cristobalite and <b>tridymite</b> than to quartz. The structures of <b>tridymite</b> and cristobalite are closely related and can be described as hexagonal and cubic close-packed layers. It is therefore possible to have intermediate structures in which the layers are not regularly stacked.|$|E

50|$|Commonly in most felsic ignimbrites {{the quartz}} polymorphs {{cristobalite}} and <b>tridymite</b> are usually {{found within the}} welded tuffs and breccias. In the majority of cases, it appears that these high-temperature polymorphs of quartz occurred post-eruption {{as part of an}} autogenic post-eruptive alteration in some metastable form. Thus although <b>tridymite</b> and cristobalite are common minerals in ignimbrites, they may not be primary magmatic minerals.|$|E
50|$|It occurs {{associated}} with hematite, magnetite, bixbyite, ilmenite, enstatite-ferrosilite, <b>tridymite,</b> quartz, sanidine, topaz, spessartine, beryl, mica, cassiterite and apatite.|$|E
50|$|Opal-CT {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as consisting of clusters of stacking of cristobalite and <b>tridymite</b> over very short length scales. The spheres of opal in opal-CT are themselves made up of tiny nanocrystalline blades of cristobalite and <b>tridymite.</b> Opal-CT has occasionally been further subdivided in the literature. Water content may {{be as high as}} 10 wt%. Lussatite is a synonym. Opal-C, also called lussatine, is interpreted as consisting of localized order of α-cristobalite with a lot of stacking disorder. Typical water content is about 1.5 wt%.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Quartz {{is one of}} {{the several}} {{thermodynamically}} stable crystalline forms of silica, SiO2. The most important forms of silica include: α-quartz, β-quartz, <b>tridymite,</b> cristobalite, coesite, and stishovite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{persistence}} of cristobalite outside of its thermodynamic stability range occurs because {{the transition from}} cristobalite to quartz or <b>tridymite</b> is [...] "reconstructive", requiring the breaking up and reforming of the silica framework. These frameworks are composed of SiO4 tetrahedra in which every oxygen atom is shared with a neighbouring tetrahedron, so that the chemical formula of silica is SiO2. The breaking of these bonds required to convert cristobalite to <b>tridymite</b> and quartz requires considerable activation energy and may not happen on a human time frame. Framework silicates are also known as tectosilicates.|$|E
50|$|Very {{large and}} {{cavernous}} spherulites are called lithophysae; {{they are found}} in obsidians at Lipari, in Yellowstone Park and other places. The characteristic radiate fibrous structure is usually conspicuous, but the fibers are interrupted by cavities that are often arranged as to give the spherulite a resemblance to a rosebud with folded petals separated by arching interspaces. Some of these lithophysae are several centimeters or more in diameter. <b>Tridymite,</b> fayalite and other minerals in the lithophysae may be precipitates from the vapor phase that occupied the cavities. The fibers of these coarse spherulites are alkali feldspar (sanidine or anorthoclase) and <b>tridymite.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Crystalline silica {{exists in}} 7 {{different}} forms (polymorphs), {{depending upon the}} temperature of formation. The main 3 polymorphs are quartz, cristobalite, and <b>tridymite.</b> Quartz {{is the second most}} common mineral in the world (next to feldspar).|$|E
50|$|Quartz is {{typically}} rare in trachyte, but <b>tridymite</b> (which likewise consists of silica) {{is by no}} means uncommon. It is rarely in crystals large enough to be visible without the aid of the microscope, but in thin sections it may appear as small hexagonal plates, which overlap and form dense aggregates, like a mosaic or like the tiles on a roof. They often cover the surfaces of the larger feldspars or line the steam cavities of the rock, where they may be mingled with amorphous opal or fibrous chalcedony. In the older trachytes, secondary quartz is not rare, and probably sometimes results from the recrystallization of <b>tridymite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{a mineral}} may change its crystal {{structure}} {{as a consequence}} of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting. For example, quartz will change into a variety of its SiO2 polymorphs, such as <b>tridymite</b> and cristobalite at high temperatures, and coesite at high pressures.|$|E

50|$|The {{meteoric}} iron of stony-irons {{is similar}} to that of iron meteorites, consisting mostly of kamacite and taenite in different proportions. The silicates are dominated by olivine. Accessory minerals that also include non-silicates are: carlsbergite, chromite, cohenite, daubréelite, feldspar, graphite, ilmenite, merrillite, low-calcium pyroxene, schreibersite, <b>tridymite</b> and troilite.|$|E
50|$|Trimorphism is {{the term}} used when a mineral has {{a total of three}} dimorphs, while the term Polymorphism is used when there are four or more. Silica, SiO2, is a good example, being found in nature as quartz, <b>tridymite,</b> cristobalite, coesite, and stishovite. Pleomorphism is a synonym of polymorphism.|$|E
50|$|Fe-rich olivine is {{relatively}} much less common, but {{it occurs in}} igneous rocks in small amounts in rare granites and rhyolites, and extremely Fe-rich olivine can exist stably with quartz and <b>tridymite.</b> In contrast, Mg-rich olivine does not occur stably with silica minerals, as it would react with them to form orthopyroxene ((Mg,Fe)2Si2O6).|$|E

50|$|He {{is largely}} remembered {{for his work}} {{involving}} mineralogical syntheses, being credited with laboratory reproduction of quartz, <b>tridymite,</b> zircon, beryl, mica, alumina and many other minerals. He determined the temperatures at which minerals dissociate {{as well as the}} temperature at which they will crystallize into a particular crystal system. He also conducted research on the oxides of nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|AlPO4 is isoelectronic with Si2O4, silicon dioxide. Berlinite {{looks like}} quartz {{and has a}} {{structure}} {{that is similar to}} quartz with silicon replaced by Al and P. The AlO4 and PO4 tetrahedra alternate. Like quartz, AlPO4 exhibits chirality and piezoelectric properties. Crystalline AlPO4 (berlinite) when heated, converts to <b>tridymite</b> and cristobalite forms, and this mirrors the behaviour of silicon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|Veining can {{be reduced}} or avoided {{by the use of}} more {{refractory}} non-silica sands (zircon, chromite etc); by flux additives which lower the temperature of silica transition to <b>tridymite</b> or cristobalite, or which sinter the sand increasing resistance to failure; or by organic additives which are decomposed to carbon at high temperature, which then bonds to silica increasing strength, imparting veining resistance.|$|E
