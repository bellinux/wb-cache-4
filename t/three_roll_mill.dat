50|$|A <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>mill</b> {{or triple}} roll mill is {{a machine that}} uses shear force created by three {{horizontally}} positioned rolls rotating in opposite directions and different speeds relative to each other, in order to mix, refine, disperse, or homogenize viscous materials fed into it.|$|E
50|$|Inks for electrodes, terminals, resistors, {{dielectric}} layers etc. {{are commonly}} prepared by mixing the metal or ceramic powders required with an organic vehicle {{to produce a}} paste for screen-printing. To achieve a homogeneous ink the mixed components of the ink may be passed through a <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>mill.</b> Alternatively, ready made inks may be obtained {{from one of the}} many companies offering products for the thick film technologist.|$|E
50|$|The three {{adjacent}} {{rolls of}} a <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>mill</b> (called the feed roll, centre roll and apron roll) rotate at progressively higher speeds. Material, {{usually in the}} form of paste, is fed between the feed roll and the center roll. Due to the narrowing space between the rolls, most of the paste initially remains in the feed region. The part that makes it through the first in-running nip experiences very high shear force due to the different rotation speeds of the two rolls. Upon exiting, the material that remains on the center roll moves through the second nip between the center roll and apron roll. This subjects it to an even higher shear force, due to the higher speed of the apron roll and typically, a smaller gap than between the feed and centre rolls. A knife blade then scrapes the processed material off the apron roll and the paste rolls down the apron. This milling cycle can be repeated several times to maximize dispersion.|$|E
40|$|Common {{dispersion}} {{methods such as}} ultrasonic sonication, planetary centrifugal {{mixing and}} magnetic dispersion have been used extensively to achieve moderate exfoliation of nanoparticles in polymer matrix. In this study, {{the effect of adding}} <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> to these <b>three</b> dispersion methods for nanoclay dispersion into epoxy matrix was investigated. A combination of each of these mixing methods with <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> showed varying results relative to the unmodified polymer laminate. A significant exfoliation of the nanoparticles in the polymer structure was obtained by dispersing the nanoclay combining <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> to magnetic and planetary centrifugal mixing methods. This exfoliation promoted a stronger interfacial bond between the matrix and the fiber, which increased the final properties of the E-glass/epoxy nanocomposite. However, a combination of ultrasound sonication and <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> on the other hand, resulted in poor clay exfoliation; the sonication process degraded the polymer network, which adversely affected the nanocomposite final properties relative to the unmodified E-glass/epoxy polymer...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} carbon fiber/epoxy {{composites}} and MWCNT (multiwalled carbon nanotube) /carbon fiber/epoxy hybrid composites with 0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 5 and 1 weight% nanotube filling {{of the matrix}} have been prepared and compared in terms of interlaminar properties. For the dispersion of the carbon nanotubes in the epoxy resin <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> has been utilized. The mechanical characterization {{has been carried out}} using standard DCB (double cantilever beam) tests assisted by acoustic emission. The test results have been evaluated by the conventional method provided by the standard and a novel method implementing acoustic emission signal localization for crack propagation tracing. According to the tests carbon nanotube filling of the matrix of the composites has a beneficial effect on their interlaminar properties: the interlaminar fracture toughness values of the composites have increased by a maximum of 13 and 33 % at a 0. 3 weight% carbon nanotube content of the matrix according to the conventional and AE based evaluation method respectively...|$|R
40|$|Commercially {{available}} multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) {{were incorporated}} in coating masses based on PVC {{by means of}} <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>mill.</b> The best results could be obtained using the 5 [*]µm gap.

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composites {{are high}} performance materials which {{are widely used}} in various applications, such as aircraft and high-end automobile structures. In theory, stiffer and tougher matrices provide better support to the fiber, hence enhancing {{the properties of the}} FRP composites. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve the properties of FRP composite by incorporating nanoclay as filler in the epoxy resin. The nanoclay particle was dispersed in epoxy resin using a <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>mill</b> machine. This thesis comprises of two main parts which are the characterization of the nanomodified-epoxy polymer and investigation of mechanical properties of the nanoclay-FRP composites with an emphasis on flexural and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) behavior. In the first part, an experimental investigation was conducted in order to identify the degree of dispersion of nanoclay in the resin system. The quality of the nanocomposites of the nanoclay in the epoxy was evaluated using x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. In addition, the thermal and mechanical properties of the nanoclay-modified epoxy compared to the neat epoxy system were also investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and flexural tests. In the second part, the mechanical properties of nanoclay-filled FRP composites were studied. The FRP composite laminates were fabricated using vacuum bagging techniques. The specimens were tested for flexural and short beam shear tests, respectively. The 5 wt% nanoclay content in the carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites (CFRP) composites gave a tremendous enhancement in flexural modulus, flexural strength and ILSS of 40 %, 48 % and 51 %, respectively, when compared to the neat CFRP system. For glass fiber reinforced polymer composites (GFRP) composites, 5 wt% nanoclay content also gave a significantly improvement on flexural modulus, flexural strength and ILSS of about 37 %, 80 % and 63 %, respectively, when compared to the neat GFRP system. Lastly, hybrid [G^Js composites with 5 wt% nanoclay also gave the highest flexural modulus, flexural strength and ILSS with 32 %, 53 % and 39 %, respectively when compared to the pure hybrid system...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S) - Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringCarbon {{nanomaterials}} {{have recently}} been discovered which possess many unique physical properties. Multiple {{attempts have been made}} to integrate these materials into new technologies, including carbon nanocomposites with the goal of vastly improving the performance of these products. This thesis focuses on the incorporation of carbon nanofibers (CNF), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT), and buckminsterfullerene’s (buckyballs) into Cytec’s Corfil 625 - 1, an existing one-part potting compound. The goal was to improve the compressive strength of the material while maintaining the lap shear strength and keeping the density under that of a commercially available two-part potting compound, 3 M’s EC- 3500. The use of surfactants from BYK-Chemie led to an improvement in compressive strength of 45 % when 5 wt% CNF was added. Carboxylic acid functionalization also showed improvement, however, CNF could not be added at a wt% as high as with the surfactant and a compressive strength enhancement of 11. 5 % was obtained. It was determined from SEM micrographs that preliminary mixing methods were breaking the glass balloons that were present in the 625 - 1 as provided by Cytec. As a result, the material was obtained without the microballoons and curing agent and new mixing methods were developed. The new compound allowed for greater flexibility in the mixing process, including higher shear and heating. It was also necessary to investigate the use of glass microballoons in order to replace what was not provided by Cytec. The use of S 15 glass microballoons from 3 M allowed for production of a potting compound similar to that of the 625 - 1 originally provided by Cytec. S 38 HS microballoons produced a one-part compound that was similar to the goal compound EC- 3500. Sonication for 5 hours produced better results than the hand mixing that was initially performed, increasing the compressive strength of the potting compound by 21. 7 % when 1 wt% functionalized CNF was added to the compound. MWNT of various sizes were investigated, with the smallest diameter nanotube (8 nm) providing the best improvement. A <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> <b>mill</b> was utilized as a new mixing method that would reduce complications and allow for the process to be scaled up producing larger batches of carbon nanocomposite. The number of times the material was run through the mill was an important parameter and a 30. 9 % improvement was acquired when the composite went through 7 times...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{gradient}} grain structure {{was produced by}} processing rod billets through <b>three</b> <b>roll</b> planetary <b>milling</b> (also known as PSW process). This kind of gradient structure is reported to provide an excellent combination of strength and ductility owing to an ultrafine-grained surface layer and a coarse-grained interior of the billet. Specifically, copper rod samples were subjected to up to six passes of PSW at room temperature. To study {{the evolution of the}} microstructure during the deformation, microhardness measurements and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) analysis were performed after one, three and six passes. Additionally, the distributions of the equivalent stress during PSW and the equivalent strain after processing were studied by finite element analysis using the commercial software QFORM. The results showed the efficacy of PSW as a means of imparting a gradient ultrafine-grained structure to copper rods. A good correlation between the simulated equivalent strain distribution and the measured microhardness distribution was demonstrated...|$|R
