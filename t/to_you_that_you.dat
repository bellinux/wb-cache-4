25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not as committed to them as you thought you were.|$|E
500|$|Regarding her {{approach}} to acting, Moore {{said in a}} 2002 interview that she leaves 95 percent of the performance to be discovered on set: [...] "I {{want to have a}} sense of who a character is, and then I want to get there and have it happen to me on camera." [...] The aim, she said, is to [...] "try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [...] <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't bring the emotion to it... and when it happens, there's nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding." ...|$|E

That person is so close <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are able to share some things only with him. For example, you can call that friend, and from the very first maniacal laugh or some other joke you will know who is {{at the other end of}} that line. We used to do that with him so often. And then when that person is gone, there will be nothing like that in your life ever again." ...|$|E

2500|$|... ”(The angel) saw {{him while}} he was praying and said, 'You've tired God with your {{requests}} since a long time. You asked God and you requires to suffer here (bottom) the punishment of the sin of which you would not be worthy of the perfect reward, and not to be deprived on his account from the perfect reward. I can attest <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have made a sin which deprive yourself of the higher reward; however you will have the fate of the saints. If you want to keep your kingdom and the lives of your children for long time, ceases to address this demand and in the resurrection your reward will be that of the just. If you want the highest reward and to be punished here, this shall be your punishment: you will be deprived of your kingdom, your children will be slaughtered before your eyes, and in the end your enemies will burn you. So choose what you want.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Continued Allied {{failure and}} heavy losses at the Battle of Loos between September and October 1915 ended any {{remaining}} {{confidence in the}} British commander, Sir John French and in the judgement of Lord Kitchener. Asquith resorted to a favoured stratagem and, persuading Kitchener to undertake {{a tour of the}} Gallipoli battlefield in the hope that he could be persuaded to remain in the Mediterranean as Commander-in-Chief, took temporary charge of the War Office himself. He then replaced French with Sir Douglas Haig; the latter recording in his diary for 10 December 1915; [...] "About 7pm I received a letter from the Prime Minister marked 'Secret' and enclosed in three envelopes. It ran 'Sir J. French has placed in my hands his resignation… Subject to the King's approval, I have the pleasure of proposing <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should be his successor.'" [...] Asquith also appointed Sir William Robertson as Chief of the Imperial General Staff with increased powers, reporting directly to the Cabinet and with the sole right to give them military advice, relegating the Secretary of State for War to the tasks of recruiting and supplying the army. Lastly, he instituted a smaller Dardanelles Committee, re-christened the War Committee, with himself, Balfour, Bonar Law, Lloyd George and Reginald McKenna as members although, as this soon increased, the Committee continued the failings of its predecessor, being [...] "too large and lack(ing) executive authority". None of this saved the Dardanelles Campaign and the decision to evacuate was taken in December, resulting in the resignation from the Duchy of Lancaster of Churchill, who wrote, [...] "I could not accept a position of general responsibility for war policy without any effective share in its guidance and control." [...] Further reverses took place in the Balkans: the Central Powers overran Serbia, forcing the Allied troops which had attempted to intervene back towards Salonika.|$|E
