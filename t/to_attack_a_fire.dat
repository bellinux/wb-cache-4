5000|$|A Mattydale lay, {{also called}} [...] "cross-lay", [...] "speedlay", and [...] "transverse lay", {{is a method}} of storing hose on a fire engine. This method of storing hose is {{designed}} for rapid deployment of a hose line <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b> In this manner, the hose is stored perpendicularly across the fire apparatus, usually above or adjacent to the pump panel, {{instead of the usual}} parallel storage in the rear. This allows the firefighter to pull the hose {{in the direction of the}} fire instead of having to make a turn.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 April 1945, U-546 {{made contact}} with the {{destroyer}} escort [...] and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>attack,</b> <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> stern torpedo. The destroyer turned into it and was hit, which tore the DE apart and sent her down with heavy loss of life.|$|R
50|$|At this time, {{one of the}} IAF pilots broke off, {{gained a}} little height and came in <b>to</b> <b>attack.</b> He <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> full burst of 20 mm at the PAF pilots, fatally {{wounding}} Naik Mohammad Din and knocking Jagjivan unconscious with a profusely bleeding arm. The encounter had lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes. Flying Officer Dogar began to retaliate and wounded PAF pilot Alfred Jagjivan came to his rescue. The PAF pilots had shot down the IAF pilots, killing all the IAF pilots in action.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Prussian XI Corps {{had become}} {{involved}} in an engagement. The left of the V Corps' outposts had overnight occupied Gunstett and {{the bank of the}} Sauer, and the French, shortly after daylight on 6 August 1870, sent down an unarmed party to fetch water. As this appeared through the mist, the Prussians naturally fired upon it, and the French General Lartigue (to whose division the party belonged), puzzled to account for the firing, brought up some batteries in readiness <b>to</b> repel <b>an</b> <b>attack.</b> These <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> few rounds only, but remained in position as a precaution.|$|R
50|$|On 28 April 1943 at Djebel Bou Azoukaz, Tunisia, Lance-Corporal Kenneally charged alone {{down the}} bare forward slope {{straight}} into {{the main body of}} the enemy about <b>to</b> make <b>an</b> <b>attack,</b> <b>firing</b> his Bren gun from the hip; the enemy were so surprised that they broke up in disorder. The lance-corporal repeated his exploit on 30 April when, accompanied by a sergeant, he charged the enemy forming up for assault, inflicting many casualties. Even when wounded he refused to give up, but hopped from one fire position to another, carrying his gun in one hand and supporting himself on a comrade with the other.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, {{efforts were}} started to develop surface-to-air {{missiles}} {{as it was}} generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance. The lethal radius of a flak shell is fairly small, and the chance of delivering a [...] "hit" [...] is essentially a fixed percentage per round. In order <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> target, guns <b>fire</b> continually while the aircraft are in range in order to launch as many shells as possible, increasing the chance {{that one of these}} will end up within the lethal range. Against the Boeing B-17, which operated just within the range of the numerous German eighty-eights flak guns, an average of 2,805 rounds had to be fired per bomber destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the last}} day of June, Farragut ordered Capt. H. W. Morris, Senior Naval Officer at New Orleans, to man Sachem with {{officers}} and crew, so the Coast Survey probably returned her to the Navy there about this time. In the same dispatch, he also ordered Sachem to blockade Aransas Pass, Texas. Commanded by Acting Volunteer Lt. Amos Johnson, the gunboat served there as tender to bark [...] late in July. On 12 August, she took an unidentified prize in Aransas Bay. Four days later, she and yacht [...] engaged a battery behind a levee. One shot struck the gunboat's side and wounded a petty officer before the Union ships silenced the Southern guns. The Confederate artillerymen later returned to their guns and resumed the duel which continued intermittently throughout the day. Two days later, Sachem, , and Arthur supported a party from sloop , which landed near Corpus Christi, Texas <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> battery. <b>Fire</b> from the ships enabled the beach party to beat off <b>a</b> counter <b>attack</b> by large bodies of infantry and cavalry. They held their beachhead on the shore until freely withdrawing late in the day after exhausting their ammunition. Sachem’s commanding officer, Acting Master Amos Johnson, won high praise for his [...] "courage and zeal" [...] during the action.|$|R
2500|$|In spring 1971, 1st Battalion, 82nd Artillery was {{deployed}} {{along the}} Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) {{in support of}} Operation Lam Son 719, the ARVN invasion of Laos. The battalion made {{one of the longest}} nighttime road marches of the Vietnam War driving 192 miles in only 12 hours. 1st Bn, 82nd Artillery units manned several critical fire bases right on the border of North Vietnam to support Vietnamese and U.S. forces operating in these areas. [...] At the height of this fighting in a 10-hour period, 1st Bn, 82nd Artillery guns fired between 7,000 and 9,000 rounds at an NVA Division that was trying <b>to</b> mount <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> against <b>Fire</b> Support Base Vandegrift the battalion's headquarters. During the 69 days of Operation Lam Son 719 the 1st Battalion, 82nd Artillery lost four men killed and twenty wounded with three more fatalities due to non-hostile causes. The battalion returned to the United States at the end of 1971 where it was soon deactivated.|$|R
2500|$|The leading {{elements}} of the First Brigade spread out to match their opponents' configuration, and for two hours the combatants fired at each other through blinding clouds of smoke. The 10th Connecticut relieved the exhausted, but not badly bloodied, 25th Massachusetts, but they too could not advance. No progress was made until the Second Brigade arrived, and its commander, Brig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno, ordered {{them to try to}} penetrate the [...] "impenetrable" [...] swamp on the Union left. Brig. Gen. John G. Foster then ordered two of his reserve regiments to do the same on the right. About this time, Brig. Gen. John G. Parke came up with the Third Brigade, and it was immediately sent to assist. Although they were not coordinated, the two flanking movements emerged from the swamp at nearly the same time. Reno ordered his 21st Massachusetts, 51st New York, and 9th New Jersey <b>to</b> <b>attack.</b> <b>As</b> they were <b>firing</b> on the Confederates, the 23rd Massachusetts, from the First Brigade, appeared {{on the other end of}} the line. The defensive line began to crack; noting this, Foster ordered his remaining forces <b>to</b> <b>attack.</b> Under assault from three sides, the Confederates broke and fled.|$|R
5000|$|The British took {{possession}} of Sarpen {{under the terms}} of capitulation following the second battle of Copenhagen on 7 September 1807. Sarpen arrived on 7 November at Chatham where she was fitted out from November to August 1808. She was to be renamed Voltiguer but the Admiralty canceled the name change. After refit she joined the British Navy as HMS Sarpen. Commander James Gifford took command of Sarpen on 16 May 1808 for the North Sea and Baltic. In 1809 she came under the command of Commander John Sanderson Gibson and participated in the Walcheren Expedition. She took up station off Blackenbeg (probably Blankenberge). In early May Gibson boarded a vessel with an English license and found out from the Master information about the size and status of the French fleet at Terneuzen. Gibson passed the information up the chain of command to Admiral Sir Richard J. Strachan. [...] Similarly, on 29 June, boats from Sarpen captured a boat and took five prisoners. Gibson interrogated the prisoners from whom he learned that the French were stringing a chain across the river at Antwerp <b>to</b> prevent <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> by <b>fire</b> ships. By October 1809, however, Sarpen was at Anholt, to which she had escorted four supply ships.|$|R
40|$|This report aims to {{establish}} a design methodology for meeting basic fire safety objectives within single storey industrial buildings using a 'common-sense' approach. A wide range of fire safety issues are addressed, ranging from environmental protection to life safety and structural performance. The emphasis is on meeting the performance requirements of the New Zealand Building Code for fire safety and hazard management. Given that industrial buildings are likely to fall into <b>a</b> high <b>fire</b> hazard category, alternative fire engineering design methods are deemed necessary for Building Code compliance. Attention is also given to issues that {{are not part of}} Building Code requirements or acceptable solutions. <b>A</b> <b>fire</b> safety strategy is recommended for an industrial site, with the focus on establishing a level of 'acceptable loss'. A risk assessment provides the means to meet loss control objectives. This should form the basis for <b>a</b> new buildings' <b>fire</b> protection design, plus the on-going fire safety management programme. Automatic alarms are considered essential for life safety and property protection, with sprinklers being the only method of controlling <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> within <b>a</b> typical industrial complex. The Fire Service cannot be expected <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> and suppress <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> from receiving <b>an</b> alarm call without sprinkler support. The Fire Service can, however, be expected to control the spread of fire to neighbouring property given certain conditional events work in their favour. The act of prewetting neighbouring combustible surfaces and thereby increasing the critical radiation intensity for pilot ignition, is considered very effective in preventing fire spread. Increasing fire rating requirements for boundary walls based on withstanding equivalent fire severities for the 'design' fire, is considered overly conservative. A maximum rating of 4 hours is recommended for any boundary wall. This recommendation is based on maximum values used in overseas Codes and assumes that boundary walls are connected to primary support structures and adjoining wall panels, so that if they fail they collapse inwards as one complete unit. The report provides a comprehensive list of conclusions that expand on the above overview, plus recommends areas for future research...|$|R
5000|$|Set in the 1860s, it {{is about}} a lively eleven-year-old tomboy named Caroline Augusta Woodlawn, nicknamed [...] "Caddie", living {{in the area of}} Dunnville, Wisconsin. As a young girl she made the journey from Boston to Dunnville with her family, one which nearly cost her life. Sickly and weak, she is allowed to run wild with her brothers, Tom and Warren, to regain her health. They spend much of their time {{exploring}} the woods and rivers that surround their farm. The book opens with Caddie, late for dinner after an excursion to visit the local Indian tribe, embarrassing her mother with her antics. She, undaunted, spends the next year having a string of adventures and scares. From a midnight ride through the forest to warn her friend “Indian John” that the settlers are planning <b>an</b> <b>attack,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prairie <b>fire</b> that brings out the best in Obediah, a schoolhouse bully, to a life-threatening fall through a lake while ice skating, her life is far from boring. Things come to a head when “perfect” Cousin Annabelle from Boston arrives for a visit and Caddie is forced to confront her future. Tom and Warren, always a part of her adventures, come along for the journey. This story is full of practical jokes and touching moments like the long journey home of Nero, a beloved pet. It is the true story of a family’s existence on the frontier during the Civil War, and offers insights into how life was lived in a small Wisconsin village where fear of local Indians was a reality and life and death situations arose with frightening regularity. The sequel, Magical Melons (1939), continues the story of Caddie and her family.|$|R
2500|$|The Japanese commander, Terunuma, {{attempting}} {{to buy time}} for the Japanese forces withdrawing from Cape Gloucester, reinforced the troops {{attempting to}} hold Talasea, sending another company forward throughout the night of 6/7 March.

Nevertheless, these troops withdrew shortly after dawn when the Marines launched <b>an</b> early morning <b>attack</b> on 7 March. Throughout the day heavy fighting followed as the Americans advanced towards the opposite coast, sending patrols out towards the hills to the south in order to secure their flank. As they approached Mount Schleuther elements of the Japanese 54th Infantry Regiment, moving west along the high ground in an effort to cut the Marines off, began to pour heavy fire down on the Americans. In response, Company 'E' established a strong base of fire while Company 'F'– with covering fire from artillery and mortars– was hurriedly dispatched to gain a position from which <b>to</b> launch <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> by <b>fire,</b> with elements of Company 'H' protecting their right flank. Arriving ahead of the Japanese, the Marines began firing down on them, killing 40 in a one sided battle that pushed them down the reverse slope. Meanwhile, the US reinforcements– the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines– that had been scheduled to arrive early on 7 March were delayed until the afternoon, when they began taking over responsibility for the defense of the beachhead from the 1st Battalion. As a result, the plan for the envelopment of the village of Liapo, southwest of Little Mount Worri, and Waru, west of the emergency landing strip at Talasea, had to be modified. Instead of having one battalion proceed straight up the track while the crossed the mountains, a company from the 1st Battalion was sent through the scrub, west of the hills, towards Liapo. Hindered by the dense jungle they became isolated and had to harbor up for the night, while the 2nd Battalion established a night perimeter around part of Mount Schleuther and Bitokara track.|$|R
