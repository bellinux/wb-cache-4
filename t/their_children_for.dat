5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France. They were {{resisted}} by Indigenous communities who were unwilling to leave <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> extended periods and who came to associate missionaries with the diseases devastating Indigenous populations. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the RÃ©collets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also {{played a role in the}} decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.|$|E
5|$|First-wave {{feminism}} was {{a period}} of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK Custody of Infants Act 1839 which introduced the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> the first time. Other legislation such as the Married Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, these became models for similar legislation in other British territories. For example, Victoria passed legislation in 1884, New South Wales in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} what effects (if any) an unplanned, out of wedlock pregnancy has on various personality characteristics of unwed mothers, both pre- and post-parturition, and to determine if there were any differences between the girls who decided to keep <b>their</b> <b>child</b> and the girls who decided to surrender <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> adoption. The personality characteristics measured and the instruments used to measure them were the following: locus of control (James 1 -E Scale); need for approval (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale-M-e Scale); Real self concept, self-esteem, ideal self concept, self-adjustment (Bills Index of Adjustment and Values - BIAV); and "submissiveness" and "ego strength" (16 PF - Form C). The subjects were single women who were pregnant for the first time and were receiving assistance from the Department of Social Services, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Ten girls, with a mean age of 18. 1 years, made the decision to keep <b>their</b> <b>child</b> and nine girls, with a mean age of 18. 8 years, made the decision to surrender <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> adoption. The girls were assessed approximately one and one-half months pre-parturition and again completed the 16 PF and the BIAV one and one-half months after parturition. The control group consisted of twelve single, never pregnant females with a mean age of 19. 9 years. They were also assessed twice (with a three month interval between assessments). The data obtained from the 1 -E scale and the M-C scale was analyzed by a one way analysis of variance model. The data obtained from the BlAV and the 16 PF was analyzed by a two factor, fixed effects analysis of variance model. The results showed that during pregnancy, unwed mothers are low on real self concept and self-esteem but following parturition, their real self concept and self-esteem rises to a level equivalent to that of single, never pregnant girls. It was also found that during pregnancy the unwed mothers were low on "ego strength" but following delivery of <b>their</b> <b>child</b> they were not different from single, never pregnant women on "ego strength". In general, the psychological trauma of unwed motherhood is not as severe as is popularly believed as is evidenced by the fact that even the personality characteristics that are affected during pregnancy show no differences between unwed mothers after parturition and single, never pregnant girls. The self-esteem level of both the girls who placed <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> adoption and the girls who kept <b>their</b> <b>child</b> improved significantly after delivery of the child. Following parturition the girls who kept <b>their</b> <b>child</b> had a significantly higher real self concept and ideal self concept than the girls who placed <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> adoption. It was also found that the girls who kept <b>their</b> <b>child</b> were more dependent and tended to lean on others when making decisions but otherwise they were not more "submissive". Both groups scored equally on "ego strength" while they were pregnant and for both groups, their "ego strength" improved with parturition. In general, the differences between the girls who keep <b>their</b> <b>child</b> and the girls who place <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> adoption are slight and after parturition, both groups appear equally able to accept and adjust to their decision of whether to keep or place <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> adoption...|$|R

25|$|More recent {{research}} {{found that in}} a sample of mothers who had released <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> adoption four to 12 years prior, every participant had frequent thoughts of their lost child. For most, thoughts were both negative and positive in that they produced both feelings of sadness and joy. Those who experienced the greatest portion of positive thoughts were those who had open, rather than closed or time-limited mediated adoptions.|$|E
25|$|All settlers, whether full {{members or}} not, were {{required}} to attend church services and were subject to church discipline. The Lord's Supper, however, was reserved to full members only.

25|$|The {{school year}} starts {{after the summer break}} (different {{from state to}} state, usually end/mid of August) and is divided into two terms. There are {{typically}} 12 weeks of holidays in addition to public holidays. Exact dates differ between states, but there are generally six weeks of summer and two weeks of Christmas holiday. The other holiday periods occur in spring (during the period around Easter Sunday) and autumn (during the former harvest, where farmers used to need <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> field work).

Ariadne bewails her abandonment by Theseus and Dionysus weds her. Dionysus drives the women of Argos to kill <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> refusing his rites. Perseus is incited by Hera to attack the Bacchantes and turns Ariadne into stone after which the Argives accept the rites of Dionysus on Hermes' demand.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some have criticised the over-reliance on private tuition, saying that {{students}} may not pay attention during lessons as {{they are able to}} fall back on their tuition classes later. Students may also be unable to find answers on their own, having relied on their tutors for answers during their school years. Some tuition centres reportedly do schoolwork on their students' behalf. Others have also criticised private tuition for taking up too much of students' free time. Due to the high cost of tuition, there are concerns that low-income families were unable to send <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> such classes. However, the government have partially subsidised private tuition at certain community bodies for children from low-income families.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the more}} {{controversial}} practices endorsed by Mr. DeSisto and the school {{was the use of}} regional [...] "parent councils" [...] that parents of students were required to attend.

25|$|Private tuition is {{a lucrative}} {{industry}} in Singapore, since many parents send <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> private tuition after school. A straw poll by The Straits Times newspaper in 2008 {{found that out}} of 100 students interviewed, only 3 students {{did not have any}} form of tuition. In 2010, the Shin Min Daily News estimated that there were around 540 tuition centres offering private tuition in Singapore. Due to their high demand, tuition centres are able to charge high fees for their services; they have an annual turnover of SGD$110.6 million in 2005. However, this industry is largely unregulated, though tuition centres are required to be registered with the Ministry of Education. There is no such requirement for individual private tutors.|$|E

500|$|Finally her soliciting {{paid off}} and in 1881, Rosebery {{was offered a}} {{government}} position acceptable to him, that of Under Secretary at the Home Office with special responsibility for Scotland. He had sought the position feeling that Scotland was neglected by the Liberal Government who {{were more interested in}} Ireland. However, immediately upon assuming the job he began to demand a place in the cabinet. The office he sought was that of Lord Privy Seal, a position Gladstone refused on account of Rosebery's inexperience in Government. It appeared that Rosebery was showing his true colours and he was accused of behaving like a spoilt child, with doubts cast over the honourableness of his reasons for refusing the Under Secretaryship of the India Office. Lady Rosebery, [...] "conscious of her husband's supreme ability," [...] wanted him in the cabinet and was furiously agitating her husband's discontent until Rosebery threatened to resign his Home Office position. Lady Rosebery had an angry row with Gladstone's wife, where Mrs Gladstone pointed out that if Rosebery resigned he would have nothing but horse racing to interest him, and that Lady Rosebery should be patient as her husband was young. Rosebery, accepting that a cabinet place {{was not going to be}} forthcoming, resigned from Government. Lady Rosebery, realising further appeal to the Gladstones was pointless, tried a new avenueâLord Hartington, the immensely influential Secretary of State for War, who was already quarrelling with Gladstone over the Irish home rule problem, and whom she allegedly met by chance at Preston Railway Station. Inviting him into her carriage for the journey to London, she pleaded her husband's case for three hours to her captive listener. The Roseberys then immediately left England and <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> a long trip to America and Australia. On their return in 1885 Rosebery was appointed Lord Privy Seal, complete with the seat in the cabinet which he sought.|$|E
