"I have <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> all <b>over</b> since, Miss Bolton," [...] he said--he half hesitated {{whether he}} should say [...] "Meenie" [...] or not, and she was half {{disappointed}} that he didn't, for they were both very young, and very young people fall in love so unaffectedly--"I have <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> all <b>over,</b> and I {{have come to the}} conclusion that there is no help for it: I must break openly with the Church." ...|$|R
