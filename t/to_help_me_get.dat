500|$|The {{remains of}} the crew members of HH-53C Jolly Roger 67—Chapman, Call, Avery, Prater, and Pearson, and Alley—were {{returned}} to the United States on October 1, 1997. The six were honored on November 19, 1997 in a full military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and a headstone commemorating all six airmen was placed at the site. Hambleton was unable to attend due to poor health, but a letter from him was read. He wrote, [...] "They deserve all the accolades that we, the living, can bestow upon them. Again, I thank them, I honor them, and I will always hold great faith in my heart with them." [...] Clark was present. He told {{the families of the}} downed fliers that [...] "Each of you played a distinct role and forming the character of these men who so willingly paid a very dear price <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> out of the jungles of Vietnam. You have my deepest sympathy—you and these six brave men." ...|$|E
2500|$|In event finals, Khorkina {{gave up her}} spot in {{the vault}} final to teammate, Elena Zamolodchikova, who ended up winning the gold medal. Khorkina said, [...] "I thought she could win the gold. I'm glad I could give her that opportunity." [...] She then won the uneven bars final with a score of 9.862. Commenting on the {{all-around}} final, Khorkina said, [...] "If I didn't get over the disappointment, I wouldn't be Khorkina. I wouldn't be standing here with the gold medal. It still hurts a lot. It was cruel to all the participants, to vault on a nonstandard height. It's quite possible to get killed. The five centimeters could decide {{the future of a}} sports person. But I was fortunate to have many people <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> through it. Tomorrow, I will dance for Russia. I will leave what happened on the vault far behind me, like the North Pole." [...] She then won the silver medal in the floor final with a score of 9.812.|$|E
2500|$|After she {{had arrived}} in the United States in 1989 with Panait, Comăneci stated, [...] "Constantin told me that I was going to live with his wife and {{children}} for a bit. I never questioned him." [...] Her arrival initially generated some negative press, however, {{as a result of the}} media's misrepresentation of her relationship with Panait. Comăneci later stated in her memoir that her response of [...] "so what?" [...] to a reporter's comment that Panait was married was due to her poor command of the English language at the time:Constantin had offered to help me defect, and I'd accepted. I assumed that his wife knew that he was going to help a handful of Romanians get out of the country and that I was one of them. But what people took from my answer was that I was a home-wrecker. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In hindsight, I understand that I'd made a very poor choice of words. Constantin had plans to become my personal manager upon our arrival in the United States. I didn't know that, but he promised <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> settled, and I guess I just accepted his involvement in my future career as fair payment for the risks he'd taken. People died every day trying to defect.|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell is a {{recovering}} addict and alcoholic {{and has been}} sober since 2003. He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, [...] "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [...] was {{at the door with}} my brother, so my choices were open the door and go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush {{at the bottom of a}} cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." [...] Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, [...] "We really miss Layne [...] and Mike , and we carry them with us in our hearts".|$|E

6000|$|... "Sure," [...] said Shillito, coolly. [...] "You're rich; anyhow, Mrs. Cartwright is rich, and I {{reckoned}} {{you would}} see my staying about the town has drawbacks.

60|$|Presently {{this thought}} {{occurred}} to me: how heedless I have been! When the boy gets calm, he will wonder why a great magician like me should have begged a boy like him <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> out of this place; he will put this and that together, and will see that I am a humbug.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> in <b>getting</b> up a {{dramatic}} entertainment of some sort," [...] said the Baroness to Clovis. [...] "You see, there's been an election petition down here, {{and a member}} unseated and no end of bitterness and ill-feeling, and the County is socially divided against itself. I thought a play of some kind would be an excellent opportunity for bringing people together again, and giving them something to think of besides tiresome political squabbles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{what are}} you pouring into me?" [...] gasped Mr. Beckwith, in astonishment. [...] "Do you think I am running a pink tea, or a ladies' sewing circle? I don't need anybody <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up a programme; my partner, Mr. Carr, attends to that end of it.

6000|$|There was {{an awkward}} pause. The lady {{passengers}} moved closer to each other; the Washoe husband looked abstractedly at the fire; and the tall man apparently turned his eyes inward for self-support at this emergency. But Miggles's laugh, which was very infectious, broke the silence. [...] "Come," [...] she said briskly, [...] "you must be hungry.

He {{believed}} we could trust Burke to join us, and, with my four black men,--who have really become good sailors,--we would have a crew of seven men altogether, with which we could work a fair-sized brig to Havre or some other French port. Before he went away our business was settled. He agreed to go with me as first mate, to do his best <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> that gold to France, to consider the whole treasure as mine, because I had discovered it,--I explained the reason to him, as I did to you,--and to accept as regular pay one hundred dollars a day, from then until we should land the cargo in a European port, and then to leave it to me how much more I would give him.

I used to envy Fanny; but I don't now, for her father and mother don't take care of her as mine do of me. She is afraid of her father, and makes her mother do as she likes. I 'm glad I came though, for I see money don't give people everything; but I 'd like a little all the same, for it is so {{comfortable}} to buy nice things. I read over my journal just now, and I 'm afraid it 's not a good one; for I have said all sorts of things about the people here, and it is n't kind. I should tear it out, only I promised to keep my diary, and I want to talk over things that puzzle me with mother. I see now that it is my fault a good deal; for I have n't been half as patient, and pleasant as I ought to be. I will truly try {{for the rest of the}} time, and be as good and grateful as I can; for I want them to like me, though I 'm only 'an old-fashioned country girl.'" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> people to {{understand}} that realism is a method, and only methodic in its consequences; when the realist is an artist, that is, and supposing the idealist with whom you compare him to be anything but a FARCEUR and a DILETTANTE. The two schools of working do, and should, lead to the choice of different subjects. But that is a consequence, not a cause.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about the main characters, Mark and Jane Studdock, who have some {{problems}} in their marriage. Mark and Jane are unhappy with their marriage.

In thesis, I will analyze the causes of the marriage problems from Jane and Mark. I conclude that they are unhappy mostly {{because of the lack of}} communication...|$|R

30|$|I {{will say}} that I {{had a lot of}} anxiety about going into the testing center in second semester, the first time, because I had overheard several of our {{students}} in our class say exactly what you just stated, that it does not prepare you for the real world and there were several comments made in second semester about those ‘special’ people who went to the testing center. And it was hurtful in the moment, but I came to the realization that I’m here for me, that I am here for my success, Jacob’s {{not going to do it}} for me (pointing to Jacob), Emerson’s not going to do it for me (pointing to Emerson).
