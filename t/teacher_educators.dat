2500|$|For Dewey and his {{philosophical}} followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners {{are taught}} {{that knowledge is}} transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner. [...] Dewey not only re-imagined {{the way that the}} learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. [...] For Dewey, “The thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education” (Dewey, 1904, p.18). [...] Dewey’s qualifications for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. [...] Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which “work automatically, unconsciously” (Dewey, 1904, p.15). [...] Turning to Dewey's essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> can begin to reimagine the successful classroom teacher Dewey envisioned.|$|E
5000|$|The way {{in which}} <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> teach has {{a greater impact on}} student teachers’ {{thinking}} about practice than what <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> teach.

Swennen et al (2008). concluded that, in order to ‘model’ what they teach, <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> need to develop the ability to link their own (tacit) theories and practice of teaching to public theory, i.e., in Korthagen’s [...] words, to translate Theory with a capital ‘T’ to theory with a small ‘t’.|$|E

40|$|This action {{research}} project aims to facilitate {{social studies teachers}} in government school to develop their pedagogical skill, especially the use of issue-based inquiry as an instructional strategy {{in teaching and learning}} of Social Studies. This study was conducted in Class 7 th of one of the government school of Karachi, Pakistan. In doing so, the {{action research}} also aimed to improve the knowledge and skills as a <b>teacher</b> <b>educator</b> facilitating <b>teachers</b> of Social Studies. This action research involved the process of formulating a general idea, conducting reconnaissance, making a general plan of action, implementing, and evaluating it, using the cyclical process of action research. The data were collected through use of: semi-structured interviews, classroom observation, document analysis, field-notes, and feedback of my research participants. The data were qualitatively analyzed on an ongoing basis to inform each subsequent step of action and reflection. The findings of the study suggest that teachers can learn the instructional strategy of issued based inquiry, by going through different phases, such as: reading the relevant literature and engaging in discussion about enquiry with <b>teacher</b> and <b>teacher</b> <b>educator,</b> self-experiencing the process through conducting small-scale inquiry, demonstration of lesson by a mentor, putting their learning 2 ̆ 7 s into practice, receiving peer-feedback and constant follow-up by the <b>teacher</b> <b>educator.</b> The study also shows that a <b>teacher</b> <b>educator</b> can be an effective facilitator (in this regard) by: becoming self-reflective, balancing his/her role as a <b>teacher</b> <b>educator</b> and action researcher within the time frame of the study and seeking feedback from research participants. In the process, a <b>teacher</b> <b>educator</b> can face challenges such as: his own time-constraint for keeping balance in his role of action and research, as a <b>teacher</b> <b>educator</b> and action researcher...|$|R

5000|$|Many writers {{advocate}} for <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> themselves {{to act as}} models of reflective practice. This implies that the way that <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> teach their students needs to be congruent with the approaches they expect their students to adopt with pupils; <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> should not only model the way to teach, but should also explain why they have chosen a particular approach whilst doing so, by reference to theory; this implies that <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> {{need to be aware}} of their own tacit theories of teaching and able to connect them overtly to public theory. However, some <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> do not always [...] "teach as they preach"; they base their teaching decisions on [...] "common sense" [...] more than on public theory and struggle with modelling reflective practice.|$|E
50|$|The {{implication}} {{of all this}} is that <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> must also be highly skilled in reflective practice. Andrea Gelfuso and Danielle Dennis, in a report on a formative experiment with student teachers, suggest that teaching how to reflect requires <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> to possess and deploy specific competences. However, Janet Dyment and Timothy O'Connell, in a small-scale study of experienced <b>teacher</b> <b>educators,</b> noted that the <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> they studied had received no training in using reflection themselves, and that they in turn did not give such training to their students; all parties were expected to know how to reflect.|$|E
