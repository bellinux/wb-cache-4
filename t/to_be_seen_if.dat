5|$|While it yet remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> {{there are}} principally more stable isotopes, {{there has not}} any theoretical, let alone practical, {{suggestion}} {{this could be the}} case. In a 2012 calculation by the JINR, it was suggested that the half-lives of all dubnium isotopes, synthesized or not, would not significantly exceed a day.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if,</b> with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E

5000|$|Additionally, {{there are}} also {{informal}} criteria one can use {{in order to determine}} syntactic categories. For example, one informal means of determining if an item is lexical, as opposed <b>to</b> functional, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> it <b>is</b> left behind in [...] "telegraphic speech" [...] (that is, the way a telegram would be written; e.g., Pants fire. Bring water, need help.) ...|$|R
25|$|However, {{there were}} supporters. Medwin's book was well {{received}} by several eminent writers, including Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges, who included in his edition of Edward Phillips' Theatrum Petarum Anglicanorum {{a memoir of}} Shelley, written by Medwin. Leigh Hunt, as might be expected, took a more tolerant view of Medwin in Lord Byron and his Contemporaries (1828), and {{since the publication of}} Byron's letters in Thomas Moore's biography(1830/31) and Lady Blessington's Conversations(1832â€“33), Medwin's recollections of Byron have come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>if</b> not always faithful in detail, as an essentially accurate portrayal.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there is}} still no {{certainty}} as to how judges will apply their powers of judicial review when an error of material fact has been committed. Fong Thin Choo was decided in 1991, prior to the UK case E v. Home Secretary. Hence, it still remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> the courts in Singapore will adopt the four requirements that were laid down in E v. Home Secretary. One view is that there is little reason for the courts to reject these requirements, given that Fong Thin Choo cited Tameside with approval, and E v. Home Secretary was based upon this case.|$|E
25|$|Feedback from consumers. In 2010 WASREB {{and local}} {{utilities}} helped to establish Water and Sanitation Action Groups (WAGs) consisting of citizen volunteers in Kisumu, Kakagemam, Nairobi and Mombasa {{to provide a}} forum for dialogue and for feedback from consumers. Consumer complained about inaccurate billing and metering, pipe bursts, illegal connections, poor workmanship on installations, vandalism, overcharging and corruption. Utility staff were initially suspicious and even hostile. The feedback {{was done in the}} form of focus group discussions, public hearings and scheduled meetings between citizen representatives and utility managers. While 63% of the complaints were resolved after 8 months, it remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> the system will become permanent or will be extended to other cities.|$|E

25|$|While {{this reform}} was {{eventually}} accomplished, other challenges must be surmounted. Mexico's shale {{oil and gas}} development close to the US border is hampered by the activities of organized criminal groups that include the theft of pipeline products and the extortion to companies in the extractive industries, along with lack of adequate infrastructure; overall, this {{has resulted in the}} low economic competitiveness of Mexico's shales in comparison with those across the border in the United States soil. It remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> the awaited Mexican energy reform will overcome these drawbacks. Owing to Mexico's weak rule of law and poor success in previous major industry reforms, the legal changes brought about might as well end up worsening the drawbacks in the energy sector and namely {{in the development of the}} country's shale resources.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} unanswered {{question is}} whether such rare variants exist because of chance mutations, population founder events and maintenance by processes such as drift, or whether there is any selective advantage involved in their maintenance and spread. An {{example of such a}} rare variant effect was recently discovered among Samoan islanders. Among the islanders the variant is extremely common, but in other populations it is extremely rare or absent. The variant predisposes to obesity but strangely is protective against type 2 diabetes. Based on cell studies it was suggested the variant may protect individuals against periods of 'famine' and there is also evidence that it has been under positive selection. The most likely scenario then is that this rare variant was established in the islanders by a founder effect among a small initial colonising population, and was able to spread because of a selective advantage it conferred within that small group. Hence, in small populations under particular environmental conditions it may be feasible that the 'thrifty gene' idea is correct. It remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> rare variants that fill the gap in the missing heritability estimates are also 'thrifty genes' or if they are rare chance events sustained by drift, as implicated for the common variants currently linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{called it}} [...] "A first-rate action thriller, a vivid {{evocation}} of urban warfare in Iraq, a penetrating study of heroism and {{a showcase for}} austere technique, terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances." [...] The Toronto Star critic Peter Howell said, [...] "Just when you think the battle of Iraq war dramas has been fought and lost, along comes one that demands <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen...</b> <b>If</b> you can sit through The Hurt Locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest, you must be made of granite." [...] Entertainment Weeklys film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare [...] "A" [...] rating, calling it, [...] "an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within {{as well as what}} it looks like on the ground. This ain't no war videogame." ...|$|E

500|$|The highest rating {{given by}} Kapur to an {{individual}} match went to the TNA X Division Championship bout, with an 8.5 out of 10. The opening Six Man Tag Team match, the No Disqualification match, Bobby Roode versus Ron Killings, the NWA World Tag Team Championship match, and the main event all received a 7 out of 10 by Kapur in his review. Regarding the main event, Kapur said that [...] "Sting looked good, but it remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> his return will be {{a turning point for}} the company in the long run." [...] Kapur commented on the X Division Championship match stating it was a [...] "good match" [...] that [...] "reinforced Joe's dominance, and left the door open for another match with either Daniels or Styles." [...] He thought the World Tag Team Championship bout had a [...] "stupid ending" [...] that [...] "marred what was otherwise a good tag match." ...|$|E
500|$|Persons {{unable to}} show {{that one of the}} {{forbidden}} classifications applies to them may try to argue that they are members of a group defined by a law in a way that violates the general guarantee of equality and equal protection. To succeed, they must establish that the classification used in the law fails the rational nexus test, which is a three-stage test formulated by the courts. The first stage of the test involves an examination as to whether the law differentiates amongst classes of individuals. At the second stage, the court considers if the differentiation is founded on an intelligible [...] or distinguishing feature. Finally, the basis of the differentiation must bear a reasonable relation to the object of the statute. However, the test is not foolproof as a classification may satisfy the test even if the object of the law is itself illegitimate. The rational nexus test, as it is currently applied in Singapore, also tolerates over- and under-inclusive classifications. It remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> local courts will consider other approaches to the issue, such as the three-tier system of scrutiny applied in the United States, the proportionality analysis applied in the United Kingdom to other areas of human rights law, or the reasonableness approach taken by some judges in India and Malaysia.|$|E
500|$|... 808s & Heartbreak {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 36 reviews. Chris Richards from The Washington Post called it [...] "an information-age masterpiece", while USA Today critic Steve Jones said [...] "West deftly uses the 808 drum machine and Auto-Tune vocal effect to channel his feelings of hurt, anger and doubt through his well-crafted lyrics". Dan Cairns from The Times stated, [...] "This so should not work...Yet 808s & Heartbreak is a triumph, recklessly departing from the commercially copper-bottomed script and venturing far beyond Westâ€™s comfort zone." [...] Rolling Stones Jody Rosen commended West's {{incorporation of the}} Roland TR-808 drum machine and described the album as [...] "Kanye's would-be Here, My Dear or Blood on the Tracks, a mournful song-suite that swings violently between self-pity and self-loathing". In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot called it West's [...] "most radical yet" [...] and said while West's fans may be disappointed, [...] "this one is for him. It remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> {{he goes back to}} making records for everybody else. For now, this is one fascinatingly perverse detour." [...] PopMatters critic Dave Heaton was impressed by West's [...] "song and album construction, and with the way he captures a particular feeling through unusual, evocative, carefully crafted music thatâ€™s both simple and complex, cold and warm, mechanical and human, melodic and harsh". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found it [...] "brilliant" [...] with a unique [...] "dark sound" [...] and [...] "engaging tunes", despite a second-half drop-off, and praised West's use of Auto-Tune, which he felt [...] "both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame that might otherwise be pure pity parties".|$|E

50|$|Rinconsaurus is a titanosaurid sauropod. Within the titanosaurs, Coria and Riga {{regard this}} dinosaur as {{closely related to}} Aeolosaurus based on several derived traits.
