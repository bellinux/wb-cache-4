An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared hot mirror filter that blocks most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400 nm to 700 nm.

A UV <b>transmitting</b> <b>filter</b> {{is placed on the}} lens, which allows ultraviolet light to pass and which absorbs or blocks all visible and infrared light. UV filters are made from special colored glass and may be coated or sandwiched with other filter glass to aid in blocking unwanted wavelengths. Examples of UV transmission filters are the Baader-U filter or the StraightEdgeU ultraviolet bandpass filter, both of which exclude most visible and infrared light. Older filters include the Kodak Wratten 18A, B+W 403, Hoya U-340 and Kenko U-360 most of which need to be used in conjunction with an additional infrared blocking filter. Typically such IR blocking, UV transmissive filters are made from Schott BG-38, BG-39 and BG-40 glass. Filters for use with digital camera sensors must not have any [...] "infrared leak" [...] (transmission in the infrared spectrum); the sensor will pick up reflected infrared radiation as well as ultraviolet, which may obscure the details that would be resolved by ultraviolet alone.|$|E

After the invention of laser, OWC was envisioned to be the main deployment area for lasers and many trials were conducted using different types of lasers and modulation schemes.

40|$|Standard video {{compression}} techniques apply motion-compensated prediction combined with transform coding of the prediction error. In {{the context of}} prediction with fractional-pel motion vector resolution it was shown, that aliasing components contained in an image signal are limiting the prediction accuracy obtained by motion compensation. In order to consider aliasing, quantisation and motion estimation errors, camera noise, etc., we analytically developed a two-dimensional (2 D) non-separable interpolation filter, which is calculated for each frame independently by minimising the prediction error energy. For every fractional-pel position to be interpolated, an individual set of 2 D filter coefficients is determined. Since <b>transmitting</b> <b>filter</b> coefficients as side information results in an additional bit rate, which is almost independent for different total bit rates and image resolutions, the overall gain decreases when total bit rates decrease. In this paper we present an algorithm, which regards the non-separable two-dimensional filter as a polyphase filter. For each frame, predicting the interpolation filter impulse response through evaluation of the polyphase filter, we only have to encode the filter coefficients prediction error. This enables bit rate savings, needed for <b>transmitting</b> <b>filter</b> coefficients of up to 75 % compared to PCM coding.

Here we introduce a phase compensation technique to design Nyquist filters. Phase compensation {{can be applied}} to the square-root of any zero-phase bandlimited Nyquist filter with normalized excess bandwidth less than or equal to one. The resulting phase compensated square-root filter is also a Nyquist filter. In the case of a raised-cosine spectrum, the phase compensator has a simple piecewise-linear form. Such a technique is particularly useful to accommodate two different structures for the receiver, one with a filter matched to the <b>transmitting</b> <b>filter</b> and one without a matched filter. We also use the phase compensation technique to characterize a more general family of Nyquist filters which subsumes raised-cosine spectra. These generalized raised-cosine filters offer more flexibility in filter design. For instance, the rate of asymptotic decay of the filter impulse response may be increased, or the residual ISI, introduced by truncation of the impulse response, may be minimized.

40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{high-temperature}} superconducting (HTS) <b>transmitting</b> <b>filter</b> based on a reaction-type resonator is presented. The purpose of an HTS reaction-type filter (HTS-RTF) is to eliminate the intermodulation distortion noise generated by microwave power amplifiers such as those employed in mobile base stations. An HTS-RTF enables both higher power handling capability and sharper cutoff characteristics compared to existing planar-type HTS transmitting filters, since a reaction-type resonator does not resonate with high-power fundamental signals. To achieve steep skirt characteristics and high-power handling capability simultaneously, a 5 -GHz three-pole HTS-RTF using split open-ring resonator is designed. This split open-ring resonator offers low maximum current densities and a high-unloaded Q-factor with low radiation. The designed prototype filter has Chebyshev characteristics with a centre frequency of 4. 95 GHz and a bandwidth of 1. 5 MHz. The HTS-RTF is fabricated using a double-sided YBa_ 2 C_ 3 O_[7 -δ] thin film deposited on a 0. 5 mm thick MgO substrate. The measured filter shows an insertion loss of less than 0. 1 dB and a third intermodulation distortion value of - 56. 7 dBc for a 40 dBm passband signal.

The relative roles of pharmacology and optics in this deterioration, however, remain unascertained. The study determined the combined impact of PHCl concentration (pharmacology) and pupil size (optics) on the static and dynamic characteristics of accommodation.

Results : Relative to no PHCl, the horizontal pupil diameter of left eye was significantly larger (P 0. 4 for all). The response magnitude and peak velocity also decreased significantly with pupil diameter, at similar rates for the no PHCl and the three PHCl conditions (P < 0. 001 for all). Conclusion: The reduction in accommodative performance with all drug concentrations and with pupil diameter suggests independent roles of pharmacology and optics in determining accommodative performance with PHCl. The reduction in accommodative performance is, however, modest and may be clinically irrelevant in Indian eyes...|$|E
