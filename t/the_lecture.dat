5|$|Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{attends a}} lecture at MIT, where the {{testimony}} of Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), an alien abductee, is being presented. Mulder argues against other members of <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> over the existence of alien life, claiming {{that it is a}} lie created to cover up a program of medical experimentation on civilians run by the military industrial complex. When <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> ends, Mulder is met by Dr. Heitz Werber, who is surprised to see that Mulder has lost his belief in alien life since the last time they met. Werber tells Mulder that he is Cassandra's doctor, and asks him to visit her.|$|E
5|$|One notable academic, who {{is known}} for his work in Nanotechnology, is Ravi Silva. Ravi Silva is the current Director of the Advanced Technology Institute at the university. In 2003, he was awarded the Albert Einstein Silver Medal and the Javed Husain Prize by UNESCO for {{contributions}} to electronic devices. The 2011 Clifford Paterson Lecture was given by Silva for his outstanding contributions to basic science and engineering in the field of carbon nanoscience and nanotechnology. <b>The</b> <b>lecture</b> is given annually on any aspect of engineering. The General Electric Company Limited endowed <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> in 1975 in honour of Clifford Paterson who undertook the creation of the GEC Research Laboratories in 1919.

5|$|Outside <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> {{room before}} the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E

5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important cutting-edge problems in mathematics.

5|$|Although Riley was wealthy {{from his}} books, {{he was able}} to triple his annual income by touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in {{managing}} his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours. Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books, and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was careful not to book busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short, lasting only three months.|$|E
5|$|At Boyd's suggestion, the Beatles {{attended}} the Maharishi's lecture at the London Hilton on Park Lane on 24 August 1967.

5|$|At {{one point}} in the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme {{in a manner similar to}} Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and the challenges that this presented. <b>The</b> <b>lecture</b> also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E

(See Introduction, 1921 edition.) This is in contrast to the remaining pages of the original Doctrine and Covenants, which are officially recognized by nearly all Latter Day Saint denominations as divine revelation given specifically to the church.|$|R
5|$|Tucker's {{effectiveness}} in <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> hall is not objectively certain, {{and he may}} well have encountered difficulty with public speaking as {{he had in the}} courtroom previously. His continued faculty chairmanship certainly testified to his relative popularity among colleagues, and he published numerous worksâ€”including one satire, a fiction, three books on economics and statistics, a Jefferson biography, as well as two pamphlets. Together with Robley Dunglison he founded and edited the Virginia Literary Museum (1829â€“1830) in which he published voluminous writings; and he frequently sent essays to newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 40 {{years of}} service, Eichelberger retired with {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} general on 31 December 1948. In 1950, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where {{he lived with his}} wife Em {{for the rest of his}} life. He suffered from a number of health problems, including hypertension and diabetes, and had his gall bladder removed. His name appeared in a series of articles for the Saturday Evening Post on his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific, actually written by ghostwriter Milton MacKaye. They subsequently expanded the articles into a book, Our Jungle Road to Tokyo. The book sold reasonably well, and Harry Truman and Omar Bradley requested autographed copies. In 1951 he traveled to Hollywood, where he served as technical consultant on Francis Goes to West Point (1952) and The Day the Band Played (1952), but he was not altogether happy with the results. He turned his hand to writing articles about the Far East for Newsweek, but gave this away in 1954. He then worked on <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> circuit, giving speeches about his experiences, but gave this up too in 1955. He campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as his work on the Scott Building, Alexander was asked to take up the {{challenge}} of completing the Smithsonian Institution Building, the progress of which had bogged down under architect James Renwick, Jr. In August 1853, Alexander accepted, and by 1855, the Smithsonian Building was complete. During construction, Alexander slightly altered Renwick's original design by placing the Smithsonian's main lecture hall on the second floor. The change allowed for superior acoustics and a wider space than could be found on the first floor. To support the large lecture hall and the central core of the building, Alexander arranged for the installation of fireproof masonry-encased iron structural columns. These would prove their value on January 24, 1865, when a fire broke out on the roof above <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> hall. The resulting blaze destroyed the hall and damaged {{much of the rest of}} the structure. Thanks to the fireproof columns, however, the Smithsonian building did not collapse.|$|E
5|$|Columbia University's Jesup Lectures {{were the}} {{starting}} point for many of the most important works of the modern evolutionary synthesis. The presenters introduced the connection between two important discoveriesthe units of evolution (genes) with selection as the primary mechanism of evolution. In 1941, Edgar Anderson (whose work on hybridization in the genus Iris had interested Stebbins since they met in 1930) and Ernst Mayr co-presented <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> series and Mayr later published his lectures as Systematics and the Origin of Species. In 1946, Stebbins was invited on Dobzhansky's recommendation to present the prestigious lectures. Stebbins' lectures drew together the otherwise disparate fields of genetics, ecology, systematics, cytology, and paleontology. In 1950, these lectures were published as Variation and Evolution in Plants, which proved {{to be one of the}} most important books in 20th-century botany. The book brought botanical science into the new synthesis of evolutionary theory, and became part of the canon of biological works written between 1936 and 1950 that formed the modern synthesis of evolution.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of <b>the</b> <b>lecture,</b> he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earthâ€”creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation wasâ€”this was science.|$|E

5|$|Marge and Homer argue {{later that}} night. Homer tells Marge {{that even though}} getting the {{trampoline}} was a mistake at least {{he is willing to}} try new things, while she is boring and nags too much. Marge disagrees, but discovers that Bart and Lisa agree with Homer's assessment. She becomes annoyed and stays the night at Patty and Selma's house. While there, she is introduced to an infomercial featuring self-help guru Brad Goodman, who supposedly can help her with her chronic nagging. After Marge and Homer watch a Brad Goodman video, Marge is more tolerant {{and the two of them}} get along better. Observing how out of control Bart is, they take the family to see Brad Goodman's live lecture in the hopes that it will change him. Bart interrupts <b>the</b> <b>lecture,</b> and Brad Goodman encourages the town to follow Bart's spontaneous attitude. Soon, the whole town begins to act like Bart, which means Bart's rebellious ways are no longer unique, putting him in a slump.|$|E
5|$|Race Against Time: Searching for Hope in AIDS-Ravaged Africa is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Stephen Lewis for the Massey Lectures. Lewis wrote it in early to mid-2005 and House of Anansi Press {{released}} it as <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> series began in October 2005. Each of the book's chapters was delivered as one lecture {{in a different}} Canadian city, beginning in Vancouver on October 18 and ending in Toronto on October 28. The speeches were aired on CBC Radio One between November 7 and 11. The author and orator, Stephen Lewis, {{was at that time}} the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa and former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations. Although he wrote the book and lectures in his role as a concerned Canadian citizen, his criticism of the United Nations (UN), international organizations, and other diplomats, including naming specific people, was called undiplomatic and led several reviewers to speculate whether he would be removed from his UN position.|$|E
5|$|Though Henry Beecher's Lawrenceburg church {{declared}} {{its independence from}} the Synod to retain him as its pastor, the poverty that followed the Panic of 1837 caused him {{to look for a}} new position. Banker Samuel Merrill invited Beecher to visit Indianapolis in 1839, and he was offered the ministry of the Second Presbyterian Church there on May 13, 1839. Unusually for a speaker of his era, Beecher would use humor and informal language including dialect and slang as he preached. His preaching was a major success, building Second Presbyterian into the largest church in the city, and he also led a successful revival meeting in nearby Terre Haute. However, mounting debt led to Beecher again seeking a new position in 1847, and he accepted the invitation of businessman Henry Bowen to head a new Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn, New York. Beecher's national fame continued to grow, and he took to <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> circuit, becoming {{one of the most popular}} speakers in the country and charging correspondingly high fees.|$|E
