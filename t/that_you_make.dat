Watts-Russell later said [...] "that's probably all I ever heard Joey really say," [...] and by that time, Santiago's quietness had been noted by those close to the band. The Pixies' first release, Come On Pilgrim, featured his trademark angular lead guitar on tracks such as [...] "The Holiday Song" [...] and [...] "Vamos".|$|E
500|$|Colbert's {{earliest}} mainstream exposure came in {{the prime}} time sketch comedy program The Dana Carvey Show. While only lasting seven episodes in early 1996, it provided Colbert with roles that would help forge his future onscreen persona. This was largely due to its format of delivering sketch performances directly to the camera. Although they did not air, several sketches inspired by The Onion also had Colbert playing a deadpan anchor delivering the news. In an interview with The New York Times regarding The Dana Carvey Show, Colbert noted, [...] "If you {{have an opportunity to}} give it right to the audience, there’s a special connection <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> by looking at the camera." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Roshan {{appeared}} in Zoya Akhtar's ensemble comedy-drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara alongside Abhay Deol and Farhan Akhtar as three friends who {{embark on a}} bachelor trip where they overcome their insecurities. Zoya cast Roshan {{in the role of}} an uptight workaholic as she considers him her favourite actor. For the film's soundtrack, Roshan recorded the song [...] "Señorita" [...] with his co-stars and Maria del Mar Fernández. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was released to positive reviews and Roshan's performance was praised. Rajeev Masand wrote, [...] "Hrithik Roshan once again brings real depth to his character with a spectacular performance. He's shy and restrained, then lets go with such fantastic intensity <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> the inward journey with his character." [...] The film grossed [...] worldwide and became Roshan's first commercial success in three years. He was nominated for another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance. Later that year, he made a special appearance in Farhan's Don 2.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were strongly}} interested in [...] "world building," [...] and the alternate universe {{allowed them to}} create a very similar world with {{a large amount of}} detail to fill in the texture of the world. An alternate universe also allowed them to show [...] "how small choices <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line," [...] according to co-director Jeff Pinkner. However, the producers also realized the concept of the alternate universe could be confusing to viewers. To avoid this, elements of the world were introduced in small pieces {{over the course of the}} first two seasons before the larger revelation in the second-season finale and the third season. J. H. Wyman stated that he would often pass the story ideas for the alternate universe by his father to see if it made sense, and would rework the script if his father found it confusing. Such world building also gave them a risky opportunity to create stories that focused solely on characters from the alternate universe with nearly no ties to the main characters; as stated by Wyman, they would be able to [...] "make two shows about one show," [...] a concept that the network executives embraced.|$|E

500|$|When {{discussing}} the many {{differences between the}} prime and parallel universes in an interview, Pinkner explained that [...] "one of the big themes {{of the show is}} how small choices <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line". Pinkner {{and the rest of the}} Fringe production team loved the opportunity to build an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. Pinkner elaborated in another interview that when the [...] "perfectionist" [...] crew were writing and constructing the parallel universe, they spent a lot of time on a high [...] "level of attention and detail" [...] that had all of the different departments and actors weighing in. Pinkner thought that because the parallel universe is effectively breaking down with [...] "World War II"-like conditions, these [...] "sort of tough times forge more noble, stronger people". To better differentiate the two universes, the producers changed the color of the opening credit sequences by making the parallel universe red and the prime universe blue. As with the opening credits in [...] "Peter", the episodes featuring the parallel universe displayed certain fringe science words in that world, including wormholes, speciation, pandemics, and telepathy.|$|E
500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{brought back}} the [...] "Cortexiphan kids", {{introduced}} {{in the first two}} seasons, because they felt that part of the storyline was really interesting. They wanted {{the end of the season}} to be a [...] "beautiful culmination of everything" [...] while traveling to the Other Side. The show had been developing a parallel universe storyline since its conception, but [...] "Over There" [...] marked the longest time spent in that world thus far. Pinker explained the idea of two worlds: [...] "One of the big themes of the show is how small choices <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line." [...] Wyman said that the parallel universe [...] "is a reminder to our viewers that your life is what your choices are." [...] The two began discussing details about the Other Side early on, especially what the differences between the two universes would be. Pinkner commented in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "a lot of them are ideas that we jokingly threw out. Some of them, like the notion of zeppelins or the Statue of Liberty if we didn't let it oxidize or the Grand Central Hotel, we're not making up. Had the Hindenburg not blown up, zeppelins would be passenger air ships docking at the Empire State Building. That was the plan. We opened ourselves to the standard that it had to be possible." [...] Pinkner later elaborated, [...] "We're interested in world building and all that stuff is the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real." [...] They used comic books as one way to subtly differentiate the two worlds. Goldsman, Wyman, and actor Joshua Jackson are longstanding comic book fans and decided to make the character of Peter a fan as well. Goldsman called on his friend Geoff Johns, Chief Creative Officer at DC Comics. He arranged for DC to specially design ten alternate covers for some of their most iconic editions, which were displayed in Peter's apartment on the Other Side. Visual effects company Eden FX created Peter's apartment and the alternate New York skyline visible outside his window. When fans reacted positively to these detailed characteristics written into the parallel universe, the producers stated their intention to show a lot more similar details in the third season.|$|E

[...] Dreyer chose to copy the Giambologna [...] "Flying Mercury" [...] at the Bargello National Museum in Florence, Italy (1580), but instead of using the breath of a zephyr to suspend Mercury (per Giambologna), Dreyer used a wave {{as he did with}} Goddess of Dawn. [...] Inscribed in the circumference of the pedestal is a quote from Horace, Satires 2.6: [...] "NO MORE I ASK, O SON OF MAIA, BUT <b>THAT</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>MAKE</b> THESE GIFTS MY OWN FOR LIFE".

But the king replied that the servant would paint it with his materials, but the king would appear in his own glory. Thus, when in [...] God told Moses [...] "see <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> them after their pattern," [...] Moses complained that he was not God that {{he should be able to}} make one exactly like the pattern.

2500|$|In 1883, Luther Standing Bear {{was sent}} to Philadelphia to work as an intern for John Wanamaker. Wanamaker's was the first {{department}} store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{and one of the}} first department stores in the United States. Luther was told by Pratt: [...] "My boy you are going away from us to work for this school. Go and do your best. The majority of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing.

[...] While riding on street cars in Philadelphia, Luther did not care to listen to the vulgar language used by white boys on the way to work. At the end of his internship, the entire Carlisle school students and faculty traveled to a large meeting hall in Philadelphia where Pratt and Wanamaker spoke. Luther was asked to come to the stage, and Wanamaker told the students that Luther had been promoted from one department to another every month getting better work and better money and in spite of the fact that he employed over one thousand people, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as Luther.|$|E
