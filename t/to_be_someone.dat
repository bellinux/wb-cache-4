5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> else, and {{complained about the}} stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
25|$|Although {{generally}} {{characterized as}} having an extravagant lifestyle, Mallya was reported in 2005 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> who prays every day and conducts the entire 42-day Sabarimala fast every year while wearing only black clothing, {{and to be a}} devout follower of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and the Art of Living Foundation.|$|E
25|$|Roger Ramey {{sent the}} demo tape out to every major label in Nashville, and {{was met with}} a solid wall of {{rejection}} by them all. After a month of not getting anywhere, out of desperation to help his sister, {{he decided to take}} a chance with MCA Nashville. MCA, being the industry leader at the time was his first choice of labels. Taking a cassette of the five song demo of Loveless, Roger bluffed his way past the receptionist of Tony Brown, the head of A (Artist & Repertoire – in charge of finding and developing new talent) by pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> else who was late for an appointment.|$|E

5000|$|An {{unrelated}} character called [...] "The Wizard" [...] was {{the main}} villain in the 1949 Batman and Robin movie serial played by actor Leonard Penn.

25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E
25|$|Bercow's {{election}} as Speaker was controversial {{because he is}} believed to have had the support of very few MPs from his former party. Conservative MPs generally viewed Bercow with distrust because of his changing political views (having moved over the years from being very right-wing to become more socially liberal, leading to clashes with past party leaders), his acceptance of an advisory role from the Labour government (a party he had often been rumoured {{to be on the verge}} of joining), his general lack of good relations with fellow MPs from the Conservatives, and his vigorous campaigning for the Speaker's job. It has been speculated that he received the votes of as few as three of his fellow Conservative MPs. However, he received the votes of a large number of Labour MPs, many of whom were angered at the way they perceived Michael Martin to have been hounded out of the job and wanted his replacement <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> who was not a favourite of the Conservative Party.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, {{the first}} SuperPrix was held. The circuit was drenched by torrential downpours from {{the tail end}} of Hurricane Charley. Being laid out on public roads the circuit was bumpy, and the cars were thrown around badly. Pierluigi Martini and Luis Pérez-Sala {{qualified}} on the front row, followed by Andrew Gilbert Scott. The championship leader Ivan Capelli span early on, in his March 86B Cosworth powered car. Because of long delays, the first race was run at a shorter distance. At every corner there seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> crashing. The race was red flagged when Andrew Gilbert Scott was experiencing handling problems after an earlier spin. When he exited the Bristol Street Motors Bend on the 21st lap, he lost it and crashed into Alain Ferté's stationary car, blocking part of the track, with Sala still fighting for the win from a fast catching up Martini. Luis Pérez-Sala was given the win, and Pierluigi Martini given second, with Michel Ferté taking third. The top six drivers were awarded half points as the race was red-flagged on the 24th lap, just before the halfway point of the 51 lap race.|$|E

500|$|Eddie Van Halen {{has since}} {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} use of [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] as the band's debut single. He said, [...] "It kind of bummed me out that Ted [...] wanted our first single <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> else's tune.

500|$|Barker {{received}} an OBE in 1978. He {{was an avid}} collector of antiques, books and posters and amassed a collection of over 53,000 postcards. He produced several compilation books of them, including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, and Sauce. Barker rarely appeared in public, and when he did, it was almost always in character. He once said, [...] "I've always known I haven't a personality of my own, I have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> else to be happy. That's why I became an actor, I suppose." ...|$|E
60|$|It may be so.

500|$|These {{concepts}} {{shaped the}} Mercury Control Center, which was located at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Another important concept pioneered by Kraft {{was the idea}} of the flight director, the man who would coordinate the team of engineers and make real-time decisions about the conduct of the mission. As Mathews later recalled, Kraft came to him one day saying, [...] "There needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> in charge of the flights while they're actually going on, and I want to be that person." [...] In this informal way, the position of flight director was born.|$|E
500|$|For many of Azaria's {{character}}s, much {{of their}} humor is derived from a [...] "funny voice", such as The Birdcage and Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian. He stated that [...] "being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in," [...] although he finds it [...] "much easier <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> much closer to myself", as it requires [...] "less energy... than playing characters that are so out there and high strung".|$|E

She has two siblings, Mónica, an actress, and Eduardo. She also has a paternal half-sister, Salma. She was raised as a Roman Catholic. Cruz grew up in Alcobendas, and spent long hours at her grandmother's apartment. She says she had a happy childhood. Cruz remembers [...] "playing with some friends and being aware that I was acting as I was playing with them. I would think of a character and pretend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> else." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of Parineeta and Lage Raho Munna Bhai, Vidya's film roles were subject to wide {{critical}} analysis. Vir Sanghvi noted that the films Heyy Babyy and Kismat Konnection were [...] "strange films [...] in which she tried {{to pretend to be}} what she is not— a Bollywood bimbette." [...] Vidya described that particular phase in her career as a [...] "struggle <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> else". Due to the criticism that her film choices evoked, Vidya decided to choose roles that she [...] "believed in" [...] rather than choose by convention. Members of the media have subsequently labelled her as [...] "bold" [...] and [...] "daring" [...] in her choices.|$|E
500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E
500|$|The men of {{the village}} join in a rousing {{drinking}} song ("To beer!"), while Jeník and Kecal argue the merits, respectively, of love and money over beer. The women enter, and the whole group joins in dancing a furiant. Away from the jollity the nervous Vašek muses over his forthcoming marriage in a stuttering song ("My-my-my mother said to me"). Mařenka appears, and guesses immediately who he is, but does not reveal her own identity. Pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> else, she paints a picture of [...] "Mařenka" [...] as a treacherous deceiver. Vašek is easily fooled, and when Mařenka, in her false guise, pretends to woo him ("I know of a maiden fair"), he falls for her charms and swears to give Mařenka up.|$|E
2500|$|The Second Gravedigger exits as Hamlet and Horatio enter, and the First Gravedigger {{begins to}} sing a song on the topics of love and graves as he digs. [...] He throws a skull (and later a second) {{up and out of the}} grave. [...] Hamlet then talks to Horatio about how {{inappropriate}} it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> treat what used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone's,</b> and possibly an important someone's, body in such a way. [...] He decides to ask the Gravedigger whose grave he is digging, but the Gravedigger will not reveal the answer without another witty exchange.|$|R

Her maternal aunt, Debashree Roy, is a Bengali film actress and her paternal cousin, Kajol, is a Hindi film actress and her contemporary. Another paternal cousin, Ayan Mukerji, is a scriptwriter and film director.

She said, [...] "There were already too many actresses at home and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> different".|$|E
500|$|As a youth, Strang kept {{a rather}} {{profound}} personal diary, written partly {{in a secret}} code that was not deciphered until over one hundred {{years after it was}} authored (by Strang's own grandson Mark Strang, a banker in Long Beach, California). [...] This journal contains Strang's musings on a variety of topics, including his desire to [...] "rival Caesar or Napoleon" [...] and his regret that by age nineteen, he had not yet become a general or member of the state legislature, which he saw as being essential by that point in his life to his quest <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> of importance. [...] However, Strang's diary equally reveals a heartfelt desire to be of service to his fellow man, together with agonized frustration at not knowing how he might do so as a penniless, unknown youth from upstate New York.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2010, {{there was}} a sudden surge in suicide rates amongst gay {{teenagers}} in the United States. In September 2010, at least six adolescents took their lives due to factors related to gay bullying. After reading about the surge of gay teen suicides, Kesha was inspired to write [...] "We R Who We R", along with Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Ammo, and Jacob Kasher Hindlin. Production of the song was completed by Luke alongside Blanco and Ammo. After being nominated for the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Kesha elaborated on the song's initial inspiration. She stated that she was concerned with today's society, criticizing the fact that people have to hide themselves and pretend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> other than who they are. Regarding her music she said that it was not for everyone, claiming that she is a misfit in society and not everyone understands her or what she stands for.|$|E
