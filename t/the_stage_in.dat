Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E

5|$|After {{reading the}} novella, Mansfield was {{intrigued}} by {{the opportunity to play}} a dual role. He secured the right to adapt the story for <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the United States and the United Kingdom, and asked Sullivan to write the adaptation. The play debuted in Boston in May 1887, and a revised version opened on Broadway in September of that year. Critics acclaimed Mansfield's performance as the dual character. The play was popular in New York and on tour, and Mansfield was invited to bring it to London. It opened there in August 1888, just before the first Jack the Ripper murders. Some press reports compared the murderer to the Jekyll-Hyde character, and Mansfield was suggested as a possible suspect. Despite significant press coverage, the London production was a financial failure. Mansfield's company continued to perform the play on tours of the U.S. until shortly before his death in 1907.|$|E
5|$|At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget {{almost two}} hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, {{and fell asleep}} when {{he stopped at the}} side of the road to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin {{extended}} his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau's rear wheel. Augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the Nantes velodrome.|$|E
5|$|Day-Lewis {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> 1989 {{to work with}} Richard Eyre, in Hamlet at the National Theatre, London, but collapsed during the scene where the ghost of Hamlet's father appears before him.

Ian Charleson then formally replaced Day-Lewis {{for the rest of the}} run, except that Charleson's ill-health forced Northam to stand in again many times. Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion, Day-Lewis later claimed to have seen the ghost of his own father. He has not appeared on stage since. The media attention following his breakdown on-stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid-1990s to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame.|$|E
