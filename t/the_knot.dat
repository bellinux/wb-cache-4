The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from in order to keep <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> to be tightened (not to be confused with <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E

Other features of the grounds include a yew tunnel and an orchard growing fruits that would have been familiar to the house's Tudor occupants– apples, pears, quinces and medlars.|$|E

Michael Nyman's 1991 opera Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs was first performed as an opera-ballet by Karine Saporta. This opera is unique in that the three vocalists, a soprano, contralto, and tenor, are voices rather than individual characters, with the tenor just as likely as the soprano to sing Miranda, or all three sing as one character.|$|E

40|$|We have {{obtained}} ultraviolet and visible wavelength images {{for the central}} regions of the interacting galaxies NGC 3395 and NGC 3396, using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. The images show many isolated sources of ultraviolet emission produced by young star-forming regions (<b>knots).</b> <b>The</b> FWHM of most of <b>the</b> <b>knots</b> in both galaxies is 20 pc. Far-UV flux distributions for the complete sample of knots can be fitted with a power law with exponent = 1. 20 0. 35 for NGC 3395 and a power law with exponent = 0. 69 0. 21 for NGC 3396.

Reddening of <b>the</b> <b>knots</b> ranges from E(BV) = 0. 0 to E(BV) = 0. 3 mag, indicating variable amounts of dust in these regions.

While concurrent with NY98 on Oak Street Extension, NY33 passes over Tonawanda Creek, which travels through Batavia on a roughly northwest–southeast alignment. The brief overlap with NY98 ends at Main Street, which carries NY5 and NY63 through the western portion of the city. NY33 turns east here, overlapping with NY5 and NY63 for five blocks along the four-lane, mostly commercial Main Street. NY63 leaves in downtown Batavia at Ellicott Street; however, NY5 and NY33 continue to follow Main Street {{through much of the}} city's eastern half.|$|E

After the ceremony Max and O.B. leave everyone to enjoy the party while they slip away with Tom. When they are alone Max gives O.B. an engraved watch to say thanks for being his best man and his best mate, but when Niall drives away at speed he doesn't see Tom {{in the way of}} the car and Max jumps out in front of him to grab Tom, Niall did not put the brakes and carried on and crashed in to a wall after running over Max. O.B. rushed to Max's side and held him, soon after he died in O.B.'s arms and Steph arrived too late to say goodbye. Steph was overwhelmed with grief, and refused to leave her flat she shared with Max or wouldn't take off her wedding dress, until a visit from the priest helps her to face up to her responsibilities for Tom. Later at Max's will reading, Steph and Tom were left Max's entire estate.|$|E
5|$|Boy Scouting uses {{a series}} of medals and patches as emblems. The badge for the Scout rank {{consists}} of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a compass needle. The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. <b>The</b> <b>knot</b> reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines {{the elements of the}} Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For years, the First Class badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank. Life has a First Class emblem on a red heart, and initially symbolized the first-aid and health-related merit badges that the rank required. Now it signifies that the ideals of Scouting have {{become a part of the}} Scout's life and character.|$|E
