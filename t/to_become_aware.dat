This inner fire resides in the middle part {{of the body}}, and he calls it the Nabhi (center) and a Chakra.

25|$|This {{brings us}} back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't able to see family resemblances. We've made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E

25|$|During reincarnation {{consciousness}} {{tries to}} liberate {{itself from the}} burden of collected impressions. Yet, since it tries to achieve this by associating itself with impressions opposite from the previously accumulated ones, it gets further entangled in accumulating fresh impressions. Thus the soul experiences itself in a seemingly endless succession of human lives, as {{a man or a}} woman, as rich or poor, strong or weak, beautiful or ugly, black or white, in various places, religions, castes etc. It is only after numerous apparent births and deaths, that the range of human experience starts to get exhausted. In this way the soul starts dissociating itself from the gross world, enabling its consciousness <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> of the subtle sphere.|$|E

Wendell Johnson, a member of the same graduate program in Iowa who also became renowned for his work in the field of stuttering, said that Charles Van Riper's methodology was hard work. As a clinician, Charles was known for being warm and sympathetic, but tough on adult stutterers who refused to work and cooperate with him, since they were expected to be able and willing to practice behaviors and attitudes that would minimize their stuttering.|$|E
25|$|In the 2016 {{video game}} , the {{character}} Sorin Sprocket is eventually revealed to have anterograde amnesia, which he developed after unintentionally causing {{a car accident}} which killed his sister. This causes his memories to completely reset every time he wakes up from sleeping, {{to the day after}} this accident. This depiction is notable for demonstrating the relationship issues that arise between Sorin and his fiancee, Ellen Wyatt, {{as a result of this}} disorder, most noticeably with how Sorin's feelings towards her to coming across as distant and cold. As the storyline continues, however, the player comes to uncover that Sorin in fact deeply loves his fiancee, and is able to maintain this love despite his disorder, but in fact feels a sense of guilt over the fact that he has to constantly remind himself of the fact that this love exists inside of him every day, due to his disorder. It is also noticeable in that it depicts how Sorin deals with his disorder, by keeping a journal where he writes down every minuet detail of every day after his sister's death. He carries this journal around everywhere he goes as a substitution to his memories, and uses what is written in the notebook <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> each time he wakes up of the fact that he he his condition, what the current date apparently is, and everything important that have apparently occurred on every day since he first developed the condition. The episode also deals with legal issues concerning the disorder, when it is debated during Ellen Wyatt's trial as to whether Sorin's journal can be considered a proper substitution to his memories for the sake of viable witness testimony. Danger's imposed by this also come into play when it is revealed that a page in Sorin's journal had been altered by someone, which causes him to go into mental collapse that any of his other memories and thoughts could also have arisen from someone else's manipulation.|$|E
