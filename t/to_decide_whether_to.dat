5|$|Coverage of {{this event}} varied {{significantly}} between Nashville's two major newspapers. The Tennessean emphasized the mayor's agreement that lunch counters should be desegregated, while the Nashville Banner emphasized the mayor's statement that {{it was up to}} the city's merchants <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> desegregate. This was largely indicative of the two papers' opposing stances on the issue. Regardless, the mayor's response was later cited as an important turning point by both activists and Nashville business owners.|$|E

5|$|The {{account of}} Edwin's {{conversion}} offered by Bede turns on two events. The first, during Edwin's exile, tells how Edwin's life was saved by Paulinus of York.

Edwin's decision to allow the baptism of his daughter Eanfled and his subsequent promise to adopt Christianity if his campaign against Cwichelm proved successful. Apart from these events, the general character of Bede's account is one of an indecisive king, unwilling to take risks, unable <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> convert or not.|$|E

5|$|During the {{peregrine}} falcon decline, Houle studied biology at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. The institution's block scheduling system meant that Houle had fewer classes each day, {{allowing her to}} travel frequently to experience various ecosystems {{in addition to her}} academic studies. Upon leaving college, Houle began working for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, and her first field assignment was to observe {{peregrine falcon}} activity along the Rocky Mountains for four summers, two of which were spent at Chimney Rock. Following her experience with the peregrine falcons, Houle had <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> continue pursuing wildlife biology or to commit instead to her passion of writing. Wings for My Flight combined both of Houle's interests; it recounted her observations of the peregrines as well as her interaction with the community at Chimney Rock during her first summer there.|$|E

William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E
5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult judgment call where the official scorer is required <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E

Governor Linda Lingle had until July 6 <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> sign or veto the measure. The House vote margin in support is not large enough to override a gubernatorial veto. Lingle vetoed the bill on July 6, arguing civil unions should be decided by referendum.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find {{reasonable}} explanations why cross-border acquisitions of foreign firms are often the preferred strategy to enter new markets.

This paper examines the issue of providing safety assurance for systems involving COTS software, and surveys what international standards say about the issue.

5|$|On January 18, 2001, the Jets {{announced}} Herman Edwards {{as the new}} coach. Edwards, {{a former}} defensive back who had {{worked his way up}} through the NFL coaching system, had never served as head coach at any level. He was the first African-American Jets head coach. Edwards lost his first game, two days before the September 11 attacks. In the wake of 9/11, the NFL had <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> play its games the following weekend. Testaverde and the Jets spoke out against playing on the weekend after 9/11, and the Jets were prepared to forfeit the game rather than fly. The NFL decided to move that week's games {{to the end of the}} regular season. The Jets needed to win that game, in Oakland against the Raiders, to reach the playoffs, and John Hall kicked a last-minute 53-yard field goal for a 24–22 victory and a playoff berth. Edwards was the first coach to lead the Jets to the playoffs in his first year with the team. In the playoffs, the Jets again played at Oakland. New York could not stop the Raiders' passing game, and Oakland won, 38–24.|$|E
5|$|The game cuts to September 1978, as Reza and his pacifist friend Babak Azadi (Omid Abtahi) watch crowds {{chanting}} {{about the}} revolution from a rooftop, and Reza takes photographs. The two then walk the streets, and {{arrive at a}} protest where revolution leaders are giving speeches. Reza's cousin Ali Shirazi (Nicholas Guilak) arrives and, when the protest is interrupted by soldiers and the crowd begins to disperse, he tries to convince Reza to throw rocks at the soldiers. Babak opposes, and Reza is left <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> act aggressively and throw rocks, or act passively and voice his concerns instead. When the soldiers start threatening the crowds by firing, Reza and Babak flee into an alley, shortly followed by Ali and an injured Abbas (Ray Haratian), one of the revolution leaders who was stabbed in the commotion. After briefly being tended to, Abbas is escorted away by Ali and Bibi Golestan (Mozhan Marnò).|$|E

Different causes for this effect have been discussed.
