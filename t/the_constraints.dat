5|$|An {{improved}} {{mathematical analysis}} of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> on possible locations of Planet Nine. Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} explore a broader range of parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is most likely to be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> of an existing one, the downside was {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated, Kertész left Keystone after Prince {{left the}} company in 1937. He was {{commissioned}} by Harper's Bazaar for {{an article on the}} Saks Fifth Avenue department store in their April 1937 issue. The magazine continued to use him in further issues, and he also took commissions from Town and Country to supplement his income. Vogue invited the photographer to work for the magazine, but he declined, believing it was not appropriate work for him. He chose to work for Life magazine, starting with a piece called The Tugboat. Despite orders, he photographed more than just tugboats, including works on the entire harbor and its activities. Life refused to publish the unauthorized photographs.

5|$|The early 20th century {{also saw}} the growth of Broadway, a group of theatres specializing in musicals.

The need to adapt enjoyable songs to <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> of a theater and a plot enabled and encouraged a growth in songwriting and the rise of composers like George Gershwin, Vincent Youmans, Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern. These songwriters wrote songs that have remained popular and are today known as the Great American Songbook.|$|E
5|$|The monarch {{and his or}} her {{immediate}} family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional, the monarch is limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the Prime Minister. The monarch is, by tradition, commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate formal executive authority over the government of the United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch's royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> of convention and precedent.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> of the bocage {{that had}} made attacks so difficult and costly for both sides, Rhino modifications were made to some M4 Sherman, M5A1 Stuart tanks and M10 tank destroyers, by fitting them with hedge-breaching 'tusks' that could force a path through hedgerows. German tanks remained restricted to the roads but U.S. armored vehicles could maneuver more freely, although {{the effectiveness of the}} devices was exaggerated. By the eve of Cobra, 60 percent of the tanks of the First Army had the rhino modification. To preserve operational security, Bradley forbade their use until Cobra was launched. In all, 1,269 M4 medium tanks, 694 M5A1 light tanks and 288 M10 tank destroyers were available.|$|E
50|$|Equivalence {{allows for}} {{simplifying}} <b>the</b> <b>constraint</b> store by replacing some constraints with simpler ones; in particular, if <b>the</b> third <b>constraint</b> in an equivalence rule is , and <b>the</b> second <b>constraint</b> is entailed, <b>the</b> first <b>constraint</b> {{is removed from}} <b>the</b> <b>constraint</b> store.

5|$|Beiderbecke's cornet {{style is}} often {{described}} by contrasting it with Armstrong's markedly different approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos often took advantage of that fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> imposed by that fact were evident in his music. While Armstrong often soared into the upper register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging his listeners. Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.|$|E
5|$|Most Germans were {{relieved}} that the conflicts and street fighting of the Weimar era had ended. They were deluged with propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels, who promised peace and plenty for {{all in a}} united, Marxist-free country without <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> of the Versailles Treaty. The first major Nazi concentration camp, initially for political prisoners, was opened at Dachau in 1933. Hundreds of camps of varying size and function were created {{by the end of}} the war. Upon seizing power, the Nazis took repressive measures against their political opposition and rapidly began the comprehensive marginalisation of persons they considered socially undesirable. Under the guise of combating the Communist threat, the National Socialists secured immense power. Above all, their campaign against Jews living in Germany gained momentum.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{themselves were}} considered to be three-dimensional given <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> of the technology at the time.

The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with the team members represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where the players are on base.
