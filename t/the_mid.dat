5|$|Ryholt dates Sheshi's reign to <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> 18th century BC.

The fort of Uronarti was abandoned {{at some point in the}} 13th Dynasty, an event which Ryholt dates to the reign of Djedkheperew given the lack of seals attributable to subsequent kings. Ryholt thus proposes that Sheshi reigned from c. 1745 BC until 1705 BC and was a contemporary of Khabaw and Djedkheperew.|$|E

40|$|SummaryCortical {{receptive}} fields {{represent the}} signal preferences of sensory neurons. Receptive fields {{are thought to}} provide a representation of sensory experience from which the cerebral cortex may make interpretations. While {{it is essential to}} determine a neuron's receptive field, it remains unclear which features of the acoustic environment are specifically represented by neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AI). We characterized cat AI spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) by finding both the spike-triggered average (STA) and stimulus dimensions that maximized the mutual information between response and stimulus. We derived a nonlinearity relating spiking to stimulus projection onto two maximally informative dimensions (<b>MIDs).</b> <b>The</b> STA was highly correlated with <b>the</b> first <b>MID.</b> Generally, <b>the</b> nonlinearity for <b>the</b> first <b>MID</b> was asymmetric and often monotonic in shape, while <b>the</b> second <b>MID</b> nonlinearity was symmetric and nonmonotonic. The joint nonlinearity for both MIDs revealed that most first and second MIDs were synergistic and thus should be considered conjointly. The difference between the nonlinearities suggests different possible roles for <b>the</b> <b>MIDs</b> in auditory processing...|$|R

5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across <b>the</b> <b>Mid</b> Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th.

5|$|Ancestors of {{contemporary}} salamanders were likely able to disperse and migrate into habitats of the Rocky Mountains and surrounding areas by the Eocene. Mesic forests {{were established in}} western North America by <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> Eocene and attained their contemporary range distributions by the early Pliocene. The temperate forest valleys and montane environments of these time periods (Paleogene to Neogene) would have provided the physiographic and ecological features supporting analogs {{of contemporary}} Ambystoma macrodactylum habitats. The Cascade Range rose during <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> Pliocene and created a rain shadow effect causing the xerification of the Columbia Basin and also altered ranges of temperate mesic ecosystems at higher elevations. The rise of the Cascades causing the xerification of the Columbia Basin is a major biogeographic feature of western North America that divided many species, including A.macrodactylum, into coastal and inland lineages.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, metal {{movable type}} {{printing}} {{was developed in}} Ming Dynasty China (and earlier in Joseon Korea, by <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> 13th century), and was widely applied in China by at least the 16th century. In Jiangsu and Fujian, wealthy Ming era families sponsored the use of metal type printing (mostly using bronze). This included the printing works of Hua Sui (1439–1513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type movable printing in the year 1490. In 1718, during <b>the</b> <b>mid</b> Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), the scholar of Tai'an known as Xu Zhiding developed movable type with enamelware instead of earthenware. There was also Zhai Jinsheng (b. 1784), a teacher of Jingxian, Anhui, who spent thirty years making a font of earthenware movable type, and by 1844 he had over 100,000 Chinese writing characters in five sizes.|$|E
