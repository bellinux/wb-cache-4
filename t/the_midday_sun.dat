5|$|The {{sculptured}} mounds {{sometimes have}} elaborate and distinctive forms, {{such as those}} of the compass termite (Amitermes meridionalis and A. laurensis), which builds tall, wedge-shaped mounds with the long axis oriented approximately north–south, which gives them their common name. This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation. The north-south orientation causes the internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun.</b> The temperature then remains at a plateau {{for the rest of the}} day until the evening.|$|E
5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>Sun</b> through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
25|$|A full six-mile (10km) round-trip ascent on {{a popular}} trail {{takes two to}} five hours for walkers, one to one-and-a-half hours for bicyclists and runners. Difficulty with <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun,</b> such as dehydration, is common. Guidelines {{recommend}} carrying two liters of water per person, extra water for dogs, and sun protection. Signs prohibit off-trail shortcuts which can cause erosion, and some shortcuts have barbed wire fencing to reduce trespassing.|$|E
60|$|Beyond {{the spring}} the road went uphill {{for a long}} distance, and then took a turn to the southward, past more farms and over a bridge {{spanning}} a tiny stream. Then {{they came to a}} small town, looking dry, dusty and almost deserted in <b>the</b> <b>midday,</b> summer <b>sun.</b>|$|R
25|$|One of Selleck's Magnum co-stars, Larry Manetti, in his 1996 memoir Aloha Magnum, was lavish in his {{praise of}} Selleck. Manetti lauded Selleck for his {{extraordinary}} work ethic on a grueling show (shooting {{for hours in}} <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> Hawaiian <b>sun),</b> Selleck's work with Hawaiian charities, and his willingness to go to bat for the program's cast and crew members.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> {{perpetual}} <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> {{poured down}} its torrid rays from zenith, {{as it had}} done {{since the beginning of}} Pellucidarian time--as it would continue to do to the end of it. Before me, across the wide sea, the weird, horizonless seascape folded gently upward to meet the sky until it lost itself to view in the azure depths of distance far above the level of my eyes.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the opening}} {{ceremony}} host nation Mexico faced the Soviet Union; {{this was the last}} time until the 2006 World Cup that the host nation's first match rather than the World Cup holders' began the tournament. Both this opening match of Group 1 and many others during the competition kicked off at noon for the benefit of European television schedules, meaning play under <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun.</b> The match produced a goalless draw, prompting some media to predict the entire tournament would be played at the slow tempo that featured in this game given the conditions involved. Following the half-time interval Anatoliy Puzach became the first substitute to be used in FIFA World Cup history as the Soviets made use of the new competition rule. Both teams won their remaining two games to progress from the group at the expense of Belgium and World Cup debutants El Salvador.|$|E
2500|$|Ventilation in each {{passenger}} cabin {{has been criticized}} as being inadequate so that passengers should be forewarned that the cabin may become extremely hot and humid, especially in <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun.</b> This has been largely mentioned when the Maokong Gondola began operating with several [...] "halts" [...] during service hours, trapping the mid-day heat within the cabins.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than five}} {{hours after the}} battle began, the Americans began to feel the {{scorching}} heat of <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> and decided to rest for a while amidst the rocks. Later that day, the search party had succeeded their task, and the Americans fell upon {{the rear of the}} outnumbered defenders, defeating them. [...] Over the course of the battle, 52 of the 60 Filipinos were killed. Among the dead was General del Pilar, shot through the neck at the height or end of the struggle (depending upon which eye-witness account is to be believed).|$|E
60|$|And {{it almost}} seems for the moment as if Nature herself stood still and listened, and looked on. <b>The</b> genial <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> is slowly melting the snow on pine trees and rocks; {{one by one the}} glistening tiny {{crystals}} blink and vanish under the warmth of the kiss; the hard, white road darkens under the thaw and slowly a thin covering of water spreads over the icy crust of the lakes.|$|R
60|$|By {{the first}} of November the wonder {{had gone out of}} the life of the settlers. One by one the {{novelties}} and beauties of the plain had passed away or grown familiar. The plover and blackbird fell silent. The prairie-chicken's piping cry ceased as the flocks grew toward maturity, and the lark and cricket alone possessed the russet plain, which seemed to snap and crackle in the midnight frost, and to wither away in <b>the</b> bright <b>midday</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|R
50|$|The May 30 {{scheduled}} {{start time}} of the race was 9:00 a.m.. At <b>midday,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> finally came {{out for a few}} hours, and the track surface dried enough for a race start at 2:10 p.m.|$|R
2500|$|Like most Australian Acacia species, mulga is thornless. [...] The {{needle-like}} phyllodes stand erect {{to avoid}} {{as much of}} <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> as possible and capture the cooler morning and evening light. Any rain that falls is channeled down the phyllodes and branches to be collected in the soil immediately next to the trunk, providing the tree with a more than threefold increase in effective rainfall. Mulga roots penetrate far into the soil to find deep moisture. The roots also harbour bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen and thus help deal with the very old, nutrient-poor soils in which the species grows.|$|E
2500|$|... "El realismo magical", magic realism, {{at least}} as practised by Márquez, is a {{development}} out of Surrealism that expresses a genuinely [...] "Third World" [...] consciousness. It deals with what Naipaul has called [...] "half-made" [...] societies, in which the impossibly old struggles against the appallingly new, in which public corruptions and private anguishes are somehow more garish and extreme than they ever get in the so-called [...] "North", where centuries of wealth and power have formed thick layers {{over the surface of}} what's really going on. In the works of Márquez, as in the world he describes, impossible things happen constantly, and quite plausibly, out in the open under <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us wait awhile--until {{the awful}} heat of <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> is over," [...] {{suggested}} Phil. [...] "The sunshine just now {{is enough to}} give one a sun-stroke." ...|$|E
50|$|Unidentified African grassland-dwelling termite, a termite {{that has}} {{developed}} an almost symbiotic relationship with gholes. This termite builds its mound with a horizontal shelf projecting out all around, a meter or so above the ground. The shelf provides shelter from <b>the</b> fierce <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> where <b>the</b> ghole can bring bones and other tough parts of its meal to chew at leisure. The termites feed on the remaining scraps of carrion that the ghole invariably leaves scattered around the mound, thus benefitting from the relationship.|$|R
50|$|Western {{and eastern}} sun can provide warmth and lighting, but are {{vulnerable}} to overheating in summer if not shaded. In contrast, <b>the</b> low <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> readily admits light and warmth during the winter, but can be easily shaded with appropriate length overhangs or angled louvres during summer and leaf bearing summer shade trees which shed their leaves in the fall. The amount of radiant heat received {{is related to the}} location latitude, altitude, cloud cover, and seasonal / hourly angle of incidence (see Sun path and Lambert's cosine law).|$|R
5000|$|Around <b>midday,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> {{becomes too}} hot for the tortoises, so they return to their hiding places. They have {{a good sense of}} {{direction}} to enable them to return. [...] In the late afternoon, they leave their shelters again and return to feeding.|$|R
60|$|That was no easy task. They {{all stood}} looking from one road {{to another in}} perplexity. The paths {{radiated}} from the little clearing like the rays of <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun,</b> and each path seemed like all the others.|$|E
60|$|The {{travellers}} {{set forth}} on horseback, and purposed to perform {{much of their}} aimless journeyings under the moon, and in {{the cool of the}} morning or evening twilight; <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun,</b> while summer had hardly begun to trail its departing skirts over Tuscany, being still too fervid to allow of noontide exposure.|$|E
60|$|The black panther--with its sleek {{black coat}} on which <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> threw tiny blotches of tawny lights--was cowering {{in a corner}} of its cage; its snake-like head, with the broad flat brow and wide curved jaws, was drawn back between its shoulders, its small golden eyes, gleaming like yellow topaz, were half closed in wary somnolence.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the limited}} fresh water {{available}} in salty intertidal soils, mangroves {{limit the amount of}} water they lose through their leaves. They can restrict the opening of their stomata (pores on the leaf surfaces, which exchange carbon dioxide gas and water vapour during photosynthesis). They also vary the orientation of their leaves to avoid <b>the</b> harsh <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> and so reduce evaporation from the leaves. Anthony Calfo, a noted aquarium author, observed anecdotally a red mangrove in captivity only grows if its leaves are misted with fresh water several times a week, simulating frequent tropical rainstorms.|$|R
6000|$|A {{crowd had}} {{gathered}} round the Ka’abah, and I had {{no wish to}} stand bareheaded and barefooted in <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> September <b>sun.</b> At <b>the</b> cry of “Open a path for the Haji who would enter the House,” the gazers made way. Two stout Meccans, who stood below the door, raised me in their arms, whilst a third drew me from above into the building. At the entrance I was accosted by several officials, dark-looking Meccans, of whom the blackest and plainest was a youth of the Benu Shaybah family,[FN#9] ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{three o'clock}} they again went into church, and now Mr. Arabin read {{the service and}} the archdeacon preached. Nearly the same {{congregation}} was present, with some adventurous pedestrians from the city, who had not thought the heat of <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> August <b>sun</b> too great to deter them. The archdeacon took his text from the epistle to Philemon. [...] "I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds." [...] From such a text it may be imagined the kind of sermon which Dr. Grantly preached, and on the whole it was neither dull, nor bad, nor out of place.|$|R
60|$|And whilst {{the city}} guard {{followed}} closely on {{the footsteps of}} their praefect, and men among the crowd prepared for the inevitable fight which they foresaw, the women {{and those who were}} feeble and pacific waved fans and cloaks about and threw dead roses across the arena, till the whole place seemed like a great pageant of many-coloured flags, over which <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> had thrown its veil of gold.|$|E
60|$|The {{garden was}} rudely but not badly kept. There was even some attempt at ornamentation, {{and many of}} the shrubs and flowers were rare and beautiful. Narrow walks traversed the masses of foliage, and several leafy bowers invited one to escape the heat of <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> in their shelter. It was not a large place, and struck one as being overcrowded because so many of the plants were taller than a man's head.|$|E
6000|$|Adye {{moistened}} {{his lips}} again. He glanced {{away from the}} barrel of the revolver and saw the sea far off very blue and dark under <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun,</b> the smooth green down, the white cliff of the Head, and the multitudinous town, and suddenly he knew that life was very sweet. His eyes came back to this little metal thing hanging between heaven and earth, six yards away. [...] "What am I to do?" [...] he said sullenly.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, summiting Cotopaxi {{became a major}} tourist draw. The José F. Ribas Refuge (Refugio José Félix Ribas) was built in 1971 at an {{elevation}} of 4800 m and enlarged in 2005. A tragedy occurred here on Easter Sunday 1996 when an avalanche partially buried the Refuge and dozens of tourists. The glacier above the Refuge was probably weakened by an earthquake that had shaken the entire Province of Cotopaxi for several days prior to the avalanche. In <b>the</b> warm <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> a huge portion of the ice wall broke loose. Being Easter there were many day visitors on the mountain who were buried in the ice and snow. Those trapped in the Refuge broke windows on the downhill side to climb to safety, but 13 people died on the slope above. The Refuge itself {{is located in a}} valley and consequently vulnerable to future avalanches.|$|R
5000|$|The ninth sign is {{the rising}} {{of the sun}} from the west after a long night. After <b>midday,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> will set again. According to hadith: Abu Hurayrah states that the Messenger of God (saw) as said, [...] "The Hour will not be {{established}} until the sun rises from the West and when the people see it they will have faith. But that will be (the time) when believing of the soul, that will have not believed before that time, will not benefit it. Ibn Maja, as-Sunan, vol. 2 p 1352-53 ...|$|R
40|$|The {{image has}} become an iconic one: five young men in dirty uniforms kneel {{in the middle of}} a dusty plain with their hands behind their heads. They squint in <b>the</b> {{blinding}} <b>midday</b> <b>sun,</b> their faces expressing anxiety and a measure of fear. A Turkish soldier leans to talk to one of them, appearing calm, even friendly. To one side another Turkish soldier whose face we do not see stands guard. This photograph has become one of the most famous images to come out of the Cyprus conflict. The men's kneeling posture, the fright in their eyes, and the apparent calm of the soldiers all evoke a vulnerability to violence. And like the bloody photo of a woman and her children murdered in their Nicosia home that was used for decades by the Turkish Cypriot administration, or like certain photographs of distraught women crying for losses that we can only imagine, the image of these five young men has been reprinted in pamphlets and brochures, newspapers and books, in ways that take for granted its power to evoke their uncertain fate...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't look, dear," [...] I said, for {{already the}} ranks of the mob were riven. We saw the upflung hands, we heard their death cries. Leaders leaped up, {{shouting}} orders, only to go down like ninepins as the line of fire reached them. There was no hope for them or any salvation save flight. Before our eyes we saw that great concourse melt away, like snow before <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun.</b> Staunton drew a great breath of relief.|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} light, the glare, the {{vibration}} {{of water and}} leaves under the kiss of <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun</b> dazzled her eyes {{so that she could}} not see. But she heard the chirrup of the sparrows, the call of thrush and blackbird, and far away the hymn of praise of the skylark. Her nostrils drew in with glad intoxication the pungent fragrance of oak-leaved geraniums, and her heart called out joyfully to the secluded plantation of young beech trees there on her left, where she often used to wander.|$|E
60|$|At Rouen, {{horse and}} rider had to part company. Belle Amie, who had covered {{close on a}} hundred leagues, {{and most of it}} in the full glare of <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> <b>sun,</b> wanted {{at least a couple of}} hours rest if she was to get to Le Havre at all, and this her rider was unwilling to give her. At the posting hostelry, which stands {{immediately}} at the rear of the cathedral, Stainville bargained for a fresh horse, and left Belle Amie in charge of mine host to be tended and cared for against his return, probably on the morrow.|$|E
50|$|While {{they are}} diurnal, 95 {{percent of the}} day is spent resting, sun basking in the morning and evening, but {{avoiding}} <b>the</b> <b>midday</b> heat. While <b>sun</b> basking is necessary for thermoregulation, it greatly increases their risk of predation. However, they remain vigilant and the dominant male will keep watch on a high rock and will give a shrill alarm if there is danger. Colonies of hyraxes include on average 34 individuals, but stable polygamous family groups make up the basic social unit. Hyraxes are also highly social animals. Play behavior is generally limited to juveniles and includes fur nipping, biting, climbing, pushing, fighting, chasing, and mounting.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>midday,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> {{was shining}} full upon {{me and the}} heat of it was rather intense upon my naked body, yet no greater than would have been true under similar {{conditions}} on an Arizona desert. Here and there were slight outcroppings of quartz-bearing rock which glistened in the sunlight; and a little to my left, perhaps a hundred yards, appeared a low, walled enclosure about four feet in height. No water, and no other vegetation than the moss was in evidence, and as I was somewhat thirsty I determined {{to do a little}} exploring.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} habitat use by {{the newly}} described Etendeka round-eared sengi (Macroscelides micus) in northwestern Namibia, we radio-tracked five individuals for nearly a month. Home ranges (100 % convex polygons) in the rocky desert habitat were remarkably large (mean 14. 9 ha) when compared to sengi species in more mesic habitats (< 1. 5 ha). The activity pattern of M. micus was strictly nocturnal, which contrasts to the normal diurnal or crepuscular activity of other sengis. The day shelters of M. micus were under single rocks and they likely were occupied by single sengis. One tagged sengi used 22 different day shelters during the study. On average, only 7 % of the day shelters were used more than once by the five tagged sengis. The shelters were also unusual for a small mammal in that they were unmodified in terms of excavation or nesting material. Shelter entrances were significantly oriented to face south by south west (average 193 °), away from the angle of <b>the</b> prevailing <b>midday</b> <b>sun.</b> This suggests that solar radiation is probably {{an important aspect of}} M. micus thermal ecology, similar to other sengis. Compared to published data on other sengis, M. micus generally conforms to the unique sengi adaptive syndrome, but with modifications related to its hyper-arid habitat...|$|R
