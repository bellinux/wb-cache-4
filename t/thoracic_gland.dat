40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the mammary lymphatic drainage under a macroscopic and mesoscopic view, comparing the vascular pattern of healthy and neoplasic mammary glands injected with drawing ink alcoholic and fluorescein solutions, in 46 mongrel female dogs. The results pointed out that the <b>thoracic</b> <b>gland</b> is drained by the axillary lymph centre, but in mammary neoplasia either superficial cervical or ventral thoracic lymph centres can be involved. Cranial and caudal abdominal glands may be drained by the axillary, inguinofemoral and popliteal lymph centres. However, the popliteal drainage is specific for the healthy caudal abdominal mammary gland. The inguinal gland can be drained by both inguinofemoral and popliteal lymph centres in both neoplasic and healthy conditions. Regarding the mammary lymphatic communications, this research demonstrated that neoplasic glands present more types of anastomosis (40. 9 %), than healthy glands (33. 33 %), and an increase in contralateral anastomosis (50 %) compared with healthy ones (33 %). Given the data, the mammary neoplasia can change the lymphatic drainage pattern in terms of lymph centres and vascular arborization, thus forming new drainage channels and recruiting a larger number of lymph nodes. Lastly, some comments were made about the severity of a specific neoplasic mammary gland and conditions to be considered before making a decision in terms of the most adequate operative procedure, and suggestions for further investigations. © 2003 Blackwell Verlag...|$|E

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer and the second most {{frequent}} cause of cancer death in women. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis remain unclear. One of the reasons for this is due, at least in part, to a lack of a suitable animal model which can closely mimic the breast carcinogenesis in normal situations without using chemical carcinogens. We have developed an animal model of mammary gland carcinogenesis using a combination of oestradiol and testosterone, and succeeded in inducing a high percentage of female Noble rats to develop mammary cancer in a relatively short time (~ 6 months). The results showed that androgens might work as a promoter to shorten the latency time of mammary gland carcinogenesis. Histopathological examination revealed that hyperplasia and dysplasia were first observed 2 months after treatment, in situ carcinoma after 3 months, and fully developed carcinoma of various forms including cribriform, papillary and camedo types were observed from 5 to 6 months after hormone implantation. Animals implanted with oestrogen or testosterone alone also developed mammary cancers, though with a lower overall incidence than the two hormones combined. They ranged from well differentiated to poorly differentiated forms with predominantly infiltrating ductal carcinoma. We have also observed a case of secondary cancer in the uterus. In addition to the high incidence of carcinoma, there was also a peculiar unexplained ipsilateral correlation between the site of hormonal implantation and the location of tumours, and the highest incidence of carcinogenesis was found to be in <b>thoracic</b> mammary <b>gland.</b> The study showed that both oestrogens and androgens are important in mammary cancer development. The animal model would prove to be a useful model for analysis of the mechanism(s) of hormonal carcinogenesis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Second <b>thoracic</b> mammary <b>glands</b> of {{immature}} BALB/c female mice were stimulated to pregnancy-like lobuloalveolar (LA) development after 6 days of incubation in a corticosteroid-free step I {{culture medium}} containing insulin, prolactin, estradiol, progesterone, and growth hormone. A low basal level (0. 0009 %) of casein mRNA (mRNAcsn) sequences was detectable in the LA glands by a specific cDNA probe. Subsequent incubation of the LA glands for 3 days in medium containing insulin and prolactin or insulin and cortisol failed to elicit mRNAcsn above the basal level, indicating that neither prolactin nor cortisol alone can support casein gene expression. However, {{an increase in}} mRNA. levels was observed when the 3 -day incubation with insulin and cortisol or insulin and prolactin was followed by 3 days of culture in presence of insulin, prolactin, and cortisol. When a 3 -day incubation with insulin and prolactin was followed by 3 days in insulin and cortisol medium, mRNAcsn. levels in the gland remained similar to the basal level. However, a 20 -fold increase in the mRNAcsn levels ensued when the LA glands were sequentially incubated for 3 days in insulin and cortisol and then for another 3 days in insulin and prolactin medium. After a preincubation in insulin and cortisol medium, the LA glands retained residual cortisol during subsequent incubation in insulin and prolactin medium, and the mRNAcsn. levels in these glands {{were related to the}} level of residual cortisol present. When mRNAcsn and the residual cortisol level reached a minimum, addition of fresh cortisol to the medium caused a 20 -fold increase in the mRNAcsn levels. This indicates that cortisol is a limiting factor in insulin and prolactin medium and its presence is absolutely required for casein gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Mammary gland tumours {{occupy a}} {{significant}} {{place in the}} pathology of this species. Female dogs that are not spayed after their first heat cycle have a higher predisposition of developing mammary tumours. Most tumours metastasize at distance via the lymphatic system. In these conditions, the sentinel lymph nodes of the mammary glands must be assessed prior to surgical treatment. Aims: Considering the insufficient usage of non-invasive investigative methods of the sentinel lymph nodes, {{the aim of this}} study is to describe the sonographic anatomy of the lymph nodes that drain the mammary gland tumours in female dog. Materials and Methods: Twelve dog females presenting tumours of the cranial and caudal abdominal mammary glands (A 1 and A 2), inguinal mammary gland (I) and cranial <b>thoracic</b> mammary <b>gland</b> (T 1) were examined (group I). In addition, a control group composed of eight dog females was used (group II). The axillary and superficial inguinal lymph nodes were evaluated using an algorithm composed of gray-scale ultrasound, Doppler technique, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and real time elastography. Surgical excision of the sentinel lymph nodes was performed and samples for histopathological examination were taken. Results: The following ultrasonographic findings revealed on gray-scale examination were suspected for the metastatic infiltration: hypoechoic pattern, round shape, hillus absence and heterogenicity. Doppler technique showed an aberrant and mixed vascularisation of the lymph nodes, while the CEUS revealed incomplete enhancement of lymph nodes parenchyma. On real time elastography, the presence of blue areas in more than 50 % from the lymph nodes parenchyma led us to conclude that the lymph node stiffness was caused by metastatic infiltration. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of the metastatic infiltration in 97 % of the examined lymph nodes. Conclusion: The algorithm composed of gray-scale ultrasound, Doppler technique, CEUS and real time elastography proved to be efficient in diagnosing the metastatic infiltration of sentinel lymph nodes of mammary gland. Further studies are needed to validate the proposed algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Chrysomelina larvae {{possess a}} {{sophisticated}} strategy {{in terms of}} chemical defense eminently adapted to their natural habitat. In case of predatory attack, the deterrent secretions are released from dorsal <b>thoracic</b> and abdominal <b>glands.</b> The source of the deterrent compound for this ingenious mechanism depends on different biosynthetic strategies and subdivides the Chrysomelina in three different groups. The ancestral strategy represents the de-novo production of iridoids. Species belonging to this group e. g. Phaedon cochleariae and Gastrophysa viridula produce the deterrent compound independently of host plant derived precursors. More evolved species of the Chrysomela as well as Phratora vitellinae use the approach of sequestering phenol glucosides to produce salicylaldehyde. Based on the precursor salicin, this defense strategy is highly adapted to the secondary metabolites of the salicaceous plant which restricts the larvae in their forage. The third group is represented by several species of the interrupta-group belonging to the genus Chrysomela. They exhibit a combined biosynthetic strategy by using de-novo produced and phytogenic derived precursors to generate butyrate-esters as defensive compounds. Irrespective of different deterrent substances, the defensive systems of all groups exhibit per se a uniform architecture and morphology. Together with the self-contained biosynthesis of these compounds, the Chrysomelina larvae represent an excellent system to analyze regulatory processes as well as uncover evolutionary relationships regarding the defensive system. In the present thesis, I identified and characterized enzymes essentially involved in the de-novo biosynthesis of the defensive compound Chrysomelidial of P. cochleariae...|$|R
