5|$|Not all cyclists were {{competing}} for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was Henri Pépin. Pépin had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban, <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending {{the night in the}} best hotels they could find. Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists {{in the history of the}} Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, Jean-Marie Teychenne, lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped Pépin.|$|E
5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least willing to {{participate}} in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan is one of his better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.|$|E

25|$|Air Force Two also lands at Carswell {{with vice}} {{president}} Lyndon B. Johnson, the Texas governor John Connally, and Senator Ralph Yarborough. Connally and Yarborough dislike each other so much that Yarborough is unwilling to travel in the same car as Johnson, who is an ally of Connally. The following day, the president tells him <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> Johnson.|$|E
25|$|One day in 1943, Parks {{boarded a}} bus and paid the fare. She then moved to her seat but driver James F. Blake told her to follow city rules and enter the bus again from the back door. When Parks exited the vehicle, Blake drove off without her. Parks waited for the next bus, {{determined}} never <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> Blake again.|$|E
25|$|The Tour {{which made}} Pépin celebrated {{started at the}} Porte Bineau in Paris on 8 July 1907. Pépin, whom reporters quickly turned into a count or a baron (see below) was rider number 59 in a peloton of 112. He had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> him. Far from {{competing}} with the favourites, Gustave Garrigou, Émile Georget and Lucien Petit-Breton, Pépin planned to treat the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending {{the night in the}} best hotels they could find.|$|E

25|$|The woman rides {{her horse}} hard. When it dies of exhaustion, Coley gives his horse {{to the woman}} and Gashade allows Coley <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> him. Later, the woman loses the trail and asks Gashade to lead on. Gashade's horse shows signs of fatigue so Gashade tells Coley to join the woman on her horse, but Spear forbids him from doing so. The woman says that the journey would be much easier without Coley. She and Spear demand that he be left behind. Gashade, under threat by Spear, reluctantly agrees and tells Coley he will come back for him soon.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{improved}} in the 1930s and riders {{were allowed to}} accept a rain jacket, a spare tyre and a pump, but only in an emergency and at the judges' discretion. A change of bike was allowed only if a frame, wheel or handlebar broke, but riders were still expected <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> spare tyres and a pump. Riders in the 1940s had to hand their bikes to officials {{the day before the}} race to have them identified with a lead seal, later with a ring similar to that fitted to racing pigeons. In that way the judges, or commissaires, could see if a rider had illegally changed bikes.|$|E
25|$|Roller Coaster – {{also known}} as Scenic Railway or The Scenic – is a wooden roller coaster at Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach, Great Yarmouth, UK. The ride was built at the park in 1932 and has {{remained}} operational. It stands and operates as the only remaining ride {{of its kind in}} the UK; and one of only eight in the world. It is one of only two remaining roller coasters where a 'brakeman' is required <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> the train, to control its speed as there are no brakes on the track. It is the second tallest and second fastest wooden roller coaster in the UK. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

25|$|Next year, in the 1934 UCI Road World Championships at Leipzig, Stallard was {{selected}} <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> Charles Holland and Fred Ghilks. Their accompanying official from the National Cyclists' Union was from Herne Hill velodrome in south London and knew little of road-racing. The circuit was nearly six miles round, {{to be covered}} 12 times. The marshalling was by Brownshirts. The race averaged 26mph with one lap at nearly 30. Holland rode 60 of the 70 miles with three broken spokes and came fourth. Stallard and Ghilks finished over two minutes later, Stallard seventh and Ghilks 26th. The race was won by Kees Pellenaars of the Netherlands, {{who went on to}} manage the Dutch team in the Tour de France.|$|E
25|$|The last {{domestic}} motorcycle {{manufacturer in}} the country is Corley Motors, whose founder and CEO, the elderly Malcolm Corley (Hamilton Camp), is en route to a shareholders meeting at the Corley factory, accompanied by his vice president, Adrian Ripburger (Mark Hamill). Malcolm suspects that Ripburger is scheming to take over the company, and is suspicious of Ripburger's plan to recruit a biker gang <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> them to the meeting. Malcolm's limousine is overtaken by one such gang, the Polecats, and he is immediately impressed with them. Catching up to them at a biker bar, he quickly befriends their leader, Ben (Roy Conrad). Ripburger offers to hire the Polecats to escort Malcolm to the meeting, but when Ben declines, he is knocked out by Ripburger's flunkies, Bolus (Jack Angel) and Nestor (Maurice LaMarche).|$|E
25|$|The {{two were}} quickly {{joined by a}} {{counter-attack}} from Axel Merckx and Sandy Casar; Boogerd and Lefevre sat up and allowed those two to join them. Casar struck a dog on the road when he and Frederick Willems were chasing Boogerd and Lefevre, {{and both of them}} went down. Casar got up quickly, but Willems was slower and wound up being absorbed by the peloton. The crash resulted in Casar tearing his gear and having <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> a nasty wound on his exposed buttocks, since dropping off to change and have the wound treated would cost him his position. Later, the race doctor's car made it up to the leading group to tend to Casar's hip and right elbow, as well as a bee sting sustained by Boogerd.|$|E

25|$|Leggett {{was born}} in Camberwell, South London, and raised Catholic. His father's forebears were village cobblers in a small village in Hampshire; Leggett's {{grandfather}} broke with this tradition to become a greengrocer; his father would relate how he used <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> him to buy vegetables at the Covent Garden market in London. His mother's parents were of Irish descent; her father had moved to Britain {{and worked as a}} clerk in the naval dockyard in Chatham. His maternal grandmother, who survived into her eighties, was sent out to domestic service at the age of twelve. She eventually married his grandfather and raised a large family, then in her late sixties emigrated to Australia to join her daughter and son-in-law, and finally returned to the UK for her last years.|$|E
25|$|On 2 October 2011, Melandri {{signed a}} {{contract}} <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> the BMW World Superbike team for the 2012 season, after Yamaha elected not to continue with a factory team after the 2011 season. Melandri achieved BMW's best result, at the time, in the Superbike World Championship, with a {{second place in the}} season-opening race at Phillip Island, having started 13th on the grid. Mixed results followed at Imola, Assen and Monza, but Melandri achieved BMW's first Superbike World Championship victory at the European round at Donington Park, leading home teammate Leon Haslam in a 1–2 finish. Melandri and Haslam collided in the meeting's second race, denying a weekend sweep for BMW. From that point, Melandri won races at Miller Motorsports Park, Motorland Aragón and a double at Brno, to move within 21 points of the championship lead held by Max Biaggi.|$|E
25|$|Long {{stirrups}} {{allow the}} rider <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> a long leg, with the knee relaxed and only slightly bent, allowing {{a deep and}} stable seat in the saddle. When riding a long stirrup, the rider has excellent control of the horse and the greatest ability to feel and communicate with the horse via the riding aids. This provides a sturdy base for activities where precision is required or when the rider is {{at risk of being}} unseated. For both reasons, long stirrups were thus the choice of heavy cavalry such as the medieval knights, who fought in close quarters and used weapons such as the lance and long, heavy swords. Historically, this type of stirrup adjustment and the riding seat it produced was called la brida. Today it is the choice for dressage and many types of western riders.|$|E

500|$|It was {{announced}} that Nelly would appear on Cyrus' album Bangerz (2013) when its track listing was confirmed on September 10. Their collaboration, [...] "4x4", was written by Cyrus, Nelly, and Pharrell Williams; it was produced by Williams and engineered by John Hanes. Andrew Coleman arranged, recorded, and edited the song with assistance from Todd Hurtt and Matthew Desrameaux; it was later mixed by Serban Ghenea. Nelly commented that the track blends elements of pop, hip hop, and country music, and elaborated that [...] "it's about having fun; kind of how a 4x4 truck symbolizes rebelliousness ... you know, mashing out, wanting <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>with</b> the bad boys."
