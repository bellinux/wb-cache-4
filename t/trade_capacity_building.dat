40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{major policy}} {{issues related to}} commodity dependence and export diversification in low-income countries. Contrary to some widely-held view, it argues that natural resources are not necessarily a ‘curse’ that condemns low-income countries to underdevelopment but can {{provide a basis for}} sustained export-led growth. Natural resource-based sectors have potential for export diversification. The OECD ‘mirror’ trade data indeed suggest that many different routes to diversification exist, including resource-based manufacturing and processing of primary products. However, these opportunities are far from being exploited in many low-income countries. This is because export diversification is typically a slow process, and this process needs to be sustained by an appropriate and coherent strategy, characterised by a combination of vision, co-ordination and management of conflicting interests. Moreover, the analysis of trade support services in two African countries points to a mismatch between private sector’s needs and services actually provided and to a limited institutional development of the trade and investment support network. The lessons for <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>building</b> are important for Africa but are also relevant for other low-income countries. export diversification, resource curse, Doha development agenda, <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>building,</b> trade support services...|$|E
