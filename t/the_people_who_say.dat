60|$|Now when I was lecturing in America I {{was often}} told, in a radiant and congratulatory manner, that {{such and such}} a person was bound to come and hear me lecture. It seemed a very cruel form of conscription, and I could not {{understand}} what authority could have made it compulsory. In the course of discovering my error, however, I thought I began to understand certain American ideas and instincts that lie behind this American idiom. For as I have urged before, and shall often urge again, the road to international friendship is through really understanding jokes. It is in a sense through taking jokes seriously. It is quite legitimate to laugh at a man who walks {{down the street in}} three white hats and a green dressing gown, because it is unfamiliar; but after all the man has some reason for what he does; and until we know the reason we do not understand the story, or even understand the joke. So the outlander will always seem outlandish in custom or costume; but serious relations depend on our getting beyond the fact of difference to the things wherein it differs. A good symbolical figure for all this may be found among <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>say,</b> perhaps with a self-revealing simplicity, that they are bound to go to a lecture.|$|E
60|$|Now that {{civilisation}} is our civilisation, and {{we never}} had any other. We have not inherited a Teutonic culture {{any more than a}} Druid culture; not half so much. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that parliaments or pictures or gardens or roads or universities were made by the Teutonic race from the north can be disposed of by the simple question: why did not the Teutonic race make them in the north? Why was not the Parthenon originally built in the neighbourhood of Potsdam, or did ten Hansa towns compete to be the birthplace of Homer? Perhaps they do by this time; but their local illusion is no longer largely shared. Anyhow it seems strange that the roads of the Romans should be due to the inspiration of the Teutons; and that parliaments should begin in Spain because they came from Germany. If I looked about in these parts for a local emblem like that of the eagle, I might very well find it in the lion. The lion is common enough, of course, in Christian art both hagiological and heraldic. Besides the cavern of Bethlehem of which I shall speak presently, is the cavern of St. Jerome, where he lived with that real or legendary lion who was drawn by the delicate humour of Carpaccio and a hundred other religious painters. That it should appear in Christian art is natural; that it should appear in Moslem art is much more singular, seeing that Moslems are in theory forbidden so to carve images of living things. Some say the Persian Moslems are less particular; but whatever the explanation, two lions of highly heraldic appearance are carved over that Saracen gate which Christians call the gate of St. Stephen; and the best judges seem to agree that, like so much of the Saracenic shell of Zion, they were partly at least copied from the shields and crests of the Crusaders.|$|E

They are on God's {{side in the}} battle of life, which is the battle of Christ and of all good men, against evil, against sin and ignorance, and the numberless miseries which sin and ignorance produce. They are not the profligate; they are not the selfish, the idle; they are not the frivolous, the insolent; they are not the wilfully ignorant who do not care to learn, and do not even--so brutish are they--think that there is anything worth learning in the world, save how to turn sixpence into a shilling, and then spend it on themselves. Not such are those who may hope to have their prayers heard, because they are worth hearing, and worth helping. But they are <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> to themselves, not once in their lives, not once a week on Sundays, but every day and all day long--I must be good; I will be good. I must be of use; I must be doing some work for God; and therefore I must learn. I must learn God's laws, and statutes, and commandments, about my station, and calling, and business in life. Else how can I do it aright? I dare no more be ignorant, than I dare be idle. I must learn. But how shall I learn? Stupid I am, and ignorant, and the more I try to learn, the more I discover how stupid I am. The more I do actually learn, the more I discover how ignorant I am. There is so much to be learned; and how to learn it passes my understanding. Who will teach me? How shall I get understanding? How shall I get knowledge? And if I get them, how shall I be sure that they are true understanding, and true knowledge? Mad people have understanding enough; and so have some who are not mad, but merely fools. Wit enough they have, active and rapid brains: but their understanding is of no use, for it is only misunderstanding; and therefore the more clever they are, the more foolish they are, and the more dangerous to themselves and their fellow-creatures. Knowledge, too--how shall I be sure that my knowledge, if I get it, is true knowledge, and not false knowledge, knowledge which is not really according to facts? I see too many who have knowledge for which I care little enough. Some know a thousand things which are of no use to them, or to any human being. Others know a thousand things: but know them in a shallow, inaccurate fashion; and so cannot make use of them for any practical purpose. Others know a thousand things: but know them all in a prejudiced and one-sided fashion; till they see things not as things are, but as they are not, and as they never will be; and therefore their knowledge, instead of leading them, misleads them, and they misjudge facts, misjudge men, and earth, and heaven, just as much as the man who should misjudge the sunlight of heaven and fancy it to be green or blue, because he looked at it through a green or blue glass. How then shall I get true knowledge? Knowledge which will be really useful, really worth knowing? Knowledge which I shall know accurately, and practically too, so that I can use it in daily life, for myself and my fellow-men? Knowledge, too, which shall be clear knowledge, not warped or coloured by my own fancies, passions, prejudices, but pure, and calm, and sound; Siccum Lumen, [...] "Dry Light," [...] as the greatest of English Philosophers called it of old? ...|$|E

In his role as band leader, Scott spoke out in support of Harrison's musical direction and refuted reports that the tour was not going well; instead, he told Circus Raves, audience reaction had been [...] "radically different from city to city" [...] and dependent on whether concertgoers chose to listen, or came expecting to hear the Beatles.|$|E

Each member's previous smaller local bands they had played in had influenced their approach to making music as well - Eubanks and Odell coming from a heavy metal background, Nimmo coming from a rock and country music background, and Andrews and Frye coming from pop punk background. Odell in particular has mentioned James Hetfield of Metallica as his biggest influence in his guitar-work, mostly notably the track [...] "Sad But True". Odell explained the meaning behind the band's name, and how it ultimately reflected the positive aspect of their music, stating: It has this underdog theme to it, which is like an anthem to people who don’t feel like they can beat the odds but they can, you know?

40|$|This {{essay will}} discuss Ernest Hemingway's Islands in the Stream, posthumously {{published}} 1970, focusing in particular {{on the importance}} of the protagonist's fluid gender identity and interest in queer sexuality. Central to my discussion is queer theorist Judith Butler's view of gender as something performed and contextual and her objection to the binary of man and woman. I will argue that the issues of gender identity and queer forms of sexuality are ever-present throughout the novel, and that in the protagonist Thomas Hudson, Hemingway presents a different hero in comparison to the hardboiled macho-man he has been claimed to glorify in his work. My thesis is that the protagonist's denial of his ambiguous gender identity and his interest in queer sexualitey are the underlying causes {{for the development of the}} plot. The novel will be discussed in relation to the thesis in chronological order: first, it examines the protagonist's detachment and separation from his sons; second, his difficulties to sustain any longer relationships with women, and third, why he never dares to trust <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> they love him...|$|E

Bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) is the {{cornerstone}} of Hawaii's deep-set, commercial longline fishery and fishers have been willing to travel farther from Hawaii in search of it. This study serves as an introduction to Hawaii's longline fishery and some of the challenges it continues to face. The commercial tuna fishery in Hawaii has many players: the fishers trying to make a living, the government organizations working to manage our ocean resources sustainably, the people with an appetite for fish, and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that not enough is being done to protect these apex predators. This study approaches this resource management issue by utilizing a geographic information system to display and describe the spatial-temporal patterns of Hawaii's longline fishery from 1994 to 2008 and demonstrates that this fishery has grown in every regard. There has been a steady increase in effort, catch and value of bigeye tuna. There has also been a growing geographic distribution of the fishery, however the vast majority of bigeye catch and value occurred around the main Hawaiian Islands. The catch rate has not shown the same steady increases and that leaves fisheries managers in the position to make the difficult decisions needed to ensure a sustainable fishery...|$|E
40|$|People {{say again}} and again that {{philosophy}} doesn´t really progress, that we are still occupied with the same philosophical problems as were the Greeks. But <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> this don´t understand why is has to be so. It is because our language has remained the same and keeps seducing us into asking the same questions. As long as there continues to be a verb´to be´that looks as if it functions in the same way as´to eatánd´to drink´, as long as we still have the adjectives´identical´,´true´,´false´,´possible´, as long as we continue to talk of a river of time, of an expanse of space, etc., etc., people will keep stumbling over the same puzzling difficulties and find themselves staring at something which no explanation seems capable of clearing up. And what´s more, this satisfies a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar as people think they can seèthe limits of human understanding´, they believe of course that they can see beyond these. `` ´ This quote is from Ludwig Wittgenstein who redefined philosophy some 70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out). Dennett, though he has been a philosopher for some 40 years, is one them. It is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, John Searle, studied under famous Wittgensteinians (Searle with John Austin, Dennett with Gilbert Ryle) but Searle got the point and Dennett did not. Dennett is a hard determinist (though he trys to sneak reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to Ryle, whose famous book´The Concept of Mind´(1949) continues to be reprinted. That book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine. Dennett enjoys making the mistakes Wittgenstein, Ryle (and many others since) have exposed in detail. Our use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention, particle, thinking, determines, wave, cause, happened, event(and so on endlessly) are rarely a source of confusion but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and any discussion detached from the environment in which language evolved) chaos reigns. Like most Dennet lacks a coherent framework-which Searle has called the logical structure of rationality. I have expanded on this considerably since I wrote this review and my recent articles show in detail what is wrong with Dennet's approach to philosophy. Let me end with another quote from Wittgenstein [...] ´Ambition is the death of thought´. Those wishing a comprehensive up to date account of Wittgenstein, Searle and their analysis of behavior from the modern two systems view may consult my article The Logical Structure of Philosophy, Psychology, Mind and Language as Revealed in Wittgenstein and Searle (2016).
