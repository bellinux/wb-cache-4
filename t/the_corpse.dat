5|$|In 1971, Evita's {{body was}} exhumed and flown to Spain, where Juan Perón {{maintained}} <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> in his home. Juan and his third wife, Isabel, {{decided to keep}} <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> in their dining room on a platform near the table. In 1973, Juan Perón came out of exile and returned to Argentina, where he became president for the third time. Perón died in office in 1974. His third wife, Isabel Perón, whom he had married on 15 November 1961, and who had been elected vice-president, succeeded him. She became the first female president in the Western Hemisphere. Isabel had Eva Perón's body returned to Argentina and (briefly) displayed beside her husband's. Perón's body was later buried in the Duarte family tomb in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires. The previous removal of Evita's body was avenged by the Montoneros when they in 1970 stole <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, whom they had previously killed. Montoneros then used the captive body of Aramburu to pressure for the repatriation of Evita's body. Once Evita's body arrived in Argentina, the Montoneros gave up Aramburu's corpse and abandoned it in a street in Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Tomás Eloy Martínez {{published}} Santa Evita, a fictionalized work propounding {{many new}} {{stories about the}} escapades of <b>the</b> <b>corpse.</b> Allegations that her body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Coronel Koenig and his assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that her body had been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> had been damaged with a hammer, {{and that one of}} the wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.|$|E
5000|$|Quake II (1997) allowed <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> of {{allies and}} foes to be gibbed. This {{introduced}} tactical advantages in certain levels since one enemy, the Strogg Medic, could fully resurrect <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> of its fellow Stroggs. Gibbing <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> before <b>the</b> Medic could reach {{them was the}} best way to prevent enemy resurrections. A mod for Quake II also introduced instagib gameplay.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the song}} [...] "Song about <b>the</b> <b>Corpses</b> of People" [...] ("Hát trên những xác người"), {{written in the}} {{aftermath}} of the Huế Massacre, Trinh sings about <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> strewn around <b>the</b> city, in the river, on the roads, on the rooftops, even on the porches of <b>the</b> pagodas. <b>The</b> <b>corpses,</b> each one of which he regards as the body of a sibling, will nourish the farmland.|$|R
5|$|In {{an echo of}} the Iliad, Achilles drags <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> {{behind his}} horse. Thus, the {{comparison}} with the Homeric Hector is heightened and, at the same time, aspects of the classical Troilus's fate are echoed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Arlinsky {{returns to}} the {{mountains}} with Mulder, but they find {{that most of the}} expedition members have been shot dead. The sole survivor is a man named Babcock, who reveals that he has saved the alien corpse from theft by burying it. Together, the three men bring <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> to the United States. There, Mulder and Arlinsky perform an autopsy on <b>the</b> <b>corpse,</b> believing it belongs to a genuine extraterrestrial. After Mulder leaves to meet with Scully, a mysterious assassin, Scott Ostelhoff, arrives and kills Arlinsky.|$|E
5|$|Taken together, the {{injuries}} {{appear to be}} a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on <b>the</b> <b>corpse.</b> The body wounds show that <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> had been stripped of its armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a backplate and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from behind on the back and buttocks while they were exposed to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with the legs and arms dangling down on either side. There may have been further flesh wounds not apparent from the bones.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets shelled {{the area}} {{in and around the}} Reich Chancellery on and off during the afternoon. SS guards brought over {{additional}} cans of petrol to further burn <b>the</b> <b>corpses.</b> Linge later noted the fire did not completely destroy the remains, as <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> were being burned in the open, where the distribution of heat varies. <b>The</b> <b>corpses</b> burned from 16:00 to 18:30. At approximately 18:30, Lindloff and Reisser covered up the remains in a shallow bomb crater.|$|R

50|$|Some {{work had}} been done at the Anatomical Institute, but the project was never {{complete}}d. The body casts were not made, and <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> were not defleshed as skeletons.

5|$|Although it {{was common}} to bury dogs in ancient Egypt, the funeral of Abuwtiyuw was unusually elaborate, an honour {{normally}} reserved for upper-class humans.

5|$|Among the Wyandots was {{the legend}} of the hooh-strah-dooh. A cross between what current fiction/legends portray as zombies and vampires, the hooh-strah-dooh was an evil spirit that {{inhabited}} recently dead bodies and caused <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> to rise and devour the living. The redbud was believed to be an effective ward.|$|E
5|$|Another story {{tells of}} a priest {{who came to the}} house one night and found the members engaged in the {{sacrifice}} of a black cat. The priest grabbed the cat and uttered an exorcism upon which a demon was released from <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> of the cat.|$|E
50|$|There was no postmortem examination, <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> {{were buried}} {{on the day}} of finding. There was a blunt wound in the body of Said Yangulbaev.

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the temple}} {{farthest}} from the door was a substantial monument to Robert Petre, a renowned 18th-century horticulturist. Executed in stucco and probably crafted by Roubiliac, it depicted an angel blowing the last trump, causing a stone pyramid to crumble and revealing <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> within to be rising from the dead.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled <b>the</b> <b>corpse,</b> finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E
5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> of Lady Van Tassel has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. <b>The</b> <b>corpse</b> is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E

5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body.

5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by {{cremation}}. The dead person's son carries <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights {{the fire to}} <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired {{to be buried in}} his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> was lowered into the tomb. <b>The</b> <b>corpse</b> was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E

The novel goes on to explain the burial customs and unveils that <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> were buried in a separate hole initially, then slowly one small hole for the family and then ended up digging a big hole for all those die on that particular day. It also painfully explains that people who helped bringing <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> to <b>the</b> burial ground died right there and happened to be buried along with <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> they carried in their shoulders.
