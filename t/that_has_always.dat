A teaser {{was released by}} Dark Horse Comics for Free Comic Book Day 2015, with Fight Club 2 #1 following in late May of that year. The series explores Joseph Campbell's concept of the 'second father' as being vital to the hero's journey, which is something <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> fascinated Palahniuk.|$|E
25|$|Another unique aspect, {{compared}} to other minor pro leagues of North America, {{is the absence of}} a veteran limit rule, which allows teams to stock up on experienced players. The league is slowly trying to clean itself up (for 2005–06, the roster limit went from 20 to 19 players, which for most teams meant one less enforcer), but this is no easy task for a league <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been popular with the fans for its reputation of being the toughest league in the world.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the year}} 2000, Sweden had a {{mandatory}} church tax, {{to be paid}} if one did belong to the Church of Sweden, which had been funneling about $500 million annually to the church. Because of change in legislation, the tax was withdrawn in the year 2000. However, the Swedish government has agreed to continue collecting from individual taxpayers the annual payment <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> gone to the church. But now the tax will be an optional checkoff box on the tax return. The government will allocate the money collected to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish and other faiths {{as well as the}} Lutherans, with each taxpayer directing where his or her taxes should go.|$|E

25|$|In 1992 and 1993, he and Herring {{wrote and}} {{performed}} Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World for BBC Radio 4, {{before moving to}} BBC Radio 1, for one series of Fist of Fun (1993), followed by three series of Lee and Herring. Throughout the late nineties he continued performing solo stand-up (something <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been a mainstay of his career – even whilst in the double act with Herring) and has collaborated with, amongst others, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh. Indeed, though Barratt and Fielding had worked together in the past, the first seeds of the Boosh were sown while working as part of Lee's Edinburgh show King Dong vs Moby Dick in which Barratt and Fielding played a giant penis and a whale, respectively. Lee returned the favour by going on to direct their 1999 Edinburgh show, Arctic Boosh, which remains the template for their live work.|$|E
25|$|Detective Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery) and {{his partner}} Ryan Alba (Greg Serano) {{have spent the last}} three years unsuccessfully trying to locate the Lion (Joe Pantoliano), an {{international}} hitman <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> eluded their grasp. They believe that they've found his location via a tipster but instead find Tom’s wife Kelly (Michelle Greathouse) tied up in a basement filled with explosives, surrounded by a black outline. The Lion calls Tom and commands him to kill Kelly or risk the entire house blowing up and killing everyone inside. Any attempt to evacuate the house or rescue Kelly will result in everyone getting blown up and the Lion will not accept any substitutions, as he wants Tom to suffer for messing up the Lion's network in the Southwestern United States. His only mercy is that Tom may turn out the lights in the basement. With no other option, Tom has the lights turned off and he shoots and kills Kelly.|$|E
25|$|Jack is {{sentenced to}} serving {{life in prison}} for the death of Peter, and Jennifer vows her eternal love for Jack every day. Jack breaks out of jail and takes Jen with him to evade police. They all are on the run for a while, until they join up with a circus. Jack becomes a laborer and Jen the {{assistant}} with Abby, their daughter. Abby strikes up a good friendship with the ringmaster's son. Eventually, Jack and Jennifer flee for Africa. While in Africa, Jennifer and Jack experience some problems with their relationship, especially when Jennifer falls for a young man named Colin Murphy...whom she does not realize is Shawn Brady's nephew! She flees to Ireland with Abby, where she ends up getting herself in trouble, and then has to come back to Salem with Bo. Jack soon follows her, and the two move in together so they can look after Abigail. Jennifer initially pushes Jack away and concentrates on relationships, first with Brandon then Colin, but she and Jack can't resist that certain something <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been between them. They are remarried, much to the delight of their daughter Abby.|$|E

500|$|Walpole {{was sent}} to England, where {{according}} to his biographer Rupert Hart-Davis {{the next ten years}} were the unhappiest time of Walpole's life. He first attended a preparatory school in Truro. Though he missed his family and felt lonely he was reasonably happy, but he moved to Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow in 1895, where he was bullied, frightened and miserable. He later said, [...] "The food was inadequate, the morality was 'twisted', and Terror – sheer, stark unblinking Terror – stared down every one of its passages... The excessive desire to be loved <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> played so enormous a part in my life was bred largely, I think, from the neglect I suffered there".|$|E
500|$|Aside from {{swinging}} {{with increased}} line-drive contact and hitting fastballs with more authority, very little has actually {{changed in the}} catcher's approach. [...] One trait <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> persisted is that Molina is an aggressive and free-swinging – but high-contact – hitter. [...] Through 2012, he swung at more than 51% percent of the pitches he saw – he {{has a reputation for}} swinging at pitches {{in and out of the}} strike zone, low and away and even in toward his hands. [...] Because of his free-swinging tendency, he naturally has a walk rate (7.1%) below the Major League average (8.4%). [...] Combined with his ability to put the bat on the ball quite frequently (87%) and his improved approach at the plate, he increased his career-high single-season batting average five times between 2006 and 2013.|$|E

500|$|Much of the ex-industrial (western) {{part of the}} Navigation now has the {{appearance}} of a tree-lined, gently-twisting river. The eastern part of the Navigation, sometimes known as the Knottingley and Goole Canal, is rather different: it has long straight stretches, but mainly through flat land <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been agricultural. Between Wakefield and Leeds, via Castleford, the Navigation is part of a circular cruising route or [...] "ring", formed by the Leeds & Liverpool and the Huddersfield or Rochdale canals. The Outer Pennine Ring utilises the Huddersfield Canal, while the North Pennine Ring uses the Rochdale Canal for the southern crossing of the Pennines. Beyond Castleford, boaters can travel on to Selby, York, Goole, Sheffield, and Keadby. With the possible restoration of the Barnsley Canal and the Dearne and Dove Canal, the section between Wakefield and the New Junction Canal might become part of a new [...] "Yorkshire Ring".|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Grant reprised {{his role}} as Daniel Cleaver for a small part in , which, like its predecessor, made more than $262million commercially. Gone from the screen for two years, Grant next reteamed with Paul Weitz (About a Boy) for the black comedy American Dreamz (2006). Grant starred as the acerbic host of an American Idol-like reality show where, {{according}} to Caryn James of the New York Times, [...] "nothing is real ... except the black hole at {{the centre of the}} host's heart, as Mr. Grant takes Mr. Cowell's villainous act to its limit." [...] American Dreamz failed financially but Grant was generously praised. He played his self-aggrandising character, an amalgam of Simon Cowell and Ryan Seacrest, with smarmy self-loathing. The Boston Globe proposed that this [...] "just may be the great comic role <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> eluded Hugh Grant," [...] and critic Carina Chocano said, [...] "He is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy." ...|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the album}} 8 on 10, Alex Needham from NME criticized the compilation's lack of new tracks, and said [...] "while far from immaculate, {{this is still}} quite a collection". About GHV2, New Strait Times Christie Leo commented that [...] "this second volume of {{greatest}} hits isn't as immediately accessible as the first. But that's not what this collection is all about. This 14-track set actually provides a more daring glimpse into the inner machinations of the music marketing juggernaut, Madonna". AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling it [...] "slightly disappointing", justifying {{that it was because}} during the 1990s, Madonna was an album artist. He finished his review saying that [...] "the end result is less {{than the sum of its}} parts, even if this is a good way to get all of Madge's 90s hits at once." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "GHV2 certainly encapsulates the second decade of the performer's boundary-bridging career", but criticized the lack of new material, and its [...] "choppy edits, random sequences and missing links", saying: [...] "the collection doesn't seem to do justice to a career <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been ahead of the game and focused on the future". Charlotte Robinson from PopMatters criticized its sequencing, stating, [...] "Chronological sequencing would have made it easier to follow the course of Madonna's musical evolution. But would these changes have made GHV2 a significantly better album? Probably not. As it stands, it's the best summary of Madonna's second decade as a performer we're going to get." ...|$|E
