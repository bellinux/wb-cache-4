Vehicles, in this matter aircraft {{as a tool of}} transportation, have a global characteristic because of the high speed and wide range capability compare to vehicles of any other transportation mode.

50|$|The {{card sorter}} of the 4A/CTS (Number 4A Crossbar / Card Translator System) allowed six digit {{translation}} of the central office code number dialed by the customer. This determined the proper trunk circuits to use, where separate circuit groups were used for different cities {{in the same area}} code, {{as in the case of}} Oakland and San Francisco. The new device used metal cards similar in principle to computer punched cards, and they were rapidly scanned as they fell past a light beam. On busy days, it sounded like a machine gun firing. CTS machines were called 4A (Advanced) if the translator was included in the original installation, and 4M (Modified) if it was added later. A 1970s version of 4XB, the 4A/ETS, used a computer to translate. For international dialing, <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Position</b> System (TSPS) provided the extra computer power.|$|E

Caldwell.Joel worked at Bell Labs (1940-83) where he first undertook cryptology studies (collaboration with Claude Shannon), followed by studies on electronic switching system that resulted in the 1ESS switch (1948-60). He then headed the development of advanced telephone services (1961-68), which led to several patents, including one on <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Position</b> System and a mechanism for handoff in cellular communication (1972). The latter invention made mobile telephony widely available by allowing a multitude of callers to use the limited number of available frequencies simultaneously and by allowing the seamless switching of calls from tower to tower as callers traveled. After 1983, he worked as a consultant to AT&T, developing mechanisms for optical switching.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. At {{the present}} stage of {{development}} of Ukraine’s economy, passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> quality management of railway enterprises {{became one of the}} main tasks to ensure their efficient operation. In terms of railway re-forms and increased competition in the transport market, the discrepancies between the technological level of traffic and the growing needs of society and the quality standards of transport services, the priority is the establishment of quality management system for passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>services</b> in rail transport. This question should be considered in the paper. Methodology. To achieve this goal and ensure a high quality level of passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>services</b> in rail trans-port, which involves a combination of approaches to the position of consumers (determination of their satisfaction) and railway enterprises (measurement of results and formation processes of service quality), the paper proposed a passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> quality management system. The proposed methodical approach to formation of the passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> quality management system in rail transport implements a principally new scheme of interaction of elements during provision of services, where the inter-related resources (human, material, financial, information), means, instruments and processes result in creation of quality transport service. Findings. The efficiency of the passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> quality management system allows detecting the dynamic of improvement of the services provided by the railway enterprises and building the system which is self-learning on the principles of continuous improvement. The paper grounded new principles of the passenger traffic quality management, which were formed on the basis of general management principles, quality management principles and railway transport management principles. Originality. The work presents the developed passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> quality management system targeted to meet the expectations of passengers from transport process while taking into account the economic interests of railway enterprises. The basis of this system is conceptual principles, namely, goal, objectives, subject, object, principles, functions and practical recommendations, which generally determine the relationship of the basic elements of the passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> quality management in rail transport. Practical value. The practical value of the obtained by the author results is that their implementation will enable railway enterprises to forecast the improvement of service quality level, taking into account their specific features and create solutions for control and regulation of processes and passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> quality effects. The theoretical and methodological provisions may be used in the formation, operation and improvement of the quality management system for passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>services</b> in rail transport...|$|R
