During one such event they took the opportunity to roll up a small ball of metal foil and drop it into the circular ring cut into the surface of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>that</b> held the globe.

He promises Rosie a tomorrow richer in every way, and they disappear into the shower. Then Maurice and Tracy return and take the money, with Tracy giving Maurice a kiss.

25|$|Plots of {{the four}} results above in the ROC space are given in the figure. The result of method A clearly shows the best {{predictive}} power among A, B, and C. The result of B lies on the random guess line (the diagonal line), {{and it can be}} seen in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>that</b> the accuracy of B is 50%. However, when C is mirrored across the center point (0.5,0.5), the resulting method C′ is even better than A. This mirrored method simply reverses the predictions of whatever method or test produced the C contingency table. Although the original C method has negative predictive power, simply reversing its decisions leads to a new predictive method C′ which has positive predictive power. When the C method predicts p or n, the C′ method would predict n or p, respectively. In this manner, the C′ test would perform the best. The closer a result from a contingency table is to the upper left corner, the better it predicts, but the distance from the random guess line in either direction is the best indicator of how much predictive power a method has. If the result is below the line (i.e. the method is worse than a random guess), all of the method's predictions must be reversed in order to utilize its power, thereby moving the result above the random guess line.|$|E
25|$|Graham {{is seated}} {{to the right}} of the picture, on the left of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>that</b> divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing {{forwards}} though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him.|$|E

500|$|In a scene {{featuring}} the two title characters having lunch at Katz's Delicatessen in Manhattan, the couple are arguing about a man's {{ability to recognize}} when a woman is faking an orgasm. Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference, and to prove her point, she vividly (fully clothed) fakes one as other diners watch. The scene ends with Sally casually returning to her meal as a nearby patron (played by Reiner's mother) places her order: [...] "I'll have what she's having." [...] When Estelle Reiner died at age 94 in 2008, The New York Times referred to her as the woman [...] "who delivered {{one of the most}} memorably funny lines in movie history". This scene was shot again and again, and Ryan demonstrated her fake orgasms for hours. Katz's Deli still hangs a sign above <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>that</b> says, [...] "Where Harry met Sally... hope you have what she had!" ...|$|E
500|$|Another stunt {{scene was}} filmed for Episode 6; the charity ball scene was filmed {{over two days}} at a Masonic Lodge and {{concluded}} with a fight between Jenny and Natalie (played by Lorelei King). The shots of Jenny spraying Natalie with a fire extinguisher were limited to two takes because {{it took so long}} to re-apply King's make up. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> <b>that</b> Ripley and King's stunt doubles fall through had its legs weakened, and the glasses on the table were replaced with sugar glass. The Brief Encounter fantasy was filmed at a steam railway near Rochdale. Nigel Cole used the scene as an opportunity to make his mark as a television director. Most of the scene was filmed by Cole and the main crew. Establishing shots were filmed by Langan and the second unit, due to time constraints. The lighting and focus of the fantasy station was intended to be a direct contrast to the harsh modernity of Piccadilly, which appeared in the [...] "real life" [...] scenes.|$|E
500|$|In August 2014, the Russos {{stated that}} the film would be set [...] "a couple years" [...] after The Winter Soldier, and would {{continue}} to focus on Steve Rogers' relationship with Bucky Barnes as well as the political themes related to Captain America.

[...] The Russos also said that they would be [...] "bringing some new elements to <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>that</b> will give us a twist on Winter Soldier", and indicated that filming was scheduled to begin in Atlanta. They described themselves as [...] "ecstatic" [...] with a first draft of the screenplay submitted by Markus and McFeely, and also {{stated that the}} film's title would be announced [...] "in a month or so at most", and that the concept and title for the film came from Feige, who had it [...] "for a while". In September, Joe expanded by saying the film would have another [...] "big idea that alters the universe as a whole in some way" [...] similar to S.H.I.E.L.D. falling in The Winter Soldier. The rest of the film, such as the characters, story, and tone, would be left open to the Russos' and writers' interpretations.|$|E

500|$|As Lennon and Cynthia {{were getting}} divorced, {{it became clear}} that Lennon did not wish to keep Kenwood, and Cynthia could not afford to {{maintain}} it on her own, so it was sold in December 1968, for a reputed £40,000, to Bill Martin, writer of songs such as [...] "Puppet on a String" [...] and [...] "Congratulations". Kenwood has subsequently changed hands several times, and been subject to some major renovation work, such that the interior now little resembles the house that Lennon lived in. The exterior and grounds are still recognisable, although the sunroom has been completely rebuilt. After being displayed at the Liverpool International Garden Festival in 1984, the psychedelic eye mosaic was unclaimed, and left in a field. It was rediscovered and restored by Tom Lorimer, a laboratory technician at the Liverpool John Moores University. The mosaic was then displayed at the Museum of Liverpool Life. Items from Lennon's Kenwood period have also appeared for auction, including towels and cutlery, a caviar jar, and <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>that</b> sat in the sunroom. Lennon kept the Kenwood house sign after he left, but gave it to Andy Eccles, who was a gardener at Tittenhurst Park, in 1972. It was sold for US$20,400, in 2003. In October 2006, Kenwood went back on the market, with a price of £5.95 million, and was sold in January 2007 for £5.8 million. It has been claimed that every owner after the Lennons has sold it due to divorce.|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} was the Extreme Elimination Chamber for the ECW World Championship. After a segment {{earlier in the}} event showed an injured Sabu was unable {{to compete in the}} match, it was decided that Hardcore Holly would take his spot in the ECW Championship match. Before the match began, Paul Heyman {{announced}} the rules of the match and [...] explained that each superstar had a weapon with them in each of their pods. Before entering the ring, Heyman had a conversation backstage with Big Show, that was unseen by television viewers, with him revealing {{that for the first time}} in his professional career he was not motivated to give the promo. Rob Van Dam and Hardcore Holly were the first superstars to begin the match and one of the other four competitors were then released from their pod every five minutes afterward. The first person to be released from his pod was CM Punk, who entered the match with a steel chair in hand. Test then followed, five minutes after him, with a crowbar. Punk was the first eliminated from the match, after Van Dam performed a Five Star Frog Splash from the top turnbuckle and covered him for the 3-count. Moments later, Test charged and delivered a big boot to Holly, eliminating him. Van Dam was the third person eliminated, after Test delivered a diving elbow drop from the top of a pod and pinned him. When it was Bobby Lashley's turn, his pod wouldn't open, he could not exit it because Heyman's Security Force had bolted the door shut. Lashley then used <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>that</b> was with him to smash through the pod, allowing him to escape. He then delivered a spear to Test to eliminate him. Big Show, was the final man to exit his pod and had a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire in tow. Lashley was able to block Big Show's swing of the barbed wire bat with a folding chair and then threw him into the pod, causing him to bleed. Lashley managed to reverse a chokeslam into a DDT and then delivered a spear to win the match and become the new ECW Champion.|$|E
500|$|At a {{press conference}} held on 5 June 2006, Jim Magilton was officially named as the new manager and former academy {{director}} Bryan Klug was appointed as first team coach. In Magilton's first season, the club reached a final placing of 14th place in <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>That</b> year, Ipswich became the first carbon neutral football club in England following a collaboration between the fans and the club's main sponsor E.ON. In October 2007, Ipswich agreed to sell a £44m stake in the club to British businessman Marcus Evans who became the majority owner and shareholder. 2007–08 brought further progress for Magilton and his side, who finished eighth in the final table. Magilton's team failed to gain promotion or reach the play-offs in the 2008–09 season, and on 22 April 2009 Magilton was sacked. His successor, Roy Keane, was appointed as manager the following day. Sheepshanks stood down as chairman after 14 years on 20 May 2009. [...] Ipswich started the 2009–10 season winless in the league after 14 games {{and bottom of the}} Championship, their worst ever start to a league season. [...] Limited success throughout the year saw the club finish 15th in Keane's first full season at the club. [...] Keane's second season at the club started well but by the start of 2011, the club were 19th in the Championship, and he left the club on 7 January 2011. [...] First team coach Ian McParland stood in as caretaker manager for two matches, including a semi-final first leg win in the League Cup against Arsenal, before Paul Jewell took the role on permanently in mid-January 2011. [...] Ipswich finished 13th that season, and 15th the following, Jewell's first full season at the club. The longest-serving members of the Championship, Ipswich were bottom of the league by late October, and Jewell left the club by [...] "mutual consent", leaving Chris Hutchings in a caretaker role. After a single match, Hutchings was replaced by Mick McCarthy on a full-time basis. McCarthy led Ipswich to finish in 14th position that season, and 9th in the following season. [...] Despite losing their final match of the 201415 season, Ipswich finished in sixth place and secured a play-off place where they played their local rivals Norwich City, losing 41 on aggregate. [...] The following season Ipswich finished just outside the playoff places, in seventh place. [...] The 2016–17 season saw Ipswich finish 16th, their lowest finish since the 1958–59 season.|$|E
