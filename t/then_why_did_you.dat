500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> want to do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E

6000|$|... ‘Well <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{begin with}} your detestable red-nosed giantesses? And she would, she would, she would, she would, she WOULD powder it!’ cries Rosa, {{in a little}} burst of comical {{contradictory}} spleen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am nearly six. Did {{you love}} {{grandmother}}? <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{never come to}} see her? Did grandmother know you was here? Why not? Why didn't I not know about you till after grandmother died?" ...|$|E

6000|$|BARBARA. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> keep {{thinking}} about it? <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> it keep coming up against {{you in your}} mind? You're not getting converted, are you? ...|$|R
6000|$|Tall black Bacchae of midnight, <b>why</b> <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> rush to assail me? Do I {{intrude on}} your rites nocturnal? What should it avail me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand. We {{are quite}} willing, since it lies upon our road. But <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come against us, who are {{peaceful}} travellers, with your spears lifted?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon. I {{should not have}} said so. It was very wrong; but, <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ask so foolish a question? Did I not tell you to let there be an end of it? And now will you {{let me give you}} one little bit of advice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] {{she said}} at length, [...] "were you in the square garden {{on the night of}} that dance at which I came out? Oh! I see by your look that you were. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not speak to me instead of {{standing}} behind a bush, watching in that mean fashion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was much}} {{surprised}} by this explanation, {{and a good deal}} relieved to find that the vessel, after all, was not a pirate; but instead of replying, I said, [...] "If it be as you state, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> take me from my island, and why do you not now take me back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still I do not understand," [...] said Margaret more softly. [...] "You {{say that}} your life or welfare hung on this shameful business. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> reveal it to me now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{all three}} prefer Douglas? And you, boys, who are such Tories, {{will you go}} see a play which is wrote by a Whig Scotchman, who was {{actually}} made prisoner at Falkirk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> take it <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it? Your life is {{not like}} his. Oh, Scatcherd! Scatcherd!" [...] and the doctor {{prepared}} to pour out the flood of his eloquence in beseeching this singular man to abstain from his well-known poison.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BARLOW. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> have children? Why weren't you celibate? They have to {{live among}} men. If they have no place among men, why have you put them there? If the peace of God {{is no more than}} the peace of death, why are your sons born of you? How can you have peace with God, if you leave no peace for your sons--no peace, no pride, no place on earth? ...|$|E
6000|$|If Mrs. Brook {{was less}} {{diverted}} she followed perhaps more closely. [...] "If {{you do me}} so much justice <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> put to me such a cold cruel question?--I mean when you so oddly challenged me on my handing on your news to Mitchy. If the principal beauty of our effort to live together is--and quite according to your own eloquence--in our sincerity, I simply obeyed the impulse to do the sincere thing. If we're not sincere we're nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{would have}} murdered you, Master, {{and you made}} him fast! <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not stop to keep him till I came along, {{and we would have}} haled him to the stocks? That would have been sport and all. You call me fool--but if you found a man covered with blood and hurts tied to a tree, and he daft and not able to speak, had you not cut him loose? Well, he's gone, and this alone is left of him,' and he spun the piece into the air.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, {{and twice}} {{in the months that}} {{followed}} you passed me on the street and did not know me, Martin almost said aloud. Each time I was hungry and heading for the pawnbroker. Yet it was work performed. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> not know me <b>then.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know me now? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{know how}} willing I am to help you, Cytherea,' she added reproachfully. 'You know it. Why are <b>you</b> so obstinate <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> selfishly bar the clear, honourable, and only sisterly path which leads {{out of this}} difficulty? I cannot, on my conscience, countenance you; no, I cannot.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What in {{the name}} of Pluto is the matter with you all?" [...] cried the amazed senator, whose night of potations had left him in no mood for patience. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> stand moping there? Stephanos, Vacculus, is {{anything}} amiss? Here, Promus, you are the head of my household. What is it, <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> turn your eyes away from me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|After the {{instances}} I {{have cited}} of actions of animals which are impossible of explanation as due to instinct, Mr. Burroughs may reply: [...] "Your instances are easily {{explained by the}} simple law of association." [...] To this I reply, first, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> deny rudimentary reason to animals? {{and why did you}} state flatly that [...] "instinct suffices for the animals"? And, second, with great reluctance and with overwhelming humility, because of my youth, I suggest that you do not know exactly what you do mean by that phrase [...] "the simple law of association." [...] Your trouble, I repeat, is with definitions. You have grasped that man performs what is called abstract reasoning, you have made a definition of abstract reason, and, betrayed by that great maker of theories, the ego, you have come to think that all reasoning is abstract and that what is not abstract reason is not reason at all. This is your attitude toward rudimentary reason. Such a process, in one of the other animals, must be either abstract or it is not a reasoning process. Your intelligence tells you that such a process is not abstract reasoning, and your homocentric thesis compels you to conclude that it can be only a mechanical, instinctive process.|$|E

Sushil is a universal brother and friend, but Aditya Joshi is his close brother[...] His friends say that he loves to give additional information about things. He is quite a trivia master and makes the best Sangria in the world. Sushil will praise restaurant X for 2 months, take you there and while you are there, he will spend time praising restaurant Y.

[...] "Your own schemes have all failed, <b>you</b> say; <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{not think of}} {{becoming}} a priest in reality, and getting the good there must be in such a calling?

5000|$|After the Italian {{invasion}} of Albania in 1939 Nishani {{returned to the}} country and initially joined the collaborationist government's Council of State which comprised various personalities opposed to King Zog. Nishani, who had known Enver Hoxha's father, Halil, was visited by Hoxha (who was then head of the Communist Party of Albania and leader of the partisan resistance) and remarked that, [...] "We old fogies have had our day, long live the youth, because you are the hope of the country. I haven't done anything much, but I fought Zog as much as I could. And I had good comrades on the newspaper who helped me in that direction. I did not give up, but what was I to do, die in exile? I was longing to see the country and my people. I came back, but these fascists and occupiers and all the rogues who serve them like dogs, I hate them like death. But you are going to say, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> join the 'Council of State'? I had to, because I have nothing to live on and I have a wife to keep. So this is what I am reduced to." [...] He quickly grew disenchanted with the post-Zog occupation and regarded involvement in the quisling government as a mistake; in this same conversation he said that [...] "everybody knows that fascism cuts the heads of communists. I am not a communist, but I have lived and worked with them, I have respected them and they have respected me. I shall tell you one thing: for you the road is not strewn with flowers, but go on, fight, because only by fighting you will save Albania." ...|$|E
40|$|Editorial: Muslim Contextualization Ihil Parshall and I meet in Manila, just a {{month after}} he {{publicly}} denounced the “C 5 ” concept (also called “Messianic Muslims”) as syncretistic. After reading “The Amazing Diversity of God in Drawing Muslims to Christ ” (see the first article) Phil says, “I don’t {{have any problem with}} what you have written. ” Completely per-plexed, I ask,“You don’t? <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> label C 5 as syncretism? ” Later on as we drive through a jungle of jeepney traffic and hash over the details of our apparent disagreement, it soon becomes clear that we are operating from very different defini-tions of who C 5 believers really are. The so-called “C 5 missionaries ” whom Phil had met advocate that it is okay to affirm Muhammad as a genuine prophet of God; that Muslim background believers should attend the mosque perpetually; and that Christians should consider legally converting to Islam to win Muslims as Muslims. “This is not C 5 ! ” I insist. “According to those who’ve described C 5 to me, ” Phil replies, “yes it is! ” Stuck in a definitional stalemate, we decide to contact John Travis, the architect of the C 1...|$|E

You know, John, how distasteful and {{unpleasant}} {{it is for}} me to have those dreary, petty, and vulgar details of the poor child's past life recalled, and, thank Heaven, I have forgotten them except when you choose to drag them before me. You agreed, long ago, that we were never to talk of the Indian massacre of her parents, so that we could also ignore it before her; <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> talk of her vulgar friends, who are just as unpleasant?
