This concept defines several principles, which should be followed by <b>testing</b> <b>teams.</b> These principles and its general application in <b>testing</b> <b>teams</b> are subsequently explained. The second part is devoted to Lean software development in a real company. I am working as a tester and I already know the development and testing processes [...] that's why one of my goals is to apply this approach to our <b>testing</b> <b>team.</b> Firstly the default situation in our company is introduced. Used technics and types of used testing tools are listed together with procedures and also the disadvantages and troubles, which occurred during the original testing process.

5|$|After a poor debut {{season for}} Victoria, Harvey did not gain {{first-class}} selection in 1948–49 and vacancies {{were hard to}} come by as the season was purely domestic with no touring <b>Test</b> <b>team,</b> so all of Australia's international representatives were available for the whole season. Harvey was selected for a Second XI match against New South Wales but failed to make an impact, scoring two runs in each innings as the Victorians completed a 195-run win.

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI.

After the hosts had complied, Bradman selected a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth <b>Test</b> <b>team</b> being Ring’s omission for Johnson, so McCool was left out. After Australia had taken a 312-run first innings lead, the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E

5000|$|While {{for some}} {{projects}} {{it may be}} possible to get away with only using one approach or the other, a more thorough approach would use a holistic software testing method, which uses both a dedicated <b>testing</b> <b>team</b> in addition to the crowd. Crowdsource testing is best for things like beta and compatibility testing, which are necessary final steps for testing; however, most software is far too complex for late-stage testing like this to cover all of the possible issues. A dedicated outsourced or in-house <b>testing</b> <b>team</b> will give a better idea of the software's possible defects, but will not give anywhere near the scope of crowdtesting. Therefore, a good solution is to integrate multiple <b>test</b> <b>teams</b> into any development project (and also to develop with the principles of testability in mind from the very beginning.) ...|$|R
