25|$|For all Windows Vista Premium Ready PCs, {{when using}} Alt+Tab to switch between open windows, {{a preview of}} each open window appears instead of just the program icon. In addition, Windows Flip 3D enables users to flip through a {{cascading}} stack of their open windows using the mouse scroll wheel, much like Apple's Cover Flow. Windows can be stacked and rotated in 3D to provide views {{of all of them}} simultaneously. (The keyboard shortcuts are +, which makes Flip 3D disappear after releasing, ++, which keeps Flip 3D visible after releasing, and ++ to flip through open windows backwards). The window buttons on the taskbar show a <b>thumbnail</b> <b>image</b> of the window, when the mouse hovers over the button.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another kind}} is actual video spam, giving the {{uploaded}} movie {{a name and}} description with a popular figure or event {{that is likely to}} draw attention, or within the video has a certain image timed to come up as the video's <b>thumbnail</b> <b>image</b> to mislead the viewer, such as a still image from a feature film, purporting to be a part-by-part piece of a movie being pirated, e.g. Big Buck Bunny Full Movie Online - Part 1/10 HD, a link to a supposed keygen, trainer, ISO file for a video game, or something similar. The actual content of the video ends up being totally unrelated, a Rickroll, offensive, or simply on-screen text of a link to the site being promoted. In some cases, the link in question may lead to an online survey site, a password-protected archive file with instructions leading to the aforementioned survey (though the survey, and the archive file itself, is worthless and doesn't contain the file in question at all), or in extreme cases, malware. Others may upload videos presented in an infomercial-like format selling their product which feature actors and paid testimonials, though the promoted product or service is of dubious quality and would likely not pass the scrutiny of a standards and practices department at a television station or cable network.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Media Center in Windows Vista, {{available}} in the Home Premium and Ultimate editions, has been upgraded significantly, including a considerable overhaul of the user interface. Each button in the main menu, which contains sections such as [...] "Music", [...] "Videos", and [...] "TV", gets encased in a box when selected, and for each selection, a submenu comes up, extending horizontally. When any of the options is selected, the entries for each are presented in a grid-like structure, with each item being identified by album art, {{if it is a}}n audio file, or a <b>thumbnail</b> <b>image</b> if it is a picture, a video or a TV recording, and other related options, such as different views for the music collection if [...] "Music" [...] is selected, extend horizontally {{along the top of the}} grid. Similarly, other items are identified by suggestive artwork. The grid displaying the items is also extended horizontally, and the selected item is enlarged compared to the rest.|$|E

5000|$|The {{plaintiff}} Kelly sold {{pictures to}} various publications from his web site. The defendants Arriba Soft Inc. and its CEO Michael J. Lyons ran a search engine. Defendant Arriba's search engine indexed {{pictures from the}} web so that web users can conduct image searches. The search engine returns a set of postage stamp-size image thumbnails that relate directly to the specific term searched on. Kelly's pictures appeared as thumbnails on defendants' search engine along with millions of other thumbnail images {{from all over the}} web. Clicking on the thumbnails from Kelly's website would connect the user with Kelly's website via a deep link. In addition to the display, a postage stamp size <b>thumbnail</b> <b>image</b> the user could also link to the full picture in a new web browser window. The <b>thumbnail</b> <b>image</b> was stored on Arriba's system, but the full picture was not stored in Arriba's system. The picture is displayed on the user's screen as a [...] "thumbnail", and if the full picture was linked to by the user then it was presented in a frame environment provided by Arriba. Kelly sued Arriba for copyright infringement for both use of the <b>thumbnail</b> <b>image</b> and use of the full image.|$|E

50|$|The {{rise of the}} Internet led to {{very rapid}} growth in the demand for {{international}} information display/e-mail systems on the World Wide Web.

50|$|On 4 February 2006, the Yemen Observer {{published}} {{two articles}} on Muslim {{reactions to the}} Danish cartoons depicting Muhammad.

50|$|Metadata removal {{tools are}} also {{commonly}} used to reduce the overall sizes of files, particularly image files posted on the Web.
