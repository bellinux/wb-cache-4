6000|$|... "You {{are very}} unbelieving," [...] Anna said coldly. [...] "I {{hope you will}} not compel me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again</b> that I {{do not know the}} man's name, nor, {{to the best of my}} belief, have I ever seen him before in my life." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is little}} {{sense in the}} words, doubtless, {{according}} to our modern notions of poetry; but they are like enough to the long, plaintive notes of the nightingale to say all that the poet has <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>again</b> and again through all his stanzas.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} I {{have promised to}} marry one woman, and because I love another. I have told you {{everything}} now; and if you choose <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again</b> that I am fighting under false colours I will leave the castle before you can see me again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Laws, it was {{out before}} I could think! And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>AGAIN,</b> <b>say</b> it <b>AGAIN,</b> <b>say</b> it <b>AGAIN!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Pertaub. You have, I see, {{brought a}} pickaxe. It will save us half an hour's work; and besides, I am glad <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't think you'll {{ever want}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>again,</b> Davy--or think it, either. And I wouldn't go about much with Mr. Harrison's hired boy if I were you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wilding rose, {{moved out}} of his {{habitual}} calm by the earnestness that pervaded him. [...] "It is not for me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again</b> what I would have Your Grace do. Your Grace has heard my views, and those of these gentlemen. It is for Your Grace to decide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am obliged, my lord, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again</b> that I {{have not}} asked for so great a favour from you. Indeed, till I {{received}} your letter desiring {{me to come}} here, I had no other thought of the living than that of vacating the house whenever your nominee should present himself." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke to}} a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after hearing what he wanted, {{referred}} him to the ostler; who after hearing all he had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again,</b> referred him to the landlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking his teeth with a silver toothpick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Anne, I'll {{never say}} it again--never. I'll never WANT <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>again.</b> I {{knew it was}} bad, but I didn't s'pose it was so--so--I didn't s'pose it was like THAT." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jist so, boy; but I'm {{tired of}} it already; it's by no means so {{pleasant}} as I expected it would be; so I'm thinkin' o' lavin' it, and takin' <b>to</b> the <b>say</b> <b>again.</b> I'm longin' dreadful to see the salt wather wance more." ...|$|R
6000|$|She was now {{clinging}} {{to him in}} very truth. [...] "Oh, my love!" [...] she said. [...] "I {{do not know how}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>again.</b> It is of you that I am thinking;--of you, of you!" ...|$|R
60|$|My friend, Mr. Collins, as I {{may have}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again,</b> {{was a very}} wide reader of poetry, with a memory like Macaulay's. It was his native {{tendency}} to find coincidences in poetic passages (which, to some, to me for example, did not often seem coincidental); and to explain coincidences by conscious or subconscious borrowing. One remarked in him these tendencies long before he wrote on the classical acquirements of Shakespeare.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And what {{a fellow}} Tom {{is to have}} thought of it,' added Aubrey. 'Nobody will ever dare <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again</b> {{that he is not}} the best of the kit of us! I must be off now to the meet: but if you are writing, Ethel, I wish you would give her my love, or {{whatever}} he would like, and tell him he is a credit to the family. I say, may I tell George Rivers?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{ring was}} no plain hoop of gold; it was garnets {{all the way}} round. She had seen it on Elspeth's finger, and craved it so greedily that it became her wedding-ring. And {{from the moment she}} had it she ceased to dislike Elspeth, and pitied her very much, as if she thought {{happiness}} went with the ring. [...] "Poor Alice!" [...] she said when she saw Elspeth crying at the wedding, and having started to go away with Tommy, she came back <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "Poor, poor Alice!" ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Underhill, {{having said}} {{all she had}} <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{recovered}} her breath and began <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>again.</b> Frequent iteration {{was one of her}} strongest weapons. As her brother Edwin, who was fond of homely imagery, had often observed, she could talk the hind-leg off a donkey.|$|R
6000|$|... "By degrees {{you might}} love me,--a little." [...] She had said {{all that she}} knew how <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and <b>again</b> shook her head. [...] "It is that accursed Colonel," [...] he exclaimed, forgetting himself as {{he thought of his}} rival.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is more," [...] Julien replied frankly, [...] "than I {{expected}} ever <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you <b>again</b> in this world. What do you expect? You don't {{think that}} I am {{the kind of}} man to--but that is absurd! Come. We'll part friends, if you like. Here's my hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought {{everybody}} knew that,' replied the landlord. 'Where {{have you come}} from, if you don't know the Valiant Soldier {{as well as the}} church catechism? This is the Valiant Soldier, by James Groves--Jem Groves--honest Jem Groves, as is a man of unblemished moral character, and has a good dry skittle-ground. If any man has got anything <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again</b> Jem Groves, let him say it TO Jem Groves, and Jem Groves can accommodate him with a customer on any terms from four pound a side to forty.|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} all the {{directions}} that have been given under this head, I ought <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again</b> before concluding it, that they are mainly applicable {{to the case of}} beginners, and of small schools. The general principles are, it is true, of universal application, but it is only where a school is of moderate size that the details of position, in respect to individual scholars, can be minutely studied. More summary processes are necessary, I am aware, when the school is very large, and the time of the teacher is incessantly engaged.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear fellow--and {{you must}} permit me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again,</b> {{that you never}} looked so young; so {{positively}} boyish as you do to-night--the Lord knows where; I believe Columbus himself wouldn't find them. Between you and me they have their hidden reasons, but upon that point I have pledged myself to secrecy. She appointed to see you here to-night, I know, but found it inconvenient, and couldn't wait. Here is the key of the door. I am afraid you'll find it inconveniently large; but as the tenement is yours, your good-nature will excuse that, Haredale, I am certain!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Didn't you hear?' {{retorted}} Jonas, lounging {{down upon}} a chair. 'I am not a-going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>again.</b> If {{you like to}} stay, you may stay. If you like to go, you may go. But if you stay, please to be civil.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never! I've wished <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>again,</b> {{ever since}} that night at Middlemount; I have always felt bound by what I said then, though I took back my words for your sake. But the promise was always there, and my life was in it. You believe that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never," [...] says he; [...] "but ye ken {{very well}} that ye've done worse. Are we to part? Ye said so once before. Are ye <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>again?</b> There's hills and heather enough between here and the two seas, David; and I will own I'm no very keen to stay where I'm no wanted." ...|$|R
60|$|When men {{are about}} to commit, or to {{sanction}} the commission of some injustice, {{it is not uncommon}} for them to express pity for the object either of that or some parallel proceeding, and to feel themselves, at the time, quite virtuous and moral, and immensely superior to those who express no pity at all. This is a kind of upholding of faith above works, and is very comfortable. To do Ralph Nickleby justice, he seldom practised this sort of dissimulation; but he understood those who did, and therefore suffered Bray <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>again</b> and again, with great vehemence, that they were jointly doing a very cruel thing, before he again offered to interpose a word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest Mother,-â€”Duke {{has written}} about our falling in with the Brownlows, and how pluckily Friar caught us up. It was a regular mercy, for the little one couldn't have lived without Dr. Medlicott, and most likely Lucas is in for a rheumatic fever. He has been telling me all about it, and how frightful {{it was to be}} all night out {{on the edge of the}} glacier in a thick fog with his ankle strained, and how little Armine went on with his texts and hymns and wasn't a bit afraid, but quite happy. You never would believe what a fellow Brownlow is. We have had a great talk, and you will never have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again</b> that he does me harm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait," [...] I said.... "I {{have come}} to you, through them. I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again</b> that I should not be here if I had {{obtained}} my desires. Yet {{there is more to}} it than that. I think I have reached a stage where I am able to say that I am glad I didn't obtain them. I see now that this coming to you was something I have wanted to do all along, but it was the cowardly thing to do, after I had failed, for it was not as though I had conquered the desires, the desires conquered me. At any rate, I couldn't come to you to encumber you, to be a drag upon you. I felt that I must have something to offer you. I've got a plan, Maude, for my life, for our lives. I don't know whether I can make a success of it, and you are entitled to decline to take the risk. I don't fool myself that it will be all plain sailing, that there won't be difficulties and discouragements. But I'll promise to try." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{will proceed}} no further {{in this kind}} of {{repetition}} of things; only thus much give me leave <b>to</b> <b>say</b> over <b>again,</b> even many of the truly godly are very faulty here. But what would they do if there were not one always at the right hand of God, by intercession, taking away these kind of iniquities? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Make {{yourself}} easy on that head, cousin Nicol," [...] answered MacGregor; [...] "the tae half o' the gillies winna ken what ye say, and the tother winna care--besides that, I wad stow {{the tongue}} out o' the head o' any o' them that suld presume <b>to</b> <b>say</b> ower <b>again</b> ony speech held wi' me in their presence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Toms {{went on a}} three-week-long {{hunger strike}} in February 1985 to protest the government's {{decision}} to buldoze the Crossroads shanty town. [...] The destruction of Crossroads resulted in violence and the deaths of several people as residents tried to resist the destruction. Toms commented during his hunger strike that, [...] "As a Christian, I am obliged <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> never <b>again</b> will I put on that SADF uniform." ...|$|R
60|$|A quick flush rose to Clarence's cheek. The group {{smiled at}} this evident {{youthful}} confession of some boyish admiration. But Clarence {{knew that his}} truthful blood was merely resenting the deceit his lips were sealed from divulging. He did not dare to glance at Susy; it added to the general amusement that the young girl was obliged to present herself. But in this interval she had exchanged glances with Mary Rogers, who had rejoined the group, {{and she knew she}} was safe. She smiled with gracious condescension at Clarence; observed, with the patronizing superiority of age and established position, that he had GROWN, but had not greatly changed, and, it is needless <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>again</b> filled her mother's heart with joy. Clarence, still intoxicated with Mrs. Peyton's kindliness, and, perhaps, still embarrassed by remorse, had not time to remark the girl's studied attitude. He shook hands with her cordially, and then, in the quick reaction of youth, accepted with humorous gravity the elaborate introduction to Mary Rogers by Susy, which completed this little comedy. And if, with a woman's quickness, Mrs. Peyton detected a certain lingering glance which passed between Mary Rogers and Clarence, and misinterpreted it, it was only a part of that mystification into which these youthful actors are apt to throw their mature audiences.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, my friends. These {{are very}} terrible {{thoughts}}--very wrong thoughts some of them, very foolish thoughts some of them, though pardonable enough; for God pardons them, {{as we shall}} see. But they are real thoughts. They are what really come into people's minds every day; and I am here {{to talk to you}} about what is really going on in your soul, and mine; not to repeat to you doctrines at second-hand out of a book, and say, There, that is what you have to believe and do; and, if you do not, you will go to hell: but to speak to you as men of like passions with myself; as sinning, sorrowing, doubting, struggling human beings; and to talk to you of what is in my own heart, and will be in your hearts too, some day, if it has not been already. This is the experience of all REAL men, all honest men, who ever struggled to know and to do what is right. David felt it all. You find it all through those glorious Psalms of his. He was no comfortable, book-read, second-hand Christian, who had an answer ready for every trouble, because he had never had any real trouble at all. David was not one of them. He had to go through a very rough training--very terrible and fiery trials, year after year; and had <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>again</b> and again, 'I am weary of crying; my heart is dry; my heart faileth me for waiting so long upon my God. All thy billows and storms are gone over me. Thou hast laid me in a place of darkness, and in the lowest deep.' - ...|$|E
6000|$|I propose, {{subject to}} the {{patience}} of the reader, to devote two or three articles to prophecy. Like all healthy-minded prophets, sacred and profane, I can only prophesy when I am in a rage and think things look ugly for everybody. And like all healthy-minded prophets, I prophesy {{in the hope that}} my prophecy may not come true. For the prediction made by the true soothsayer is like the warning given by a good doctor. And the doctor has really triumphed when the patient he condemned to death has revived to life. The threat is justified at the very moment when it is falsified. Now I have said again and again (and I shall continue <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>again</b> and again on all the most inappropriate occasions) that we must hit Capitalism, and hit it hard, for the plain and definite reason that it is growing stronger. Most of the excuses which serve the capitalists as masks are, of course, the excuses of hypocrites. They lie when they claim philanthropy; they no more feel any particular love of men than Albu felt an affection for Chinamen. They lie when they say they have reached their position through their own organising ability. They generally have to pay men to organise the mine, exactly as they pay men to go down it. They often lie about the present wealth, as they generally lie about their past poverty. But when they say that they are going in for a [...] "constructive social policy," [...] they do not lie. They really are going in for a constructive social policy. And we must go in for an equally destructive social policy; and destroy, while it is still half-constructed, the accursed thing which they construct.|$|E
6000|$|The gentleman {{with the}} large face held up a {{soothing}} hand. [...] "Peace, peace," [...] he said. [...] "I did not interrupt you. I annihilated you. Why did you presume to talk to artists about art? Go away, or I shall have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Bah! <b>again.</b> Go and have a fit. Leave us--two rare souls who may not meet again--to our talking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your kindness--" [...] Alan {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but began <b>again.</b> [...] "Feeling as I must--" [...] then interrupting himself. [...] "I {{beg your}} pardon, 'tis no fit time, nor fit--But you'll let me hear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have {{suffered}}. Probably I {{know how}} much I have suffered better than any one--ha--I say than any one! If I can put that aside, if I can eradicate the marks of what I have endured, and can emerge before the world--a--ha--gentleman unspoiled, unspotted--is it a great deal <b>to</b> expect--I <b>say</b> <b>again,</b> is it {{a great deal to}} expect--that my children should--hum--do the same and sweep that accursed experience {{off the face of the}} earth?' ...|$|R
