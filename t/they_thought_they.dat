After Jordan won a standard wrestling match between three wrestlers, also involving Booker and Christian, Benoit {{decided that he would}} face all three men in a match between the four at No Mercy.|$|E
5|$|They {{visited the}} Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but {{were unable to}} trace the path they took. Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people. Trying {{to come up with}} an explanation, they {{wondered}} if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon. During their research, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.|$|E

5|$|When {{the ride}} opened in 2000, Cedar Point chose High End Systems, {{headquartered}} in Austin, Texas, {{to light the}} ride. Rob Decker, Cedar Point’s Corporate Director of Planning & Design, said that <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would have to mount multiple floodlights on the tower. However, {{they were able to}} install thirty EC-1 floodlights {{at the base of the}} lift hill structure which provided lighting throughout the ride's structure. Of the six main support towers, three had six EC-1s, and three towers had four EC-1s. The three tallest towers had another unit in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} ship began its homeward voyage Christian and his discontented {{followers}} seized Bligh and {{took control of}} the vessel. Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood was among those who remained with Bounty. Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while Bounty sailed on, ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791 Heywood and his companions were met with in Tahiti by the search vessel , and held in irons for transportation to England. Heywood and one other actually went out to the Pandora in canoes , very happy to be rescued-as <b>they</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>They</b> were then arrested and treated barbarously by the Captain, Edward Edwards, who had them and 12 others fettered and handcuffed in an 11 ft. box built for the purpose on deck. Their subsequent journey was prolonged and eventful; Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned, and Heywood himself was fortunate to survive, being the 3rd last {{to get out of the}} box, which had only an exit 18 inches sq. in the roof..|$|E
5|$|When {{his mother}} left the group, Guest moved {{back with her}} to the United Kingdom. Guest, his mother and {{stepfather}} Martin moved to north London, and he began the process of experiencing adolescence in a society different from that inside the Rajneesh movement. Guest reentered society at age 11, and faced confusion over the contrast in experiences between his childhood in the Rajneesh movement and his new experiences as a teenager in London. He enrolled in the Haverstock School in north London, but had trouble during his teen years with drugs and alcohol. He had difficult relations with his stepfather, and had not spent much time with him prior to the move to London. Anne and Martin went through a period of time where <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were beings from a different world, and read books on UFOs. Guest fostered his interest in reading, and went on to study at university.|$|E

25|$|On 27 March 1871 {{the first}} ever {{international}} match took place, involving the English rugby team and the Scottish. Scotland won the match, which was played at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh.

25|$|About 5:00a.m., Griffin's {{division}} {{was told to}} move to the left to J. Boisseau's house. Since Warren did not know Pickett had withdrawn his force, he still expected Griffin to be able to intercept them. Griffin's force moved in line of battle with great care because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> might strike the Confederate force from White Oak Road while moving toward the Crump Road. The Confederates did not attack and Warren remained with Crawford until he reached Crump Road.|$|E

25|$|Nininger's {{strategy}} was to search for meteorites in the Great Plains of the United States, where the land was largely cultivated and the soil contained few rocks. Between the late 1920s and the 1950s, he traveled across the region, educating local people about what meteorites looked like {{and what to do}} if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had found one, for example, in the course of clearing a field. The result was the discovery of over 200 new meteorites, mostly stony types.|$|E
25|$|Bakhtin's {{works and}} ideas gained {{popularity}} after his death, and he endured difficult conditions {{for much of}} his professional life, a time in which information was often seen as dangerous and therefore often hidden. As a result, the details provided now are often of uncertain accuracy. Also contributing to the imprecision of these details is the limited access to Russian archival information during Bakhtin’s life. It is only after the archives became public that scholars realized that much of what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> knew about the details of Bakhtin’s life was false or skewed largely by Bakhtin himself.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands' {{target was}} {{therefore}} 198 to win (in 36 overs), or 197 to tie. It is fair that their target was increased, {{even though they}} had the same number of overs to bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively in their first 28 overs, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralizes the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 minus& 122 = 75 runs.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} day, the inquest {{heard that the}} police {{officers}} who shot Menezes dead were 'convinced' {{at the time that}} he was a suicide bomber. In his comments, Sir Michael Wright said that the two officers thought Menezes was about to detonate a 'device' on the Tube. He took the inquest jury through the events leading up to Menezes's death, listing a number of occasions where officers were unclear whether or not <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were pursuing a bomber. The jury was told of differences between what was being relayed on radio and logged in the Scotland Yard control room and how the officers in the field were interpreting the information.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} {{illustrates that}} in the Republic the relationship between Church and State always remained problematic, {{even though it had}} seemed to be settled in favor of the church in 1619. Though the regents knew better than to interfere in matters of doctrine (as they were accused of doing in 1618), <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had certain rights of oversight in return for the privileged status of the Reformed Church. The clergy, on the other hand, had never reconciled itself to such oversight, and on the contrary was of the opinion that the Church had a right to oversee public policy. As the regents would never concede such a right there was a constant tension between the two, not least in the matter of tolerance, or rather, Toleration.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us.

They moved till reached to a remote land wherein nobody was living there and, at least, away from that mayor. This land had been dubbed Al-Mansoorah ( [...] Arabic : المنصورة) because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>they</b> won/took a licking against that mayor of which they disagreed with him and had some conflicts.

25|$|A {{change in}} market {{conditions}} {{also contributed to}} Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> needed. Borland had {{done an excellent job}} marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any sexual}} contact, extramarital sex opens the {{possibility}} of the introduction of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) into a marriage. Since most married couples do not routinely use barrier contraceptives, STDs can be introduced to a marriage partner by a spouse engaging in unprotected extramarital sex. This can be a public health issue in regions of the world where STDs are common, but addressing this issue is very difficult due to legal and social barriersto openly talk about this situation would mean to acknowledge that adultery (often) takes place, something that is taboo in certain cultures, especially those strongly influenced by religion. In addition, dealing with the issue of barrier contraception in marriage in cultures where women have very few rights is difficult: the power of women to negotiate safer sex (or sex in general) with their husbands is often limited. The World Health Organisation (WHO) found that women in violent relations were at increased risk of HIV/AIDS, because they found it very difficult to negotiate safe sex with their partners, or to ask medical advice if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> have been infected.|$|E
25|$|If {{there were}} interruption(s) during Team 1's innings, or Team 1's innings was cut short, so {{the numbers of}} overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will adjust Team 2's target score as {{described}} above. The adjustment to Team 2's target after interruptions in Team 1's innings is often an increase, implying that Team 2 has more resource available than Team 1 had. Although both teams have 10 wickets and the same (reduced) number of overs available, an increase is fair as, for some of their innings, Team 1 thought they would have more overs available than they actually ended up having. If Team 1 had known that their innings {{was going to be}} shorter, they would have batted less conservatively, and scored more runs (at the expense of more wickets). They saved some wicket resource to use up in the overs that ended up being cancelled, which Team 2 does not need to do, therefore Team 2 does have more resource to use in the same number of overs. Therefore, increasing Team 2's target score compensates Team 1 for the denial of some of the overs <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would get to bat. The increased target is what D/L thinks Team 1 would have scored in the overs it ended up having, if it had known throughout that the innings would be only as long as it was.|$|E
