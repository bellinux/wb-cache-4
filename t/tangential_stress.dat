40|$|The {{objective}} of this activity {{is to determine the}} <b>tangential</b> <b>stresses</b> of the outer shell, due to uneven thermal expansion of the inner and outer shells of the current waste package (WP) designs. Based on the results of the calculation ''Waste Package Barrier Stresses Due to Thermal Expansion'', CAL-EBS-ME- 000008 (ref. 10), only <b>tangential</b> <b>stresses</b> are considered for this calculation. The <b>tangential</b> <b>stresses</b> are significantly larger than the radial stresses associated with thermal expansion, and at the WP outer surface the radial stresses are equal to zero. The scope of this activity is limited to determining the <b>tangential</b> <b>stresses</b> the waste package outer shell is subject to due to the interference fit, produced by having two different shell coefficients of thermal expansions. The inner shell has a greater coefficient of thermal expansion than the outer shell, producing a pressure between the two shells. This calculation is associated with Waste Package Project. The calculations are performed for the 21 -PWR (pressurized water reactor), 44 -BWR (boiling water reactor), 24 -BWR, 12 -PWR Long, 5 DHLW/DOE SNF - Short (defense high-level waste/Department of Energy spent nuclear fuel), 2 -MCO/ 2 -DHLW (multi-canister overpack), and Naval SNF Long WP designs.

50|$|The {{role of the}} {{tangential}} viscous {{stress is}} essential in establishing a steady meniscus shape in flow focusing, as illustrated {{in the case of}} a simple liquid jet surrounded by a gas. In the absence of a sufficiently strong <b>tangential</b> <b>stress,</b> a round-apex meniscus is obtained. Both the inner liquid and the external gas flows would exhibit stagnation regions around the round apex. The surface tension stress σ/D would be simply balanced by an appropriate pressure jump across the interface. If one slowly pushes a liquid flow rate Q, the system would spit intermittently the excess of liquid to recover the round-apex equilibrium shape. However, when the <b>tangential</b> <b>stress</b> is sufficiently vigorous compared to σ /D, the surface can be deformed into a steady tapering shape, which allows the continuous and smooth acceleration of the liquid under the combined actions of the pressure drop ΔP and the tangential viscous stress τs on the liquid surface.|$|E

50|$|This {{demonstrates}} that {{the state in the}} contact interface is not only dependent on the relative positions of the two bodies, but also on their motion history. Another example of this occurs if the sphere is shifted back to its original position. Initially there was no <b>tangential</b> <b>stress</b> in the contact interface. After the initial shift micro-slip has occurred. This micro-slip is not entirely undone by shifting back. So in the final situation tangential stresses remain in the interface, in what looks like an identical configuration as the original one.|$|E
50|$|A further {{simplification}} occurs if the {{two bodies}} are “geometrically and elastically alike”. In general, stress inside a body in one direction induces displacements in perpendicular directions too. Consequently, there is an interaction between the normal stress and tangential displacements in the contact problem, and an interaction between the <b>tangential</b> <b>stress</b> and normal displacements. But if the normal stress in the contact interface induces the same tangential displacements in both contacting bodies, {{then there is no}} relative tangential displacement of the two surfaces. In that case, the normal and tangential contact problems are decoupled. If this is the case then the two bodies are called quasi-identical. This happens for instance if the bodies are mirror-symmetric with respect to the contact plane and have the same elastic constants.|$|E

The radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>stresses</b> and strain energy density are expressed using the Lekhnitskii-Eshelby-Stroh (LES) formalism for the plane elasticity.

30|$|According to the {{different}} features of the deformation area, the deformation area is divided into five regions named A, B, C, D and E, as shown in Figure  8.

The middle region of the flange (Region B) shows tensile <b>tangential</b> <b>stress</b> and radial stress, and the round corner (Region C) shows tensile <b>tangential</b> <b>stress</b> and compressive radial stress.

30|$|The {{tensioning}} {{stress distribution}} of {{circular saw blade}} after roll tensioning was described by Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of the tensioned region, the <b>tangential</b> tensioning <b>stress</b> is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to inside. In the exterior loop of the tensioned region, the <b>tangential</b> tensioning <b>stress</b> is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to outside. This distribution of <b>tangential</b> tensioning <b>stress</b> is not very ideal relatively. The <b>tangential</b> tensioning <b>stresses</b> of circular saw blades tensioned by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. The <b>tangential</b> tensioning <b>stress</b> outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of <b>tangential</b> tensioning <b>stress</b> produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll tensioning. However, hammer tensioning has its limitations because the hammer tensioning creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer tensioning is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure tensioning process is one kind of tensioning methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. The force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. A cyclic symmetry stress distribution and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of <b>tangential</b> tensioning <b>stress</b> is produced during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. This tensioning approach is conducive to the realization of the automatic tensioning operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{fundamental}} problem of elastic–plastic normally loaded contact between a deformable sphere and a rigid flat is analyzed under perfect slip and full stick {{conditions for a}} wide range of the sphere mechanical properties. The effect of these properties on failure inception is investigated by finding the critical interference and normal loading as well as the location of the first plastic yield or brittle failure. The analysis is based on the analytical Hertz solution under frictionless slip condition and on a numerical solution under stick condition. The failure inception is determined by using either the von Mises criterion of plastic yield or the maximum tensile stress criterion of brittle failure. For small values of the Poisson’s ratio the behavior in stick, when high <b>tangential</b> <b>stresses</b> prevail in the contact interface, is much different than in slip.
