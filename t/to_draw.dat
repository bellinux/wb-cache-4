5|$|Sasuke {{was also}} the most {{difficult}} character for Kishimoto <b>to</b> <b>draw.</b> He felt that his drawings tended to make Sasuke look too old, {{a result of his}} inexperience in drawing younger characters mature beyond their years.

Midway through Part I, Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke featuring a number of belts strapped around his arms and legs, but because it took too long <b>to</b> <b>draw,</b> he returned to Sasuke's original costume design. Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke, he has become his favorite character <b>to</b> <b>draw.</b> He ranked Sasuke alongside Sakura in terms of drawing difficulty. In some cases, his superiors even asked Kishimoto to redraw parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well.|$|E
