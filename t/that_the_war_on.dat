5|$|Meanwhile, Robert Wakefield (Douglas), a {{conservative}} Ohio judge, is appointed {{to head the}} President's Office of National Drug Control Policy, taking on the title drug czar. Robert is warned by his predecessor (Brolin) and several influential politicians <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Drugs is unwinnable. Robert's daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin which quickly develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital. As Robert and his wife Barbara (Irving) struggle {{to deal with the}} problem, Robert discovers that Barbara has known about their daughter's involvement with drugs for over six months.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Begg {{was interviewed}} {{in the video}} 21st Century CrUSAders, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terrorism is really akin to a war against Islam. According to Gareth Peirce, {{possession}} of this film has been offered in British courts as evidence of radicalisation.|$|E
25|$|Fritz Todt {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} on 8 February 1942, shortly after a meeting with Hitler in East Prussia. Todt had become {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> the eastern front could not be won and thought himself independent enough to say as much to Hitler. As a result, there has been some speculation that Todt's death was a covert assassination, but this has never been substantiated.|$|E

500|$|Robert drags Seth {{along as}} he begins to search Cincinnati for his daughter. After a drug dealer who is prostituting Caroline refuses to reveal her whereabouts, Robert breaks into a seedy hotel room and finds a semi-conscious Caroline {{in the company of}} an older man. He breaks down in tears as Seth quietly leaves. Robert returns to Washington, D.C., to give his {{prepared}} speech on a [...] "10-point plan" [...] to win the war on drugs. In the middle of the speech, he falters as he realizes how futile this all is, then tells the press <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Drugs implies a war even on some people's own family members, which he cannot endorse. He then walks out of the press conference and takes a taxi to the airport. Robert and Barbara go to Narcotics Anonymous meetings with their daughter to support her and others.|$|E
500|$|Journalism {{lecturer}} David Blackall of the University of Wollongong reviewed Chomsky's {{book for}} the Asia Pacific Media Educator. He noted that it would polarize readers between those whose anti-imperialist beliefs would be reinforced and those who would denounce Chomsky's ideas as conspiracy theories. He thought the book was important in reminding readers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror was keeping the US public in fear and was ensuring an ongoing international market for weaponry. However, he thought that there were [...] "recurring attribution problems" [...] in Chomsky's text, for instance by referring to the international press {{as if it were}} a homogeneous entity with a single point of view. Ultimately, he thought that the book had something to teach educators of journalism: that [...] "hen there is a desire of the power elite to move on an issue, and the population is generally opposed, then the issue is removed from the political arena and from the news media priorities – distraction being a primary method." ...|$|E
500|$|Coke {{also brought}} {{up the issue of}} hunting game. During the late 18th century a series of laws were passed {{protecting}} a landowner's right to hunt, and giving severe penalties to poachers. On 27 February Coke, an enthusiastic hunter, suggested in Parliament that these laws be relaxed; [...] "Combinations had been formed in the Country against the execution of these laws and some lives had been lost". Before any motion could be brought (it was not until 1827 that the laws were revised), the situation in America came up again. On 22 February, Henry Seymour Conway brought a motion asking the King to [...] "listen to the humble prayer and advice of his faithful Commons, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> the continent of North America may no longer be pursued for the impractical purpose of reducing the inhabitants of that country to obedience by force". While the motion failed, it was again brought on 27 February, and passed. With this, Conway moved that [...] "An humble address be presented to His Majesty"; George III replied that he would see them on 3 March at St James's Palace. It was then that [...] "the most important and symbolic act of Coke's political career" [...] occurred. As a Knight of the Shire, Coke had the right to appear in court dressed [...] "in his boots" [...] as opposed to in formal court dress; this he did, appearing in front of George III dressed in leather breeches, boots and spurs.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Amnesty International (AI) opined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> {{drugs is}} [...] "a myth", stating {{that members of}} Colombian {{security}} forces worked closely with paramilitaries, landlords and narco-traffickers to target political opposition, community leaders, human rights and health workers, union activists, students, and peasants. Amnesty International reported that [...] "almost every Colombian military unit that Amnesty implicated in murdering civilians two years ago [...] was doing so with U.S.-supplied weapons".|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{there is}} {{considerable}} legal debate about the impact these laws have had on Americans' civil rights. Critics claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Drugs has lowered the evidentiary burden required for a legal search of a suspect's dwelling or vehicle, or to intercept a suspect's communications. [...] However, many of the searches that result in drug arrests are often [...] "commissions" [...] to search a person or the person's property.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 February 2015, Iraq's Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> ISIL was {{effectively}} ‘World War III’, due to ISIL's proclamation of a worldwide caliphate, [...] {{it also aims}} to conquer the world, and its success in spreading the conflict to multiple countries outside of the Levant region. Speaking of ISIL's destruction of pre-Islamic sites in the region, Syria's head of antiquities, Maamoun Abdul Karim, stated that [...] "this is the entire world's battle." ...|$|E

50|$|A Harvard economist, Jeffrey Miron, {{estimated}} <b>that</b> ending <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> drugs would inject 76.8 {{billion dollars}} into the US economy in 2010 alone.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} granted in 2002 to the then {{editor-in-chief of the}} monthly Letras Libres, Ricardo Cayuela Gally, Kapuściński opined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> terror, owing to the asymmetrical character of the combatants engaged in it, could only be wonand indeed easily, within a monththrough a (re)introduction of [...] "Stalinism", a method undesirable for the sole reason that it would leave the world under the permanent [...] "hegemony" [...] of the United States, a circumstance that would spell the end of [...] "the free society".|$|E
2500|$|Farage {{takes an}} anti-prohibitionist {{position}} on recreational drugs. In an April 2014 phone-in interview hosted by The Daily Telegraph he argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Drugs {{had been lost}} [...] "many, many years ago", stating that [...] "I hate drugs, I've never taken them myself, I hope I never do, but I just {{have a feeling that}} the criminalisation of all these drugs is actually not really helping British society." [...] He argued in favour of a Royal Commission on drugs exploring all avenues as how to most effectively legislate on drugs and deal with their related criminal and public health problems, including the possibility of their legalisation.|$|E
2500|$|Author Doug Stokes {{claims that}} there is a major {{discrepancy}} between the U.S. [...] "stated goals of US policy and the actual targets and effects" [...] of the war on drugs in Colombia, arguing that U.S. military assistance has been primarily directed at fighting the FARC and ELN guerrillas despite the fact that past CIA and DEA reports have identified the insurgents as minor players in the drug trade. Stokes proposes a revisionist continuity theory: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> drugs is a pre-text and this war, just as the Cold War that preceded it and the War on Terror that followed it, was mainly about Northern Hemisphere competition to control and exploit Southern Hemisphere natural resources. In other words, [...] "the maintenance of a world capitalist order conducive to US economic interests." [...] As this competition for third world resources has continued even {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, there would be continuity in US foreign policy.|$|E

2500|$|Others {{have also}} {{suggested}} that press coverage contributed to a public confused and misinformed on both the nature and level of {{the threat to the}} U.S. posed by terrorism. In his book, Trapped in the War on Terror political scientist Ian S. Lustick, claimed, [...] "The media have given constant attention to possible terrorist-initiated catastrophes and to the failures and weaknesses of the government's response." [...] Lustick alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror is disconnected from the real but remote threat terrorism poses and that the generalized War on Terror began as part of the justification for invading Iraq, but then took {{on a life of its}} own, fueled by media coverage. Scott Atran writes that [...] "publicity is the oxygen of terrorism" [...] and the rapid growth of international communicative networks renders publicity even more potent, with the result that [...] "perhaps never in the history of human conflict have so few people with so few actual means and capabilities frightened so many." ...|$|E
2500|$|According {{to former}} Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico and César Gaviria of Colombia, the United States-led drug war is pushing Latin America into a {{downward}} spiral; Mr. Cardoso {{said in a}} conference that [...] "the available evidence indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> drugs is a failed war". The panel of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy commission, headed by Cardoso, stated that the countries involved in this war should remove the [...] "taboos" [...] and re-examine the anti-drug programs. Latin American governments have followed {{the advice of the}} U.S. to combat the drug war, but the policies had little effect. The commission made some recommendations to United States President Barack Obama to consider new policies, such as decriminalization of marijuana and to treat drug use as a public health problem and not as a security problem. The Council on Hemispheric Affairs states it is time to seriously consider drug decriminalization and legalization, a policy initiative that would be in direct opposition to the interests of criminal gangs.|$|E
60|$|It was, however, {{previously}} to this {{cessation of}} activity, that the Commissioners of the United Colonies, {{as they were}} called, met to devise the means of a concerted resistance. Unlike their former dangers from the same quarter, it was manifest, by {{the manner in which}} a hostile feeling was spreading around their whole frontier, that a leading spirit had given as much of unity and design to the movements of the foe, as could probably ever be created among a people so separated by distance and so divided in communities. Right or wrong, the Colonists gravely decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> their part was just. Great preparations were therefore made to carry it on, the ensuing summer, in a manner more suited to their means, and to the absolute necessities of their situation. It was in consequence of the arrangements made for bringing a portion of the inhabitants of the Colony of Connecticut into the field, that we find the principal characters of our legend in the warlike guise in which they have just been re-introduced to the reader.|$|E

60|$|In their fortune {{there has}} been some fluctuation. We are to see how their minds have been {{affected}} with a change. Some impression it made on them, undoubtedly. It produced some oblique notice of the submissions that were made by suppliant nations. The utmost they did was to make some of those cold, formal, general professions of a love of peace which no power has ever refused to make, because they mean little and cost nothing. The first paper I have seen (the publication at Hamburg) making a show of that pacific disposition discovered a rooted animosity against this nation, and an incurable rancor, even more than any one of their hostile acts. In this Hamburg declaration they choose to suppose <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>on</b> the part of England, is a war of government, begun and carried on against the sense and interests of the people,--thus sowing in their very overtures towards peace the seeds of tumult and sedition: for they never have abandoned, and never will they abandon, in peace, in war, in treaty, in any situation, or for one instant, their old, steady maxim of separating the people from their government. Let me add, (and it is with unfeigned anxiety for the character and credit of ministers that I do add,) if our government perseveres in its as uniform course of acting under instruments with such preambles, it pleads guilty to the charges made by our enemies against it, both on its own part and on the part of Parliament itself. The enemy must succeed in his plan for loosening and disconnecting all the internal holdings of the kingdom.|$|E
