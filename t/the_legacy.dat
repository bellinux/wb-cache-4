5|$|On the August 10 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H met with Michaels at an office {{cafeteria}} in Texas where Michaels {{was working as}} a chef; throughout the show, Triple H tried to convince Michaels to return to WWE from hiatus. After several incidents (including grease grill burgers on fire and Michaels shouting at a little girl), Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face <b>The</b> <b>Legacy</b> at SummerSlam, superkicked the girl, and quit his chef job. On the August 17 episode of Raw, Triple H and Michaels officially reunited as DX, but {{as they were in the}} process of their in-ring promo, <b>The</b> <b>Legacy</b> attacked them both. Their first match after reuniting was against <b>The</b> <b>Legacy</b> at SummerSlam, which they won. At Breaking Point, however, they lost to <b>The</b> <b>Legacy</b> in the first ever Submissions Count Anywhere match in WWE history.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Legacy</b> was a villainous {{alliance}} {{in the professional}} wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), that competed on its Raw brand from 2008 to 2010. Originally, <b>The</b> <b>Legacy</b> was a group led by Randy Orton that contained the tag team of Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase. Two other wrestlers, Manu and Sim Snuka, were affiliated with the faction prior to its official formation. The concept behind the group was that each member was a multi-generational wrestler. The name <b>The</b> <b>Legacy</b> was a reference to their extensive family histories in wrestling.|$|E
5|$|After Adamle {{stepped down}} as General Manager, Stephanie soon became {{in charge of the}} brand and (reignited her feud) and had altercations with Chris Jericho in the {{following}} weeks, which involved her firing him (although he was later reinstated). After her father Vince returned, the family began a feud with Randy Orton, who began the storyline by punting Vince in the head. After a few weeks of feuding, Orton and his alliance, <b>The</b> <b>Legacy,</b> punted Shane in the head and performed an RKO on McMahon. Following the attack, he was chased out of the ring by Triple H, who is her real-life husband. The rivalry between Orton, <b>The</b> <b>Legacy</b> and The Mcmahons heated up when Orton attacked and kissed Stephanie. Triple H and <b>the</b> <b>Legacy</b> rivalry continued at WrestleMania XXV, where Triple H defended the WWE Championship against Orton. The following month, Orton won the championship at Backlash. After Backlash McMahon left Raw and took a hiatus from WWE television.|$|E

40|$|The {{awarding}} of the 2010 FIFA World Cup to South Africa was an historic moment {{for all of}} Africa as football’s biggest event travelled to the continent for the first time. This study, set five years on, seeks to identify <b>the</b> <b>legacies</b> left by <b>the</b> construction of two new stadiums in Durban and Cape Town. As part of the EU-funded CARNiVAL project, which seeks to investigate <b>the</b> <b>legacies</b> and impacts of hosting such events, {{interviews were conducted with}} key stakeholders involved in <b>the</b> planning of <b>legacies</b> in <b>the</b> two cities. Using Chappelet and Junod’s (2006) framework to analyse <b>the</b> <b>legacies,</b> this study found that Durban and Cape Town have used different strategies to leverage <b>the</b> <b>legacies</b> with differing results. Yet, both stadiums have suffered from the same issue; a seeming lack of need for two stadiums with capacities over 54, 000, for domestic sport leagues which average fewer than 10, 000 spectator...|$|R
