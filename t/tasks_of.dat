40|$|The present {{research}} diachronically examines {{the development of}} orthographically correct writing in students of all grades of Primary School, {{as well as its}} relationship with the phonological and morphosyntactic awareness. The correlation of the above variables with various factors, was, still, investigated, such as intelligence, but also the child’s attending school and the parent’s educational and economic level. In the investigation 240 students who were attending the six grades of Primary School took part, 55, 8 % (134 students) of the sample consisted of students attending the 1 st Primary School in Schimatari, whereas 44, 2 % (106 students) are students of the Primary School in Oinofita. The students participated in the first, the second and the third measurement. Participants in the investigation were, also, the children’s parents. 32, 9 % of fathers 24, 5 $ of mothers have graduated from Highest Educational Institutes – Technological Educational Institutes. 34, 2 % (76) of fathers and 43, 2 %(95) of mothers had a certificate of Senior High School. For the evaluation of the children’s orthographic ability eight tasks were used: a) Misspelled text, b) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictation words with a common stem, c) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictating sentences with derivative words <b>of</b> the previous <b>task,</b> d) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictating words a common suffix, e) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictating sentences with derivative words <b>of</b> the previous <b>task,</b> f) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> choosing right or wrong word, g) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictating words (simple and compound), and h) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictating sentences with derivative pseudowords of the words <b>of</b> the previous <b>task.</b> The phonological awareness was also evaluated with the following tasks: a) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> recognizing the rhyme, b) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> distinguishing common beginning middle or ending syllable, c) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> recognizing common beginning – ending phoneme, d) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> syllabic segmentation e) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> phonemic segmentation, f) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> deletion of beginning, middle, ending syllable, g) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> deletion of beginning or ending phoneme, and h) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> substitution of beginning phoneme. 9 For the morphosyntactic awareness of the student’s five tests were used: a) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> evaluation of grammatically – correction and explanation of grammatically incorrect sentences, b) Berko’s test (<b>Task</b> <b>of</b> derivative morphology), c) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> sentence analogy and d) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> words in mixed order for the construction of sentences. The level of the student’s intelligence was investigated with the Greek WISC – III (Georgas, Paraskevopoulos, Bezeveghis, & Giannitsas, 1997). The parent’s questionnaire contained questions regarding: a) their educational and economic level, b) The child’s study environment (library, place of study), c) Their occupation with the child’s study. Main finding of the study was the ascertainment that the orthographic awareness has a developmental character while the children cover various stages of acquiring, understanding and dealing with the rules of correct writing. Still a clear relationship among the three skills of language awareness, orthographically correct writing, phonological awareness and morphosyntactic knowledge. However the relation among them is not linear {{in the sense that the}} ability of orthographically correct writing connects also with other factors, such as intelligence, the parent’s educational level but also the attending school. ...|$|R

5|$|Cromwell {{did much}} work through his many offices {{to remove the}} <b>tasks</b> <b>of</b> {{government}} from the Royal Household (and ideologically from the personal body of the King) and into a public state. He did so, however, in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants, not least because he needed to retain Henry's support, his own power, {{and the possibility of}} actually achieving the plan he set out. Cromwell made the various income streams put in place by Henry VII more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration. The role of the King's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council, much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor. A difference emerged between the financial health of the king, and that of the country, although Cromwell's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy, which required his hand to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending that strained relations as well as finances. Cromwell's reforms ground to a halt in 1539, the initiative lost, and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act, the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539.
