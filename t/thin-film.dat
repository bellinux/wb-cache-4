The precursors were annealed in a furnace with Se metals at 590 °C for 20  minutes. The final {{composition of the}} CZTSSe <b>thin-films</b> was of Cu/(Zn[*]+[*]Sn)[*]~[*] 0.88 and Zn/Sn[*]~[*] 1.05, with a metal S/Se ratio estimated at ~ 0.05.

Kelvin probe force microscopy was used to identify the local potential difference that varied according to the thickness of the NaF layer on the CZTSSe <b>thin-films.</b> The potential values at the grain boundaries were observed to increase as the NaF thickness increased. Moreover, the ratio of the positively charged GBs in the CZTSSe <b>thin-films</b> with an NaF layer was higher than that of pure CZTSSe <b>thin-films.</b> A positively charged potential was observed around the grain boundaries of the CZTSSe <b>thin-films,</b> which is a beneficial characteristic that can improve the performance of a device.|$|R

40|$|Bimetallic <b>thin-films</b> {{offer the}} ability of {{producing}} analog grayscale photomasks with OD ranging from ~ 3. 0 OD (unexposed) to < 0. 22 OD (fully exposed). Recent developments have yielded the ability to deposit and pattern bimetallic <b>thin-films</b> on pre-patterned binary Chrome masks. Care is taken to ensure that when writing the grayscale pattern that the underlying Chrome layer is not affected. Through this technique, the advantages of analog grayscale {{can be added to}} the high resolution capabilities currently available with Chrome masks. Currently the optical characteristics of bimetallic <b>thin-films</b> limit their effectiveness in high resolution applications. Techniques designed to minimize defects in the uniformity of <b>thin-films</b> after laser exposure are investigated along with different methods of performing the raster-scanning of the photomask patterns. Also discussed is a new application of bimetallic <b>thin-films</b> as a beam-shaping mask. Characterizing the laser beam profile for our writing system, a grayscale mask is designed and tested in an attempt to modify the Gaussian beam profile of the laser into a more uniform flat-top profile. Obtaining a flatter laser power distribution for the writing laser would assist in improving the optical characteristics of the bimetallic <b>thin-films</b> since the primary cause for the photomask’s gray level non-uniformities is the Gaussian nature of the laser beam’s power distribution causing lines on the photomasks. A flatter profile is shown to eliminate these lines and allow for more uniform gray levels on the laser-exposed bimetallic <b>thin-films...</b>|$|R
5|$|Indium {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some indium compounds, such as indium {{antimonide}} and indium phosphide, are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as the semiconductor dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature transistors and InP for high-temperature transistors. The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. Indium is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation <b>thin-film</b> solar cell. Indium is used in PNP bipolar junction transistors with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E
5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating <b>thin-film</b> microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E
5|$|In {{animals such as}} on the {{feathers}} of birds and the scales of butterflies, interference is created by a range of photonic mechanisms, including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some cuts of meat also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue {{is found in the}} marble berries of Pollia condensata, where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces Bragg's law scattering of light. The bright gloss of buttercups is produced by <b>thin-film</b> reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.|$|E

5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a <b>thin-film</b> structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in <b>thin-film</b> PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E

The W 03 <b>thin-films</b> are polycristalline structures with dominant planes (200).

25|$|There are two {{separate}} causes of optical effects due to coatings, often called thick-film and <b>thin-film</b> effects. Thick-film effects arise {{because of the}} difference in the index of refraction between the layers above and below the coating (or film); in the simplest case, these three layers are the air, the coating, and the glass. Thick-film coatings do not depend on how thick the coating is, so long as the coating is much thicker than a wavelength of light. <b>Thin-film</b> effects arise when the thickness of the coating is approximately the same as a quarter or a half a wavelength of light. In this case, the reflections of a steady source of light can be made to add destructively and hence reduce reflections by a separate mechanism. In addition to depending very much on the thickness of the film and the wavelength of light, <b>thin-film</b> coatings depend on the angle at which the light strikes the coated surface.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a {{continuous}} rollforming {{process for the}} folding of <b>thin-films</b> was proposed and studied as a key step in the continuous manufacturing of pharmaceutical tablets.

An experimental apparatus was designed and developed to test the folding of <b>thin-films.</b> The experimental apparatus was designed in a modular fashion to facilitate testing of various process parameters. Analysis was carried out for the folding operations, based on which two folding strategies were proposed - (i) without scoring and (ii) with scoring. The first strategy relies on elastic deformation of the <b>thin-films,</b> whereas the later depends on localized, plastic deformation caused by the scoring geometry. From the experiments on folding we identified three regimes of process operation namely: insufficient scoring, appropriate scoring, and excessive scoring. The implications of different levels of scoring were observed and understood carefully for the scoring and folding operation.
