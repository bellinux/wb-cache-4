The flow sensor is microfabricated in a three step process: (a) micro heater and thermocouple fabrication, (b) microchannel fabrication and (c) system integration. The micro flow sensor was characterized using a mixture of 50 % methanol and 50 % water. The flow rate in the microchannel was controlled using a syringe pump. The sensor was calibrated using a pulse heat input. The {{results show that the}} sensor was sensitive for flow in the range 0. 5 µl/min to 0. 7 ml/min...|$|E

The conference was organised by Brunel University and supported by the Italian Union of Thermofluiddynamics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, University of Thessaly, IPEM, the Process Intensification Network, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Heat Transfer Society, HEXAG - the Heat Exchange Action Group, and the Energy Institute.
