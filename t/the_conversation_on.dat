25|$|Looking {{into the}} new millennium, <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> a National level turned {{to the role of}} {{religion}} in ritual. In 1968, Theta Phi opened its doors to women of all faith and replaced the crucifix used in ritual to a cross. In 1988, there was discussion of removing the cross in ritual. The discussion was tabled during convention but it was decided that the cross would have a less prominent role in ritual In 1990, Theta Phi Alpha surveyed the sisters about the Catholic influences in the ritual. The most positive response was to adjusting the ritual to match the current views of the national fraternity, while the most negative response was to removing all references to God in the ritual. This dissonance between the sisters is still discussed today. However, Theta Phi Alpha is slowly removing religious aspects, in 1990 the Lord's Prayer was removed from the ritual. In 1992, the Theta Phi Alpha Prayer was removedand the following year a less religious ritual for deceased members and a nonreligious national philanthropy, The House that Theta Phi Alpha Built were introduced.|$|E

500|$|Jim calls Wallace {{to pitch}} for the CEO {{to invest in}} Athlead. Dwight puts <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> speaker phone, {{allowing}} him to hear Wallace first tell Jim his salary {{is going to be}} cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoot down the idea of investing in Athlead. Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim. Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they [...] "haze the new guy", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap. It is also hinted that Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the boom mike operator for the documentary crew, has developed a crush on Pam.|$|E
2500|$|In CIA {{interviews}} {{long after}} the war ended, Helms recalled the role he played in policy discussions. He was the neutral party who {{could come up with}} facts applicable to the issue at hand. The benefit of such a role was that he could be decisive in [...] "keeping the game honest". Helms comments that many advocates of particular policy positions will almost invariably 'cherry pick' facts supporting their positions, whether consciously or not. Then the voice of a neutral could perform a useful function in helping to steer <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> routes within realistic parameters.|$|E
