40|$|In {{this paper}} we measure the angular power spectra C_ℓ of three high-redshift {{large-scale}} structure probes: the radio sources from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the quasar catalogue of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Release Six (SDSS DR 6 QSOs) and the MegaZ-LRG (DR 7), the final SDSS II Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) photometric redshift survey. We perform a global {{analysis of the}} constraints on the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity from these angular power spectra, {{as well as from}} their cross-correlation power spectra with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature map. In particular, we include non-Gaussianity of the type arising from single-field slow roll, multifields, curvaton (local type), and those which effects on the halo clustering can be described by the equilateral <b>template</b> (<b>related</b> to higher-order derivative type non-Gaussianity) and by the enfolded <b>template</b> (<b>related</b> to modified initial state or higher-derivative interactions).

40|$|General-purpose {{microprocessors}} augmented with SIMD execution units enhance multimedia applications {{by exploiting}} data level parallelism. However, supporting /overhead <b>related</b> <b>instructions</b> (instructions necessary {{to feed the}} SIMD execution units such as address generation, packing/unpacking, permute, loads/stores, and loop branches) dominate media instruction streams accounting for 75 - 85 % of the dynamic instructions. This leads to an under-utilization of SIMD execution units resulting in a throughput that ranges between 1 - 12 % of the peak throughput. We accelerate multimedia applications by providing explicit hardware support to eliminate or reduce {{the impact of the}} supporting/overhead <b>related</b> <b>instructions.</b> Performance evaluation shows that such hardware can significantly improve performance over conventional SIMD enhanced general-purpose processors (1. 05 x to 28 x). In this paper, we investigate the cost of incorporating hardware, for efficient execution of supporting /overhead <b>related</b> <b>instructions,</b> into a high-speed SIMD enhanced general-purpose processor and perform area, power, and timing tradeoffs. Our results indicate that [...] the added hardware requires less than 10 % SIMD execution units' chip area and 0. 3 % overall chip area, and power consumption is less than 1 % of the total processor power. This is achieved without elongating the critical path of the processor.

The proposed VMHI template handles successfully shortcomings of existing spatiotemporal <b>templates</b> <b>related</b> to motion self -occlusion and speed. Therefore, VMHI allows for interactive visualization, as well as quantification of motion performance. This study focuses on the analysis of sway and speed-related abnormalities, which are among the most common motion irregularities in the studied set of human actions. </p...|$|R
