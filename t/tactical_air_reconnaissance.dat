25|$|The Skywarrior {{is one of}} {{only two}} U.S. Navy attack {{aircraft}} intended as a strategic bomber to enter full-scale service (the other being its predecessor, the North American AJ Savage). The carrier-based supersonic North American A-5 Vigilante was also originally designed for strategic nuclear strike missions and initially, very briefly, supplanted the A-3 in that role beginning in the early 1960s. However, with the removal of aircraft carriers from the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), the realization that very high altitude penetration of the Soviet Union was no longer feasible, and the transfer of the U.S. Navy's strategic nuclear deterrence mission to the Fleet Ballistic Missile submarine force, the Vigilante saw its mission changed to carrier-based <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance.</b>|$|E

He later served as the operations officer of a fighter-interceptor squadron in Knoxville, Tennessee, before being promoted to commander of a fighter squadron at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. During the Vietnam War, Butterfield commanded a squadron of low and medium-level combat <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> aircraft. He flew 98 combat missions, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1965 and 1966, Butterfield served as the military assistant to the special assistant to the Secretary of Defense, where he became a friend of Alexander Haig. He also gained extensive experience working at the White House, where he spent half his time. He advanced to the rank of Colonel, and beginning in 1967, was serving in Australia as the F-111 project officer; representative for the commander-in-chief of the Pacific forces; and senior U.S. military representative.|$|E

5|$|On 26 March 1969, four partner nations– United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, {{agreed to}} form a {{multinational}} company, Panavia Aircraft GmbH, to develop and manufacture the MRCA.

Various concepts, including alternative fixed-wing and single-engine designs, were studied while defining the aircraft.
