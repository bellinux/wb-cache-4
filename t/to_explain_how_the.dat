Although many biochemical changes are known {{to occur in the}} brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E

40|$|Postcolonial {{theory has}} a people problem. By this, I am unabashedly {{suggesting}} that postcolonial theoreticians’ overemphasis on people {{as the site}} of analysis {{lies at the heart of}} the limitations of the field’s key terms, epistemological boundaries, and approach to understanding phenomena as a whole. Indeed, if postcolonial theory and its related concepts and methods are to have any intellectual purchase, then it is time to abandon its anthropocentric approach <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> world works and suggesting how to right humanity’s wrongs in favor of perspectives which acknowledge the solidarity of things and the non-hierarchical nature of life...|$|R

Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment was uninterested in it. Lovelace's notes even had <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.

25|$|The Pancaratra texts {{present the}} Vyuhas theory of avatars <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> {{absolute}} reality (Brahman) manifests into material form of ever changing reality (Vishnu avatar). Vasudeva, state the Pancaratra texts, {{goes through a}} series of emanations, where new avatars of him appear. This theory of avatar formation syncretically integrates the theories of evolution of matter and life developed by the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. These texts also present cosmology, methods of worship, tantra, Yoga and principles behind the design and building of Vaishnava temples (Mandira nirmana). These texts have guided religiosity and temple ceremonies in many Vaishnava communities, particularly in South India.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} unite his {{theories}} about the soul and how it operated within the body, he adapted {{the theory of the}} pneuma, which he used <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> soul operated within its assigned organs, and how those organs, in turn, interacted together. Galen then distinguished the vital pneuma, in the arterial system, from the psychic pneuma, in the brain and nervous system. Galen placed the vital pneuma in the heart and the psychic pneuma within the brain. He conducted many anatomical studies on animals, most famously an ox, to study the transition from vital to psychic pneuma. Although highly criticized for comparing animal anatomy to human anatomy, Galen was convinced that his knowledge was abundant enough in both anatomies to base one on the other.|$|E
25|$|In 1735, in Leipzig, he {{published}} a three-volume work, Opera philosophica et mineralis ("Philosophical and mineralogical works") {{in which he}} tried to conjoin philosophy and metallurgy. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on {{the analysis of the}} smelting of iron and copper, and it was the work that gave Swedenborg his international reputation. The same year, he also published the small manuscript de Infinito ("On the Infinite") in which he attempted <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> finite is related to the infinite and how the soul is connected to the body. It was the first manuscript in which he touched upon such matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies since he presented the view that the soul is based on material substances. He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time such as John Locke, Christian von Wolff, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Descartes and earlier thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and Augustine of Hippo.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the books}} Ellis wrote after inventing REBT had a strong autobiographical element. He used anecdotes from his {{personal}} life <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> insights of REBT occurred to him and how they helped him cope with personal problems such as shyness, anger and chronic illness. He also used anecdotes from client sessions to illustrate how his therapy worked. Two of Ellis last books were explicitly autobiographical. Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me -- It Can Work for You (Prometheus Books, 2004) recounts his early life and crises in an unusually candid way. It illustrates the way he handled his problems, at first through philosophy, and later {{through the application of}} his emerging therapeutic skills and insights. All Out!: An Autobiography (Prometheus Books, 2009) —published after his death—is a more traditional narrative of his life and work (though it also meant to be an inspirational story of the use of rational thinking in self-help).|$|E

This paper {{introduces}} the NooJ module for the Wolof {{language and the}} implemented electronic dictionary. the linguistic resources used are common usage dictionaries including Arame Fall’s and Jean Léopold Diouf’s dictionaries, {{as well as the}} Wolof lexicon available at CLAD (Centre de linguistique Appliquée de Dakar). The present work will first focus on the socio-linguistic situation of the Wolof language while describing its alphabet before, in a second part, introducing the complex morphology of this language. The third part will be devoted <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> core of the dictionary has been constructed and describing the flexional and derivation rules used to implement it in NooJ. Finally, the first results achieved with NooJ will be presented...|$|R
