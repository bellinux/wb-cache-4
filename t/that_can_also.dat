5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E

The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of seaborgium have been reported with atomic masses 258–267, 269, and 271, three of which, seaborgium-261, 263, and 265, have known metastable states. All of these decay only through alpha decay and spontaneous fission, with the single exception of seaborgium-261 <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> undergo electron capture to dubnium-261.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean Greeks {{introduced}} several {{innovations in}} the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language and their religion already included several deities <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be found in the Olympic Pantheon. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax.|$|E

5|$|Another factor <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism {{is in front of}} the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass also {{contribute to}} the dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{produced}} art {{to serve}} functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were {{developed during the}} Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change. These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The Narmer Palette, for example, displays figures <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be read as hieroglyphs. Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.|$|E

25|$|Bektashis {{hold that}} the Qur'an has {{two levels of}} meaning: an outer (Zāher ظاهر) and an inner (bāṭen باطن).
