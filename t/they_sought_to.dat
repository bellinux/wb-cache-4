5|$|As the Angolan Civil War {{began to}} take on a {{diplomatic}} component, in addition to a military one, two key Savimbi allies, The Conservative Caucus' Howard Phillips and the Heritage Foundation's Michael Johns visited Savimbi in Angola, where <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> persuade Savimbi to come to the United States in the spring of 1989 to help the Conservative Caucus, the Heritage Foundation and other conservatives in making the case for continued U.S. aid to UNITA.|$|E
5|$|The resounding Australian {{victories}} {{gave the}} England selectors many problems as <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> find a combination that could challenge the tourists' superiority. As a result, England used 21 players in all, while Australia only used 15, {{one of which}} was forced by injury. Australia had ten players who competed in four or more Tests, while England only had seven such players.|$|E
5|$|The second {{follow-up}} study {{was done in}} 1998 by Kitayama and Uchida. <b>They</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> investigate {{the relationship between a}} person's name-letter effect and his or her birthday-number effect, given that Kitayama and Karasawa had suspected a single driving force behind both. As they had predicted, Kitayama and Uchida found that within a person the two effects were correlated. Later studies confirmed this finding.|$|E

5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{their own}} recording studio, the duo immediately {{started working on}} new material and assimilated themselves with music recording and studio equipment, as <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> become more ambitious artists and less dependent on other producers. The two also became more accustomed to playing live, particularly Big Boi, and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana. Having dropped out months before graduation, André 3000 also returned to high school to earn his diploma during the recording of ATLiens.|$|E
5|$|Later on that day, a deserter {{from the}} Persian fleet, a Greek called Scyllias, swam into the Allied camp. He brought {{bad news for}} the Allies — whilst most of the Persian fleet was {{undergoing}} repairs, the Persians had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of Euboea, to block the escape route of the Allied fleet. The Persians did not want to attack the Allies yet, because they thought the Allies would simply flee, and so <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> trap them. The Allies resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent being trapped, though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians becoming aware of their plans.|$|E
5|$|Operating {{through a}} cell structure, MK planned {{to carry out}} acts of {{sabotage}} that would exert maximum pressure on the government with minimum casualties; <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> bomb military installations, power plants, telephone lines, and transport links at night, when civilians were not present. Mandela stated that they chose sabotage {{because it was the}} least harmful action, did not involve killing, and offered the best hope for racial reconciliation afterwards; he nevertheless acknowledged that should this have failed then guerrilla warfare might have been necessary. Soon after ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, MK publicly announced its existence with 57 bombings on Dingane's Day (16 December) 1961, followed by further attacks on New Year's Eve.|$|E

5|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} Stone Rollin at Blakeslee Recording Company, his {{recording studio}} complex in Los Angeles, California. He spent approximately one year {{working on the}} album, including writing its music and lyrics. He worked on the album's production with recording engineer and long-time collaborator Charles Brungardt. The two shared an interest in collecting vintage musical gear and studying historic recording techniques, which they had applied in recording The Way I See It. However, for Stone Rollin, <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> eschew its predecessor's Motown aesthetic for a more eclectic style, in keeping with Saadiq's other musical projects.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Adams {{emerged as}} an {{important}} public figure in Boston soon after the British Empire's victory in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). The British Parliament found itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue, and <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> directly tax the colonies of British America for the first time. This tax dispute {{was part of a}} larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{obtained a}} land patent from the London Virginia Company in June 1619. They had declined {{the opportunity to}} settle south of Cape Cod in New Netherland because of their desire to avoid the Dutch influence. This land patent allowed them to settle {{at the mouth of}} the Hudson River. <b>They</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> finance their venture through the Merchant Adventurers, a group of businessmen who principally viewed the colony as a means of making a profit. Upon arriving in America, the Pilgrims began working to repay their debts.|$|E

5|$|The king's uncle Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, and Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, {{became known}} as the Lords Appellant when <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> impeach five of the king's favourites and {{restrain}} what was increasingly seen as tyrannical and capricious rule. Later they were joined by Henry Bolingbroke, the son and heir of John of Gaunt, and Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk. Initially, they were successful in establishing a commission to govern England for one year, but they were forced to rebel against Richard, defeating an army under Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, at the skirmish of Radcot Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The romantic {{nationalism}} that Tod espoused {{was used}} by Indian nationalist writers, especially those from the 1850s, as <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> resist British control of the country. Works such as Jyotirindranath Tagore's Sarojini ba Chittor Akrama and Girishchandra Ghosh's Ananda Raho retold Tod's vision of the Rajputs in a manner to further their cause. Other works which drew their story from Tod's works include Padmini Upakhyan (1858) by Rangalal Banerjee and Krishna Kumari (1861) by Michael Madhusudan Dutt.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen {{to live in the}} dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as well because <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis.|$|E
5000|$|Jane Burden first {{appears as}} a model in the Oxford murals. Jane was noticed by Rossetti and Burne-Jones when she was visiting an Oxford theatre with her sister. Struck by Jane's beauty, <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> her <b>to</b> model for them.|$|R
50|$|A notable {{characteristic}} of the United Pentecostal Churches of Christ is that <b>they</b> have <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> combine Pentecostal Holiness teaching and practice with an ecclesiology and theology {{that is at once}} evangelical, pentecostal, sacramental, ceremonial and celebratory.|$|R
50|$|The {{memory of}} St. Eucherius still clings to three vast caves {{near the village}} of Beaumont whither, it is said, the people of Lyon had to go in search of him in 434 when <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> him <b>to</b> make him their archbishop.|$|R
5|$|Although {{working within}} the Neo-Gothic school of design, they {{differed}} from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm's early years {{as they were in}} high demand for the surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other film tie-in games, which often closely follow {{the events of}} their source material, the development team of Escape from Butcher Bay focused on differentiating the game from The Chronicles of Riddick. <b>They</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> explore Riddick's character in a prison break setting, and took inspiration from films such as Escape from Alcatraz. Starbreeze was also inspired by video games such as GoldenEye 007 and the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series. The opening sequence, in which Riddick is escorted into Butcher Bay, {{is a tribute to}} Half-Life, and the game's hand-to-hand combat was inspired by Punch-Out!!. Starbreeze focused solely on developing the game's single-player mode, and did not include multiplayer; the company believed that such a mode would require a design team twice as large and another year of development.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, reactionary {{conspiracy}} theorists, such as Scottish physicist John Robison and French Jesuit priest Augustin Barruel, began speculating that the Illuminati had survived their suppression {{and become the}} masterminds behind the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The Illuminati were accused of being subversives who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a revolutionary wave in Europe {{and the rest of}} the world in order to spread the most radical ideas and movements of the Enlightenment—anti-clericalism, anti-monarchism, and anti-patriarchalism—and to create a world noocracy and cult of reason. During the 19th century, fear of an Illuminati conspiracy was a real concern of the European ruling classes, and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 the very revolutions <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> prevent.|$|E
25|$|Tribal {{authorities}} have sometimes had conflicts {{with state and}} federal authorities. <b>They</b> have <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> assert their longstanding claim to the Sandia Mountains east of the ridge, and they strongly opposed {{the construction of the}} Sandia Peak Tramway in 1966.|$|R
5000|$|There were no agreed {{safeguards}} against consultations {{being used}} cynically by decision-makers {{to make it}} look like <b>they</b> had <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> canvass other opinions, while in fact having set a new policy in place even before it asked the question.|$|R

5|$|Jellyvision Games did {{not want}} to change much of the older games for the 2011 version. <b>They</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> keep as many of the old game {{question}} types, such as the Jack Attack and Dis Or Dat questions, updating the games to support online play. To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish Questions that required players to type in a phrase, the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game. The developers took advantage of other features of the newer consoles: they were able to use rumble features of console controllers to emphasize the effect of Screwing other players, and wrote several humorous titles for the in-game achievements.|$|E
5|$|On the peninsula, an {{enclave of}} Japanese troops had {{established}} itself after withdrawing north following earlier engagements in {{the centre of}} the island throughout 1944–45. Coming up against heavy resistance along Tsimba Ridge, the Australians' advance was halted for three weeks as they fought to wrest control of the ridge from the defending Japanese from the 81st Infantry Regiment, whose strength was roughly equal to that of the Australians. The main Australian attack took place on 6 February, {{but it was not until}} 9 February that the Japanese completely withdrew from the position. Small-scale fighting in the surrounding area continued until 22 February. The next stage of the campaign saw the Australians take Ratsua as <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> establish a defensive line across the base of the Bonis Peninsula between Ratsua and Ruri Bay.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman {{rule was}} {{subsequently}} reinstated in 1840 after Acre was recaptured with the critical {{support of the}} British Navy, However, the locals who were drafted into Muhammad Ali's army returned to their hometowns following the reassertion of Ottoman rule. Not long {{after the end of}} Egyptian rule, the intermittently recurring civil strife between the Qays and Yaman tribo-political factions resumed in parts of central Palestine. Throughout the 1840s until the 1860s, the Ottomans launched their own modernization reforms, known as the Tanzimat, throughout the empire with varying degrees of success. Coinciding with these efforts, the international powers began a tug-of-war of influence in Palestine as <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> extend their protection over the country's religious minorities, a struggle carried out mainly through their consular representatives in Jerusalem.|$|E
50|$|Both {{were heavily}} {{influenced}} by the Scandinavian example and <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> ways <b>to</b> introduce the ideas and methods they had witnessed into Luton Museum. In 1938 a rural industry gallery was opened at Wardown designed on Scandinavian principles with built-in cases and freestanding exhibits.|$|R
50|$|The Dark Sisterhood began {{long ago}} when women born with unusual powers began banding {{together}} for protection. Called witches, they adopted {{the name of the}} Dark Sisterhood originally in defiance of their persecutors. <b>They</b> <b>sought</b> power <b>to</b> save themselves from death and torture, but over time their goals became twisted. <b>They</b> <b>sought</b> not just <b>to</b> be equal, but to rule; to replace a corrupt system with their own. Today, the Sisterhood use their mutant psychic abilities to manipulate crucial figures in every level of society - from huge crime cartels to renegade police officers, corporate CEO's, and even heads of state. All to further their goal of global domination.|$|R
