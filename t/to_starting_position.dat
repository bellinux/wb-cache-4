25|$|One {{interesting}} {{exception was}} a horizontal seven inch turntable. Although made in 1886, {{the machine was}} a duplicate of one made earlier but taken to Europe by Chichester Bell. Tainter was granted Patent No. 385886 for it on July 10, 1888. The playing arm is rigid except for a pivoted vertical motion of 90 degrees to allow removal of the record or a return <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> While recording or playing, the record not only rotated but moved laterally under the stylus which thus described a spiral, recording 150 grooves to the inch.|$|E

50|$|The Half Dive Bomber variant simply {{stops the}} {{movement}} {{at the point}} the chest is between the hands and then reverses the movement to return <b>to</b> the <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> The Hindu dand variant returns directly <b>to</b> the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> without bending the arms or arcing the chest and shoulders back through the hands.|$|R

50|$|Some advise {{to lower}} down <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> slowly and with control. Others do the {{exercise}} more dynamically and with speed.|$|E
5000|$|Execution.- Simultaneously raise {{knees and}} torso until hips and knees are flexed. Return <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> with waist, hips and knees extended. Repeat.|$|E
5000|$|For {{a deck of}} given size, {{the number}} of Mongean shuffles {{that it takes to}} return a deck <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position,</b> is known [...] Twelve perfect Mongean shuffles restore a 52-card deck.|$|E

50|$|Powerlifting: Take {{position}} on a flat bench with body weight resting on buttocks and upper traps whilst driving feet into the floor. Movement requires the weight to be taken at full arms' length, lowered to upper torso, paused, and then lifted <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
50|$|Standing on a {{platform}} with an edge where the heels can hang (e.g. a curb), lift the body {{on the balls of}} the feet. The subject then slowly returns <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> This trains the gastrocnemius and to a lesser degree the soleus. A seated calf-raise trains the soleus.|$|E
50|$|Head lift - In a {{lying down}} position, knees bent at 90° angle, feet flat, slowly lift the head, chin toward your chest, (concentrate on {{isolation}} of the abdominals to prevent hip-flexors from being engaged), slowly contract abdominals toward floor, hold for two seconds, lower head <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> for 2 seconds. Complete 10 repetitions.|$|E
50|$|Pawns return <b>to</b> the <b>start</b> <b>position</b> on {{the same}} file they are {{captured}} on.|$|R
50|$|The {{individual}} {{begins by}} {{lying on the}} ground in a supine position, legs raised in the air at 90 degrees, arms stretched out the sides. The legs are then lowered to the right side by rotating the hips, then brought back <b>to</b> the <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> The legs are then lowered to the left side, then returned <b>to</b> the <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
50|$|Black retreats their rook <b>to</b> its <b>start</b> <b>position,</b> and White {{continues}} {{moving the}} king to safety.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} point scoring category is passing differential. This category is strongly correlated to who {{the driver is}} than it is <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> While finishing points are typically the largest point contributor to total points in NASCAR Fantasy Live, place and passing differentials collectively can often provide a driver with more points than simply finishing 1st.|$|E
5000|$|Standing Hip abduction- Standing up {{and holding}} on to a nearby surface, slowly lift one leg away from the midline {{of the body and}} then lower it back <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> This is simply a more {{advanced}} way to do any of the lying hip abduction exercises, and should be done as the patient progresses in rehab.|$|E
5000|$|Upright push-up - A {{stand-up}} push-up {{against the}} wall, with feet together arms-length away from wall, place hands {{flat against the}} wall, contract abdominal muscles toward spine, lean body towards wall, with elbows bent downward close to body, pull abdominal muscles in further, with controlled breathing. Release muscles as you push back <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> Complete 20 repetitions.|$|E
50|$|The American Kart Racing Association (AKRA) uses group {{transponder}} qualifying <b>to</b> calculate <b>starting</b> <b>positions</b> for 20-lap features.|$|R

50|$|An {{overhead}} bar (sometimes {{called a}} chin-up bar) is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts their body up, chin {{level with the}} bar, and keeping the back straight throughout. The bar remains {{in front of the}} subject at all times. The subject then slowly returns <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> in a slow controlled manner. This primarily trains the lats or upper back muscles, as well as the forearms. An underhand grip variation or chin-up trains both the back and biceps.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the above exercises, the Touro College study concluded the [...] "quadruped" [...] position yielded the most effective results. A quadruped position is defined as [...] "a human whose body weight is supported by both arms as well as both legs". In this position, the subject would start with a flat back, then slowly tilt the head down, and arch the back, contracting the abdominal muscles towards the spine, holding this position for 5 seconds, then releasing back <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> Complete two sets of 10 repetitions.|$|E
30|$|Same {{procedure}} {{as above}} was used {{but with the}} patient moving actively his limb to the reference angle relative <b>to</b> the <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On the German player's turn, a 3, 7, or 11 {{results in}} that player taking a 'Security Card' {{rather than an}} Opportunity Card. These allow the German player to {{undertake}} counter-escape actions, such as [...] "Shoot to Kill", [...] "Detect Tunnel", call an [...] "Appell" [...] (a counting parade forcing all pieces back <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>positions),</b> or perform searches. Once used, Security and Opportunity Cards are discarded.|$|R
50|$|The Flutter Kicks {{variation}} raises {{both legs}} {{off the ground}} by several inches, then alternates lifting each leg to the 45-degree position and returning it <b>to</b> its <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic rescue {{tools are}} {{powered by a}} {{hydraulic}} pump, which can be hand-, foot-, or engine-powered, or even built into the tool. These tools may be either single-acting, where hydraulic pressure will only move the cylinder in one direction, and the return <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> is accomplished using a pressure-relief valve and spring setup, or dual-acting, in which hydraulic pressure is used to both open and close the hydraulic cylinder. Recently, manufacturers of these rescue tools have begun offering options for electrically-powered versions as well using simple electric rotation motors or screw pistons rather than the aforementioned setup, promising greater reliability, lower cost of ownership, lower weight and better handling, greater portability, quicker and more direct operation, and greater potential power.|$|E
40|$|Proposed coal-mining machine {{operates}} in both forward and reverse directions along mine face. New design increases efficiency and productivity, because {{does not stop}} cutting as it retreats <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> after completing pass along face. To further increase efficiency, automatic miner carries its own machinery for crushing coal and feeding it to slurry-transport tube. Dual-drum mining machine cuts coal in two layers, crushes, mixes with water, and feeds it as slurry to haulage tube. At end of pass, foward drum raised so it becomes rear drum, and rear drum lowered, becoming forward drum for return pass...|$|E
