5|$|According to Tibetologist John Powers, Tibetan sources counter this {{narrative}} of titles {{granted by the}} Chinese to Tibetans with various titles which the Tibetans gave <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> emperors and their officials.

The Ming emperors sent invitations to ruling lamas, but the lamas sent subordinates rather than coming themselves, and no Tibetan ruler ever explicitly accepted the role of being a vassal of the Ming.|$|E
