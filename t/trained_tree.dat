2500|$|There {{can be a}} vast {{difference}} between the techniques and practices of professional arborists and those of inadequately <b>trained</b> <b>tree</b> workers who simply [...] "trim trees". [...] Some commonly offered [...] "services" [...] are considered unacceptable by modern arboricultural standards and may seriously damage, disfigure, weaken, or even kill trees. [...] One such example is tree topping, lopping, or [...] "hat-racking", where entire tops of trees or main stems are removed, generally by cross-cutting the main stem(s) or leaders, leaving large unsightly stubs. [...] Trees that manage to survive such treatment are left prone to a spectrum of detrimental effects, including vigorous but weakly attached regrowth, pest susceptibility, pathogen intrusion, and internal decay.|$|E

40|$|A 3 year {{research}} has been conducted on grapevine « Vernaccia » variety to evaluate the influence of some training systems on the flower failure percentage. Four training systems were compared: spur pruning, horizontal cordon, bilatera 1 Guyot, and Sylvoz. Observations were made each year on the flower number per inflorescence, and on the flower failure percentage. The resu 1 ts showed a great influence of the training system on the flower failure percentage, while the number of flowers per inflorescence was mainly related to the different seasons. The highest flower failure percentage was found in spur pruned trees, the lowest in Sylvoz <b>trained</b> <b>trees,</b> and the intermediate in horinzontal cordon and bilateral Guyot <b>trained</b> <b>trees...</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{strategies}} to cultural management. Establishment of new trees that are disease free {{by trying to}} plant trees {{as soon as they}} are received from the nursery {{to reduce the amount of}} stress the tree undergoes to reduce the amount of dead tissue. Apply insecticides to prevent insects such as, peach tree borer to prevent disease causing conidia from entering wounded parts of the tree that the insects create. Prune trees appropriately and at the correct time when buds start to break to promote wide angled branching. Infection at pruning sites is less common when done during late spring because of the smaller amount of inoculum present at this time. Inspect trees occasionally and removed any dead branches to prevent infection at these sites. <b>Training</b> <b>trees</b> properly also helps foster decreased amount of disease. <b>Training</b> <b>trees</b> during the first season to have branches develop wide crotch angles to sustain long orchard life. Avoid excessive and late fertilization during cold season to avoid low temperature injury. Fertilize trees during the early spring to prevent cold-susceptible growth.|$|R

40|$|We prove a {{conjecture}} of W.

Each such presentation is described by a binary tree {{and a collection of}} vector spaces, one for each vertex of the tree. A problem suggested by Wolfgang Hackbusch and Joseph Landsberg is to compare the complexities of encodings, if one presents the same tensor with respect to two different trees. We answer this question when the two trees are extremal cases: the most "spread" tree (perfect binary tree), and the "deepest" binary <b>tree</b> (<b>train</b> track <b>tree).</b> The corresponding tensor formats are called hierarchical formats (HF) and tensor train (TT) formats, respectively.

It is shown that {{the class of}} transformations computed by nondeleting and linear bimorphisms actually coincides with the previously mentioned class. Moreover, every nondeleting and linear bimorphism with an ε-free input-homomorphism can straightforwardly be implemented by a multi bottom-up tree transducer [Fülöp, Kühnemann, Vogler: A Bottom-up Characterization of Deterministic Top-down Tree Transducers with Regular Look-ahead. Inf. Proc. Letters 91, 2004]. The class of transformations realized by the latter devices is shown to be closed under composition and {{is included in the}} composition of the class of transformations realized by top-down tree transducers with itself. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} jointly parsing a bitext can {{substantially}} improve parse quality on both sides. In a maximum entropy bitext parsing model, we define a distribution over source trees, target trees, and node-to-node alignments between them. Features include monolingual parse scores and various measures of syntactic divergence. Using the translated {{portion of the}} Chinese treebank, our model is trained iteratively to maximize the marginal likelihood of <b>training</b> <b>tree</b> pairs, with alignments treated as latent variables. The resulting bitext parser outperforms state-of-the-art monolingual parser baselines by 2. 5 F 1 at predicting English side trees and 1. 8 F 1 at predicting Chinese side trees (the highest published numbers on these corpora). Moreover, these improved trees yield a 2. 4 BLEU increase when used in a downstream MT evaluation. ...|$|R

40|$|A new {{boosting}} algorithm of Freund and Schapire is used {{to improve}} the performance of an ensemble of decision trees which are constructed using the information ratio criterion of C 4. 5 algorithm. This boosting algorithm iteratively constructs a series of decision trees, each decision <b>tree</b> being <b>trained</b> and pruned on examples that have been filtered by previously <b>trained</b> <b>trees.</b> Examples that have been incorrectly classified by the previous trees in the ensemble are with higher probability to give a new probability distribution for the next tree in the ensemble to train on.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of anomaly detection algorithms is finding samples deviating from the majority. Although {{a vast number}} of algorithms designed for this already exist, almost none of them explain, why a particular sample was labelled as an anomaly. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called Explainer, which returns the explanation of sample’s differentness in disjunctive normal form (DNF), which is easy to understand by humans. Since Explainer treats anomaly detection algorithms as black-boxes, it can be applied in many domains to simplify investigation of anomalies. The core of Explainer is a set of specifically <b>trained</b> <b>trees,</b> which we call sapling random forests. Since their training is fast and memory efficient, the whole algorithm is lightweight and applicable to large databases, datastreams, and real-time problems. The correctness of Explainer is demonstrated {{on a wide range of}} synthetic and real world datasets...|$|R

These ensembles have many advantages over neural nets.
