500|$|In {{light of}} this failure, the Australian brigade {{commander}} requested further resources to undertake a full-scale offensive aimed at clearing the Japanese from the peninsula. This request was passed up to corps-level, but it was denied as Savige could not afford <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>assets</b> that were {{being used in the}} drive south. Under pressure to keep casualties to a minimum following criticism in the Australian media and in Parliament regarding the necessity of the campaign, Potts formulated a plan to withdraw the 27th Infantry Battalion from the right flank around Ruri Bay, and concentrate his forces on the left flank along a [...] front around the plantation at Buoi, to the north of Ratsua. Savige agreed to this on 22 July and the following day the 8th Infantry Battalion launched an attack against a feature known to the Australians as [...] "Como Ridge", which ran roughly northwest to southwest in the centre of the peninsula between Ruri Bay and Buoi Plantation. There it was believed that the Japanese were attempting to set up a forward position. The attack went in after a preliminary attack from the air, with one company attacking with two Matilda tanks from the 2/4th Armoured Regiment in support. Although the airstrike had been largely ineffective and both of the tanks struggled to cross the [...] "swampy ground", the direct fire support provided by the tanks proved decisive and the Australians took the position within 20 minutes, killing 12 Japanese.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} reviews the risk {{financing}} techniques {{employed in the}} insurance markets {{and looks at the}} changing field of the risk management arena. The overarching view is that apart from the traditional channels of financing risk, alternative routes should be explored. The latter is strengthened with the surfacing of off-balance sheet instruments in modern financial markets. The paper extends the discussion to the layered risk financing approach and reinforces its importance. That is, cash flow engineering instruments are employed to match different segments of the loss distributions. The role of insurance risk capital to assume extreme losses is further discussed, while reinsurance still remains a form of capital restructuring. Taken all together, the intention is that risk financing should be able <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>assets</b> committed to liabilities, and should reduce the cost of risk capital in sponsoring all-purpose equity. Finally, risk management platforms are redefined, while the securitisation of insurance risk is explored along with its effectiveness and possible caveats.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the role played by}} Dutch banks in the confiscation of Jewish property during World War II. ABN AMRO s predecessors, then seven commercial banks, surrendered the lion s share of Jewish financial assets to the Nazis. How can this be explained? One possible answer is that the banks allowed their own, commercial, interests to prevail over those of their Jewish clients. Other factors were: strategies of deception by the German authorities, low level of resistance among Dutch Jews, German pressure on banks <b>to</b> <b>release</b> Jewish <b>assets</b> and, finally, the lengthy duration of the war. ...|$|R

The authors suggested that revolutionary technologies, such as the Internet and wireless devices, would over time make it possible to derive value from previously less liquid or even unrecognized assets, and that the aggregate effect of such value liberation would be "a new wave of liquidity, which will engulf the global economy and result in substantial increases in liquidity around the world. " They further suggested that for this value liberation to take place, each of these previously illiquid, and in certain circumstances even unrecognized, assets would need to go through a four-step process: reduction in friction, value <b>release,</b> <b>asset</b> pricing, and asset recognition. We find in this paper that while a number of these predictions have come true, the degree of transformation that was envisioned in the original article are still far from becoming a reality.
