5|$|By the mid 1950s, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of economists had ceased debating Keynesianism and accepted the synthesis view; however, room for disagreement remained. The synthesis attributed problems with market clearing to sticky prices <b>that</b> <b>failed</b> to adjust to changes in supply and demand. Another group of Keynesians focused on disequilibrium economics and tried to reconcile the concept of equilibrium with the absence of market clearing.|$|E
5|$|Horder {{prescribed}} her an antidepressant, a {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor, {{a few days}} before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when <b>that</b> <b>failed,</b> he arranged for a live-in nurse. Commentators have argued that because antidepressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.|$|E

5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children <b>that</b> <b>failed</b> to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw that program as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency. When <b>that</b> <b>failed</b> as a strategy, the aerial effort was redirected {{to serve as an}} anti-infiltration campaign. After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an end at the direction of President Lyndon B.

5|$|Anna Beauchamp {{joined her}} husband in his cell in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap door {{at the top of}} the room. During their incarceration, they tried to bribe a guard into {{allowing}} them to escape. When <b>that</b> <b>failed,</b> they tried to pass a letter to Senator Beauchamp asking for help to escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, but to no avail. Beauchamp's final request to Desha for a stay of execution was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a vial of laudanum which Anna had smuggled into the cell. Both survived. The following morning, Jereboam and Anna were put on suicide watch and threatened with separation.|$|E

He then played a greedy politician in the political thriller Raajneeti (2010), which was well received. In 2012, Bajpayee essayed the role of Sardar Khan in Gangs of Wasseypur. His next roles were of a naxalite in Chakravyuh (2012), and a CBI officer in Special 26 (2013). In 2016, he portrayed professor Ramchandra Siras, in Hansal Mehta's biographical drama Aligarh, for which he won his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.|$|E

5|$|Besides the budget, another measure <b>that</b> <b>failed</b> {{to pass in}} the 2002 {{session was}} a bill to {{eliminate}} {{the death penalty for}} juveniles. The precedent for the juvenile death penalty had been set in the 1989 Supreme Court case of Stanford v.

In 2003, Patton announced he would commute Stanford's sentence. Patton did oversee the execution of two adult prisoners in 1997 and 1999, making him the first Kentucky governor to do so since 1962.|$|E

On 31 October 1918, Bodrog collided with a sand bank while navigating through heavy fog near Vinča. She was later captured by the Serbian Army.|$|E

In all, a total of 58,722 South Vietnamese soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 South Vietnamese government officials and employees, who reported to the North Vietnamese military authorities. The South Vietnamese military in Huế also surrendered vast quantities of weaponry, which included 140 tanks and armoured vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory <b>that</b> <b>failed</b> to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
5|$|During the {{bombardment}} of 19 February, Gaulois bombarded Turkish forts covering {{the mouth of}} the Dardanelles, although Charlemagne did not participate that day. During the day's action, the ship was hit twice, but was only lightly damaged. The two ships traded positions during {{the bombardment}} of 25 February, although Charlemagne was not damaged. On 2 March, the French squadron bombarded targets in the Gulf of Saros, {{at the base of the}} Gallipoli Peninsula. Five days later, the French squadron attempted to suppress the Turkish guns while British battleships bombarded the fortifications. Gaulois was hit by one shell during this attack <b>that</b> <b>failed</b> to detonate. Admiral Guépratte and his squadron returned to the Gulf of Saros on 11 March where they again bombarded Turkish fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{vultures}} roost communally {{on large}} trees, buildings or on cliffs. Roost sites are usually chosen {{close to a}} dump site or other suitable foraging area. In Spain and Morocco, summer roosts are formed mainly by immature birds. The favourite roost trees tended to be large dead pines. The number of adults at the roost increases towards June. It is thought that breeding adults {{may be able to}} forage more efficiently by joining the roost and following others to the best feeding areas. Breeding birds <b>that</b> <b>failed</b> to raise young may also join the non-breeding birds at the roost during June.|$|E
