50|$|The speed-adaption {{mechanism}} is a mechanism {{used to determine}} the required torque from the joints at different moving speeds. During the stance phase it has been seen that quasistiffness, which is the derivative of the <b>torque</b> <b>angle</b> relationship with respect the angle, changes constantly as a function of walking speed. This means that over the stance phase, depending on the speed the subject is moving, there is a derivable <b>torque</b> <b>angle</b> relationship {{that can be used to}} control a lower limb prosthesis. During the swing phase joint torque increases proportionally to walking speed and the duration of the swing phase decreases proportionally to the stride time. These properties allow for trajectories to be derived that can be controlled around that accurately describe the angle trajectory over the swing phase. Because these two mechanism remain constant from person to person this method removes the speed and patient specific tuning required by most lower limb prosthetic controllers.|$|E

So, now the electromagnetic torque equation of the permanent magnet synchronous generator is simply a linear equation depend on the Iqs current only.|$|E
50|$|A {{power system}} {{consists}} {{of a number of}} synchronous machines operating synchronously under all operating conditions. Under normal operating conditions, the relative position of the rotor axis and the resultant magnetic field axis is fixed. The angle between the two is known as the power angle or <b>torque</b> <b>angle.</b> During any disturbance, the rotor deaccelerates or accelerates with respect to the synchronously rotating air gap mmf, creating relative motion. The equation describing the relative motion is known as the swing equation, which is a non-linear second order differential equation that describes the swing of the rotor of synchronous machine. The power exchange between the mechanical rotor and the electrical grid due to the rotor swing (acceleration and deceleration) is called Inertial response.|$|E

Methods: A convenience sample of 17 females aged 18 - 22 years from a university ladies football team. Peak <b>torque</b> and <b>angle</b> of peak <b>torque</b> of both hamstrings were measured using a Biodex system 2 isokinetic dynamometer in concentric and eccentric mode at an angular velocity of 60 °/sec. The related t-test was used to test for significant differences between limbs. Results: Muscle strength differences ranging between 0. 9 % - 38. 3 % (Concentric: 9. 7 ± 7. 7; Eccentric: 15. 4 ± 9. 3) were noted. However, no significant differences were found between the dominant and non dominant limb (peak torque concentric p= 0. 068, eccentric p= 0. 063; <b>angle</b> of peak <b>torque</b> concentric p= 0. 449, eccentric p= 0. 246). Conclusions: In a group of recreational football players, limb dominance did not significantly affect peak <b>torque</b> or <b>angle</b> of peak <b>torque</b> at 60 °/secs. However, noteworthy strength imbalances were observed in a number of participants, indicating that clinicians need to be cautious when using the uninjured limb as a baseline measure.

The development of high power high coercivity magnetic alloys, such as samarium cobalt, {{has led to the}} advent of the brushless dc machine, which offers a more advantageous alternative to the brush machine. The brushless DC machine eliminates the need for brush contacts, through the use of electronic commutation.

30|$|The null {{hypothesis}} is rejected. In real life, the play between the archwire and the bracket slot {{is greater than}} the ideal, and the actual torque expressed by both 0.018 and 0.022 brackets will therefore always be less than expected. What is more, even when using brackets and archwires of nominally identical dimensions, there may be great variation in play and <b>torque</b> <b>angles,</b> due to the dimensional imprecision of such products. Unfortunately, it appears impossible to compensate for such discrepancies in a clinical setting, as, although in our experience, the bracket slots were invariably larger than their nominal size, some archwires were oversized and some were smaller than the measurements declared by the manufacturer, and the variable degree of bevelling will also affect the archwire/slot play.|$|R

METHODS: One hundred and sixty maxillary - 2 o and mandibular - 11 o canine brackets of Roth prescription from the following brands were selected: Abzil, Eurodonto, Morelli and Ormco. The brackets were set in wax and images were obtained by scanning. Reference points were determined over these images, lines drawn and the <b>torque</b> <b>angle</b> was measured. The Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used at a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: For maxillary canine brackets, the medium <b>torque</b> <b>angle</b> values were: Abzil - 0. 93 o &# 177; 0. 88 o; Eurodonto 0. 13 o &# 177; 0. 34 o; Morelli - 2. 56 o &# 177; 0. 50 o, and Ormco - 1. 16 o &# 177; 1. 27 o. For mandibular canine brackets, the values were: Abzil - 11. 76 o &# 177; 0. 40 o; Eurodonto - 10. 40 o &# 177; 0. 25 o; Morelli - 11. 18 o &# 177; 0. 56 o, and Ormco - 11. 36 o &# 177; 0. 30 o.

40|$|Nemaline {{myopathy}} is a congenital neuromuscular disorder, which {{primarily affects}} the thin filaments. Clinically {{the most important}} feature is muscle weakness; however, this weakness is poorly understood. The present investigation aimed to determine the <b>torque</b> <b>angle</b> relationship of the knee extensor muscles during in vivo muscle contractions in a family with a novel phenotype of nemaline myopathy. The {{results of this study}} show that quadriceps weakness occurs predominantly at higher knee flexion angles, but relatively normal strength was found at angles closer to full knee extension. When the relative <b>torque</b> <b>angle</b> relationships were considered, torque loss at smaller than optimum knee flexion angle was greater in the patients compared with the controls. In addition, the optimum angle for maximal quadriceps torque production was shifted towards smaller knee flexion angles in the patients. This suggests that a weakness specifically at higher knee flexion angles probably occurs as a result of adaptations consequently to the disease. Furthermore, it is important to assess muscle function at different joint positions to allow adequate interpretation of muscle weakness...|$|E
