The result was essentially a repeat of the December 1989 voting, with some parties previously voting 'No' choosing to abstain. González's parliamentary support remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E

25|$|All the old barrack {{buildings}} were demolished in 1936 {{to allow the}} construction of the present red brick buildings. One of the more unfortunate aspects of development since the 1930s has been the encroachment of structures outside the Fort Walls, especially on the Hesse and King Street sides. In terms of layout and despite some changes in architectural style, the Fort, as it stands today, is almost <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 1889.|$|E
25|$|If Captain Lynch {{had known}} that the Federal fleet faced a {{shortage}} of ammunition very much like his own, he perhaps would have altered his tactics, although the outcome would likely have been <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> Rowan ordered the captains in his fleet to conserve their ammunition. They were told to use ramming and boarding, so far as was possible, to disable or capture the enemy ships.|$|E

Although the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 {{made it possible for}} the government or emanations of the state to be sued on contracts {{in the same way as}} a normal individual, where statute confers power on a public body to do certain acts, actions by representatives beyond that power will be ultra vires and void. The result is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for companies before reform in 1989, so that whole chains of agreements could be declared as non-existent.|$|E

25|$|The format was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 2010–11. The tournament {{consisted}} of 24 matches, divided {{into a group}} stage and a knockout stage. The group stage had the teams divided into two equal groups, with each playing a round-robin tournament. The top two teams of each group advanced to the knockout stage. The knockout stage {{consisted of}} two semi-finals, a third-place playoff and the grand final. The semi-finals had the top team of one group facing the second from the other. The winners of the semi-finals played the grand final to determine {{the winner of the}} competition, while the losers of the semi-finals played the third-place playoff.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals {{had allowed}} 69 steals against them through September 8, while they had stolen only 32. Yadier Molina {{is not at}} fault {{as much as the}} {{pitchers}} letting the runners get good jumps, instead of holding them closer to first base. Since his debut in 2004, the team has never allowed more than 64 steals until this year. Molina's pop time—defined as the time elapsed from the moment the pitch hits the catcher's mitt to the moment the intended fielder receives the throw—is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> last year (1.92 seconds), when he allowed 37 stolen bases and ranked third in the National League with a caught-stealing percentage of 41. That pop time ranks seventh best among all catchers in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, milk-buying {{patterns}} have changed drastically in the UK. The classic milkman, who travels his local milk round (route) using a milk float (often battery powered) {{during the early}} hours and delivers milk in 1 pint glass bottles with aluminium foil tops directly to households, has almost disappeared. Two {{of the main reasons}} for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping). Another factor is that it is cheaper to purchase milk from a supermarket than from home delivery. In 1996, more than 2.5 billion liters of milk were still being delivered by milkmen, but by 2006 only 637 million liters (13% of milk consumed) was delivered by some 9,500 milkmen. By 2010, the estimated number of milkmen had dropped to 6,000. Assuming that delivery per milkman is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 2006, this means milkmen deliveries now only account for 6–7% of all milk consumed by UK households (6.7 billion liters in 2008/2009).|$|E

25|$|On April 12, 2000, the then-St. Louis Rams debuted new logos, team colors, and uniforms. The Rams' {{primary colors}} were changed from royal {{blue and yellow}} to Millennium Blue and New Century Gold. A new logo of a {{charging}} ram's head {{was added to the}} sleeves and gold stripes were added to the sides of the jerseys. The new gold pants no longer featured any stripes. Blue pants and white pants with a small gold stripe (an extension off the jersey stripe that ended in a point) were also an option with the Rams only electing to wear the white set in a pre-season game in San Diego in 2001. The helmet design essentially remains <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 1948, except for updates to the coloring, navy blue field with gold horns. The 2000 rams' horn design features a slightly wider separation at the helmet's center. Both home and away jerseys had a gold stripe that ran down each side, but that only lasted for the 2000 and 2001 seasons.|$|E
25|$|El Paraíso is {{situated}} {{near the mouth}} of the Chillón River Valley and is 2km from the Pacific Ocean. The temperature averages at 70°F ranging from 55°F to 90°F. El Paraíso is a river valley, which provides rich resources and is surrounded by barren desert land. There is a large flood plain near the site, which supports the growth of cotton fields. The Pacific Ocean brings the Humboldt Current through, creating rich and diverse marine life as well as lush tropical vegetation. The Humboldt Current most likely provided an extremely important food source before the advent of agriculture on the coast. Due to the lack of geologic and climatic evidence, it is assumed that the current climate on the Peru Coast is much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> 4–5000 years ago. Studies conducted by Reitz et al. found mollusc remains which indicated at least two major El Niño events took place during the occupation of El Paraíso. El Niño would have affected the abundance, diversity and species composition of available resources. Most likely, El Niño only affected two separate human life-times and there is evidence that people subsisted from remaining marine life and the lush vegetation which El Niño brings to desert lands.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Dikembe Mutombo {{made people}} {{question}} the draft's legitimacy when he prematurely tweeted a congratulatory {{message to the}} Philadelphia 76ers for receiving the first pick hours before the lottery was conducted. Philadelphia did indeed win the first overall pick. Further questions were raised a bit when the NBA Draft revealed that every spot remained exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> before the event took place, {{which was the first}} occurrence in draft lottery history. A year later, Lakers executive Magic Johnson raised even further questions about the draft process with him assuring head coach Luke Walton that the Lakers would acquire a top 3 pick for the 2017 NBA draft after an interview Walton had on May 4, 2017, twelve days before the draft lottery commenced and moved up to the second pick. As a result of the way teams like the Philadelphia 76ers were manipulating draft odds in their favor by losing games on purpose, starting September 28, 2017 {{with the end of the}} 2018 NBA draft, the NBA would implement a new system discouraging teams from going through Philadelphia's route in the mid-2010's by not only giving the worst three teams equal odds at the #1 pick, but also increasing their odds at going down within the draft with four teams being selected instead of the usual three.|$|E
