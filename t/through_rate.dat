50|$|Generally {{the water}} should be {{replaced}} about every hour. This means a typical raceway section requires a flow rate around 30 liters per second. However, the optimum flow <b>through</b> <b>rate</b> depends on the species, because {{there are differences in}} the rates at which oxygen is consumed and metabolic wastes are produced. For example, trout and juvenile salmon are less tolerant of degraded water quality and require a more rapid water turnover than catfish or tilapia. The flow rate necessary to maintain water quality can also change through the year, as the temperature changes and the cultured species grow larger. For reason such as these, continuous monitoring of water quality is important, including measurements of water flow rates, pH levels and temperature, as well as the levels of dissolved oxygen, and suspended and solid waste material.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 In this dissertation, I model {{generalized}} second price (GSP) auction for keyword {{search to}} analyze the optimal bidding strategies of the participating advertisers. The results also apply to a more general setting where multiple goods are being auctioned off. The study in chapter 3 examines the bidding strategies of the advertisers in a complete information static GSP auction. The results show that unlike in standard second price auction, truthful bidding is never a dominant strategy in general second price auction. In chapter 4, I have developed a model of static incomplete information GSP auction. I characterize all possible pure strategy Bayes [...] Nash equilibrium {{of the game and}} show that the consideration of the click <b>through</b> <b>rates</b> ratio {{plays a key role in}} determining the equilibrium bidding strategies for the advertisers. Specifically, I find that when the click <b>through</b> <b>rates</b> ratio exceeds a critical value, there will be no pure strategy Bayes-Nash equilibrium. The analysis also reveals that in a game of static incomplete information no asymmetric bidding equilibrium would prevail. The study in chapter 5 analyzes a model of incomplete information dynamic GSP auction. I find that in a dynamic game, the existence of both separating strategy equilibrium and pooling strategy equilibrium would depend upon critical values of click <b>through</b> <b>rates</b> ratio. I also prove that the advertisers with high valuation for a keyword will either reveal their identities at the very beginning or at the very end of this dynamic game. The results also show that when search engines do not publish the bidding history (i. e. there is 'minimum disclosure of information'), the advertisers will never try to mimic each other or in other words, there will be no pooling strategy equilibrium...|$|R

In May 1994, Ken McCarthy mentored Boyce in his transition from traditional to online advertising and first introduced the concept of a clickable/trackable ad. He stated that he believed that only a direct response model - in which the return on investment of individual ads was measured - would prove sustainable over the long run for online advertising.

50|$|The end goal is {{to convert}} a shopper into a customer1, but {{conversion}} {{is not the only}} metric as View <b>Through</b> <b>Rate</b> (VTR) is a common measurement2. Some merchants realize additional benefit such as Search Engine Optimization (SEO)3. A typical video commerce application would involve a video which contains a number of clickable objects so that the viewer can click on any of those objects for further information or to purchase them. However, the clickable object may not always be within the video itself, but part of the Flash or HTML5 player used to play back the video. In 2004, one year before YouTube’s birth, Fabio Pilotti and Gianfranco Giardina created the first video of the e-videoshopping series: Videos specifically designed for the online store of Mediaworld, main european retailer of the consumer electronics industry4.With the production of this series, the first online video-presentations of consumer electronics products were born.
