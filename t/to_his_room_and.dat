5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the death}} spreads, and the interns hurry to his room to find a shocked Stevens, lying on the bed, {{clinging}} to his still form. As they each try to comfort her, {{the cause of his}} death is revealed to have been a blood clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and hugging her. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who {{did not know how to}} handle Burke's situation, goes <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> puts her hand on his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program. After everyone begins going their separate ways, Grey remains torn on who she should follow: Shepherd or Dandridge.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Quinn {{suffers a}} massive brain hemorrhage. Adal gives Carrie a letter Quinn wrote declaring {{his love for}} her. She visits him in the hospital, locks the door <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> removes his pulse monitor, {{implying}} a mercy killing. The episode ends with Carrie pausing before anything happens to Quinn.|$|E
25|$|George Hall is {{the husband}} of Mrs. Hall and helps her run the Coach and Horses Inn. He {{was the first person}} in Iping to suspect that Griffin is invisible: when a dog bites him and tears his glove, Griffin retreats <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> Hall follows to see if he is all right, only to see Griffin without his glove and handless (or so it appears to Hall).|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{passengers}} on board San Juan were able to jump onto {{the deck of the}} S.C.T. Dodd before the two ships drifted apart. Not long after the collision occurred, the lights went out on board the San Juan. While heading up to the San Juan's deck, passenger George Houghton, observed a group of distressed passengers by the main stairwell, shouting at each other and praying. Houghton compared the sight to Dante's Inferno. Shortly after the collision, the San Juan began to capsize on its port side and start sinking stern first. Wireless operator Clifford Paulson hurriedly returned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> began sending out distress signals. Soon after a single ship had replied, water rushed in through Paulson's door and completely flooded his room. Luckily, Paulson was able to escape.|$|E

50|$|But real horror awaits. He {{makes it}} back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> discovers that Magda {{did not go}} to the theatre the night before. She stayed at home, dressed her face in a clown makeup, chopped her hair with a razor, and then hanged herself.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the best}} known of Hollywood's {{unfinished}} films, Queen Kelly (1929), was directed by Erich von Stroheim and produced by Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., father of the future President John F. Kennedy. Produced in 1928â€“29, the film starred Swanson in the title role, with Walter Byron and Seena Owen. It is the story of Prince Wolfram, betrothed to the mad Queen Regina V of Kronberg. On maneuvers (as punishment for consorting with other women), he spies Kelly walking with the other students of a convent. Enthralled by her beauty, he kidnaps her that night from the convent, takes her <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> professes his love for her. When the Queen finds them together the next morning, she whips Kelly and throws her out of the castle. Queen Regina then puts Wolfram in prison for his refusal to marry her. Kelly goes to German East Africa to visit her dying Aunt, and is forced to marry the disgusting Jan. The Aunt dies after the wedding, and Kelly refuses to live with Jan, becoming the head of her aunt's brothel. Her extravagances and style earn her the name Queen Kelly.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{makes her}} debut and only appearance in 2010's Heavy Rain, developed by French studio Quantic Dream. She is introduced in her apartment, {{being unable to}} sleep. After taking a shower and trying to sleep once more, she notices the apartment has been broken into. The two invaders then attack, though ultimately are revealed to be a nightmare caused by Madison's poor sleeping. Madison then goes to a motel {{to try to help}} her sleep, where she meets other protagonist Ethan Mars, who has been injured after attempting the Origami Killer's first trial in order to find his son (who has been abducted by the killer). Though she doesn't know the cause, she helps him <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> treats his wounds. Later in the game, she tends to Ethan's wounds again after he tries to complete another trial. After this, Madison helps Ethan to avoid the police who now believe him to be the Origami Killer, though whether she is successful depends on the player's actions. After they return to the motel, or after Ethan arrives having escaped the police station after being freed by another of the protagonists, FBI agent Norman Jayden, she learns why Ethan is now on the run, and that he is completing trials to find letters of the address where his son is being held.|$|E
25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance. It was determined that Clifton's cause of death was due to stabbing and clubbing with a baseball bat. Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry and scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short moment and then went back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he took off the mattress and stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E
60|$|Miss Carver {{began to}} talk to him about the book, and then about Mr. Evans. She asked him if he went much <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> Lemuel said no, not at all, since the first time Mr. Evans had asked him up. He said, after a pause, that he did not know whether he wanted him to come.|$|R

What could the voices have to tell you about that?" ...|$|R
500|$|After {{returning}} to the pub, Havelock confirms they have done enough damage to move on the Lord Regent. Corvo infiltrates the tower of Dunwall and removes the Lord Regent from power and, in the process, learns that the Lord Regent intentionally imported the plague to decimate the lower classes of society, though things quickly got out of hand. Corvo returns to the Hound Pits pub where the Loyalists celebrate their success. After sharing a drink, Corvo goes <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> collapses. Upon waking he [...] learns that his drink was poisoned by Samuel {{at the behest of}} Havelock and his Loyalist allies Treavor Pendleton and Teague Martin to prevent him interfering in their plan to install Emily as Empress and rule through her. Samuel remains loyal to Corvo and had given him a non-lethal dose of poison. Samuel sets Corvo adrift on the river and flees. When Corvo wakes, he is a prisoner of the assassin Daud and his men, who killed the Empress and intend to claim the bounty placed on Corvo's head by the now Lord Regent Havelock.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterward, Barton is {{visited by}} two police detectives, who inform him that Charlie's {{real name is}} Karl [...] "Madman" [...] Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer wanted for several murders; after {{shooting}} his victims, they explain, he decapitates them and keeps the heads. Stunned, Barton returns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> examines the box. Placing it on his desk without opening it, he begins writing and produces the entire script in one sitting. After a night of celebratory dancing, Barton returns to find the detectives in his room, who, after handcuffing Barton to the bed, reveal they've found evidence of Mundt's latest murders. Each of the men notes how hot it is, before Charlie as the hotel is engulfed in flames. Running through the hallway, screaming [...] "I'll show you {{the life of the}} mind!", Charlie shoots the policemen with a shotgun. As the hallway burns, Charlie speaks with Barton about their lives and the hotel, breaks the bed frame to which Barton is handcuffed (thus freeing him), then retires to his own room, saying as he goes that he paid a visit to Barton's parents and uncle in New York. Barton leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer.|$|E
500|$|Presley and Linda Thompson {{split in}} November 1976, {{and he took}} {{up with a new}} girlfriend, Ginger Alden. He {{proposed}} to Alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later, though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again. Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977, [...] "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts." [...] In Alexandria, Louisiana, the singer was on stage for less than an hour and [...] "was impossible to understand". Presley failed to appear in Baton Rouge; he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, {{and the rest of the}} tour was cancelled. Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, he stuck to most touring commitments. In Rapid City, South Dakota, [...] "he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk", according to Presley historian Samuel Roy, and unable to [...] "perform any significant movement." [...] Guralnick relates that fans [...] "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> his spiritualism books." [...] A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his own past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of Howard Hughes. [...] "Way Down", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, came out on June 6. On the next tour, CBS filmed two concerts for a TV Special, Elvis in Concert, to be aired in October. On the first of these, captured in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, [...] "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project." [...] He did better on the second night, two days later in Rapid City: [...] "He looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though his appearance was still a [...] "face framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks." [...] His final concert was held in Indianapolis, Indiana at Market Square Arena, on June 26.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{said the}} monsignore, {{stopping}} {{for a moment}} in the ball, [...] "here is a letter which must be instantly delivered, and by a trusty hand," [...] and he gave it to Mr. Clifford, who, looking at the direction, nodded his head and said, [...] "By no one but myself. I will show my lord <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> depart with this instantly." ...|$|R

60|$|Pushing his {{way through}} these gapers, Barton found, as he expected, that his patient had fainted. He aided the policemen to place him on the stretcher, {{accompanied}} him to the infirmary (how common a sight is that motionless body on a stretcher in the streets!), explained {{as much of the}} case as was fitting to the surgeon in attendance, and then, at last, returned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> a bath, puzzling over the mystery.|$|R
2500|$|In 1986, the {{television}} series Moonlighting produced an episode entitled [...] "Atomic Shakespeare", written by Ron Osborn and Jeff Reno (with a writing credit for William 'Budd' Shakespeare), {{and directed by}} Will Mackenzie. The episode recasts the show's main characters in a self-referential comedic parody of The Taming of the Shrew. The episode opens with a boy who is annoyed {{that he has to}} read The Shrew for his homework, rather than watching his favourite programme, Moonlighting itself. He goes <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> begins reading, and the episode then takes place in his mind as he imagines the members of the cast of Moonlighting in an adaptation of the play itself, with Cybill Shepherd as Katherina and Bruce Willis as Petruchio.|$|E
2500|$|Steven then {{grows up}} with various {{different}} stepmothers, {{and though he}} grows close to them all, he feels abandoned when they leave. When Ian prepares to marry Laura Dunn (Hannah Waterman), Steven is anxious that they too will end up splitting; his fears are realised when he catches Ian kissing prostitute Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) in 2002. From being a quiet, sensitive boy, Steven starts rebelling and skipping school. When Laura finds out, she confronts Steven, who reveals that Ian had kissed Janine. The subsequent rows {{have a negative effect}} on Steven; he becomes angry with the world and starts writing poison pen letters to people. Ian eventually finds out and confronts Steven. Following an argument, Steven goes <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> overhears Ian calling him [...] "Cindy's little brat!"; Ian is forced to tell Steven that he is not his natural father. Distressed and angry, Steven decides to leave Walford to meet Simon, who lives in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|Now that Joe {{was into}} the final, he didn't mention his broken thumb to anyone. He went back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> soaked his thumb {{in hot water}} and Epsom salts. [...] "Pain or not, Joe Frazier of Beaufort, South Carolina, was going for gold." [...] Joe proclaimed. Joe would fight a 30-year-old German {{mechanic}} named Hans Huber, who failed {{to make it on}} the German Olympic wrestling team. By now Joe was used to fighting bigger guys, but he was not used to doing it with a damaged left hand. When the opening bell sounded on fight night, Joe came out and started swinging punches, he threw his right hand more than usual that night. Every so often he'd used his left hook, but nothing landed with the kind of impact he managed in previous bouts. Under Olympic rules, 5 judges judge a bout, and that night three voted for Joe.|$|E
6000|$|But Jacob moved. He murmured good-night. He {{went out}} into the court. He buttoned his jacket across his chest. He went back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> being the only man who walked at that moment back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>his</b> {{footsteps}} rang out, his figure loomed large. Back from the Chapel, back from the Hall, back from the Library, came the sound of his footsteps, as if the old stone echoed with magisterial authority: [...] "The young man--the young man--the young man-back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> rooms." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then this}} Tommy {{would put the}} gas out softly <b>and</b> go <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own <b>room,</b> <b>and,</b> let us hope, blush a little.|$|R

Let me have it, papa, if he catches me, he'll tear it to smithereens.' ...|$|R
60|$|The poor dwarf {{hurried back}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> poured out his grief to the goose.|$|E

50|$|Khayman is {{generally}} gentle, optimistic, and friendly, inviting mortals <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> entertaining them with poetry, music and conversation, although he sometimes appears somewhat lonely or even shy. Although powerful, he dislikes wanton brutality. He lives by various guises {{in many different}} places, and when he stops having fun or feels pain, he fades out and forgets who he has been. Attempts to think back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> origins are painful, and so he avoids doing so, eventually forgetting entirely.|$|R
5000|$|Faust returns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> the dog follows him. Faust {{translates}} the Gospel of John, which presents difficulties, as Faust cannot {{determine the}} sense of the first sentence (specifically, the word Logos (Ancient Greek: [...] ) - [...] "In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God" [...] - currently translated as The Word). Eventually, he settles upon translating it with the very one meaning Logos does not have, writing [...] "In the beginning was the deed".|$|R
