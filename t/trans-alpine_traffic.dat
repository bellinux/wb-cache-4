5000|$|The area {{surrounding}} the castle have been settled {{since at least}} the last 4000 years, but the significance of the castle in <b>trans-alpine</b> <b>traffic</b> became especially important between the 10th to 14th centuries.|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between high- and lowlands depends {{not only on}} morphological and environmental features, {{but also on the}} way human communities experience it. Accordingly, the paper analyses the southern slopes of the Eastern Alps from the 5 th to the 15 th century. In the early Middle Ages, as a result of climate and social changes, life became tough in plains and valleys, while the highlands gained in importance. With the new Millennium, the mountain areas evolved and so did their relationship with the plains. <b>Trans-Alpine</b> <b>traffic</b> expanded further, and crossing the mountains was organised in well-articulated stages between Gemona and Villach, which stood at the two ends of the journey. Mountain dwellers were involved in support activities for the movement of people and goods. First, they provided food and shelter for travellers; secondly, they supplied beasts of burden for goods transport, and served as guides and caravan drivers. The mountain resources – timber, minerals, livestock – covered mostly the needs of the great, distant city, Venice. After Venice conquered the Pariarchate of Aquileia (1420) the eastern mountain chain became the border area of the outskirts of the Venetian Dominion...|$|E
50|$|In {{negotiations}} with the European Union, Switzerland demanded a limitation of <b>trans-alpine</b> heavy goods <b>traffic</b> which was denied by the EU. Therefore, the Swiss negotiators took another route and demanded a kilometre-based tax on heavy goods vehicles, the Distance-related heavy vehicle fee (HVF), {{which was to be}} installed for all domestic and international truck traffic above 3.5 tonnes.|$|R
25|$|During late-1980s and early-1990s {{negotiations}} with the European Economic Community, the predecessor of the EU, Switzerland demanded a limitation of <b>trans-alpine</b> heavy goods <b>traffic,</b> which the EEC refused. The Swiss negotiators therefore changed track and instead demanded a kilometre-based tax on heavy goods vehicles, the distance-related heavy vehicle fee (HVF), {{which was to be}} installed for all domestic and international truck traffic above 3.5 tonnes.|$|R
40|$|Although <b>trans-Alpine</b> highway <b>traffic</b> exhaust {{is one of}} {{the major}} sources of air {{pollution}} along the highway valleys of the Alpine regions, little is known about its contribution to residential exposure and impact on respiratory health. In this paper, source-specific contributions to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter[*]>[*] 10  μm (PM 10) and their spatio-temporal distribution were determined for later use in a pediatric asthma panel study in an Alpine village. PM 10 sources were identified by positive matrix factorization using chemical trace elements, elemental, and organic carbon from daily PM 10 filters collected between November 2007 and June 2009 at seven locations within the village. Of the nine sources identified, four were directly road traffic-related: traffic exhaust, road dust, tire and brake wear, and road salt contributing 16  %, 8  %, 1  %, and 2  % to annual PM 10 concentrations, respectively. They showed a clear dependence with distance to highway. Additional contributions were identified from secondary particles (27  %), biomass burning (18  %), railway (11  %), and mineral dust including a local construction site (13  %). Comparing these source contributions with known source-specific biomarkers (e. g., levoglucosan, nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) showed high agreement with biomass burning, moderate with secondary particles (in winter), and lowest agreement with traffic exhaust...|$|R
