Specifically, the IEEE 802. 11 in ad hoc mode, {{the most popular}} MAC protocol in mobile ad hoc networks, is extended from single channel to multiple channels operation. The current standard allows the prac-tical use of three channels in 802. 11 b and eight in 802. 11 a, but multiple channels operation is not supported in ad hoc mode. The proposed protocol ensures maximum perfor-mance, low delay, reliability, efficiency and fairness, while allowing <b>transmission</b> <b>priorities</b> to be set on a per-channel basis. In addition, a solution is provided for the Hidden Multi-Channel Problem, which arises when only one network inter-face card is used.

30|$|To tackle a more {{challenging}} latency-sensitive scenario, we picked ECG monitoring as the target information gathering application. Compared to other vital signs, ECG waveforms require relatively high data rate. The {{quality of a}} single ECG lead recorded at 300 Hz was shown to be adequate for diagnosis [1]. Given 16 bits per sample, we need a data rate of approximately 60 Kbps to transmit a 12 -lead ECG waveform. This low but steady data rate characteristic favors the OFDMA technique, which allows multiple transmission links to communicate simultaneously and thus keeps the latency to a minimum. In addition, to further reduce the transmission latency, we have proposed a distributed control channel access mechanism where user nodes are classified into four access classes according {{to the amount of}} vital sign data yet to be transmitted (higher classes have higher <b>transmission</b> <b>priority).</b> In this way, user nodes carrying more backlog data would have higher <b>transmission</b> <b>priority</b> to form transmission links with target receivers. Furthermore, in our proposed MAC mechanism, the nodes can gather neighborhood information during a neighborhood discovery phase. Another unique mechanism in this MAC allows nodes to detect packet collision for tackling network congestion and deadlocks.|$|E
