2500|$|.....Let it {{be known}} to you that from the time Arminius {{returned}} to us from Basel, his life and learning both have so approved themselves to us, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> the best of him in every respect, if he steadily persists in the same course, which, by the blessing of God, we doubt not he will; for, among other endowments, God has gifted him with an apt intellect both as respects the apprehension and the discrimination of things. If this henceforward be regulated by piety, which he appears assiduously to cultivate, it cannot but happen that this power of intellect, when consolidated by mature age and experience, will be productive of the richest fruits. Such is our opinion of Arminius ---a young man, unquestionably, {{so far as we}} are able to judge, most worthy of your kindness and liberality" [...] (Letter of June 3, 1585, from Beza to Amsterdam).|$|E
60|$|We {{encountered}} one day, by chance, an {{old friend}} of whom we had lost sight for some years, and who-expressing a strong anxiety to renew our former intimacy-urged us to dine with him on an early day, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might talk over old times. We readily assented, adding, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>we</b> should be alone. 'Oh, certainly, certainly,' said our friend, 'not a soul with us but Mincin.' 'And who is Mincin?' was our natural inquiry. 'O don't mind him,' replied our friend, 'he's a most particular friend of mine, and a very friendly fellow you will find him;' and so he left us.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the words}} of Rachel's parents: [...] "The act, while we may {{disagree}} with it, must be put into context. Rachel was partaking in a demonstration in Gaza opposing the War on Iraq. She was working with children who drew two pictures, one of the American flag, {{and one of the}} Israeli flag, for burning. Rachel said that she could not bring herself to burn the picture of the Israeli flag with the Star of David on it, but under such circumstances, in protest over a drive towards war and her government's foreign policy that was responsible for much of the devastation that she was witness to in Gaza, she felt it OK to burn the picture of her own flag. We have seen photographs of memorials held in Gaza after Rachel's death in which Palestinian children and adults honor our daughter by carrying a mock coffin draped with the American flag. We have been told that our flag has never been treated so respectfully in Gaza in recent years. We believe Rachel brought a different face of the United States to the Palestinian people, a face of compassion. It is this image of Rachel with the American flag <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> will be remembered most." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011, Antigua and Barbuda's UN Ambassador John William Ashe {{was chosen}} as the {{consensus}} candidate by all 33 GRULAC member states to be the president of the United Nations General Assembly, thus not necessitating an election. In opening remarks to the General Assembly, Ashe said: [...] "The upcoming year will be pivotal for this Assembly as we seek to identify the parameters of the post-2015 development agenda. The magnitude of the task before us will require decisive action and the highest levels of collaboration and we must prove ourselves and our efforts to be equal to the enormity of the task. We simply cannot reach our development goals, or advance human well-being without addressing the needs and challenges of women and youth, while also making use of the contributions of the both. With some 1.4 billion people without reliable electricity; 900 million lacking access to clean water and 2.6 billion without adequate sanitation, action is urgently needed to address these persistent challenges. With so many initiatives in these three fields, let us try and draw upon and share the existing knowledge, while scaling up initiatives that have already worked in the areas of integrated water management, sustainable energy and sanitation services for the proposed post-2015 development agenda." [...] Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon then said: [...] "We will intensify our efforts to define a post-2015 development agenda, including with a single set of goals for sustainable development <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> will address the complex challenges of this new era and capture the imagination {{of the people of the}} world, as the MDGs did. Syria is without doubt the biggest crisis facing the international community. The Assembly has a role and a voice in our efforts to resolve it and respond to the suffering." ...|$|E
