40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the influences of differing physician characteristics and attitudes on the diagnosis of emotional problems, and <b>the</b> <b>prescribing</b> of selected psychotropic and non-psychotropic drugs. The 32 physicians who completed the study recorded 10, 585 patient visits, which accounted for 7934 prescribed drugs. Overall, 549 (6. 9 %) of <b>the</b> drugs <b>prescribed</b> were classified as psychotropic drugs. After controlling for patient characteristics, there was not a statistically significant relationship between board certification, practice size, or physician age and the rate at which study physicians diagnose emotional problems. Board certification, physician age, physician propensity to prescribe drug therapy, and the feeling that patients expect drug therapy were significantly related to <b>the</b> <b>prescribing</b> of non-psychotropic drugs. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>prescribing</b> of non-psychotropic drugs, <b>the</b> <b>prescribing</b> of psychotropic drugs was not predictable.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prescribed</b> {{readings}} for {{the second}} of three Easter feast days included the narration of the Road to Emmaus. The cantata was Bach's first composition for Easter as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. He derived it from his earlier Serenata, which had a similar celebratory mood. An unknown librettist solved the problem that Bach's congratulatory cantata was a dialogue of tenor and alto by retaining a dialogue in three movements, assigned to Hope and Fear. They represent different attitudes to {{the news of the}} Resurrection of Jesus, which may be found in the two disciples, discussing the events on their walk, but also within the listener of the cantata.|$|E

A longitudinal observation study of all prescriptions, from primary care, for inhaled corticosteroids dispensed in Scotland from January 1999 to May 2002 was undertaken. The main outcome measures were <b>the</b> trends in <b>prescribing</b> of inhaled corticosteroids and GP consultations for respiratory diseases. <b>The</b> <b>prescribing</b> of all inhaled corticosteroids has risen over the study period. <b>The</b> rise in <b>prescribing</b> of <b>the</b> combination product containing fluticasone and salmeterol {{appears not to}} have been at the expense of <b>the</b> <b>prescribing</b> of fluticasone alone while <b>the</b> <b>prescribing</b> of <b>the</b> budesonide/eformoterol combination may be at the expense of budesonide (BUD) alone. GP consultations for both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have declined over a similar period. <b>The</b> increased <b>prescribing</b> of inhaled corticosteroids over this period is associated with the increased use of the fluticasone/salmeterol combination rather than an increase in the use of all inhaled corticosteroids. The accompanying fall in number of consultations with GPs may be due to this increased prescribing or a move to nurse led clinic...|$|R

5|$|Control {{systems have}} a need for {{smoothing}} filters in their feedback loops with criteria to maximise the speed of movement of a mechanical system to <b>the</b> <b>prescribed</b> mark {{and at the same}} time minimise overshoot and noise induced motions. A key problem here is the extraction of Gaussian signals from a noisy background. An early paper on this was published during WWII by Norbert Wiener with the specific application to anti-aircraft fire control analogue computers. Rudy Kalman (Kalman filter) later reformulated this in terms of state-space smoothing and prediction where it is known as the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem. Kalman started an interest in state-space solutions, but according to Darlington this approach can also be found in the work of Heaviside and earlier.|$|E
5|$|On {{the upright}} collar of full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It {{was not possible to}} know which grade of general an officer was by his collar insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore two rows of nine buttons in groups of three down the front of the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore two rows of eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had no distinction between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear <b>the</b> <b>prescribed</b> uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore the uniform of a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking <b>the</b> <b>prescribed</b> regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E

5|$|The Peace of Thorn of 1466 {{reduced the}} Teutonic Knights, but brought no lasting {{solution}} to the problem they presented for Poland and their state avoided paying <b>the</b> <b>prescribed</b> tribute. The chronically difficult relations had gotten worse after the 1511 election of Albrecht as Grand Master of the Order. Faced with Albrecht's rearmament and hostile alliances, Poland waged a war in 1519; the war ended in 1521, when mediation by Charles V resulted in a truce. As a compromise move Albrecht, persuaded by Martin Luther, initiated a process of secularization of the Order and the establishment of a lay duchy of Prussia, as Poland's dependency, ruled by Albrecht and afterwards by his descendants. The terms of the proposed pact immediately improved Poland's Baltic region situation, and at that time also appeared to protect the country's long-term interests. The treaty was concluded in 1525 in Kraków; the remaining state of the Teutonic Knights (East Prussia centered on Königsberg) was converted into the Protestant (Lutheran) Duchy of Prussia under the King of Poland and the homage act of the new Prussian duke in Kraków followed.|$|E

Sultan Iskandar, nevertheless bore the brunt of the backlash by the numerous references centred towards alleged acts of criminal wrongdoings even though many of the listed acts were committed by other members of the royal family.|$|E
