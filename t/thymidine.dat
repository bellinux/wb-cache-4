5|$|Thymine and uracil, nucleic {{bases of}} <b>thymidine</b> and uridine, respectively, {{do not have}} exocyclic amino groups and hence do not require any protection.|$|E
5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific <b>thymidine</b> in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II.|$|E
25|$|TK1 is {{synthesized}} by {{the cell}} during the S phase of cell division. After cell division is completed, TK1 is degraded intracellularly {{and does not}} pass to body fluids after normal cell division. There is a feed-back regulation of the action of <b>thymidine</b> kinase in the cell: <b>thymidine</b> triphosphate (TTP), {{the product of the}} further phosphorylation of <b>thymidine,</b> acts as an inhibitor to <b>thymidine</b> kinase. This serves to maintain a balanced amount of TTP available for nucleic acid synthesis, not oversaturating the system. 5'-Aminothymidine, a non-toxic analogue of <b>thymidine,</b> interferes with this regulatory mechanism and thereby increases the cytotoxicity of <b>thymidine</b> analogues used as antineoplastic drugs. The reaction kinetics of <b>thymidine</b> and <b>thymidine</b> analogues phosphorylation is complicated and only partly known. The overall phosphorylation of <b>thymidine</b> to <b>thymidine</b> triphosphate does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the various phosphates of <b>thymidine</b> and uridine interfere with the phosphorylation of each other. The kinetics of TK from different species differ from each other's and also the different forms from a given species (monomer, dimer, tetramer and serum form) have different kinetic characteristics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thymidine</b> {{reacts with}} ATP to give <b>thymidine</b> monophosphate and ADP.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thymidine</b> monophosphate is also {{produced}} by the cell in a different reaction by methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate, a product of other metabolic pathways unrelated to <b>thymidine,</b> by the enzyme thymidylate synthase. The second route is sufficient to supply <b>thymidine</b> monophosphate for DNA repair. When a cell prepares to divide, a complete new set-up of DNA is required, and the requirement for building blocks, including <b>thymidine</b> triphosphate, increases. Cells prepare for cell division by making some of the enzymes required during the division. They are not normally present in the cells and are downregulated and degraded afterwards. Such enzymes are called salvage enzymes. <b>Thymidine</b> kinase 1 is such a salvage enzyme, whereas <b>thymidine</b> kinase 2 and thymidylate synthase are not cell cycle-dependent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thymidine</b> monophosphate, {{the product}} of the {{reaction}} catalyzed by <b>thymidine</b> kinase, is in turn phosphorylated to <b>thymidine</b> diphosphate by the enzyme thymidylate kinase and further to <b>thymidine</b> triphosphate by the enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase. The triphosphate is included in a DNA molecule, a reaction catalyzed by a DNA polymerase and a complementary DNA molecule (or an RNA molecule in the case of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme present in retrovirus).|$|E
25|$|<b>Thymidine</b> kinase {{is present}} in animals, plants, some bacteria, archeans and virus. The <b>thymidine</b> kinases from pox viruses, African swine fever virus, Herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus and Epstein- Barr virus have been {{identified}} and to a varying degree characterized. The enzyme form in virus {{is different from that}} in other organisms. <b>Thymidine</b> kinase is not present in fungi.|$|E
25|$|Some {{antiviral}} drugs, such as acyclovir (ATC: J05AB01) and ganciclovir (ATC: J05AB06) as well {{as other}} nucleoside analogs make use of the substrate specificity of viral <b>thymidine</b> kinase, as opposed to human <b>thymidine</b> kinases. These drugs act as prodrugs, which in themselves are not toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral <b>thymidine</b> kinase. Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic triphosphates that lead to cell death. Human <b>thymidine</b> kinase, in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific <b>thymidine</b> kinase. In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of antiviral drug resistance is frequently observed. Sequencing the <b>thymidine</b> kinase gene in Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of antiviral drug resistance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thymidine</b> kinases {{have a key}} {{function}} in the synthesis of DNA and therefore in cell division, as {{they are part of}} the unique reaction chain to introduce <b>thymidine</b> into the DNA. <b>Thymidine</b> is present in the body fluids as a result of degradation of DNA from food and from dead cells. <b>Thymidine</b> kinase is required for the action of many antiviral drugs. It is used to select hybridoma cell lines in production of monoclonal antibodies. In clinical chemistry it is used as a proliferation marker in the diagnosis, control of treatment and follow-up of malignant disease, mainly of hematological malignancies.|$|E
25|$|Antibodies against <b>thymidine</b> kinase are {{available}} for immunohistochemical detection. Staining for <b>thymidine</b> kinase {{was found to be}} a reliable technique for identification of patients with stage 2 breast carcinoma. The highest number of patients identified was obtained by combination of <b>thymidine</b> kinase and Ki-67 staining. The technique has also been validated for lung cancer, for colorectal carcinima, for lung cancer and for renal cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The first {{indirect}} use of <b>thymidine</b> kinase in biochemical {{research was}} {{the identification of}} dividing cells by incorporation of radiolabeled <b>thymidine</b> and subsequent measurement of the radioactivity or autoradiography to identify the dividing cells. For this purpose tritiated <b>thymidine</b> {{is included in the}} growth medium. In spite of errors in the technique, it is still used to determine the growth rate of malignant cells and to study the activation of lymphocytes in immunology.|$|E
25|$|Incorporation of a <b>thymidine</b> {{analogue}} with boron {{has been}} suggested and tried in animal models for boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors. A very extensive number of <b>thymidine</b> derivatives containing boron have been described.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} classes of drugs directed against <b>thymidine</b> metabolism and thereby involving <b>thymidine</b> kinase {{that are used}} to control cancer associated cell division. Chain terminators are <b>thymidine</b> analogues that are included in the growing DNA chain, but modified so that the chain cannot be further elongated. As analogs of <b>thymidine,</b> this type of drugs are readily phosphorylated to 5'-monophosphates. The monophosphate is further phosphorylated to the corresponding triphosphate and incorporated in the growing DNA chain. The analog has been modified so that it does not have the hydroxyl group in the 3'-position that is required for continued chain growth. In zidovudine (AZT; ATC:J05AF01) the 3'-hydroxyl group has been replaced by an azido group, in stavudine (ATC: J05AF04) it has been removed without replacement. AZT is used as substrate in one of the methods for determination of <b>thymidine</b> kinase in serum. This implies that AZT interferes with this method and may be a limitation: AZT is a standard component of HAART therapy in HIV infection. One common consequence of AIDS is lymphoma and the most important diagnostic application of <b>thymidine</b> kinase determination is for monitoring of lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} classes of <b>thymidine</b> kinases {{have been identified}} and are included in this super family: one family groups together <b>thymidine</b> kinase from herpesvirus as well as cellular thymidylate kinases, the second family groups TK from various sources that include, vertebrates, bacteria, the bacteriophage T4, poxviruses, African swine fever virus (ASFV) and Fish lymphocystis disease virus (FLDV). The major capsid protein of insect iridescent viruses also belongs to this family. The Prosite pattern recognizes only the cellular type of <b>thymidine</b> kinases.|$|E
25|$|After {{smallpox}} {{was declared}} eradicated by WHO in December 1979, vaccination programs were terminated. A re-emergence {{of the disease}} either by accident or {{as a result of}} biological warfare would meet an unprotected population and could result in an epidemic that could be difficult to control. Mass vaccination would be unethical, as the only efficient vaccines against smallpox include live vaccinia virus with severe adverse effects on rare occasions. As one protective measure, large amounts of vaccine are kept in stock, but an efficient drug against smallpox has high priority. One possible approach would be to use the specificity of the <b>thymidine</b> kinase of poxvirus for the purpose, in a similar way that it is used for drugs against herpesvirus. One difficulty is that the poxvirus <b>thymidine</b> kinase belongs to the same family of <b>thymidine</b> kinases as the human <b>thymidine</b> kinases and thereby is more similar chemically. The structure of poxvirus <b>thymidine</b> kinases has therefore been determined to find potential antiviral drugs. The search has, however, not yet resulted in a usable antiviral drug against poxviruses.|$|E
25|$|The {{mutation}} rate {{has been estimated}} to be ~1.38×10−7 substitutions/site/year. In clinical setting, the mutations in either the <b>thymidine</b> kinase gene or DNA polymerase gene has caused resistance to aciclovir. However, most of the mutations occur in the <b>thymidine</b> kinase gene rather than the DNA polymerase gene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thymidine</b> kinase is a salvage {{enzyme that}} is only present in {{anticipation}} of cell division. The enzyme is not set free from cells undergoing normal division where the cells have a special mechanism to degrade the proteins no longer needed after the cell division. In normal subjects, the amount of <b>thymidine</b> kinase in serum or plasma is therefore very low. Tumor cells release enzyme to the circulation, probably {{in connection with the}} disruption of dead or dying tumor cells. The <b>thymidine</b> kinase level in serum therefore serves as a measure of malignant proliferation, indirectly as a measure of the aggressivity of the tumor.|$|E
25|$|Molecular combing of DNA fibers {{can be used}} {{to monitor}} the {{structure}} of chromosomes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This provides DNA replication profiles of individual molecules. This requires that the yeast strains express <b>thymidine</b> kinase, which wild type yeasts so not, being fungi (see occurrence). Therefore. a gene for <b>thymidine</b> kinase must be incorporated in the genome.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to {{aciclovir}} is rare {{in people}} with healthy immune systems, but is more common (up to 10%) in people with immunodeficiencies on chronic antiviral prophylaxis (transplant recipients, people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome due to HIV infection). Mechanisms of resistance in HSV include deficient viral <b>thymidine</b> kinase; and mutations to viral <b>thymidine</b> kinase or DNA polymerase, altering substrate sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{use of the}} <b>thymidine</b> kinase {{makes use}} of the {{presence}} in some tumor cells of substances not present in normal cells (tumor markers). Such tumor markers are, for instance, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and AFP (alpha fetoprotein). The genes for these tumor markers {{may be used as}} promoter genes for <b>thymidine</b> kinase. <b>Thymidine</b> kinase can then be activated in cells expressing the tumor marker but not in normal cells, such that treatment with ganciclovir kills only the tumor cells. Such gene therapy-based approaches are still experimental, however, as problems associated with targeting the gene transfer to the tumor cells have not yet been completely solved.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} {{of stem cells}} in adult organs, as shown by autoradiography with labeled <b>thymidine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{drugs are}} {{specifically}} directed against dividing cells. They {{can be used}} against tumors and viral diseases (both against retrovirus and against other virus), as the diseased cells replicate much more frequently than normal cells and also against some non-malignant diseases related to excessively rapid cell replication (for instance psoriasis). It {{has been suggested that}} the antiviral and anti-cancer activity of <b>thymidine</b> analogues is, at least partly, achieved by downregulation of mitochondrial <b>thymidine</b> kinase.|$|E
25|$|Genes for virus {{specific}} <b>thymidine</b> kinases {{have been}} identified in Herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of tetramer after modification of <b>thymidine</b> kinase 1 after synthesis enhances the enzyme activity. It {{has been suggested}} that this is a mechanism for regulation of the enzyme activity. The {{formation of}} tetramers is observed after the Dictyostelium development stage. Its use for fine regulation of DNA synthesis is suggested to have been established in warm blooded animals after they branched out from the vertebrates. Also the development of <b>thymidine</b> kinase like enzymes in the development has been studied.|$|E
25|$|Another use of {{gene therapy}} is the {{introduction}} of enzymes into these cells that make them susceptible to particular chemotherapy agents; studies with introducing <b>thymidine</b> kinase in gliomas, making them susceptible to aciclovir, are in their experimental stage.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>thymidine</b> analogues, for {{instance}} Idoxuridine (ATC: J05AB02) act by blocking base pairing during subsequent replication cycles, thereby making the resulting DNA chain defective. This {{may also be}} combined with radioactivity to achieve apoptosis of malignant cells.|$|E
25|$|Aciclovir is {{converted}} by viral <b>thymidine</b> kinase to aciclovir monophosphate, {{which is then}} converted by host cell kinases to aciclovir triphosphate (ACV-TP). ACV-TP, in turn, competitively inhibits and inactivates HSV-specified DNA polymerases preventing further viral DNA synthesis without affecting the normal cellular processes.|$|E
25|$|If {{the code}} was DNA-based, it {{operated}} as follows. The genetic code was expressed via RNA intermediates, which were single-stranded. The RNA {{was produced by}} a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase using nucleotides {{similar to those of}} DNA, with the exception that the nucleotide <b>thymidine</b> in DNA was replaced by uridine in RNA.|$|E
25|$|AZT is a <b>thymidine</b> analogue. AZT {{works by}} {{selectively}} inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase, the enzyme {{that the virus}} uses to make a DNA copy of its RNA. Reverse transcription is necessary for production of HIV's double-stranded DNA, which would be subsequently integrated into the genetic material of the infected cell (where it is called a provirus).|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{a series of}} papers {{have shown that the}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) base composition correlates with animal species maximum life span. The mitochondrial DNA base composition is though to reflect its nucleotide-specific (guanine, cytosine, <b>thymidine</b> and adenine) different mutation rates (i.e., accumulation of guanine in the mitochondrial DNA of an animal species is due to low guanine mutation rate in the mitochondria of that species).|$|E
25|$|Mammals {{have two}} isoenzymes, that are {{chemically}} very different, TK1 and TK2. The former was first found in fetal tissue, {{the second was}} found to be more abundant in adult tissue, and initially they were termed fetal and adult <b>thymidine</b> kinase. Soon it was shown that TK1 is present in the cytoplasm only in anticipation of cell division (cell cycle-dependent), whereas TK2 is located in mitochondria and is cell cycle-independent. The two isoenzymes have different reaction kinetics and are inhibited by different inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{selective}} {{culture medium}} is called HAT medium {{because it contains}} hypoxanthine, aminopterin and <b>thymidine.</b> This medium is selective for fused (hybridoma) cells. Unfused myeloma cells cannot grow because they lack HGPRT and thus cannot replicate their DNA. Unfused spleen cells cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybrid cells, referred to as hybridomas, are able to grow indefinitely in the media because the spleen cell partner supplies HGPRT and the myeloma partner has traits that make it immortal (similar to a cancer cell).|$|E
25|$|Methotrexate is an {{antimetabolite}} of the antifolate type. It {{is thought}} to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the denovo synthesis of the nucleoside <b>thymidine,</b> required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and pyrimidine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} frequently {{occurs in}} repeated sequences, {{and helps to}} suppress the expression and mobility of 'transposable elements': Because 5-methylcytosine can be spontaneously deaminated (replacing nitrogen by oxygen) to <b>thymidine,</b> CpG sites are frequently mutated and become rare in the genome, except at CpG islands where they remain unmethylated. Epigenetic changes of this type thus {{have the potential to}} direct increased frequencies of permanent genetic mutation. DNA methylation patterns are known to be established and modified in response to environmental factors by a complex interplay of at least three independent DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, the loss of any of which is lethal in mice. DNMT1 is the most abundant methyltransferase in somatic cells, localizes to replication foci, has a 10–40-fold preference for hemimethylated DNA and interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).|$|E
25|$|Early {{long-term}} higher-dose {{therapy with}} AZT was initially associated with side effects that sometimes limited therapy, including anemia, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy. All {{of these conditions}} were generally found to be reversible upon reduction of AZT dosages. They {{have been attributed to}} several possible causes, including transient depletion of mitochondrial DNA, sensitivity of the γ-DNA polymerase in some cell mitochondria, the depletion of <b>thymidine</b> triphosphate, oxidative stress, reduction of intracellular L-carnitine or apoptosis of the muscle cells. Anemia due to AZT was successfully treated using erythropoetin to stimulate red blood cell production. Drugs that inhibit hepatic glucuronidation, such as indomethacin, nordazepam, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and trimethoprim decreased the elimination rate and increased the therapeutic strength of the medication. Today, side-effects are much less common with the use of lower doses of AZT.|$|E
25|$|The viral <b>thymidine</b> kinases differ {{completely}} {{from the}} mammalian enzymes both structurally and biochemically and are inhibited by inhibitors {{that do not}} inhibit the mammalian enzymes. The genes of the two human isoenzymes were localized in the mid-1970s. The gene for TK1 was cloned and sequenced. The corresponding protein has a molecular weight of about 25 kD. Normally, it occurs in tissue as a dimer with a molecular weight of around 50 kD. It can be activated by ATP. After activation, is a tetramer with a molecular weight around 100 kD. However, the form of enzyme present in the circulation does not correspond to the protein as encoded by the gene: the main fraction of the active enzyme in the circulation has a molecular weight of 730 kD and is probably bound in a complex to other proteins. This complex is more stable and has a higher specific activity {{than any of the}} lower molecular weight forms.|$|E
