2500|$|As TEM samples cannot {{typically}} {{be viewed}} at a full 180° rotation, the observed images typically {{suffer from a}} [...] "missing wedge" [...] of data, which when using Fourier-based back projection methods decreases the range of resolvable frequencies in the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> Mechanical refinements, such as multi-axis tilting (two tilt series of the same specimen made at orthogonal directions) and conical tomography (where the specimen is first tilted to a given fixed angle and then imaged at equal angular rotational increments through one complete rotation in {{the plane of the}} specimen grid) can be used to limit the impact of the missing data on the observed specimen morphology. Using focused ion beam milling, a new technique has been proposed which uses pillar-shaped specimen and a dedicated on-axis tomography holder to perform 180° rotation of the sample inside the pole piece of the objective lens in TEM. Using such arrangements, quantitative electron tomography without the missing wedge is possible. In addition, numerical techniques exist which can improve the collected data.|$|E

This study reports {{for the first time that}} the central zone is composed of stacked disk-shaped layers of highly bioturbated sediment, the radial burrows are composed of a sand-rich lining of pelleted annuli surrounding an active sand-rich fill, and the presence of subtle conical features above the radial galleries that are inferred to result from collapse cone feeding. Reconstructions of heberti demonstrate that the thick walled burrows are composed of sand-rich annular rings, are a broad U-shape, and may be either clustered or isolated. Our observations show that the morphology of heberti is inconsistent with the generic diagnosis of Palaeophycus, but is morphologically comparable to Schaubcylindrichnus, and is herein synonymised with Schaubcylindrichnus to create S. heberti comb. nov. The <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reconstructions</b> have revealed a number of hitherto unknown morphological elements to both taxa which has facilitated new interpretations of the trace-makers behaviour. The data improves the taxonomic understanding of both P. trochoides and S. heberti which require significant taxonomic change and emendation of diagnoses at the species and genus level...|$|R

2500|$|Two {{ideas about}} the {{homology}} of arms, hands and digits have existed in the past 130 years. First that digits are unique to tetrapods [...] and second that antecedents {{were present in the}} fins of early sarcopterygian fish. Until recently it was believed that [...] "genetic and fossil data support the hypothesis that digits are evolutionary novelties".p.640. However new research that created a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reconstruction</b> of Panderichthys, a coastal fish from the Devonian period 385 million years ago, shows that these animals already had many of the homologous bones present in the forelimbs of limbed vertebrates. For example, they had radial bones similar to rudimentary fingers but positioned in the arm-like base of their fins. [...] Thus there was in the evolution of tetrapods a shift such that the outermost part of the fins were lost and eventually replaced by early digits. This change is consistent with additional evidence from the study of actinopterygians, sharks and lungfish that the digits of tetrapods arose from pre-existing distal radials present in more primitive fish. Controversy still exists since Tiktaalik, a vertebrate often considered the missing link between fishes and land-living animals, had stubby leg-like limbs that lacked the finger-like radial bones found in the Panderichthys. The researchers of the paper commented that it [...] "is difficult to say whether this character distribution implies that Tiktaalik is autapomorphic, that Panderichthys and tetrapods are convergent, or that Panderichthys is closer to tetrapods than Tiktaalik. At any rate, it demonstrates that the fish–tetrapod transition was accompanied by significant character incongruence in functionally important structures.".p.638.|$|E

Under the hypothesis that the microvascular architecture of tumours {{is a reflection of the}} histopathological subtype, we performed <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reconstructions</b> of the microvasculature in these subtypes of medulloblastomas and ependymal tumours using computerised image analysis. In addition, we quantitatively assessed three microvascular parameters (number, area, perimeter) in these neoplasms. <b>Three-dimensional</b> <b>reconstructions</b> showed a dense pattern of irregular vessels in classic and large cell medulloblastoma. In desmoplastic medulloblastoma and medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity, the vessels were more unevenly distributed and organised around the nodular areas. Classic medulloblastoma and large cell medulloblastoma had on average the largest vessel area and perimeter. The highest number of vessels was seen in classic medulloblastoma and medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity. Three-dimensional analysis of ependymal tumours showed that low-grade ependymoma had larger but fewer vessels compared to anaplastic ependymoma, while myxopapillary ependymoma had a complex, heterogeneous pattern of vessels and subependymoma few but regular vessels. In ependymal tumours, the highest values for vessel number, vessel area and vessel perimeter were found in anaplastic ependymoma and the lowest values in subependymoma. We conclude that our <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reconstructions</b> shed unprecedented light on the tumour vasculature in medulloblastomas and ependymal tumours and expect that such reconstructions are helpful tools for further studies on tumour angiogenesis...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} whether the new technique of CT-angiography was accurate in displaying the complex anatomy of the aorta and its major branches. METHODS: Seventeen patients {{with a variety of}} aortic pathology were examined. Using a spiral CT-scanner a volumetric scan was made during injection of 150 cc of i. v. contrast. Depending on the chosen CT technique, a body volume with a length ranging between 25 - 100 cm could be examined in one 50 second spiral scan. On the resulting transverse slices vascular lumina and extent of thrombus were studied. Subsequently, the transverse slices were reconstructed in the coronal or sagittal plane in order to appreciate the craniocaudal relations of the vascular anatomy. Finally, <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reconstructions</b> were made of vascular lumina and thrombus. RESULTS: In aortic aneurysms the extent of the aneurysmal dilatation and of the adherent thrombus could be accurately located relative to the origins of renal and visceral branches proximally, and iliac bifurcation distally. In cases of severe elongation, dissection or complex anatomy, a detailed preoperative insight into the individual anatomy could be obtained. The two-dimensional axial and multiplanar reconstructions offered excellent anatomic detail. The <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reconstructions,</b> being based on a considerable data reduction, offered an efficient means of providing an overall view of complex anatomic relations. CONCLUSION: The advantage of CT-angiography is that, based on a single spiral scan, the vascular structures in the examined body volume can be displayed in any desired plane using multiplanar <b>reconstructions.</b> Alternatively, <b>three-dimensional</b> renderings can be created. The combination of multiplanar <b>reconstructions</b> and <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reconstructions</b> makes CT-angiography an accurate technique for displaying even the most complex aortic anatom...|$|R
