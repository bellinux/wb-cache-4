[...] "The public still <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> are married," [...] Sonny {{wrote in his}} diary at the time, [...] " [...] that's {{the way it has}} to be." [...] In February 1974, Sonny filed for a separation, citing [...] "irreconcilable differences". A week later, Cher countered with a divorce suit and charged Sonny with [...] "involuntary servitude", claiming that he withheld money from her and deprived her of her rightful share of their earnings. The couple battled in court over finances and the custody of Chastity, which was eventually granted to Cher. Their divorce was finalized on June 26, 1975.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2014, Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted {{time to the}} {{discussion}} of irony in the episode [...] "Dord". In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Now I Want to Sniff Some Glue" [...] {{contains}} four {{lines of}} minimalist lyrics which depict youthful boredom and inhaling solvent vapors found in glue. On {{the question of}} the authenticity of the text, Dee Dee said in an interview: [...] "I hope no one <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> really sniff glue. I stopped when I was eight [...]" [...] Dee Dee also explained that its concept came from adolescent trauma. After several songs by the Ramones whose titles began with [...] "I Don't Want to... Tommy said that [...] "Now I Want to Sniff Some Glue" [...] is the first positive piece on the album. The song served as an inspiration for one of the first punk fanzines, Mark Perry's Sniffin' Glue. [...] "I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement" [...] is also a minimalist piece, and was inspired by horror movies. The entire text is composed of three lines, and the composition was based on three major chords. With a playing time of 2:35, it is the longest piece on the album.|$|E

2500|$|Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram assured {{parliament}} {{that the}} National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not usurp the States' right in any manner. The central government would {{make use of}} its power only under [...] "extraordinary" [...] circumstances, and depending on {{the gravity of the}} situation, he said. [...] "The agency will also have the powers to return the investigations to the State, if it so <b>thinks.</b> <b>We</b> have struck a balance between the right of the States and duties of the Centre to investigate." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 1906, Morley wrote favourably for staunch {{resistance}} to the railway workers agitation for higher wages. Failure {{to do so would}} damage the Liberal Party with the middle class because [...] "railways are the middle class investment... if anybody <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> can govern this country against the middle class, he is wrong". In 1909 the Liberal Chancellor David Lloyd George increased taxes in his budget (the [...] "People's Budget") to pay for increased armaments and social reform. Morley claimed that behind the budget [...] "hangs the spectre of Tariff Reform" [...] because the public [...] "may say that, if this is the best that can be done under Free Trade, they'll try something else". Morley viewed [...] "the Expenditure of the country" [...] as [...] "the most formidable of our standing problems".|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{began his}} 1843 book Either/Or with a question: [...] "Are passions, then, the pagans of the soul? Reason alone baptized?" [...] He didn't want to devote himself to Thought or Speculation like Hegel did. Faith, hope, love, peace, patience, joy, self-control, vanity, kindness, humility, courage, cowardliness, pride, deceit, and selfishness. These are the inner passions that Thought knows little about. Hegel begins {{the process of}} {{education}} with Thought but Kierkegaard <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> could begin with passion, or {{a balance between the}} two, a balance between Goethe and Hegel. He was against endless reflection with no passion involved. But {{at the same time he}} did not want to draw more attention to the external display of passion but the internal (hidden) passion of the single individual. Kierkegaard clarified this intention in his Journals.|$|E
2500|$|St Thomas Aquinas interprets 'You should {{love your}} {{neighbour}} as yourself' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar {{of love for}} others. Considering that [...] "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" [...] and quotes Aristotle that [...] "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves," [...] he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, {{the good of the}} whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.|$|E
