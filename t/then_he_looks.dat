25|$|Unhappy in school, Napoleon {{writes about}} his {{difficulties}} {{in a letter}} to his family. A bully reports to a monk that Napoleon is hiding letters in his bed, and the monk tears the letter to pieces. Angry, Napoleon goes to visit the attic quarters of his friend Fleuri, a place of refuge where Napoleon keeps his captive bird, a young eagle that was sent to him from Corsica by an uncle. Napoleon tenderly pets the eagle's head, then leaves to fetch water for the bird. The two bullies take this opportunity to set the bird free. Napoleon finds the bird gone and runs to the dormitory to demand the culprit show himself. None of the boys admits to the deed. Napoleon exclaims that they are all guilty, and begins to fight them all, jumping from bed to bed. In the clash, pillows are split and feathers fly through the air as the Minim Fathers work to restore order. They collar Napoleon and throw him outside in the snow. Napoleon cries to himself on the limber of a cannon, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> up to see the young eagle in a tree. He calls to the eagle which flies down to the cannon barrel. Napoleon caresses the eagle and smiles through his tears.|$|E
2500|$|.....think of the {{following}} use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E

60|$|The {{stranger}} {{looked at}} him curiously. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> still more curiously up the passage towards the main entrance. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> back at Brown again, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> very carefully at the window beyond Brown's head, still coloured with the after-glow of the storm. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> seemed to make up his mind. He put {{one hand on the}} counter, vaulted over as easily as an acrobat and towered above the priest, putting one tremendous hand upon his collar.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> {{at it in}} silence. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at me--also in silence.|$|R
60|$|Mike {{finished}} unfastening an obstinate strap. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> up.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's true,' says Gran'dad, holdin' himself in. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at me, an' back to Ned, an' says: 'I can't see ye here. Where ye stoppin'? At the Kenton house?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> on {{the world}} round him; all is well ordered--seasons, animals, sun, and stars abide. They {{continue}} this day according to God's ordinances. The unchangeableness of nature is a comfort to him; for it is a token of the unchangeablenes of God who made it.|$|E
60|$|Ninth. But being wearied out of this, and if God {{loves him}} he will weary {{him out of}} it, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> unto heaven and cries to God for righteousness; the which God shows him in his own good time he hath {{reckoned}} to him, {{for the sake of}} Jesus Christ.|$|E

60|$|The Tinker slept {{until the}} {{afternoon}} {{drew to a}} close and the shadows grew long beside the woodland edge, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> awoke. First <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> up, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> down, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> east, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> west, for <b>he</b> was gathering his wits together, like barley straws blown apart by the wind. First he thought of his merry companion, but <b>he</b> was gone. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> thought of his stout crabstaff, and that he had within his hand. Then of his warrant, and of the fourscore angels he was to gain for serving it upon Robin Hood. He thrust his hand into his pouch, but not a scrap nor a farthing was there. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> sprang to his feet in a rage.|$|R
60|$|The dealer hid a grin. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> a bit bewildered again.|$|R
60|$|Though fairies are the 'phantasmogenetic agencies' {{in second}} sight, a man may acquire the art by magic. A hair rope which has bound a corpse to a bier is wound about him, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> {{backward}} 'through his legs' till {{he sees a}} funeral. The vision of a seer can be communicated to any one who puts his left foot under the wizard's right foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gosh {{blame them}} darned mules," [...] says Straw-top, {{in a voice}} so good that I nearly apologized; [...] "they're a'lus bustin' loose." [...] And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at me close, and then {{he takes off his}} hayseed hat, and says, in a {{different}} voice: [...] "I'd like to shake hands with Parleyvoo Pickens, the greatest street man in the West, barring only Montague Silver, which you can no more than allow." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the story}} is printed you will admire the breathless scene where Van Sweller checks the headlong team. And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> into Amy Ffolliott's eyes and sees two things--the {{possibilities}} of a happiness he has long sought, and a nascent promise of it. He is unknown to her; but he stands in her sight illuminated by the hero's potent glory, she his and he hers by all the golden, fond, unreasonable laws of love and light literature.|$|E

6000|$|... [p.73]But {{sometimes}} he nods over a difficult passage under my very eyes, or he reads {{it over a}} dozen times in the wantonness of idleness, or he takes what school-boys call a long [...] "shot" [...] most shamelessly at the signification. When this happens I lose my temper, and raise my voice, and shout, [...] "Verily there is no power nor might save in Allah, the High, the Great!" [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at me, and with passing meekness whispers- ...|$|E
60|$|I am grieved to {{say that}} on Saturday I stand engaged to dine, at three weeks' notice, with one ----, {{a man who has}} read every book that ever was written, and is a perfect gulf of information. Before {{exploding}} a mine of knowledge he has a habit of closing one eye and wrinkling up his nose, so that he seems perpetually to be taking aim at you and knocking you over with a terrific charge. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> again, and takes another aim. So you are always on your back, with your legs in the air.|$|E
60|$|The amateur nature-lover {{proceeds}} {{over the}} down, appreciating all this {{as hard as}} he can appreciate, and anon gazing up at the grey and white cloud shapes melting slowly from this form to that, and showing lakes, and wide expanses, and serene distances of blue between their gaps. And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> round him for a zoological item. Underfoot the grass of the down is recovering from the summer drought and growing soft and green again, and plentiful little flattened snail shells lie about, and here and there a late harebell still nods in the breeze. Yonder bolts a rabbit, and then something whizzes by the amateur nature-lover's ear.|$|E
60|$|Morel stood watching. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at his son, helplessly, and in horror.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at Ralph, and was quiet, for Ralph had swooned away.|$|R
60|$|Three-quarters {{of an hour}} {{passed before}} <b>he</b> spoke again. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> up.|$|R
60|$|But at {{a certain}} stage of prosperity, as in a balloon ascent, the {{fortunate}} person passes through a zone of clouds, and sublunary matters are thenceforward hidden from his view. He sees nothing but the heavenly bodies, all in admirable order, and positively as good as new. He finds himself surrounded in the most touching manner by the attentions of Providence, and compares himself involuntarily with the lilies and the skylarks. He does not precisely sing, of course; but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> so unassuming in his open landau! If all the world dined at one table, this philosophy would meet with some rude knocks.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{does it in}} this way. He puts five sovereigns {{under his}} hand. That is the limit, you know. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at his card, and pushes it out. With his hand still {{touching}} it, he watches the dealer and, if he can see by his face that his card is a good one--and you can generally tell that--he withdraws his hand with four of the sovereigns, leaving only one on the card. If, on the other hand, he thinks it is a bad one, he leaves the whole five there. He does the trick cleverly enough; but I am certain that I have, four or five times, seen him do it.|$|E

6000|$|SCENE--The Beach at Nice. A woman, beautiful, still young, exquisitely clothed, complacent, poised, reclines {{near the}} water, idly scrawling {{letters in the}} sand with the staff of her silken parasol. The beauty of her face is audacious; her languid pose is one that you feel to be impermanent--you wait, expectant, for her to spring or glide or crawl, like a panther that has unaccountably become stock-still. She idly scrawls in the sand; and the word that she always writes is [...] "Isabel." [...] A man sits a few yards away. You can {{see that they are}} companions, even if no longer comrades. His face is dark and smooth, and almost inscrutable--but not quite. The two speak little together. The man also {{scratches}} on the sand with his cane. And the word that he writes is [...] "Anchuria." [...] And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> out where the Mediterranean and the sky intermingle, with death in his gaze.|$|E
60|$|The idealist, looking first within, {{perceives}} that self-consciousness is {{the great}} fact of life, and that consciousness expresses itself in words or deeds; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> outward, and is aware of another Consciousness that expresses itself in the lowly grass or in the stars of heaven. Looking inward he finds that he is governed by ideas of truth, beauty, goodness and duty; looking outward he everywhere finds evidence of truth and beauty and moral law in the world. He sees, moreover, that while his body changes constantly his self remains the same yesterday, to-day and forever; and again his discovery is {{a guide to the}} outer world, with its seedtime and harvest, which is but the symbol or garment of a Divine Self that abides without shadow of change in a constantly changing universe. To him the only reality is spirit, and spirit cannot be harmed by fire or flood; neither can it die or be buried, for it is immortal and imperishable.|$|E
60|$|But I {{wish you}} to run into neither extreme. I only ask {{you to look at}} your past lives, if you have ever been open sinners, as St. Paul looked at his. There is no sentimental melancholy in him; no pretending to be miserable; no trying to make himself miserable. He is saved, and he knows it. He is an apostle, and he stands boldly on his dignity. He is cheerful, hopeful, joyful: but {{whenever}} he speaks of his past life (and he speaks of it often), it is with noble shame and sorrow. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> to himself the chief of sinners, not worthy to be called an apostle, because he persecuted the Church of Christ. What he is, he will not deny. What he was, he will not forget, he dare not forget, lest he should forget that the good which he does, he does not--for in him (that is, in his flesh, his own natural character), dwelleth no good thing--but Christ, who dwells in him; lest he should grow puffed up, careless, self-indulgent; lest he should neglect to subdue his evil passions; and so, after having preached to others, himself become a castaway.|$|E
