5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} land mass by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>a</b> period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|<b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>a</b> {{decline in}} his career {{at such a young}} age which began soon after the arrival of new manager Alex Ferguson in November 1986, the change of manager coming after a dismal start to the season led to the {{decision}} to sack Ron Atkinson. Whiteside, still only 21, was facing trouble from his right knee which was now beginning to require serious medical procedures to prevent it from causing his retirement. Ferguson put Whiteside back up front, and in turn he scored three times in his first four games back from injury. Ferguson did though have to rebuke Whiteside after some of his numerous drinking sessions. He ended the 1986–87 season with 10 goals in 37 appearances, however United could only manage an 11th-place finish.|$|E
5|$|The {{briefing}} {{process was}} repeated {{with a second}} group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six {{were found to be}} over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>a</b> grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory. Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.|$|E

Volcanic activity resumed with Deakin Volcanics in the north west and south of Canberra. First rhyodacite was erupted followed by tuff, more rhyodacite, tuff with some underwater sediments, and finishing with rhyolite. At least four large eruptions made up this volcanic deposit. Over the top of this in the west near the Murrumbidgee River there was a further massive volcanic eruption, called Laidlaw Volcanics.|$|E

With its two toughest games in the group phase out of the way, the U.S. team reeled off three more wins, beating Norway 5–1, Romania 7–2, and West Germany 4–2 to go 4–0–1 and advance to the medal round from its group, along with Sweden.|$|E

There <b>then</b> <b>came</b> <b>a</b> victory over Nottinghamshire and a close draw against Surrey in the Championship, which left them fourth at the end of May. They then beat Gloucestershire in a 3-day match at Maidstone, which also got them an eight-point deduction for a poor pitch.

25|$|Southampton were {{founding}} {{members of the}} Premier League in 1992–93, but {{spent most of the}} next ten seasons struggling against relegation. In 1995–96, Southampton finished 17th with 38 league points, avoiding relegation on goal difference. Two important wins during the final weeks of the season did much to ensure that Saints and not Manchester City would achieve Premiership survival. First came a 3–1 home win over eventual double winners Manchester United, <b>then</b> <b>came</b> <b>a</b> 1–0 away win over relegated Bolton Wanderers. Former Liverpool and Rangers manager Graeme Souness, was brought in, signing foreign players such as Egil Østenstad and Eyal Berkovic. The highlight of the season was a 6–3 win over Manchester United at The Dell in October, when both his signings scored twice. However, he had to deal with criticism over the Ali Dia debacle. He resigned after just one season in charge, being replaced by Dave Jones who had won promotion to Division One with Stockport County as well as reaching the League Cup semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|The Diocese of Dornakal {{was founded}} on 29 December 1912, when the Rev. Vedanaygam Samuel Azariah was consecrated its first Bishop in St. Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta. The real {{significance}} of the ceremony lay {{in the fact that}} Bishop Azariah was the first Indian to be consecrated a Bishop of the Anglican Communion. When it was first formed in 1912, the Diocese of Dornakal was quite a small diocese in the south-east corner of the Nizam's Dominions. A few years later it was enlarged by the addition of the District of Dummagudem, in which the Church Mission Society was working. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>a</b> Resolution of the Episcopal Synod in the year 1920, which transformed this comparatively small diocese into a diocese which has now probably as large, if not a larger number of Anglican Indian Christians than any other in India. By this resolution all the Mission Districts of both the Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in the Telugu country, were placed under the Episcopal jurisdiction of the Bishop of Dornakal. This means that the present Diocese of Dornakal includes {{a large portion of the}} Krishna district, together with the part of the Godavari district named Dummagudem; parts of the Kurnool and Cuddapah districts to the south occupied by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel; also the areas in the Hyderabad State occupied by the Indian Missionary Society of Tinnevelly, the Singareni Mission, the Khammamett Mission (formerly under the Church Missionary Society), and the then recently formed Dornakal Diocesan Mission.|$|E
25|$|When {{he came to}} a {{cave and}} lodged there, God asked him what he was doing there. Elijah said that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told Elijah to stand on the mount, and God passed by. A great wind rent the mountains, and broke the rocks in pieces, but God was not in the wind. Then an {{earthquake}} came, but God was not in the earthquake. Then a fire came, but God was not in the fire. And <b>then</b> <b>came</b> <b>a</b> still small voice, which asked him what he was doing there. Elijah repeated that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told him to go to Damascus and anoint Hazael to be king over Aram, to anoint Jehu to be king over Israel, and to anoint Elisha to succeed Elijah as prophet. God foretold that any who escaped the sword of Hazael would be killed by Jehu; any who escaped the sword of Jehu would be killed by Elisha; and God would leave alive in Israel only the 7 thousand who had not bowed to Baal. So Elijah found Elisha, who was plowing with one of his 12 yoke of oxen, and Elijah cast his mantle on Elisha. Elisha left the oxen, asked Elijah for permission to kiss his parents goodbye, killed the oxen and distributed their meat to the people, and went to follow Elijah.|$|E

25|$|In {{the human}} level, with the {{development}} of consciousness, love, although continuous with its lower forms, attains a higher form because of its relation to reason. In the beginning these two factors are in a natural harmony, but the one doesn't have conscious access to the other. Each one operates almost separately from the other. <b>Then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> stage where reason and love come in rapport and conflict with each other, yet the important factor is that they start coming simultaneously in the conscious sphere. <b>Then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> third stage where a synthesis of love and reason is achieved to bring an altogether new type of consciousness, best described as superconsciousness.|$|R
