5|$|As a primate brain, {{the human}} brain has a much larger {{cerebral}} cortex, in proportion <b>to</b> <b>body</b> size, than most mammals, and a highly developed visual system.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{typically}} have quite small brains relative <b>to</b> <b>body</b> size {{compared with other}} vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal. However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative <b>to</b> <b>body</b> weight as birds and marsupials.|$|E

5|$|All {{those with}} a risk of {{exposure}} <b>to</b> <b>body</b> fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already. Testing to verify effective immunization is recommended and further doses of vaccine are given {{to those who are}} not sufficiently immunized. In 10- to 22-year follow-up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among {{those with a}} normal immune system who were vaccinated. Only rare chronic infections have been documented.|$|E
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage <b>to</b> <b>body</b> tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive. Although critics felt that it lacked a classic single and considered it a minor letdown compared <b>to</b> <b>Body</b> Talk Pt. 1, it received praise for being solid and club-ready. In Sweden, the album {{reached the top of}} the Sverigetopplistan chart. It also reached number one in Denmark and number three in Norway. In the United States, it peaked at number forty-one, becoming Robyn's highest position on the chart.|$|E

5|$|Despite Reich's {{precarious}} mental health, {{his work}} on character {{and the idea of}} muscular armouring contributed to the development of what is now known as ego psychology, gave rise <b>to</b> <b>body</b> psychotherapy, and helped shape the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, the bioenergetic analysis of Reich's student Alexander Lowen, and the primal therapy of Arthur Janov.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{possibility}} of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known lungless tetrapods are amphibians. The majority of salamander species are lungless salamanders, which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their mouth. This necessarily restrict their size: all are small and rather thread-like in appearance, maximising skin surface relative <b>to</b> <b>body</b> volume. Other known lungless tetrapods are the Bornean flat-headed frog and Atretochoana eiselti, a caecilian.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds {{remain in}} the air and do not settle on the ocean. They produce very little oil from their uropygial glands so their {{feathers}} would become sodden if they settled on the surface. In addition, with their long wings relative <b>to</b> <b>body</b> size, they would have great difficulty taking off again.|$|E

5|$|Lex Luger's {{rivalry with}} Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge {{on the deck}} of the USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>body</b> slam Yokozuna, Luger arrived in a helicopter. He was able <b>to</b> <b>body</b> slam Yokozuna, which led to a title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the Lex Express. Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he had to wear protective padding over the steel plate in his forearm.|$|E
5|$|Like most known tyrannosaurids, Tarbosaurus {{was a large}} bipedal predator, {{weighing}} up to five tonnes and equipped with about sixty large teeth. It had a unique locking mechanism in its lower jaw and the smallest forelimbs relative <b>to</b> <b>body</b> size of all tyrannosaurids, renowned for their disproportionately tiny, two-fingered forelimbs.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, the hindlimbs were stocky {{and short}} {{compared}} <b>to</b> <b>body</b> length. The tibia (lower leg bone) of Majungasaurus was even stockier {{than that of}} its relative Carnotaurus, with a prominent crest on the knee. The astragalus and calcaneum (ankle bones) were fused together, and the feet bore three functional digits, with a smaller first digit that did not contact the ground.|$|E
50|$|The silver cord in meta{{physical}} {{studies and}} literature, {{also known as}} the sutratma or life thread of the antahkarana, refers to a life-giving linkage from the higher self (atma) down <b>to</b> the physical <b>body.</b> It also refers to an extended synthesis of this thread and a second (the consciousness thread, passing from the soul <b>to</b> the physical <b>body)</b> that connects the physical <b>body</b> <b>to</b> the etheric <b>body,</b> onwards <b>to</b> the astral <b>body</b> and finally <b>to</b> the mental <b>body.</b>|$|R

5|$|Most bovids {{alternately}} {{feed and}} ruminate throughout the day. While those that feed on concentrates feed and digest in short intervals, the roughage feeders take longer intervals. Only small {{species such as}} the duiker browse {{for a few hours}} during day or night. Feeding habits are related <b>to</b> <b>body</b> size; while small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed upon high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands.|$|E
5|$|One set of {{characteristics}} relate <b>to</b> <b>body</b> size and temperature. The metabolic theory of ecology provides a predictive qualitative set {{of relationships between}} an organism’s body size and temperature and metabolic processes. In general, smaller, warmer organisms have higher metabolic rates and {{this results in a}} variety of predictions regarding individual somatic growth rates, reproduction and population growth rates, population size, and resource uptake rates.|$|E
5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Hulk Hogan {{defended his}} title against Yokozuna. Yokozuna {{controlled}} {{the beginning of}} the match until he ran at Hogan in the corner but missed an avalanche splash. Hogan tried twice <b>to</b> <b>body</b> slam Yokozuna but could not pick him up. Yokozuna performed a bear hug on Hogan and tried to pin him after executing a belly to belly suplex. Hogan kicked Yokozuna in the face three times and knocked him down to the mat. He performed a leg drop, his signature move, on Yokozuna but was unable to pin him. As Hogan prepared to attempt <b>to</b> <b>body</b> slam Yokozuna, manager Harvey Wippleman, disguised as a planted photographer, jumped up onto the edge of the ring. His camera exploded in Hogan's face, which allowed Yokozuna to knock Hogan down and perform a leg drop. Yokozuna pinned Hogan to regain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and performed a Banzai drop on Hogan after the match.|$|E

5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative <b>to</b> <b>body</b> size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
5|$|Because {{language}} {{emerged in}} the early prehistory of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and {{it is believed that}} no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative <b>to</b> <b>body</b> mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Computed tomography, {{also known}} as CT scanning, of a {{complete}} Majungasaurus skull (FMNH PR 2100) allowed a rough reconstruction of its brain and inner ear structure. Overall, the brain was very small relative <b>to</b> <b>body</b> size, but otherwise similar to many other non-coelurosaurian theropods, with a very conservative form closer to modern crocodilians than to birds. One difference between Majungasaurus and other theropods was its smaller flocculus, a region of the cerebellum that helps to coordinate movements of the eye with movements of the head. This suggests that Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids like Indosaurus, which also had a small flocculus, did not rely on quick head movements to sight and capture prey.|$|E
500|$|In Re Finger, Goff J made a {{distinction}} between gifts <b>to</b> incorporated <b>bodies</b> and gifts <b>to</b> unincorporated <b>bodies.</b> When a gift is <b>to</b> an unincorporated <b>body,</b> it must be treated, whatever the wording, as a gift <b>to</b> that <b>body's</b> purpose. This is because unincorporated bodies cannot possess things. If the <b>body</b> has ceased <b>to</b> exist but the purpose continues, the gift has not failed. Incorporated bodies {{on the other hand}} can possess property, and as such, as said by Buckley J in Re Vernon's Will Trust, [...] "A bequest <b>to</b> a corporate <b>body</b> ... takes effect simply as a gift <b>to</b> that <b>body</b> beneficially, unless there are circumstances which show that the recipient is to take the gift as a trustee." ...|$|R
