5|$|The Al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo {{seems to}} have had a similar {{projecting}} entrance to the Great Mosque of Mahdiya. The original building had an open central courtyard with three arcades. Its layout was similar to the Kairouan and Samarra mosques. These had round arches on pre-Islamic columns with Corinthian capitals. There were three domes (indicative of the location of <b>the</b> <b>prayer</b> hall), two at the corners of the qibla wall and one over <b>the</b> <b>prayer</b> niche, and a small brick minaret over the main entrance. The gallery around the courtyard had series of columns and <b>the</b> <b>prayer</b> hall, which had the domes built over it, had five more rows of five pillars.|$|E

25|$|Except in the Dialogue Mass form, which arose about 1910 {{and led to}} a {{more active}} {{exterior}} participation of the congregation, the people present at the Tridentine Mass do not recite out loud <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> of <b>the</b> Mass.

5|$|George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester who {{had earlier}} praised Lang's work for church unity, said that Lang's failure {{to take a}} lead after <b>the</b> <b>Prayer</b> Book {{rejection}} of 1928 meant that the Church of England {{had been unable to}} revise its forms of worship or take any effective control of its own affairs. Others have argued that Lang's laissez-faire approach to <b>the</b> <b>Prayer</b> Book controversy helped to defuse a potentially explosive situation and contributed to an eventual solution. Lang himself was gloomy about his legacy; he believed that since he had not led his country back into an Age of Faith, or marked his primacy with a great historical act, he had {{failed to live up to}} his own high standard. Others have judged him more charitably, praising his industry, his administrative ability and his devotion to duty.|$|E
