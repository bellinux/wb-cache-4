5|$|On {{the east}} coast of Florida, Klaus {{produced}} 15foot (4.5m) waves and tides of 3feet (1m) above normal. Beach erosion was reported along {{the east coast}}, due to persistent easterly winds. As the remnant moisture of Klaus entered <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> it produced heavy rainfall between 10–15inches (250–380mm) of rainfall in South Carolina, with slightly lower totals in North Carolina. In South Carolina, the rainfall caused a dam to burst, killing four people. About two days after the remnants of Klaus entered <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Tropical Storm Marco made landfall on northwestern Florida, dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region.|$|E
