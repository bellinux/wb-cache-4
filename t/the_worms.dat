5|$|Operating {{close to}} the power station is a fishing bait company, Seabait. Seabait uses some of the excess hot water that the plant generates to grow worms four {{times as fast as}} in the wild. <b>The</b> <b>worms</b> are used for several purposes, {{primarily}} for providing worms as bait while fishing. However, <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> are also frozen, packaged and exported to seafood farms. This is seen as environmentally beneficial as it reduces the need for bait digging in natural habitats.|$|E
5|$|Worms Armageddon is a 2D {{artillery}} turn-based tactics {{video game}} developed by Team17 {{and part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Worms</b> series. The player controls a team of up to eight worms in combat against opposing teams either AI- or player-controlled, using weapons both based on real-life weapons and ones that are cartoonish. The player can customize battles, teams, and maps for near-infinite gameplay options.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having {{to make all the}} choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E

5000|$|The hook is then {{inserted}} into the head region of <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> and exits <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> about 1/4 of an inch down <b>the</b> <b>worm.</b> <b>The</b> <b>worm</b> is then moved up the hook towards the shank and then rotated so that <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> is now 'locked' on the shank. The point of the hook is then threaded back {{into the body of}} <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> to make <b>the</b> rig weedless.|$|R

As the cat tries {{to blow out}} <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> with a pump, Foghorn once again {{interrupts}} him and pushes him around. As Foghorn tries to blow out <b>the</b> <b>worm,</b> <b>the</b> cat grabs <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> and begins to fish. <b>The</b> <b>worm</b> is about to do his part by force, when Foghorn {{comes out of the}} pond, takes <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> and yet again scolds and pushes the cat around.|$|R
5|$|Marsh rice rats from Paynes Prairie, Alachua County; Cedar Key, Levy County; and Lake Istokpoga, Highlands County, all in Florida, {{have yielded}} A.forresteri. In Paynes Prairie, the type locality, 82 of 178 animals {{examined}} were infected with 1 to 50 (average 10) worms, but in Cedar Key {{only a single}} rat contained one worm. <b>The</b> <b>worms</b> {{were found in the}} front part, or fundus, of the stomach, with their front ends in the fundal tissue and their back ends projecting into the inside.|$|E
5|$|Paterson's worms are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings {{are determined by the}} configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to {{the point at which the}} worm currently is. Despite being governed by simple rules the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{discovers that}} two worms put {{together}} will kill each other. When the investigators place one of <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> into the infected dog, it recovers. Against Scully's objections, Hodge and Da Silva try {{to place the}} other worm into Mulder and Hodge realizes that Da Silva is the infected person. He and Mulder restrain the hysterical Da Silva and place the last worm inside her. When they are rescued, Da Silva is quarantined {{and the others are}} released. Although Mulder wants to return to the site, he is told that it has been destroyed by the government.|$|E

50|$|An {{indication}} of <b>the</b> <b>worm's</b> infection {{of a given}} PC is {{the existence of the}} file C:\WIN.LOG or C:\WIN2.LOG on the PC's hard disk, as well as seemingly random crashes with LSASS.EXE on the screen caused by faulty code used in <b>the</b> <b>worm.</b> <b>The</b> most characteristic symptom of <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> is <b>the</b> shutdown timer that appears due to <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> crashing LSASS.exe.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>worm</b> {{was found}} {{a few hours before}} it was {{successfully}} removed, and based on data that was recorded (due to <b>the</b> <b>worm's</b> original intent for research purposes) <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> was able to infect uninfected profiles after they were sanitized forcefully by developers of Justin.tv. <b>The</b> <b>worm</b> was sanitized once more after the vulnerability was patched, and it was able to be removed easily. However, this shows the ability for <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> to adapt and spread even after counter-attack.|$|R
5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite {{to continue with the}} next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E
5|$|The worm {{removed from}} Bear {{is kept in}} a jar, and another is {{recovered}} {{from one of the}} scientists' bodies. Mulder (believing that <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> are extraterrestrial) wants them kept alive, but Scully feels that they should be destroyed to prevent infection. The group check each other for black nodules and find none, although Mulder reminds Scully that the nodules disappeared from the dog over time. When Mulder finds Murphy in the freezer with his throat cut, the others (including Scully) believe that he has become infected and killed Murphy. Mulder is then locked in a storeroom.|$|E
5|$|Worms Armageddon {{includes}} {{a very high}} level of customizability – in multiplayer games or skirmishes, the player can create custom game modes with preferred gameplay options and weapon sets. Regular options include starting health, whether <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> can move, how long a turn lasts, and sudden death options. Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates and how often, and how powerful individual weapons are. Worms Armageddon offers several levels of customizability outside of direct gameplay options.|$|E
50|$|In a worm-and-gear set, <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> {{can always}} drive the gear. However, if the gear {{attempts}} to drive <b>the</b> <b>worm,</b> it {{may or may}} not succeed. Particularly if the lead angle is small, the gear's teeth may simply lock against <b>the</b> <b>worm's</b> teeth, because <b>the</b> force component circumferential to <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> is not sufficient to overcome friction.|$|R

The executable of <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> is 10,000 bytes in size; a list of spammed newsgroups and mail addresses is stored on the infected hard drive. <b>The</b> <b>worm</b> spreads only if the Winsock library is not set to read-only.|$|R
5|$|While in Egypt, Fairley {{investigated}} schistosomiasis (then {{known as}} bilharzia). The disease {{was known to}} be caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, the disease was easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a complement fixation test for the disease {{along the lines of the}} Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> in the circulatory system could be cured by intravenous tartaric acid. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and bacillary dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Worms Armageddon was {{originally}} intended to be an expansion pack to Worms 2, but it was eventually developed as a standalone game. It {{was intended to be}} the last game of <b>the</b> <b>Worms</b> franchise, but Andy Davidson, the creator of Worms, felt that it needed more content before being released, leading to the development of Worms World Party. It was also going to be released under the name Wormageddon, but Team17 changed the name to Worms Armageddon because of close similarities to {{the name of the game}} Carmageddon. It was released initially for PCs in 1999 in Europe and on 31 May 1999 in North America and has since been ported to Dreamcast and PlayStation on 30 November 1999, Game Boy Color on 19 January 2000, and Nintendo 64 on 30 March 2000. The Nintendo 64 version is one of the first Nintendo 64 games to feature a terrain editor and generator. A Macintosh version was being developed by MacSoft, but it has since been cancelled. Worms Armageddon was produced by Martyn Brown and composed by Bjørn Lynne, Karl Morton was the game's lead programmer, and Dan Cartwright was the game's lead artist.|$|E

50|$|A {{worm drive}} is a gear {{arrangement}} {{in which a}} worm (which is a gear {{in the form of}} a screw) meshes with a worm gear (which is similar in appearance to a spur gear). The two elements are also called <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> screw and <b>worm</b> wheel. <b>The</b> terminology is often confused by imprecise use of <b>the</b> term <b>worm</b> gear to refer to <b>the</b> <b>worm,</b> <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> gear, or <b>the</b> <b>worm</b> drive as a unit.|$|R

25|$|The pyramid {{method of}} {{harvesting}} worm compost {{is commonly used}} in small-scale vermiculture, and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins. In this process, compost is separated into large clumps, which is placed back into composting for further breakdown, and lighter compost, with which {{the rest of the}} process continues. This lighter mix is placed into small piles on a tarp under the sunlight. <b>The</b> <b>worms</b> instinctively burrow {{to the bottom of the}} pile. After a few minutes, the top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> are again visible. This repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms usually {{began to}} appear six to 11 days after initial infection, {{beginning}} with a fever and cough. Most cases reported a progression to a persistent cough, leading to expectoration and sometimes hemoptysis. Worms in the bronchial region can trigger a chronic, nonproductive cough and asthma-like symptoms due to the obstruction of airways by <b>the</b> <b>worms.</b> These symptoms, along with a low-grade fever, can last several months if not initially diagnosed correctly. A scratching or crawling sensation can be felt in the throat if <b>the</b> <b>worms</b> are attached in the larynx.
