5|$|<b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> Uttararama {{follow a}} {{different}} style from <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> the previous Anuradhapura period, and show some significant differences. The identity of the standing image is subject to {{a certain amount of}} dispute among historians and archaeologists, some of whom argue that it depicts the monk Ananda rather than the Buddha. Each of the images have been carved in a way that uses a maximum possible area of the rock, and their heights seem to have been decided based on the height of the rock itself. Each statue appears to have had its own image house, as indicated by the remains of brick walls at the site. The Uttararama was where Parakramabahu I held a congregation of monks to purify the Buddhist priesthood, and later drew up a code of conduct for them. This code of conduct has been recorded in an inscription on the same rock face containing <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> the Buddha.|$|E
