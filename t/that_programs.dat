This project has been {{kept up to date}} to run on all variants of the S60 platform and there are several third party modules available. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, with the feature <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> can be both written and run on the target device.|$|E
5|$|The {{emphasis}} on liberal {{arts in the}} revised degree titles (for both the A.L.B. and A.L.M. degrees) {{was not intended to}} signify a difference in the degree itself versus the University's other offerings, but instead to serve as a response to concerns expressed by some <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> catering to non-traditional students were overly vocational in nature. The purpose of the name was to reaffirm adherence to the University's historic focus on the liberal arts, and distinguish it from other, more vocational, institutions.|$|E
5|$|In the Computer Edge case, the Australian court {{decided against}} the then-prevailing {{opinions}} in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) and ruled object code was not copyrightable, while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v. Mackintosh reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was {{a translation of}} source code and embodied in a silicon chip, it was therefore a translation of an original literary work expressed in a material form and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of copyright. The Canadian court opined <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> within ROM silicon chips are protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code {{is a form of}} translation. It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an idea in another form, but rather only applies to the expression of an idea in another language, and that a translation has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages.|$|E

He {{and his wife were}} not on relief but they were employed by the WPA as statisticians. Friedman said <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> like the CCC and WPA were justified as temporary responses to an emergency. Friedman said that Roosevelt deserved considerable credit for relieving immediate distress and restoring confidence.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} issue was that early Macs lack a memory {{management}} unit (MMU), which precludes the possibility of several fundamental modern features. An MMU would provide memory protection to ensure <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> cannot accidentally overwrite other program's memory, and it would provision shared memory. Lacking shared memory, the API was instead written so the operating system and application shares all memory, which is what allows QuickDraw to examine the application's memory for settings like the line drawing mode or color.|$|E
25|$|On August 31, 2007, Apple {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> on NBC's 2007–08 television schedule {{would not}} be available on iTunes. NBC had informed Apple the previous day that it {{would not be}} renewing its contract. It was later clarified that this change only applied to series produced by NBC Universal-owned Universal Media Studios, including Universal-produced shows on other networks such as House. NBC programs produced by other studios, such as Chuck (Warner Bros.) and Journeyman (20th Century Fox), would remain available on iTunes.|$|E

25|$|Dickens and Flynn (2001) {{have argued}} that genes for high IQ {{initiate}} an environment-shaping feedback cycle, with genetic effects causing bright children to seek out more stimulating environments that then further increase their IQ. In Dickens' model, environment effects are modeled as decaying over time. In this model, the Flynn effect {{can be explained by}} an increase in environmental stimulation independent of it being sought out by individuals. The authors suggest <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> aiming to increase IQ would be most likely to produce long-term IQ gains if they enduringly raised children's drive to seek out cognitively demanding experiences.|$|E
25|$|ECLAC {{states that}} in order to create better {{economic}} relations globally, international lending agencies must work with developing countries to change how and where credit is concentrated as well as work towards accelerating financial development in developing countries. ECLAC further suggests that the United Nations expand its agenda to work more rigorously with international lending agencies and that they become more inclusive of all nations. Key factors in achieving universal competition is the spread of knowledge at the State level through education, training and technological advancements. Economist Jagdish Bhagwati suggested <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> to help developing countries adjust to the global economy would be beneficial for international economic relations.|$|E
25|$|Reading from NOR flash {{is similar}} to reading from random-access memory, {{provided}} the address and data bus are mapped correctly. Because of this, most microprocessors can use NORflash memory as execute in place (XIP) memory, meaning <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> stored in NORflash can be executed directly from the NORflash without needing to be copied into RAM first. NORflash may be programmed in a random-access manner similar to reading. Programming changes bits from a logical one to a zero. Bits that are already zero are left unchanged. Erasure must happen a block at a time, and resets all the bits in the erased block back to one. Typical block sizes are 64, 128, or 256KiB.|$|E

25|$|The 1968 festival {{was halted}} on 19 May. Some directors, such as Carlos Saura and Miloš Forman, had {{withdrawn}} their films from the competition. On 18 May, filmmaker Louis Malle {{along with a}} group of directors took over the large room of the Palais and interrupted the projections in solidarity with students and labour on strike throughout France, and in protest to the eviction of the then President of the Cinémathèque Française. The filmmakers achieved the reinstatement of the President, and they founded the Film Directors' Society (SRF) that same year. In 1969, the SRF, led by Pierre-Henri Deleau created the Directors' Fortnight (Quinzaine des Réalisateurs), a new non-competitive section <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> a selection of films from around the world, distinguished by the independent judgment displayed in the choice of films.|$|E
25|$|Another kind of {{production}} involves {{the creation of}} programs {{for the analysis of}} computational systems. In the NKS framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.|$|E
