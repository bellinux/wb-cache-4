They were not people of fashion, as we readily perceived, but kindly-looking mercantile folk, and ladies painted as white as newly calcimined house walls; and all gravely polite. There was one gentleman as large round as a hogshead, with a triple arrangement of fat {{at the back of his}} neck which was fascinating. He always bowed when we met (necessarily with his whole back) and he ate with an appetite proportioned to his girth. I could wish still to know who and what he was, for he was a person very much to my mind. So was the head waiter, dark, silent, clean-shaven, who let me use my deplorable Spanish with him, till in the last days he came out with some very fair English which he had been courteously concealing from me. He looked own brother to the room-waiter in our corridor, whose companionship I could desire always to have. One could not be so confident of the sincerity of the little camarera who slipped out of the room with a soft, sidelong [...] "De nada" [...] at one's thanks for the hot water in the morning; but one could stake one's life on the goodness of this camarero. He was not so tall as his leanness made him look; he was of a national darkness of eyes and hair which as imparted to his tertian clean-shavenness was a deep blue. He spoke, with a certain hesitation, a beautiful Castilian, delicately lisping the sibilants and strongly <b>throating</b> the gutturals; and what he said you could believe. He never was out of the way when wanted; he darkled with your boots and shoes in a little closet next your door, and came from it with the morning coffee and rolls. In a stress of frequentation he appeared in evening dress in the dining-room at night, and did honor to the place; but otherwise he was to be seen only in our corridor, or in the cold, dark chamber at the stair head where the camareras sat sewing, kept in check by his decorum. Without being explicitly advised of the fact, I am sure he was the best of Catholics, and that he would have burnt me for a heretic if necessary; but he would have done it from his conscience and for my soul's good after I had recanted. He seldom smiled, but when he did you could see it was from his heart.|$|E
50|$|The <b>throating</b> issue exists {{because in}} the USA it has been {{traditional}} to have short chambers so that the bullet is being engraved {{at the moment of}} insertion. European practice has more of a forcing cone construction which can, by itself, allow significantly higher chamber pressure. All Sig-Sauer handguns (for example) have European <b>throating</b> and all are certified to fire +P ammunition. Short <b>throating</b> and unnoticed bullet setback can easily increase chamber pressures by more than 10,000 psi.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Throat</b> packs are {{routinely}} placed in (para) nasal surgery, {{based on the}} assumption they prevent postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) by preventing blood and wound debris to run into the hypopharynx and being swallowed. Literature suggests a <b>throat</b> pack does not lower the incidence of PONV, but does cause more postoperative <b>throat</b> pain. In addition a <b>throat</b> pack bares possible dangers, such as postoperative asphyxia. Objective: The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the influence of a <b>throat</b> pack on the incidence and severity of postoperative <b>throat</b> pain. Influence of insertion mode (manual vs. under direct vision) was also addressed. Lastly, incidence and severity of PONV were evaluated to get an impression of the effectiveness of <b>throat</b> packs. Methods: We designed an observational prospective trial comparing the research group of (para) nasal surgery patients in whom a <b>throat</b> pack is used with a control group of diverse surgery patients, also operated under general anaesthesia and endotracheal intubated. Incidence and severity of <b>throat</b> pain and PONV were recorded directly postoperative and 24 hours postoperative. Results: A <b>throat</b> pack increases the chance on suffering from <b>throat</b> pain (OR 2. 4) due to a higher incidence directly postoperative. <b>Throat</b> pain was severe both directly postoperative and 24 hours postoperative when a <b>throat</b> pack was placed. No statistical significant differences were found in incidence and severity of PONV, neither between research and control group nor between modes of inserting the <b>throat</b> pack. Conclusion: A <b>throat</b> pack causes significantly more and severe postoperative <b>throat</b> pain than endotracheal intubation alone. Insertion mode does not influence the effectiveness of hypopharyngeal packing. PONV incidence and severity after (para) nasal surgery with a routinely placed <b>throat</b> pack does not differ from a general surgery population, suggesting the <b>throat</b> pack is effective in preventing PONV evoked by blood in the stomach. ...|$|R

30|$|On {{the basis}} of analysis, {{it can be found}} that the main {{influential}} factor of porosity is <b>throat</b> radius; the main influential factors of permeability include <b>throat</b> radius, <b>throat</b> radius uniformity coefficient, aspect ratio and coordination number; the main influential factors of relative permeability include <b>throat</b> radius uniformity coefficient, aspect ratio, wettability, shape of pore <b>throat,</b> and coordination number. It also indicates that wettability and shape of pore <b>throat</b> have a greater impact on irreducible water saturation; aspect ratio and shape of pore <b>throat</b> affect residual oil saturation largely. Additionally, the micro-parameters that influence the ratio of endpoint relative permeability to a great extent are <b>throat</b> radius uniformity coefficient, aspect ratio, and coordination number.|$|R

30|$|The average pore <b>throat</b> radius is {{positively}} correlated with the water-free and ultimate stage oil displacement efficiencies, with respective correlation coefficients of 0.8256 and 0.9025 (Fig.  10). When the <b>throat</b> radius is less than 1  µm, oil displacement efficiency sharply increases with the increasing <b>throat</b> radius, which then turns to be gentle when the <b>throat</b> radius is greater than 1  µm. This indicates the influence of <b>throat</b> radius and <b>throat</b> permeability contribution curve on oil displacement efficiency. Under the same experimental conditions, more evenly distributed <b>throat</b> radius can contribute to smoother seepage path, larger sweeping area, and higher displacement efficiency {{when it comes to}} the <b>throats</b> with similar or equal radius. As the main factor influencing oil displacement efficiency, <b>throat</b> radius can more intuitively and truly characterize the reservoir under the action of sedimentary and diagenetic alternation.|$|R

50|$|A <b>throat</b> {{culture is}} a {{laboratory}} diagnostic test that evaluates {{for the presence of}} a bacterial or fungal infection in the <b>throat.</b> A sample from the <b>throat</b> is collected by swabbing the <b>throat</b> and placing the sample into a special cup (culture) that allows infections to grow. If an organism grows, the culture is positive and the presence of an infection is confirmed. The type of infection is found using a microscope, chemical tests, or both. If no infection grows, the culture is negative. Common infectious organisms tested for by a <b>throat</b> culture include Candida albicans known for causing thrush and Group A streptococcus known for causing strep <b>throat,</b> scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. <b>Throat</b> cultures are more sensitive (81% sensitive) than the rapid strep test (70%) for diagnosing strep <b>throat,</b> but are nearly equal in terms of specificity.|$|R
