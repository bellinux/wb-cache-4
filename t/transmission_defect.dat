40|$|Many {{clinical}} features of autosomal centronuclear myopathies (CNM) and X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) {{are common to}} congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). We describe three children whose clinical and electrophysiological findings originally suggested CMS, in whom CNM was diagnosed pathologically, though not yet genetically characterised. A fourth case, with XLMTM, also showed electrophysiological features of a neuromuscular <b>transmission</b> <b>defect.</b> Three (including the XLMTM case) showed improved strength with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment. We also studied neuromuscular junction structure and function in the MTM 1 knockdown zebrafish model of XLMTM, demonstrating abnormal neuromuscular junction organization; anticholinesterase therapy resulted in marked clinical response. These observations suggest that a neuromuscular <b>transmission</b> <b>defect</b> may accompany CNM and contribute to muscle weakness. Muscle biopsy {{should be considered in}} infants suspected to have CMS, especially if treatment response is incomplete, or no CMS gene mutation is identified. Treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may benefit some CNM patients. This warrants further confirmation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring the {{formation}} of neuronal circuits, axon path-finding decisions specify the location of synapses on the correct brain side and in correct target areas. We investigated a possible link between axon midline crossing and the subsequent development of output synapses formed by these axons. Conditional knockout of Robo 3 in the auditory system forced a large commissural synapse, the calyx of Held, to be exclusively formed on the wrong, ipsilateral side. Ipsilateral calyx of Held synapses showed strong <b>transmission</b> <b>defects,</b> with reduced and desynchron-ized transmitter release, fewer fast-releasable vesi-cles, and smaller and more variable presynaptic Ca 2 + currents. <b>Transmission</b> <b>defects</b> were not observed in a downstream inhibitory synapse, and some defects persisted into adulthood. These results suggest that axon midline crossing conditions functional maturation of commissural synapses, thereby minimizing the impact of mislocalized synap-ses on information processing. This mechanism might be relevant to human disease caused by mutations in the ROBO 3 gene...|$|R

40|$|The exocyst, {{a complex}} of eight proteins, {{contributes}} to the morphogenesis of polarized cells in {{a broad range of}} eukaryotes. In these organisms, the exocyst appears to facilitate vesicle docking at the plasma membrane during exocytosis. Although we had identified orthologs for each of the eight exocyst components in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), no function has been demonstrated for any of them in plants. The gene encoding one exocyst component ortholog, AtSEC 8, is expressed in pollen and vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis. Genetic studies utilizing an allelic series of six independent T-DNA mutations reveal a role for SEC 8 in male gametophyte function. Three T-DNA insertions in SEC 8 cause an absolute, male-specific <b>transmission</b> <b>defect</b> that can be complemented by expression of SEC 8 from the LAT 52 pollen promoter. Microscopic analysis shows no obvious abnormalities in the microgametogenesis of the SEC 8 mutants, and the mutant pollen grains appear to respond to the signals that initiate germination. However, in vivo assays indicate that these mutant pollen grains are unable to germinate a pollen tube. The other three T-DNA insertions are associated with a partial <b>transmission</b> <b>defect,</b> such that the mutant allele is transmitted through the pollen at a reduced frequency. The partial <b>transmission</b> <b>defect</b> is only evident when mutant gametophytes must compete with wild-type gametophytes, and arises in part from a reduced pollen tube growth rate. These data support the hypothesis that one function of the putative plant exocyst is to facilitate the initiation and maintenance of the polarized growth of pollen tubes...|$|E
40|$|GRMZM 2 G 372877 was {{identified}} as a gene with potential function in the male gametophyte based on its strong expression in mature pollen relative to other maize tissues (Chettoor et al. 2014). Identification of a Ds insertion mutation in this gene from the Brutnell/Vollbrecht collection provided further support for this hypothesis, as initial data indicated the insertion was associated with a male-specific <b>transmission</b> <b>defect.</b> In this study, we confirmed the location of GRMZM 2 G 372877 on chromosome 9, approximately 25 map units away from wx 1. We used linkage of the Ds insertion to Wx 1 +, as well as PCR genotyping, to follow up on the initial results, confirming a male-specific <b>transmission</b> <b>defect</b> from mutant heterozygotes. Because the severity of the <b>transmission</b> <b>defect</b> varied with different crosses (2 % to 13 %), we tested the idea that the defect decreased pollen fitness when in competition with wild-type pollen. Consistent with this idea, we found that male transmission of the mutation increases in frequency when less pollen is applied to the silk (12 % to 43 %). Based on DNA sequence, we found GRMZM 2 G 372877 was orthologous to a gene (delegen 14) included in a 65 -kb deletion associated with the rice no-pollen mutant (Osnop) (Jiang et al 2005), suggesting a conserved function for this gene in pollen. We have tentatively named the gene nop 1 *, and it encodes a protein with C 2 and GRAM domains that are predicted to interact with calcium and phosphoinositides, respectively. Results from microscopy experiments, to visualize specific cellular defects, and to help better determine the function for this gene in pollen or pollen tube development, will also be presente...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCongenital {{stationary}} {{night blindness}} (CSNB) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous retinal disorder which represents rod photoreceptor dysfunction or signal <b>transmission</b> <b>defect</b> from photoreceptors to adjacent bipolar cells. Patients displaying photoreceptor dysfunction show a Riggs-electroretinogram (ERG) while {{patients with a}} signal <b>transmission</b> <b>defect</b> show a Schubert–Bornschein ERG. The latter group is subdivided into complete or incomplete (ic) CSNB. Only few CSNB cases with Riggs-ERG and only one family with a disease-causing variant in SLC 24 A 1 have been reported. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a previously diagnosed icCSNB patient identified a homozygous nonsense variant in SLC 24 A 1. Indeed, re-investigation of the clinical data corrected the diagnosis to Riggs-form of CSNB. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified compound heterozygous deletions and a homozygous missense variant in SLC 24 A 1 in two other patients, respectively. ERG abnormalities varied in these three cases but all patients had normal visual acuity, no myopia or nystagmus, unlike in Schubert–Bornschein-type of CSNB. This confirms that SLC 24 A 1 defects lead to CSNB and outlines phenotype/genotype correlations in CSNB subtypes.

Methods: 67 subjects with increased fatigue and new weakness in one quadriceps muscle showing neuromuscular <b>transmission</b> <b>defects,</b> were included in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of 60 mg pyridostigmine {{four times a day}} for 14 weeks. Primary outcome was fatigue (on the "energy'' category of the Nottingham health profile). Secondary outcomes included two minute walking distance and quadriceps strength and jitter. Motor unit size of the quadriceps was studied as a potential effect modifier. The primary data analysis compared the changes from baseline in the outcomes in the last week of treatment between groups. Results: 31 subjects treated with pyridostigmine and 31 subjects treated with placebo completed the trial. No significant effect of pyridostigmine was found on fatigue. The walking distance improved more in the pyridostigmine group than in the placebo group (by 7. 2 m (6. 0 %); p < 0. 01). Subgroup analysis showed that a significant improvement in walking performance was only found in subjects with normal sized motor units. Quadriceps strength improved more in the pyridostigmine group than in the placebo group (by 6. 7 Nm (7. 2 %); p= 0. 15). No effect of pyridostigmine was found on jitter. Conclusions: Pyridostigmine in the prescribed dose did not reduce fatigue in subjects with postpoliomyelitis syndrome.

In this study, we demonstrate that SIRT 6 is highly expressed in the retina, controlling levels of histone H 3 K 9 and H 3 K 56 acetylation. Notably, despite apparent normal histology, SIRT 6 deficiency caused major retinal <b>transmission</b> <b>defects</b> concomitant to changes in expression of glycolytic genes and glutamate receptors, as well as elevated levels of apoptosis in inner retina cells.

To explore ROP 2 function in maize, we isolated five Mutator transposon insertions (rop 2 ::Mu alleles). Transmission frequency through the male gametophyte, but not the female, was lower than expected {{in three of the}} rop 2 ::Mu mutants. These three alleles formed an allelic series {{on the basis of the}} relative transmission rate of each when crossed as trans-heterozygotes. A dramatic reduction in the level of ROP 2 -mRNA in pollen was associated with the three alleles causing a <b>transmission</b> <b>defect,</b> whereas a rop 2 ::Mu allele that did not result in a defect had wild-type transcript levels, thus confirming that mutation of rop 2 causes the mutant phenotype. These data strongly support a role for rop 2 in male gametophyte function, perhaps surprisingly, given the expression in pollen of the nearly identical duplicate gene rop 9. However, the <b>transmission</b> <b>defect</b> was apparent only when a rop 2 ::Mu heterozygote was used as the pollen donor or when a mixture of wild-type and homozygous mutant pollen was used. Thus, mutant pollen is at a competitive disadvantage compared to wild-type pollen, although mutant pollen grains lacked an obvious cellular defect.

40|$|The exocyst, an {{eukaryotic}} tethering complex, co-regulates targeted exocytosis as an effector {{of small}} GTPases in polarized cell growth. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by {{double or triple}} paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO 70 paralogs. Out of 23 Arabidopsis EXO 70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in pollen. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in EXO 70 A 2, C 1, C 2, F 1, H 3, H 5, and H 6 genes revealed that only a loss-of-function EXO 70 C 2 allele resulted in a significant male-specific <b>transmission</b> <b>defect</b> (segregation 40 %: 51 %: 9 %) due to aberrant pollen tube growth. Mutant pollen tubes grown in vitro exhibited enhanced growth rate and a decreased thickness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, exo 70 C 2 pollen tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go growth dynamics. A pollen-specific depletion of the closest paralog, EXO 70 C 1, using ami-RNA in the exo 70 C 2 mutant background resulted in a complete pollen-specific <b>transmission</b> <b>defect,</b> suggesting redundant functions of EXO 70 C 1 and EXO 70 C 2. Both EXO 70 C 1 and EXO 70 C 2, GFP-tagged and expressed under their native promoters, localized in the cytoplasm of pollen grains, pollen tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. Expression of EXO 70 C 2 -GFP complemented aberrant growth of exo 70 C 2 pollen tubes. The absent EXO 70 C 2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO 70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO 70 C 2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal tip growth of Arabidopsis pollen tubes...|$|E

However, inappropriate treatments during the machining process can generate a number of defects in the optic fiber sensors. Therefore, the quality of optic fiber sensors fabricated using CO 2 laser machining must be analyzed. The results show that analysis of the fiber core size after machining can provide preliminary defect detection, and qualitative analysis of the optical <b>transmission</b> <b>defects</b> {{can be used to}} identify imperfections that are difficult to observe through size analysis. To more precisely and quantitatively detect fabrication defects, we included a tensile test and numerical aperture measurements in this study. After a series of quality inspections, we proposed improvements to the existing CO 2 laser machining parameters, namely, a vertical scanning pathway, 4 W of power, and a feed rate of 9. 45 cm/s. Using these improved parameters, we created optical fiber sensors with a core diameter of approximately 400 μm, no obvious optical <b>transmission</b> <b>defects,</b> a numerical aperture of 0. 52 ± 0. 019, a 0. 886 Weibull modulus, and a 1. 186 Weibull-shaped parameter.

The process of male gametogenesis depends upon relatively poorly understood mechanisms of gamete cell production, but the male germline-specific R 2 R 3 MYB transcription factor DUO 1 is an essential factor in germ cell division and gamete differentiation in Arabidopsis. One major objective of the thesis {{was to assess the}} validity of Brewbaker’s evidence that Magnoliaceae possess exclusively bicellular pollen at anthesis. This analysis provided conclusive evidence of the coexistence of polymorphic (bicellular and tricellular) pollen in Magnoliaceae species. Further, the maturation of pollen under increased temperature regimes can significantly accelerate the rate of generative cell division in M. grandiflora. A second major aim was to identify sequence and functional conservation of DUO 1 orthologs genes in angiosperms and bryophytes. This study provided further evidence that a supernumerary lysine residue in the DUO 1 MYB domain is widely conserved and the sequences and expression of two DUO 1 orthologs from moss (Physcomitrella patens) were validated. Arabidopsis, tomato and rice DUO 1 orthologs were shown to transactivate Arabidopsis DUO 1 target promoters. The expression of angiosperm DUO 1 orthologs were able to complement the generative cell division and genetic <b>transmission</b> <b>defects</b> in duo 1 mutants, demonstrating conservation of function of DUO 1 orthologs in Arabidopsis. The final objective was to investigate the functional conservation of DAZ 1 /DAZ 2 –related proteins in other angiosperms.

Using genetics, pharmacology, and electrophysiology, we show that EEL- 1, the HUWE 1 ortholog in C.  elegans, preferentially regulates GABAergic presynaptic transmission. Decreasing or increasing EEL- 1 function alters GABAergic transmission and the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance in the worm motor circuit, which leads to impaired locomotion and increased sensitivity to electroshock.

40|$|SummaryThe orally {{transmitted}} retrovirus mouse mammary {{tumor virus}} (MMTV) requires the intestinal microbiota for persistence. Virion-associated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), stimulating {{production of the}} immunosuppressive cytokine IL- 10 and MMTV evasion of host immunity. However, the mechanisms by which MMTV associates with LPS remain unknown. We find that the viral envelope contains the mammalian LPS-binding factors CD 14, TLR 4, and MD- 2, which, in conjunction with LPS-binding protein (LBP), bind LPS to the virus and augment transmission. MMTV isolated from infected mice lacking these LBPs cannot engage LPS or stimulate TLR 4 and have a <b>transmission</b> <b>defect.</b> Furthermore, MMTV incorporation of a weak agonist LPS from Bacteroides, a prevalent LPS source in the gut, significantly enhances the ability of this LPS to stimulate TLR 4, suggesting that MMTV intensifies these immunostimulatory properties.

To gain more insight into this pathological process, it is of fundamental importance to establish when during the fly life cycle the lack of TBPH affects motoneuron activity and {{whether this is a}} reversible phenomenon. To achieve this, we conditionally expressed the endogenous protein in TBPH minus Drosophila neurons and found that TBPH is a short lived protein permanently required for Drosophila motility and synaptic assembly through the direct modulation of vesicular proteins, such as Syntaxin 1 A, indicating that synaptic <b>transmission</b> <b>defects</b> are early pathological consequences of TBPH dysfunction in vivo. Importantly, TBPH late induction is able to recover synaptogenesis and locomotion in adult flies revealing an unexpected late-stage functional and structural neuronal plasticity.

Visual field testing by Goldmann perimetry showed blind-spot enlargement, and mfERG showed corresponding amplitude reductions. Conclusions: We speculate that the intense hyperautofluorescent material at the outer border of the peripapillary zone might be accumulated drusenoid lipofuscin...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana {{that carry}} {{mutations}} in CYCLOARTENOL SYNTHASE 1 (CAS 1) which {{is required in}} sterol biosynthesis have been described. Knockout mutant alleles are responsible of a male-specific <b>transmission</b> <b>defect.</b> Plants carrying a weak mutant allele cas 1 - 1 accumulate 2, 3 -oxidosqualene, the substrate of CAS 1, in all analyzed organs. Mutant cas 1 - 1 plants develop albino inflorescence shoots that contain low amount of carotenoids and chlorophylls. The extent of this albinism, which affects Arabidopsis stems late in development, may be modulated by the light/dark regime. The fact that chloroplast differentiation and pigment accumulation in inflorescence shoots {{are associated with a}} low CAS 1 expression could suggest the involvement of 2, 3 -oxidosqualene in a yet unknown regulatory mechanism linking the sterol biosynthetic segment, located in the cytoplasm, and the chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthetic segments, located in the plastids, in the highly complex terpenoid network. CAS 1 loss of function in a mosaic analysis of seedlings further demonstrated that leaf albinism associated with an accumulation of 2, 3 -oxidosqualene is a novel phenotype for plant sterol deficient mutant...|$|E
40|$|Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen, {{dramatically}} alters its {{protein profile}} {{when it is}} transmitted between ticks and mammals. Several differentially expressed proteins {{have been shown to}} be critical for the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi. In this study, we demonstrated that expression of the surface lipoprotein-encoding gene bba 07 is induced by an elevated temperature and a reduced pH during in vitro cultivation, as well as during nymphal tick feeding. Expression of bba 07 is regulated by the Rrp 2 -RpoN-RpoS pathway, a central regulatory network that is activated during nymphal feeding. By generating a bba 07 mutant of an infectious strain of B. burgdorferi, we demonstrated that although BBA 07 -deficient spirochetes were capable of infecting mice via needle inoculation and surviving in ticks, they were defective in infection of mammals via tick transmission. Complementation of the bba 07 mutant with a wild-type copy of bba 07 partially restored the <b>transmission</b> <b>defect</b> of the bba 07 mutant. Based on these findings, we concluded that the surface lipoprotein BBA 07 is produced during tick feeding and facilitates optimal transmission of B. burgdorferi from the tick vector to a mammalian host...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{studies have}} {{revealed}} significant overlaps of risk genes among psychiatric disorders. However, {{it is not}} clear how different mutations of the same gene contribute to different disorders. We characterized two lines of mutant mice with Shank 3 mutations linked to ASD and schizophrenia. We found both shared and distinct synaptic and behavioral phenotypes. Mice with the ASD-linked InsG 3680 mutatio n manifest striatal synaptic <b>transmission</b> <b>defects</b> before weaning age and impaired juvenile social interaction, coinciding with the early onset of ASD symptoms. On the other hand, adult mice carrying the schizophrenia-linked R 1117 X mutation show profound synaptic defects in prefrontal cortex and social dominance behavior. Furthermore, we found differential Shank 3 mRNA stability and SHANK 1 / 2 upregulation in these two lines. These data demonstrate that different alleles of the same gene may have distinct phenotypes at molecular, synaptic, and circuit levels in mice, which may inform exploration of these relationships in human patients.

40|$|To {{identify}} genes with essential {{roles in}} male gametophytic development, including postpollination (progamic) events, we have undertaken a genetic screen based on segregation ratio distortion of a transposon-borne kanamycin-resistance marker. In {{a population of}} 3359 Arabidopsis Ds transposon insertion lines, we identified 20 mutants with stably reduced segregation ratios arising from reduced gametophytic transmission. All 20 mutants showed strict cosegregation of Ds and the reduced gametophytic transmission phenotype. Among these, 10 mutants affected {{both male and female}} transmission and 10 mutants showed male-specific <b>transmission</b> <b>defects.</b> Four male and female (ungud) mutants and 1 malespecific mutant showed cellular defects in microspores and/or in developing pollen. The 6 remaining ungud mutants and 9 male-specific (seth) mutants affected pollen functions during progamic development. In vitro and in vivo analyses are reported for 5 seth mutants. seth 6 completely blocked pollen germination, while seth 7 strongly reduced pollen germination efficiency and tube growth. In contrast, seth 8, seth 9, or seth 10 pollen showed reduced competitive ability that was linked to slower rates of pollen tube growth. Gene sequences disrupted in seth insertions suggest essential functions for putative SETH proteins in diverse processes including protein anchoring, cell wall biosynthesis, signaling, and metabolism...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether strength decline in post-polio syndrome (PPS) results from excessive distal axonal degeneration of enlarged motor units. We assessed changes over 10 years in isometric quadriceps strength, mean motor unit action potential (MUAP) size, root mean squared (RMS) amplitude, {{and level of}} interference (LOI) in 47 patients with PPS and 12 healthy controls, using high density surface EMG. At baseline, all patients had symptomatic quadriceps dysfunction, evidenced by <b>transmission</b> <b>defects</b> on single-fibre EMG. MU size and strength declined significantly by 20 % and 15 %, respectively in patients with PPS. Those with the largest initial MU sizes exhibited the greatest losses of mean MU size (27 %) and proportional decreases in quadriceps strength (23 %). Initial strength, change in LOI and change in RMS amplitude together explained 35 % of the variability in strength changes in patients. MU size of controls did not change, although they lost 29 % strength. MU size and strength declined concomitantly in a homogeneous cohort of patients with PPS and quadriceps dysfunction. This long term follow-up study provides evidence that size diminution of enlarged MUs combined with a reduced number of active MUs contributes to the gradual strength decline in PP...|$|R
