40|$|We {{incorporate}} partially {{informed decision}} makers into games of communication through cheap talk. We analyze three different extensive-form {{games in which}} <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> and <b>the</b> decision maker (DM) privately observe signals {{about the state of}} the world. In game 1, the DM reveals her private signal to <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> before <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> reports to her. In game 2, the DM keeping her signal private while <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> reports to her. In game 3, the DM strategically communicates to <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> first before <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> reports to her. We find that the DM’s expected equilibrium payoff is not monotonically increasing in the informativeness of her private signal because <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> may reveal less of his information when facing a better-informed DM. Whether the DM extracts more information from <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> in game 1 or in game 2 depends on the parameters. Allowing the DM to communicate strategically to <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> first does not help her extract more information from <b>the</b> <b>expert.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} model of {{delegated}} expertise designed to analyze executive compensation. An expert has to pick one of two possible decisions. By exerting effort <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> can obtain private information on these decisions. <b>The</b> <b>expert’s</b> decision and its ultimate performance realization are publicly observed, but <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> information is not. In other words, the principal observes <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> decision and its realization, but does not know whether <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> expended effort to obtain information and whether he made an efficient decision conditional on the information he received. We characterize the optimal compensation contract among those that give <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> incentives to obtain information to determine the efficient decision {{and to make the}} decision that is efficient contingent on the obtained information. We show that: 1) It is generically optimal to make pay contingent on the decision made by <b>the</b> <b>expert,</b> not only on performance; 2) <b>The</b> <b>expert</b> is often rewarded for choosing alternatives that are ex-ante inefficient. 3) When decisions differ in their complexity, optimal pay-performance may be zero if <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> chooses <b>the</b> complex alternative. Our model highlights novel factors that should be considered in the design of executive compensation contracts, sheds light on existing compensation practices, such as rewarding executives for acquisitions, and suggests mechanisms to promote managerial innovation. ...|$|R

5|$|Gascoigne {{was then}} given a {{significant}} opportunity {{that became the}} focus of the remainder of his paid academic career: to help establish one of the world's largest optical telescopes, at Siding Spring. In the early 1960s, the Australian and British governments proposed a partnership to build a joint optical telescope facility, and Gascoigne was among <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> involved. Former Mount Stromlo director and now head of the Greenwich observatory, Richard Woolley, was prominent in supporting the project from the British end. In 1967, the two governments formally agreed to collaborate on the construction of a large telescope, {{to be known as the}} Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Given the existing infrastructure of the ANU's Siding Spring Observatory, the site was readily agreed as the location for the AAT. Gascoigne was one of the four members of the Technical Committee established to guide the telescope's development. He provided leadership on the design and optics of the new telescope, and was made the chief commissioning astronomer in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe {{grew up in}} South Australia, {{and studied}} at St Peter's College, Adelaide in his youth. There he earned the {{attention}} of cricket watchers for his skill and his suspect action. Halcombe was suspected of throwing, meaning an illegal bowling action in which a player straightens his arm {{in the process of}} delivering the ball, thereby throwing it, whereas the laws of cricket required that a bowler did not change the angle of his elbow in delivering the ball. In 1923, while still a schoolboy, he was observed by former England captain Archie MacLaren (who was currently visiting Australia as part of the Marylebone Cricket Club team) and former Australia captain and all rounder George Giffen. To test the legitimacy of Halcombe's action, his wrist, forearm and elbow were encased in splints, so that he could not move his elbow position.

5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the {{thousands}} of pages of evidence gathered. The selection of works puzzles <b>the</b> <b>experts,</b> specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the finial, the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} whether a career-minded expert would make better decisions if the principal could observe {{the consequences of}} <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action. <b>The</b> previous literature has found that this “transparency of consequence ” can only improve the efficacy of <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> decision making. We show, however, that this conclusion is very sensitive to the specified cost structure. While learning the consequences of <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action makes <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> more likely to choose the action most likely to correspond to the true state of the world, when costs are asymmetric, this {{may be associated with}} a decrease in the principal’s expected welfare. In addition, for a range of parameters, if the principal benefits from learning the consequences of <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action, her utility is higher if she observes only the consequences and not the action taken. As such, the optimal transparency regime will involve either the principal observing only <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action or only the consequences of <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action; it will but never be optimal to observe both.
