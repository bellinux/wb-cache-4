40|$|This {{study is}} {{predicated}} on a strong belief that the gender make-up of African parliamnets must relfect the gender demographics of African states. It is only when that is achieved that the concepts of equality, non-discrimination and democracy can gain their true meaning. As a departure point, the study makes a case that statistically women are under-represented across {{the overwhelming majority of}} African parliaments. The study asserts that the under-representation is prevalent amid the existence of international, regional and domestic instruments, all providing for women's right to representation in decision-making processes. Thus, the study demonstrates that there is a gap between de jure and de facto representation. The study then argues that the convoluted ideology of patriarchy, sacrosanct cultures, inviolable religions, the constructed public/private dichotomy, low levels of education, and the negative impact of globalisation all act in concert to deny African women their rightful place in decision-making institutions, particluarly parliaments. In a bid to investigate how this can be reserved, the study explores the Rwandan and South African models for purposes of gaining insights on how they have contrived to reach and surpass the critical mass of women in their parliaments. These two models demonstrate that a combination of <b>temporary</b> <b>special</b> <b>measures</b> and gender mainstreaming are effective tools for emancipating women and ensuring their representation in parliaments. These have to be buttressed by strong legal and institutioanl frameworks, which operate in a conducive socio-political environment. " [...] Abstract.

40|$|The {{socio-cultural}} {{background in}} Malta is very specific, having {{developed over the}} centuries {{as a result of}} our historical and geographical position 1. The Maltese archipelago lies in the middle of the Mediterranean, where east meets west and north meets south, and has had a long history of colonialism due to this politically strategic position. Malta is extremely small in comparison to other European countries, has one of the highest population densities in the world, is an island group (with resultant insularity), is strongly Catholic, displays strong primacy of the ‘family’, and as found by Abela (1994), is rather traditional and quite resistant to divergent value systems. Notwithstanding some prevailing sexist attitudes within the general population, the legal structures have been changing over the last 50 years (since women won the right to vote) to acknowledge, and enhance, the equal status of women. During this period, the ‘breadwinner’s wage’ 2 was abolished, the public sector removed its ban on employment of married women, and more recently, a government Commission and Secretariat (which was later given the higher status of Department) were set up to work on addressing gender issues. In 1991 amendments to the Constitution were passed that allowed redress against discrimination based on sex, and further allowed for the possibility of <b>special</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>measures</b> to be introduced which are aimed a...|$|R

40|$|Vulnerable and/or intimidated court {{users are}} able to give {{evidence}} {{with the assistance of}} <b>special</b> <b>measures.</b> This thesis examines the role of equality in the provision of such measures to those giving evidence in Crown Court trials. I adopt Keith Hawkins’ conceptual framework of surround, field and frames to analyse the multitude of factors relevant to understanding its role. The standard of equality I invoke is that which underpinned the initial development of <b>special</b> <b>measures</b> for non-defendant witnesses. This is used to assess whether the law remains committed to equal treatment despite the unequal provision of <b>special</b> <b>measures</b> between vulnerable and/or intimidated defendant and non-defendant witnesses. Furthermore, using findings from interviews undertaken with 18 criminal practitioners, I consider the role that the principle of equality appears to play in the use of <b>special</b> <b>measures.</b> I conclude that the principle of equality is not consistently upheld in the provision of <b>special</b> <b>measures</b> in law and practice. Barriers to its more prominent role include the way, and the socio-political context in which, <b>special</b> <b>measures</b> law developed; the legal field in which they are invoked; and the way that criminal practitioners appear to frame decisions about their use...|$|R
