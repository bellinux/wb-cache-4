5|$|Certain Christian groups, {{most notably}} those in some King James Only denominations, {{consider}} {{all types of}} rock and metal music to be opposition to <b>their</b> <b>faith,</b> regardless of lyrical content or the lifestyles of the band members. However, fans and artists see metal as another genre of music, parallel to such genres as blues, classical, jazz, punk, and hip-hop. Bands such as Showbread and Antestor believe that the instrumentation of the music is simply a medium of art, while the person creating the music {{as well as the}} lyrics being presented provide the message. Therefore, Christian metal is created when Christians compose metal music in a way that reflects <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> in Christ.|$|E

5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b> God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{position}} of the Christians and Jews of the empire became increasingly apparent. The Jews had earned imperial toleration {{on account of the}} great antiquity of <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b> They had been exempted from Decius's persecution and continued to enjoy freedom from persecution under Tetrarchic government. Because <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> was new and unfamiliar and not typically identified with Judaism by this time, Christians had no such excuse. Moreover, Christians had been distancing themselves from their Jewish heritage for their entire history.|$|E
5|$|Heathenry, also termed Heathenism or Germanic Neopaganism, is {{a modern}} Pagan religion. Scholars of {{religious}} studies classify Heathenry as a new religious movement. Its practitioners model <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> on the pre-Christian belief systems adhered to by the Germanic peoples of Iron Age and Early Medieval Europe. To reconstruct these past belief systems, Heathenry uses surviving historical, archaeological, and folkloric evidence as a basis, although approaches to this material vary considerably.|$|E

50|$|Chala Jews {{were unable}} to return to <b>their</b> true Jewish <b>faith</b> due to the fatal {{consequences}} associated with leaving the Islamic faith.

5|$|Barnard Castle School (colloquially Barney School or locally the County School) is a co-educational {{independent}} day and {{boarding school}} in the market town of Barnard Castle, County Durham, in the North East of England. It {{is a member of}} The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC). It was founded in 1883 with funding from a 13th-century endowment of John I de Balliol and the bequest of the local industrialist Benjamin Flounders. The ambition was to create a school {{of the quality of the}} ancient public schools at a more reasonable cost, whilst accepting pupils regardless of <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because the {{faithful}} {{are obliged to}} attend Mass {{unless there is a}} grave impediment, pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept.... Yet more than a precept, the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of Christian life. It is crucially important that all {{the faithful}} should be convinced that they cannot live <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> or share fully {{in the life of the}} Christian community unless they take part regularly in the Sunday Eucharistic assembly.|$|E

5|$|During {{the end of}} {{his final}} season at Vicenza, Baggio {{shattered}} both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the meniscus of his right knee while playing against Rimini on 5 May 1985, while attempting a slide tackle. The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and it seriously threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not play again, Fiorentina retained <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> in him, agreeing to commit to the transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of many reasons for Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> and religious practice on the Torah, five books {{said to have been}} given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented {{only a small fraction of}} the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E

5|$|Periyar viewed Christianity {{similar to}} the monotheistic faith of Islam. He {{explained}} that <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> says {{that there can be}} only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.|$|E

5|$|The Christians, {{believing that}} this tribulation came upon {{them for their}} neglect of the Law of God and their {{religious}} duties, began to fervently read the Krista Purana, an epic poem {{on the life of}} Jesus Christ written by the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens (1549–1619). On discovering this, some Muslims destroyed the books, but the Christians constructed subterranean refuges in which to perform their religious devotions, read the books, and strengthen <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b> According to Mr. Silva of Gangollim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment ordered by Tipu was amputation of the ears, nose, feet and one hand.|$|E

Members of the confraternity serve as teachers in the Sunday Schools of the parish (there are seven different Sunday Schools belonging to Mt. St. Peter's in total). These teachers send out the Catholic messages of faith and love through words, stories, examples, and prayers in order to help the children grow in <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b> The majority of children who attend one of the Sunday Schools are ages 6–12.|$|E
5|$|This {{refers to}} the Seven Sleepers, the Catholic legend of seven Christian {{children}}, persecuted for <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> {{during the reign of}} the Roman emperor Decius, who fled to the shelter of a cave where they slept for more than 200 years. Donne, one of six or seven children and a baptised Catholic during a time of strong anti-Catholic sentiment from both the populace and the government, would certainly have been familiar with the story.|$|E
5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b> Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E
