40|$|A multivariable modal {{analysis}} technique is presented for evaluating flexible aircraft dynamics, focusing on meaningful vehicle responses to pilot inputs and atmospheric turbulence. Although {{modal analysis}} is the <b>tool,</b> <b>vehicle</b> time response is emphasized, and {{the analysis is}} performed on the linear, time-domain vehicle model. In evaluating previously obtained experimental pitch tracking data {{for a family of}} vehicle dynamic models, it is shown that flexible aeroelastic effects can significantly affect pitch attitude handling qualities. Consideration of the eigenvalues alone, of both rigid-body and aeroelastic modes, does not explain the simulation results. Modal analysis revealed, however, that although the lowest aeroelastic mode frequency was still three times greater than the short-period frequency, the rigid-body attitude response was dominated by this aeroelastic mode. This dominance was defined in terms of the relative magnitudes of the modal residues in selected vehicle responses...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{intensive}} wind tunnel tests, this study provides an effective and accurate approach to estimate the operational driving speed limit on bridges subjected to different road conditions and wind intensities, through a convenient continuous simulation technique (CSP). A fast and vigorous simulation <b>tool,</b> <b>vehicle</b> performance simulation, is developed to effectively model the performance of vehicles traveling on bridges by considering the interactions between wind, vehicles, and the bridge. The CSP, on the other hand, dramatically reduces the data generation time and makes a reliability analysis of vehicles possible. The application of the proposed method on the Confederation Bridge in Canada {{is presented as a}} numerical example. The simulation result overrides the general impression that only high-sided vehicles are sensitive to wind attacks, and this work demonstrates that light-weighted vehicles are also likely to suffer from instability problems on bridges under relatively low wind velocity. In addition, different types of vehicle can undergo different instability mechanisms under the same wind condition and these vehicle instability mechanisms vary with wind velocity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Driving {{at night}} time {{increases}} the risk of accidents because the driver’s perception is reduced to the limited area of the environment which is illuminated by the car’s head lights. In the study presented in this paper, the <b>tool</b> <b>Vehicle</b> in the Loop (VIL) is used the first time to research the potential of a new light function. VIL is a Virtual Reality application and simulation setup which allows for testing driver assistance systems in critical driving situations while driving a real car, but without the risk of collisions with real objects. VIL is based on the Virtual Test Drive (VTD) simulation software. The Active Safety Light is an advanced light functionality which illuminates the potential escape path a driver should take in order to avoid an imminent accident. The two main results of this first field study are, that VIL is suitable to study advanced light functions and that the Active Safety Light supports the driver in critical situations. The driver reacts nearly 60 ms faster and the situation is estimated as more critical so that the driver brakes instinctively harder, i. e. the break pressure is increased by almost a factor of two.

40|$|Abstract — The {{application}} of SiC devices (as battery interface, motor controller, etc.) in a {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) will benefit from their high-temperature capability, high-power density, and high efficiency. Moreover, the light weight and small volume will affect the whole power train system in a HEV, and thus performance and cost. In this work, the performance of HEVs is analyzed using PSAT (Powertrain System Analysis <b>Tool,</b> <b>vehicle</b> simulation software). Power loss models of a SiC inverter are incorporated into PSAT powertrain models in order to study the impact of SiC devices on HEVs. Two types of HEVs are considered. One is the 2004 Toyota Prius HEV, {{the other is a}} plug-in HEV (PHEV), whose powertrain architecture is {{the same as that of}} the 2004 Toyota Prius HEV. The vehicle-level benefits from the introduction of the SiC devices are demonstrated by simulations. Not only the power loss in the motor controller but also those in other components in the vehicle powertrain are reduced. As a result, the system efficiency is improved and the vehicles consume less energy and emit less harmful gases. It also makes it possible to improve the system compactness with simplified thermal management system. For the PHEV, the benefits are more distinct. Especially, the size of battery bank can be reduced for optimum design...|$|E

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Elsevier Limited [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]Recent studies have reported that males show better naming of nonliving things than females, while females show better naming of living things than males. Such effects may reflect sex differences in the size of lexicons across categories or their access/retrieval strategies. These possibilities were examined in three experiments using semantic fluency tasks for two living (animals, fruits) and two nonliving (<b>tools,</b> <b>vehicles)</b> categories. Experiment 1 documented better fluency for ???fruits??? in females (n= 300) and for ???<b>tools???</b> and ???<b>vehicles???</b> in males (n= 300). Experiment 2 examined fluency consistency by re-testing a subgroup of subjects again 30 min later. This confirmed the pattern across sex and revealed that subjects reproduced 70 % of the same words (even when not instructed to do so). Finally, in Experiment 3, a new sample of male and female subjects was tested for 4 min to exhaust their fluency lexicons and overcome access/strategy effects. This confirmed the female advantage for fruits and male advantage for tools. These findings are consistent with differences in the size of lexicons for males and females and are attributed to sex differences in domain-specific processing systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of high-performance rechargeable batteries for power <b>tools</b> or hybrid <b>vehicles</b> {{has proved to}} be an extremely challenging task because of the need to simultaneously meet multiple battery performance requirements, like high energy (watt-hours per unit battery mass or volume), high power (watts per unit battery mass or volume), long life (5 - 10 years and some hundreds of deep charge-discharge cycles), low cost (measured per unit battery capacity), resistance to abuse and operating temperature extremes, perfect safety and minimal environmental impact. Despite years of intensive worldwide R&D, no battery can meet all of these goals. The use of lithium ion batteries in power <b>tools,</b> <b>vehicles</b> or other applications were high amounts of energy have to be stored in the battery are limited because of safety risks and the lack of safety mechanisms. A wider use of lithium ion batteries for power <b>tools</b> or hybrid <b>vehicles</b> requires safer battery materials and intelligent b attery packaging concepts. The required physical and electrical properties and safety of the lithium ion batteries are supposed to be achieved by the introduction of new materials, e. g. alternative electrode materials and electrolytes. The focussed applications require new designs for the electrode contact deposition, for the heat management and the combination of the single cells into battery modules. In this paper we will focus on the possibilities to improve safety and high temperature performance of lithium ion batteries. The focus will be on nano-scale electrode materials and alternative electrolytes, especially ionic liquids...|$|R
