5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment {{on the possibility of}} holding the confirmation of charges hearings in Kenya rather than in The Hague. This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea of holding <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> in Arusha, Tanzania, which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{sometimes}} gruesome testimony {{it was generally}} believed <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> were politically motivated and that individual excesses could largely be traced only to Lang and Dorcas Williams, both {{of whom had been}} acting under the orders of a Marine Corps officer who had since been committed to an insane asylum. Both of the accused gendarmerie officers had been indicted by U.S. Navy court-martial prior to <b>the</b> <b>hearings.</b> A separate inquiry conducted by the Haitian government concluded that, outside of 10 killings attributed to Lang and Williams, the gendarmerie's conduct of the war had been justifiable.|$|E

5|$|In early 1949, {{physicist}} Robert Bacher {{stepped down}} from the Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal wanted a physicist to replace Bacher, and they ultimately recommended Smyth for the position. President Harry Truman nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth resign as Physics Department chairman. (His old colleague Allen Shenstone took up the post.) Smyth was the commission's only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending hearings of the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> inquired into a small amount of uranium that was alleged to be unaccounted for in AEC labs. Smyth later condemned <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> as grounded in misconceptions about the work of nuclear scientists.|$|E

5|$|Of {{far greater}} {{importance}} to McCarthy than the committee's inconclusive final report was the negative {{effect that the}} extensive exposure had on his popularity.

5|$|McCarthy's {{hearings}} are often incorrectly conflated with <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC).

HUAC was a House committee, and as such had no formal connection with McCarthy, who served in the Senate, although the existence of the House Un-American Activities Committee thrived in part as a result of McCarthy's activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938-1975).|$|E

5|$|The often uproarious and {{spectacular}} Cuocolo trial attracted {{a lot of}} attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States, including by Pathé's Gazette.
