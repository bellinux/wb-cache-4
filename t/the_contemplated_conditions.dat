40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} innovations and profits from a Schumpeterian perspective using the analytical tools of modern classical economics. The concept of "circular flow" is formalised and Schumpeter's zero-profits assumption investigated. Next a typology of process innovations is discussed using a simple two-sector framework. In Schumpeter profits are transitional phenomena. In <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>contemplated,</b> increases in labor productivity will lead to rising real wages. The argument is generalized to product-cum-process innovations in systems with joint production where a bad that is costly to dispose of {{is transformed into a}} good that can be marketed profitably. ...|$|R
40|$|Adoctor in {{the course}} of {{rendition}} of medical service to his patient shall comply with certain legal requirements. Accordingly he shall obtain the consent of a patient and the consent so obtained must be an informed one. He shall exercise reasonable care and skill in rendering his professional services. Any lapse on his part in this regard invites liability in the form of trespass for non-consensual treatment and tortious or contractual liability for medical negligence and failure to obtain an informed consent. In <b>the</b> above <b>contemplated</b> circumstances, a doctor attracts liability for deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act, subject to <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>contemplated</b> there in. A patient, if successful in proving medical negligence {{on the part of a}} doctor is entitled for compensation which has its own economic ramification both on the doctor as well as the patient. In this article, an attempt is made to critically analyse the concept of medical negligence from the legal and economic perspective...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} (AI) is a {{group of}} techniques that have quite a potential to be applied to pavement engineering and management. In this study, we developed a practical, flexible and out of the box approach to apply genetic algorithms to optimizing the budget allocation and the road maintenance strategy selection for a road network. The aim is to provide an alternative to existing software and better fit the requirements of an important number of pavement managers. To meet the objectives, a new indicator, named Road Global Value Index (RGVI), was created to <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> pavement <b>condition,</b> the traffic and the economic and political importance for each and every road section. This paper describes the approach and its components by an example confirming that genetic algorithms are very effective for the intended purpose. ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{moving to}} Glasgow as a {{teenager}} to find work as a compositor, McHugh {{found himself in a}} city with various possibilities for developing his education as a social reformer. The Irish who had fled to the city in such numbers after the Great Famine were finally starting to organise themselves politically. Native Scots of all classes, especially those Gaels who had come from the Highlands as a result either of the Clearances or the region’s own famine in <b>the</b> 1840s, were <b>contemplating</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> in which the working classes of Glasgow, and other towns in Scotland, were forced to live. As a member of the Glasgow Home Rule Association, and then the secretary of the Glasgow branch of the Irish Land League, McHugh was singled out as a speaker and organiser of ability, and was chosen to lead a Land League mission to the Scottish Highlands in order to direct the nascent crofters’ agitation along radical lines. After the death of the Land League, McHugh toured Scotland with Henry George himself, and helped to found the Scottish Land Restoration League, a body dedicated to taxing land values to their full extent, thereby abolishing landlordism.|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} Project Launch, a teacher {{induction}} program {{sponsored by a}} regional teacher center and a consortium of universities, is compared for rural and non-rural participants. Indicators of success include teacher accomplishment of action plan goals, teacher self and mentor assessment of teaching strengths related to action plan goals, profiles of teaching strengths, and retention in teaching. Measures of teaching strength are related to INTASC standards. Rural participants differed significantly from non-rural participants in their lower self-perceived accomplishment of action plan goals. Rural participants {{were significantly more likely}} to move from their 1 st positions after 1 year, but their attrition was not significantly different in later years. Ways to structure induction programs more effectively for rural participants are proposed. National teacher shortages call rural educators to <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> that induce teachers to begin their careers in rural schools and to stay there. Factors in rural teacher retention considered in the literature include salary and other conditions of employment (Rude, 1997), characteristics of candidates such as place identification and commitment to a rural lifestyle (Boylan, Sinclair, Smith...|$|R
40|$|Codification is a {{ubiquitous}} {{feature of}} modern legal systems. Codes are hailed as tools for making law more convenient {{to find and}} to apply than law found in court precedents or in ordinary statutes. Codes are commonplace in most countries. The United States is anomalous. It does not have true codes. In the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries, when many countries adopted systematic civil, criminal and procedural codes, the United States considered, but did not adopt such codes. This Article discusses the absence of codes in American law, identifies American substitutes for codes, relates the history of attempts to create American codes and concludes with observations about the consequences of no-codes. This article is important because it forces us to look at our legal system from a distance as foreign observers do. It makes us <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> chaotic <b>conditions</b> that prevail here. It should make us yearn for best practices that prevail elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Marriage {{which is}} {{considered}} as a social institution of paramount importance, is inter-alia recognized by all the civilizations across the globe as a legitimate means for procreation leading to the perpetuation of {{the very existence of}} the society. But there are thousands of couples who are deprived of the bliss of procreation due to infertility of one of them or both or for the reason that they are physically incapable of involving themselves in sexual intercourse. The barrenness so caused has grave psychological, social and emotional impact on both the couples. Generally it is the wife being branded as barren becomes a prey of social contempt, though at times not for her fault. In conservative and traditional societies a childless woman's position becomes so pathetic that because of the wrath of in laws the matrimonial home becomes a hell for her as against her expectation of it to be a heaven. Adoption is one legal solution for the problem of issueless couples, which enables them to have a son or daughter subject to the fulfillment of <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>contemplated</b> in <b>the</b> relevant adoption laws...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Describe the {{characteristics}} of the evolution of nurses in the medical records of patients admitted to a school hospital in the city of João Pessoa, PB, Brazil. Methods: This is a descriptive, exploratory and documental, embodied in a quantitative approach. The source of study data were the records of patients of the Pediatric Clinic of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases (IPD), who were in the Statistical and Medical Archive Service (SMAS), in a time frame from April to October 2015. The analysis the data was performed, from the descriptive statistics, using a statistical software. Results: Through the data collected, two characteristics were observed in the records: the general aspects and the focus of care. In general aspects, the developments were characterized as being absent from erasures, use of correctives, grammatical errors, non-standard abbreviations and generic terms. They proved to be legible and clear, using scientific terminology, the date and time stamp. However, it was found that there are many blanks. As the focus of care, <b>the</b> records <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> general <b>condition,</b> level of consciousness, respiratory pattern and eliminations. Conclusions: Based on the foregoing, the concreteness of this study shows us that nurses need to be aware in order to provide a more qualified registration and, above all, standardized, ensuring continuity of care and promoting the evaluation of the implemented care...|$|R
5000|$|Diana Al-Hadid's often {{large-scale}} work {{is shown}} internationally. Her sculptures, panels, and drawings often reference [...] "art from centuries past." [...] Al-Hadid also sources conceptual ideas and imagery from literature, history, anatomy, architecture, cosmology, and physics. Her work blurs {{the boundaries between}} figuration and abstraction. Al-Hadid has described her work as [...] "impossible architecture." [...] Her sculptures frequently draw from a myriad of incongruous sources in order to confront mystical and scientific understandings of the world. Al-Hadid says of her work, [...] "I am not trying to discover who I am through my work. I am exploring those things that make less sense to me, where there is something new to discover." [...] Despite their sheer physical presence, her monumental works are intricate and ethereal, inviting viewers to <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> human <b>condition.</b> Al-Hadid builds her sculptures in parts that can be assembled and disassembled, and she explores the evolution of ideas as her work develops from beginning to end.

5000|$|He has two children, Monika Saukaitė, a painter, and Mykolas Sauka, a {{sculptor}} and writer. Šarūnas' work, by both critics and laymen, {{is often referred}} to as [...] "different". However, the [...] "difference" [...] in Sauka's paintings is quite consistent. Sauka's imagery is rich with religious symbolism, sharp contrasts of colour, characters and objects in a state of decay. The images of blood, organs, severed body parts and butchery are often found in his paintings. This literal dissection or deformation of the human form is possibly an expression of the author's belief that the human must be stripped from conventional chains in order to <b>contemplate</b> <b>the</b> true <b>condition</b> of its body and soul. In many of his paintings, he uses his own face, sometimes faces of his family members or relatives; the victim and aggressor usually both have the same face. A full appreciation of his artwork requires an understanding of the extent and cruelty of the communist terror in Lithuania and other countries of Eastern Europe and a grasp of some of the underlying metaphysical and archetypal ideas that are basic to his world view and sensibility.|$|R
