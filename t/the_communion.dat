The remaining churches {{do not recognize}} the OCA as autocephalous, although they do recognize the self-governing nature of the church. While the subject of political and ecclesiastical dispute, this controversy does not impair <b>the</b> <b>communion</b> between the OCA and the wider Eastern Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{was summoned}} in 1559 to {{consider}} the Reformation Bill {{and to create a}} new church. The Reformation Bill defined <b>the</b> <b>Communion</b> as a consubstantial celebration as opposed to a transubstantial celebration, included abuse of the pope in the litany, and ordered that ministers should not wear the surplice or other Roman Catholic vestments. It allowed ministers to marry, banned images from churches, and confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Anglican <b>Communion</b> Primates' Meetings are regular {{meetings}} of the primates in <b>the</b> Anglican <b>Communion,</b> i.e. <b>the</b> principal archbishops or bishops of each (often national) ecclesiastical province of <b>the</b> Anglican <b>Communion.</b> There are currently 38 primates of <b>the</b> Anglican <b>Communion.</b> <b>The</b> primates come together from the geographic provinces around the world. The Archbishop of Canterbury chairs the meetings, with the Secretary General of the Anglican Consultative Council (ACC) serving as secretary.|$|R

5|$|The 12th-century font {{was removed}} {{when the church}} was made redundant; it {{is now in the}} nearby church of St Maelog, Llanfaelog.

5|$|The Bill met heavy {{resistance}} in the House of Lords, as Roman Catholic bishops {{as well as the}} lay peers voted against it. They reworked much of the Bill, changed the litany to allow for a transubstantial belief in <b>the</b> <b>Communion</b> and refused to grant Elizabeth the title of Supreme Head of the Church. Parliament was prorogued over Easter, and when it resumed, the government entered two new bills into the Houses—the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{thoroughly}} renovated in 1631 by Thomas Lyte, who installed the arch-braced-collar truss roof, <b>the</b> <b>communion</b> rail, a rear screen and a frieze below the roof painted with {{the arms of}} the Lytes and their relations. A monument to the south of the altar records Thomas' work on the chapel. In 1912 Sir Walter Jenner added the stained glass, including medieval glass said to have come from Charlton Mackrell church which William Le Lyte had commissioned before his death in 1316.|$|E

5|$|The murals {{are one of}} {{the best}} {{representations}} of Byzantine art outside the traditional borders of Byzantium. The majority of the murals bear scriptures in Greek. The murals were painted under the patronage of atabek Ivane Zakarian between 1205 and 1216. Parallels have been drawn between the murals and the 11th century Armenian miniature paintings of the Mugni Gospels. The coloring of the murals is characteristic of typical Byzantine art while the thematic solutions are more Armenian. New and Old Testaments scenes as well as various saints including Saint Gregory the Illuminator are depicted on the murals. A large image of the Holy Virgin is depicted in the dome holding Jesus. The mural has been badly damaged and only parts of it survived. Below the Holy Virgin, <b>the</b> <b>Communion</b> is shown where Jesus is depicted twice, turning on the right and left sharing bread with the Apostles. The images of the Apostles Peter, John the Evangelist, Paul and Matthew have survived. The common Christians saints are depicted below <b>the</b> <b>Communion</b> scene, including Pope Sylvester, Saint James the son of Alpheus, Saint John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, Gregory the Illuminator, Jacob of Mtsbin, Clement of Rome, Gregory the Thaumaturgist, Cyril of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea. The murals on the western wall depict the Kingdom of Heaven. The northern wall depicts the trial of Jesus by the high priest of Caiaphas and by the Roman Procurator Pontius Pilate. Some of the murals were renovated in 1979. The arches, niches and columns are also covered by murals.|$|E
5|$|Osbert {{was accused}} of murdering William, {{specifically}} by poisoning him through <b>the</b> <b>communion</b> chalice. A fellow cleric, Symphorian, {{who had been a}} chaplain of the deceased archbishop, brought murder charges against Osbert. Symphorian obtained a hearing on the charges at a royal council presided over by King Stephen of England at Michaelmas in 1154, but Stephen's subsequent death prevented a resolution. Osbert attempted to have the trial switched to an ecclesiastical court and was supported in his efforts by Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury. A trial was finally held in 1156 and Osbert's accuser did not produce any witnesses, but Osbert was unable to prove his innocence, prompting the transfer of the case to a papal court. No record of any judgment exists, but Osbert apparently appeared before two popes, Adrian IV and Alexander III. A further appeal to the papal court was referred to papal judges-delegate between 1175 and 1180.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks before}} Garza's death, {{a woman named}} Maria America Guerra had been sexually {{assaulted}} while kneeling at <b>the</b> <b>communion</b> rail at another Catholic church in the area. Rumor held that Father Feit was responsible, but local church leaders discouraged people from considering {{the possibility that a}} priest could have been involved in a violent crime. Feit admitted to visiting a priest at that church on the day of Guerra's attack, but he denied assaulting her. He was later charged with rape, and the trial ended in a hung jury. In 1962, rather than facing a second trial, Feit entered a plea of no contest to a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault, and he paid a $500 fine. Years later, Feit said he did not understand that a no contest plea would result in his conviction.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada, the ACNA is not {{a member}} {{province}} of <b>the</b> Anglican <b>Communion,</b> although <b>the</b> holy orders of clergy within the Anglican Church in North America are recognized by the primus inter pares of <b>the</b> Anglican <b>Communion,</b> <b>the</b> Archbishop of Canterbury.

5|$|In the Mainwaring chapel is the canopied wall tomb of SirWilliam Mainwaring of Baddiley and Peover {{who died}} in 1399. His effigy is in alabaster, it is {{recumbent}} and dressed in plate armour as a knight. His head rests on a helm bearing an ass's head and around his neck is a gold collar of esses. The rest of the monument is in red sandstone. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle is a marble tomb commemorating SirRichard Wilbraham (1578–1643), his son SirThomas Wilbraham (1601–1660) and their wives. It includes the recumbent effigies in marble of SirThomas and his wife, Elizabeth. At the east end of the south aisle is an ancient piscina which is in good condition. In the chancel is another piscina and a sedilia, both of which are damaged. The screen in the Dorfold chapel is dated 1685 while that dividing the chancel from the nave is from a later date. <b>The</b> <b>communion</b> rail is also dated 1685. The brass chandelier dates from the 18thcentury. Stained glass in the east window and in windows of the south aisle is by Kempe and is dated between 1885 and 1888. The reredos includes the Ten Commandments {{to the north of the}} altar and the Lord's Prayer and the Creed to the south. The carved oak pulpion a stone base and the oak eagle lectern date from the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The {{woodwork}} {{removed by}} Street was sold for a nominal sum, with {{a condition that}} {{it could only be}} used for a hall, chapel or library. Some pieces ended up in the library and chapel of Forest School in Walthamstow, east London (an institution that previously had no link to the college). Panels under <b>the</b> <b>communion</b> rail were also removed from the chapel, even though Street had reported to the college that these carvings were the only portion of the chapel woodwork with any real value, and had suggested at one point reusing them in connection with the ante-chapel screen and the adjoining seats. Some of the woodwork was transferred to St Edern's Church, Bodedern, in Anglesey, which had links with the college from 1648 until the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Some of the panels may also have been re-used in the Fellows' Library (in the second quadrangle); other panelling at Bodedern came from the college, but not apparently from the chapel, and so may have been from a disused library gallery.|$|E
5|$|When Leo IV died in October 780, his {{sole heir}} {{was the young}} Constantine VI, his son by the Empress Irene of Athens. Due to Constantine's being underage, a regency was instituted under Irene, {{but this was not}} well {{received}} among leading officials. Not only was rule by a woman alien to the military-dominated establishment of the time, but Irene was also a confirmed iconophile, an adherent of the veneration of holy images. This was regarded as heresy by the state-sponsored doctrine of Iconoclasm, which was especially popular with the army and the officials loyal to Constantine V's memory. A number of them, including the Postal Logothete (foreign minister) Gregory, the former strategos (governor) of the Anatolic Theme Bardas and Constantine, the commander of the Excubitors guard regiment, consequently favoured the rise of Nikephoros to the imperial throne. Barely {{a month and a half}} after Leo's death, the plot was discovered. Irene had the conspirators exiled, and Nikephoros and his younger brothers were ordained as priests, removing them from the line of succession. To confirm this before the people, on Christmas Day 780, Nikephoros and his brothers were forced to perform <b>the</b> <b>communion</b> service in the Hagia Sophia.|$|E
