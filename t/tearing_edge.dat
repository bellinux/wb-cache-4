40|$|Purpose: To {{demonstrate}} a capsulorhexis technique using predominantly shearing forces with a cystotome on a virtual reality simulator {{and on a}} human eye. Method: Our technique involves creating the initial anterior capsular tear with a cystotome to raise a flap. The flap left unfolded on the lens surface. The cystotome tip is tilted horizontally and is engaged on the flap near {{the leading edge of}} the tear. The cystotome is moved in a circular fashion to direct the vector forces. The loose flap is constantly swept towards the centre so that it does not obscure the view on the <b>tearing</b> <b>edge.</b> Results: Our technique has the advantage of reducing corneal wound distortion and subsequent anterior chamber collapse. The capsulorhexis flap is moved away from the tear leading edge allowing better visualisation of the direction of tear. This technique offers superior control of the capsulorhexis by allowing the surgeon to change the direction of the tear to achieve the desired capsulorhexis size. Conclusions: The EYESI Surgical Simulator is a realistic training platform for surgeons to practice complex capsulorhexis techniques. The shearing forces technique is a suitable alternative and in some cases a far better technique in achieving the desired capsulorhexis. Protoco...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{surface of}} welded joints in X 70 steel {{pipeline}} was processed by laser shock wave, its mechanical behaviors of tension fracture were analyzed with tension test, and the fracture morphologies and the distributions of chemical element were observed with {{scanning electron microscope}} and energy dispersive spectrum, respectively. The experimental {{results show that the}} phenomenon of grain refinement occurs in the surface of welded joints in X 70 steel pipeline after the laser shock processing, and compressive residual stress is formed in its surface strengthened layer. There is no yield stage but a continuous yield behavior in the welded joints in X 70 steel pipeline after the laser shock processing, and its extensibility has decreased by 20 %. The welded joints in X 70 steel pipeline in primitive state exhibits brittle fracture with less <b>tearing</b> <b>edges,</b> while the fracture of welded joints in X 70 steel pipeline processed by laser shock is ductile fracture with a lot of <b>tearing</b> <b>edges...</b>|$|R
