5|$|After {{the band}} had walked offstage, {{in a move}} {{described}} by NME as the most meaningful of the concert, the audience faced the troops in the stadium and broke into a spontaneous round of applause, which quickly <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> ovation—an act which the soldiers mimicked in turn.|$|E
5|$|Flinn {{conceived}} the penal colony Rura Penthe as on an arid, undeveloped world with odorous aliens; Meyer {{suggested that it}} be <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> ice world instead. The exterior shots of Martia, Kirk, and McCoy traveling across the frozen wastes were filmed {{on top of a}} glacier in Alaska, forty minutes east of Anchorage. Because of budget and time constraints, the second unit was tasked with getting the footage. The location was accessible only by helicopter, and was scouted months before filming began.|$|E

5|$|The throne {{remained}} vacant and {{the legislative}} elections of 1920 <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> open {{conflict between the}} Venizelists, who favored republicanism, and the supporters of the ex-King Constantine. On 14 November 1920, with the war with Turkey dragging on, the monarchists won, and Dimitrios Rallis became prime minister; Venizelos (who lost his own parliamentary seat) chose to leave Greece in self-exile. Rallis asked Queen Olga to become regent until Constantine's return.|$|E
5|$|Written by Russell T. Davies. Planned for {{the sixth}} and seventh episodes of Series 6, it would have seen Bannerman Road being <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> 'electric city' by Illy, a smart and evil alien. Sarah Jane would have then been {{replaced}} by an identical clone who, afterwards, turns 'electric city' into 'clone town', exploding Bannerman Road, due to too much power.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{developments}} in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service too small to be useful. Modern weapons systems and their supporting logistics facilities such as munitions stores could not fit within the 16th-century designs. A 1905 review of the Falmouth defences concluded that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be mounted at combination of Pendennis and newer sites along the coast, and the castle was disarmed. A review in 1913 concluded that keeping naval artillery at Calshot was also unnecessary, and the site was <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> experimental seaplane station instead.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{new line}} which {{features}} robot versions of various Marvel Comics superheroes (and later more of the Star Wars Transformers figures once it merged with this line).

Spider-Man becomes <b>a</b> helicopter, Wolverine <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> 4WD, Venom <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> turbocharged retro car. They {{are not to be}} confused with the Marvel Megamorphs toy line, which also featured transformable mecha piloted by the superheroes. Eventually, the Star Wars Transformers figure joined the line with reissues of previous figures, as well as all new molds.|$|R

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered {{by large}} baggage trains. To some degree, this was <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> advantage {{with the development of}} the tabor– military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it lost much of its military significance in the 18th century; the primary reason for this was a lack of sufficient funding.|$|E
5|$|He {{has also}} ridden at the Badminton Horse Trials, {{where he is}} one of only two Americans to win that event, and he also holds the honor of having the most wins at the Rolex Three Day Event with six victories. Through his 1974 World Championship victory, Davidson is {{credited}} with helping to create the Rolex event, as this victory allowed the US to host the 1978 World Championships. The 1978 event <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> annual competition that eventually became the Rolex Kentucky Three-Day, which was the first and continues to be the only four-star eventing competition in the United States. Davidson has competed at the event almost every year since it began.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the chapel}} was {{believed}} to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and to have been buried under the earthworks when they were first constructed. An argument then ensued between the antiquarian William Taylor, who championed the Anglo-Saxon dating for the site, and Harrod, who insisted that the chapel was in fact Norman in origin; the issue was not settled until later in the 20th century, when the Norman date was confirmed. By 1900 the castle was open to the public, overseen by a caretaker who lived {{in one corner of the}} keep, the section of which had been reroofed and <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> apartment.|$|E
25|$|Belle, however, is not {{oblivious}} to her peers' views of her. She voices her {{concerns about it}} to her eccentric father and inventor, Maurice who assures her that she is anything but strange ("No Matter What"). The two then put {{the finishing touches on}} his invention and Maurice heads off to an invention fair donning a scarf knitted for him by Belle ("No Matter What {Reprise]"), but becomes lost in the woods and attacked by a pack of wolves. After surviving a wolf attack, he enters the Beast's castle where the servants, including Lumière, <b>a</b> maître d' <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> candelabra, Cogsworth, the head of household <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> clock, Babette, <b>a</b> maid <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> feather duster that still seems to retain her flirtatious tendencies, Mrs. Potts, the head of the kitchen <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> teapot, and Chip, her son <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> teacup. They welcome him, but the horrid Beast arrives and locks Maurice away in the dungeon for trespassing.|$|R

5|$|Early Greek {{sources have}} it that Philomela was <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> swallow, {{which has no}} song; Procne <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> nightingale, singing a {{beautiful}} but sad song in remorse. Later sources, among them Ovid, Hyginus, and the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats write that although she was tongueless, Philomela was <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> nightingale, and Procne <b>into</b> <b>a</b> swallow. Eustathius' {{version of the story}} has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.|$|R
5|$|Ralph Cipriano was The Philadelphia Inquirers {{religion}} {{reporter for}} about a year in 1993. During that time he was called several times by Tierney on behalf of Tierney's client, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. After leaving the religion reporter position, Cipriano wrote articles for the Sunday paper, where in 1997 he wrote a profile on Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua. The profile <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> investigative piece as Cipriano obtained documents detailing US$5 million in questionable spending and how the church was spending millions in the suburbs while cutting inner-city services.|$|E
5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has a polite {{personality}} and wears glasses. He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not be fooled by his glasses {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> NPC.

He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
5|$|Trafford has two medieval castles. Dunham Castle is {{an early}} medieval castle in Dunham Massey. It belonged to Hamon de Massey, and was {{probably}} still standing in the early 14th century.

Watch Hill Castle {{is an early}} medieval motte-and-bailey castle {{on the border of}} Dunham Massey and Bowdon. It is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The motte and surrounding ditch still survives, although it had fallen out of use by the 13th century.|$|E
