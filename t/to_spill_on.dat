The film was Barker's directorial debut. The film involves the resurrection of Frank (Sean Chapman), who had opened the door to an alternate dimension and had his body torn to pieces by creatures known as Cenobites. Years later, Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) moves into their late mother's abandoned house with new wife, Julia (Clare Higgins). An accident causes some of Larry's blood <b>to</b> <b>spill</b> <b>on</b> the attic floor, which somehow triggers Frank's resurrection. To complete his resurrection, he requires more blood which Julia provides while Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), Larry's daughter, discovers Frank's puzzlebox which leads her to meet with the Cenobites.|$|E

Michael opted <b>to</b> <b>spill</b> water <b>on</b> Gaelan's bed, {{which at the time}} was only used by Gaelan himself. Because of that, and because he also didn't empty the whole bottle, he was awarded his first strike. Soon after, he was given other missions, one of which was to be nominated by at least eight of his fellow housemates in the next round of nominations. To complete this mission he fabricated a story about a custody issue concerning his young son Reuben, claiming he wanted to leave the house to concentrate on this issue.|$|R

Eddie explains the situation to his best friend Roger (Glen Morgan), who is highly skeptical of the whole thing. At first the revenge is innocent enough, but before long the plans start to become more sinister, with the potential to cause real physical harm and eventually building towards murder. Having no desire to take things so far, Eddie determines to sever ties with the dead rocker, but Sammi has no intention of letting that happen. When Eddie is alone in his room, Sammi causes some soda <b>to</b> <b>spill</b> <b>on</b> the record, initiating an electrical surge that gives him just the amount of energy he needs to escape out of the record and become able to carry out his murderous plans without the help of another. Eddie smashes his record player and stereo system after a personal, face-to-face visit from Sammi, hoping to make sure he never sees the dead rocker in his room again.|$|E
5000|$|While Hercules buries Tyron, Deric and Lyla tell Hercules to hide {{until his}} sight returns. Deric says that Nemis {{was not always}} bad, but life wore him down. In the cave, Penelope tries to get Nemis to let them go, but he denies the two women their freedom. In the woods outside the cave, Salmoneus distracts Nemis so Hercules can save the women. Nemis comes back into the cave, and he and Hercules begins fighting. While they fight, Penelope and the other woman escape. Even blind, Hercules manages to avoid being beaten by Nemis' club. Hercules uses his sword to cause the pot <b>to</b> <b>spill</b> <b>on</b> the fire, putting it out. He tells Nemis with no light, [...] "you have the same problem I do." [...] As the two {{continue}} to fight Nemis is impaled by his own club, and {{falls to the ground}} wounded. Hercules tries to stop the roof from collapsing on Penelope. Nemis gets up and holds the roof, telling Hercules to save Penelope. Hercules gets Penelope and the other woman and they run out of the cave as it collapses, killing Nemis. Later, Hercules says that Nemis really did love Penelope and Salmoneus says he won lots of money because no one had faith in Hercules against the centaurs. Hercules takes the money and gives it to Marcus and Penelope. Hercules walks off with Salmoneus protesting about his money.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} road race stage, several crashes {{took place in}} the final kilometers, which limited the number of riders present to sprint for the stage win. Petacchi was one of only five riders who avoided being caught up in the crashes, and won the stage ahead of Mark Renshaw, Thor Hushovd, Robbie McEwen, and Mathieu Ladagnous. In stage 2, Gavazzi {{indirectly}} caused the great multitude of crashes that happened that day. A member of the morning breakaway, Gavazzi slipped on the Col du Stockeu in Spa, and as a camera bike swerved to avoid hitting him, it too crashed, causing motor oil <b>to</b> <b>spill</b> <b>on</b> the roadway. The oil trickled well downhill, {{and by the time the}} peloton came through about five minutes later, it was all over the road, leading to the crashes of some 60 riders from nearly every team in the race. Petacchi was again the victor in the much simpler and much safer flat stage 4. He figured into the sprint finishes to stages 5 and 6, but lost out to Mark Cavendish in both. In stage 9, Cunego, already 45 minutes down in the overall standings, made a winning breakaway. He, Sandy Casar, and Luis León Sánchez sought the stage win with Christophe Moreau, Anthony Charteau, and bridging overall favorites Alberto Contador and Andy Schleck just behind them. Casar appeared to be more familiar with the course, as he took an aggressive line on the course's final left-hand turn, with the finish line located just around that corner. He took the win, with Cunego third.|$|E

5000|$|The {{belief in}} the ill luck that comes from spilt salt is quite old, going back to ancient Rome.

For it makes substances more compact and preserves {{them for a long}} time: hence it was usually presented to guests before other food, to signify the abiding strength of friendship.

50|$|Critics {{usually found}} the fourth {{generation}} acceptable. The car was praised for its adequate handling {{as well as}} a moderately comfortable ride. Other reviewers noted the car to be an ugly and somewhat expensive choice in the compact car segment, some simply referred to it as a Golf with a boot (trunk) on the back added as a last minute addition. Some complaints were made that the back seats lacked adequate room for two adults. Some found the seat cushioning too firm. The interior was praised for the high level of fit, but is quite bland, sparsely equipped, and uninspiring. New in this generation was Volkswagen's signature blue and red instrument lighting which became standard in all models in 1999. The climate controls were placed low on the console. The recirculation mode cannot be turned on when air is vented to the windshield, and if the driver changes the climate control to vent air to the windshield, an internal mechanism would turn off the recirculation mode. The power outlet is recessed next to the ash tray and is covered with two flaps, one of which is shared with the ash tray. Retractable cup holders were placed directly above the stereo, obscuring vision of the stereo display and allowing beverages <b>to</b> <b>spill</b> <b>on</b> the stereo, gear selector, and other sensitive components during erratic vehicle movements. The flimsy plastic construction of the retractable cup holder is likely to fail with normal use. Rear passengers have a pair of retractable cup holders located under the cylindrical ash tray on the center console. These problems were rectified in 2003 for the US market by placing two recessed cup holders in tandem in the center console and another behind the arm rest pedestal for rear passengers. The driver must raise the arm rest to access the center cup holder, and a large beverage occupying the front cup holder obstructs the driver's ability to pull the hand brake. European cars were given a redesigned retractable cup holder in front.|$|E

40|$|Efforts {{to quickly}} deploy {{effective}} fast-water spill response have been {{hampered by the}} lack of technology and adequate training. The objective of this manual is to serve as a training aid and a field manual to increase the effectiveness of fast-water responses.

This guide starts with a decision guide to determine what techniques can be used in various response scenarios. Additional details are provided for hydrodynamic issues, individual tactics, fast-water skimmers and support equipment such as boats and anchors. A large number of appendices provide additional background information needed to make decisions. Whenever possible, figures are accompanied by pictures to provide a full explanation of each tactic or methodology. This is the first document that puts all of the needed information for responding <b>to</b> <b>spills</b> over 1 knot in one book. It will assist the US Coast Guard, the US EPA and commercial companies in responding <b>to</b> <b>spills</b> <b>on</b> rivers and in coastal areas.

The tracks showed the prints of only three feet, the fourth being dragged, indicating that the animal was lame. That butter was carried on one side of the camel and honey on the other was evident because ants had been attracted to melted butter on one side of the road and flies <b>to</b> <b>spilled</b> honey <b>on</b> the other.|$|R
