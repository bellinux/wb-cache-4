5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics is <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> body's motion {{can be described as}} a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> large {{population}} implies a large market. Though underdeveloped countries {{have a large}} population, their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E

5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} is <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> transitional form between two different taxonomic groups {{must be a}} direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated {{by the fact that}} {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E
25|$|The {{term life}} cycle refers to <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> fair, {{holistic}} assessment requires {{the assessment of}} raw-material production, manufacture, distribution, use and disposal including all intervening transportation steps necessary or caused by the product's existence.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Dr. David Gottlieb {{notes that}} many Kabbalists hold that the {{concepts}} of, e.g., a Heavenly Court or the Sitra Ahra are only given to humanity by God {{as a working}} model to understand His ways within our own epistemological limits. They reject <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> satan or angels actually exist. Others hold that non-divine spiritual entities were indeed created by God {{as a means for}} exacting his will.|$|E

25|$|More {{recent case}} law from the UK tends {{to refer to}} a duty of public {{authorities}} to act fairly rather than to natural justice. One aspect of such a duty is the obligation on authorities in some cases to give effect to procedural legitimate expectations. These are underpinned by <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> party that is or will be affected by a decision can expect that he or she will be consulted by the decision-maker before the decision is taken.|$|E
25|$|For {{this video}} work, Andreyev uses audio and visual {{representations}} of her canine companion Tom {{to speculate on}} his subjective and emotional experience traveling in a car by examining <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> canine's sense of smell is a locus for heightened sensitivity and empirical intelligence. The visuals refer to a psychedelic experience, metaphorically representing Tom's experience. The visuals are accompanied by a soundscape constructed from studio recordings of Tom's voice and car engine sounds to create connotative rhythmic and harmonic modes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{authors and}} {{scholars}} addressed this issue. Malcolm Gladwell discuses the “Law of the Few” in his book, The Tipping Point. He suggests that highly connected and rare {{people have the}} ability to shape the world. This handful of unique people can spread the word around and create a social epidemic through their connections, charm, personality, expertise and persuasiveness. <b>The</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> small group of people can influence others and cause them to adopt products, services or behaviors was the subject of another book, The Influentials by Edward Keller and Jonathan Berry. This minority comprises a wide range of people who act as experts in their field and their opinions are highly regarded by their peers.|$|E
5000|$|Activity theory {{therefore}} includes <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{activity is}} carried out within a social context, or specifically in a community. The {{way in which the}} activity fits into the context is thus established by two resulting concepts: ...|$|R

25|$|In the 14th century, Jean Buridan {{rejected}} <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> motion-generating property, {{which he}} named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position {{was that a}} moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. Buridan also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also believed that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects (such as celestial bodies) to move in a circle.|$|E
500|$|Students {{are often}} [...] "mentally {{committed}} to <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number {{can be represented}} in one and only one way by a decimal."

500|$|... "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerBalls" [...] portrays young {{children}} as almost entirely uninterested in reading. The South Park boys only exhibit excitement for their reading assignment {{based on the}} promise of offensive and controversial material in the book. Rather than finding any merit in the book, the boys are angry when they find the material inoffensive, prompting Cartman to declare he has been [...] "tricked" [...] into reading an entire book. Through {{the rise and fall of}} Butters' career as an author, the episode also demonstrates the perils of literary success and hoaxes. The episode also lampoons <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> book can be identified as the sole reason for a reader to kill somebody, particularly through Butters' reaction to The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs. Butters experiences blackouts after reading The Catcher in the Rye and chanting [...] "Kill John Lennon/Ronald Reagan!", until he disappointedly learns they are already dead. Later, a reader of Butters' book The Poop That Took a Pee goes out and murders the Kardashians.|$|E
50|$|A {{valid patent}} also {{requires}} a non-obvious invention. The invention {{must have some}} element of inventiveness. This concept originated in common law out of <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> invention must be inventive. It is now explicitly codified in section 28.3 of the Patent Act.|$|R

500|$|Echoing {{the actions}} of Kent's {{previous}} landlord, Parsons had not repaid Kent's loan—of which about three guineas was outstanding—and Kent therefore instructed his solicitor to sue him. [...] He managed to recover the debt by January 1762, just as the mysterious noises at Cock Lane began again. [...] Catherine Friend had lodged there shortly after the couple left but moved out when she found the noises, which had returned intermittently and which were becoming more frequent, could not be stopped. [...] They apparently emanated from Elizabeth Parsons, who also suffered fits, {{and the house was}} regularly disturbed by unexplained noises, likened at the time to the sound of a cat scratching a chair. [...] Reportedly determined to discover their source, Richard Parsons had a carpenter remove the wainscotting around Elizabeth's bed. He approached John Moore, assistant preacher at St Sepulchre's since 1754 and rector of St Bartholomew-the-Great in West Smithfield since June 1761. [...] The presence of one ghost, presumed to belong to Fanny's sister, Elizabeth, had already been noted while Fanny lay dying, and the two concluded that the spirit now haunting Parsons' house must be that of Fanny Lynes herself. [...] <b>The</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> person's spirit might return from the dead to warn those still alive was a commonly held belief, and the presence of two apparently restless spirits was therefore an obvious sign to both men that each ghost had an important message to disclose.|$|E
