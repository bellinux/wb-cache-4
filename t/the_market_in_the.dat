25|$|Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman {{reject the}} idea that {{systematic}} slave breeding was a major economic concern in their 1974 book Time on the Cross. They {{argue that there is}} very meager evidence for the systematic breeding of slaves for sale in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper South during the 19th century. They distinguish systematic breeding—the interference in normal sexual patterns by masters with an aim to increase fertility or encourage desirable characteristics—from pro-natalist policies, the generalized encouragement of large families through a combination of rewards, improved living and working conditions for fertile women and their children, and other policy changes by masters. They point out that the demographic evidence is subject to a number of interpretations. Fogel argues that when planters intervened in the private lives of slaves it actually had a negative impact on population growth.|$|E
