Portland's first outbreak of Dutch elm disease occurred in 1976 at Overlook Park, and the peak infections were in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Asipatravana/Asipatrakanana (forest of sword leaves): The Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana reserve this {{hell for}} a person who digresses from the {{religious}} teachings of the Vedas and indulges in heresy. The Vishnu Purana states that wanton tree-felling leads to this hell. Yamadutas beat them with whips {{as they try to}} run away in the forest where palm <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> swords as leaves. Afflicted with injury of whips and swords, they faint and cry out for help in vain.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{have been}} made by the Food and Agricultural Organization to improve {{relations}} between farmers, agro-pastoralists and pastoralists in the Zakouma National Park (ZNP), Siniaka-Minia, and Aouk reserve in southeastern Chad to promote sustainable development. As part of the national conservation effort, more than 1.2 million <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> been replanted to check the advancement of the desert, which incidentally also helps the local economy by way of financial return from acacia trees, which produce gum arabic, and also from fruit trees.|$|E
5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} has resulted in an increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which has resulted in an increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests {{of the east}} and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig <b>trees)</b> <b>have</b> driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> flowers rich in nectar {{which are}} {{attractive}} to bees. The production of forest honey {{is an important}} industry in rural areas {{of the developing world}} where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using traditional methods. The flowers of the elder (Sambucus) are used to make elderflower cordial and petals of the plum (Prunus spp.) can be candied. Sassafras oil is a flavouring obtained from distilling bark from the roots of the white sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).|$|E
5|$|Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and the Sacramento Tree Foundation have partnered {{to provide}} the city of Sacramento shade trees for free. The program allows {{citizens}} to receive trees from four to seven feet tall. They also give them fertilizer, and delivery, all at no cost. They encourage citizens to plant their trees to benefit their home by reducing air conditioning costs. Approximately more than 450,000 shade <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> been planted in the Sacramento area.|$|E

5|$|<b>Trees</b> <b>have</b> been venerated {{since time}} immemorial. To the ancient Celts, certain trees, {{especially}} the oak, ash and thorn, held special significance as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking {{the lives and}} fortunes of individuals to them or using them as oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads {{were believed to be}} shy nymphs who inhabited trees.|$|E
5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, {{the definition of}} a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. <b>Trees</b> <b>have</b> been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is home to}} one of {{the last}} stands of old-growth forest in eastern North Carolina. A forest of bay trees, sweetgum, pawpaw, persimmon, bald cypress and poplar are found on the {{northern}} shore of Lake Phelps. The cypress have a trunk diameter of up to tenfeet (3m) and the poplar have a trunk diameter of sixfeet (2m). There are vines that are as wide as an average man's leg and grow up the trees in excess of 130feet (40m). In the section of the park along the Scuppernong River, the Atlantic white cedar and other rare cedar <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> grown to rather large sizes. Several of the trees at Pettigrew State Park are listed on the North Carolina and National Registries of Big Trees.|$|E

5|$|Tarariki {{are found}} in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of {{particularly}} tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In Hawke's Bay, some <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> greener, broader leaves, and this may be because of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatu Gorge.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{threat to the}} bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{is likely to be}} ongoing land clearing in semi-arid bioregions of Queensland and NSW. The eastern Australian Bioregions that comprise the core range of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat, particularly the Brigalow Belt (north and south), have been subjected to broad scale clearing and habitat modification since European settlement. Clearing of vegetation for agriculture and removal of hollow bearing trees for firewood collection and forestry are likely to reduce the availability of roosting sites for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat. Clearing of native vegetation and removal of dead wood and dead <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> been recognised as key threatening processes for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat in NSW.|$|E
5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E

5|$|The {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} fields around the lake are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which {{date back to the}} most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Mature oak (Quercus) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and chestnuts (Castanea sativa). Many elm (Ulmus) <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape.|$|E

5|$|Trees play a {{significant}} role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are one of the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.|$|E
