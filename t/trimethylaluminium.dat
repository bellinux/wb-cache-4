50|$|The {{compound}} is a dimer of triethylaluminium. One pair of ethyl groups {{bridge the}} two Al centers, and four are terminal ligands. The two bridging carbon centres are five-coordinate.

50|$|Organoaluminium {{chemistry}} {{is the study}} of compounds containing bonds between carbon and aluminium bond. It {{is one of the major}} themes within organometallic chemistry. Illustrative organoaluminium compounds are the dimer <b>trimethylaluminium,</b> the monomer triisobutylaluminium, and the titanium-aluminium compound called Tebbe's reagent. The behavior of organoaluminium compounds can be understood in terms of the polarity of the C−Al bond and the high Lewis acidity of the three-coordinated species. Industrially, these compounds are mainly used for the production of polyolefins.|$|E
5000|$|Short {{interactions}} between hydrocarbon substituents and coordinatively unsaturated metal complexes {{have been noted}} since the 1960s.

In 1976, Wilkinson and Galyer disclosed an improved synthesis using <b>trimethylaluminium</b> in conjunction with trimethylamine, instead of methyllithium.

5000|$|MAO is most {{well known}} for being a {{co-catalyst}} for olefin polymerizations by homogeneous catalysis. In traditionalZiegler-Natta catalysis, supported titanium trichloride is activated by treatment with <b>trimethylaluminium</b> (TMA). TMA only weakly activates homogeneous precatalysts, such as zirconacene dichloride. In the mid-1970s that Kaminsky discovered that metallocene dichlorides can be activated by MAO (see Kaminsky catalyst). The effect was discovered when he noticed that {{a small amount of}} water enhanced the polymerizing activity in the Ziegler-Natta system and deduced that water must react with trimethylaluminum to give MAO.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} deactivating {{metabolic transformation}} of natural prostaglandins is enzymatic oxidation of the C-15 hydroxyl to the corresponding ketone. This is prevented, with retention of activity, by methylation {{to give the}} C-15 tertiary carbinol series.This molecular feature is readily introduced at {{the stage of the}} Corey lactone (1) by reaction with methyl Grignard reagent or <b>trimethylaluminium.</b> The resulting mixture of tertiary carbinols (2) is transformed to oxytocic carboprost (3) by standard transformations, including sepoaration of diastereomers, so that the final product is the C-15 analogue. This diastereomer is reputably freeer of porstaglandin side effects than the C-15 (S) isomer.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to Kaminsky, {{titanium}} chlorides {{supported on}} various materials were widely used (and still are) as heterogeneous catalysts for alkene polymerization. These halides are typically activated by treatment with <b>trimethylaluminium.</b> Kaminsky discovered that titanocene and related complexes emulated {{some aspects of}} these Ziegler-Natta catalysts but with low activity. He subsequently found that high activity could be achieved upon activation of these metallocenes with methylaluminoxane ((MAO). The MAO serves two roles: (i) alkylation of the metallocene halide and (ii) abstraction of an anionic ligand (chloride or methyl) to give an electrophilic catalyst with a labile coordination site.|$|E
50|$|Dimethylmercury {{currently}} has few applications {{because of the}} risks involved. As with many methyl-organometallics, it is a methylating agent that can donate its methyl groups to an organic molecule; however, the development of less acutely toxic nucleophiles such as dimethylzinc and <b>trimethylaluminium,</b> and the subsequent introduction of Grignard reagents (organometallic halides), has essentially rendered this compound obsolete in organic chemistry. It was formerly studied for reactions in which the methylmercury cation was bonded to the target molecule, forming potent bactericides; however, the bioaccumulation and ultimate toxicity of methylmercury has largely led it to be abandoned for this purpose {{in favor of the}} less toxic diethylmercury and ethylmercury compounds, which perform a similar function without the bioaccumulation hazard.|$|E
50|$|In one study, a 4.5.5.5fenestrane was {{synthesized}} {{with one}} carbon atom replaced by nitrogen because aza- compounds and their salts {{are more likely}} to form crystalline compounds suitable for X-ray analysis than low-molecular-weight alkanes. In step 1 the alkyl halide 1-iodo-3-butene 1 is converted to a cyanozinc cuprate 2 (by transmetalation of the organozinc iodide with copper cyanide) which reacts in the next step with 1-nitrocyclopentene 3 in a nucleophilic addition whereby the nitronate 4 is captured by phenylselenenyl bromide to the selenium intermediate 5. Hydrogen peroxide oxidation of 5 yields the nitroalkene 6 as a mixture of syn and anti isomers. A 4+2cycloaddition with n-butylenol ether in presence of <b>trimethylaluminium</b> gives the nitronate 7 and a second 3+2cycloaddition by heating in presence of potassium carbonate gives the nitroso acetal 8. Hydrogenation with Raney nickel gives the diol 9 which on a double Mitsunobu reaction (with an amine proton donor) gives the azafenestrane 10 as the borane salt.|$|E
