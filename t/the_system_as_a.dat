5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on March24 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially {{it consisted}} of a broad but consolidating circulation, with outflow to the north offsetting moderate wind shear to aid in development. It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping into the center. On March26, the JMA classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression just east of Pohnpei. On March27, the JTWC started tracking <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Tropical Depression 04W. Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped into it. The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same day, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.|$|E

5|$|During late November, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 625kilometers (390mi) east-southeast of Pohnpei. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic {{turning in}} {{the lower levels of}} the atmosphere, and a trough was located near the surface. The disturbance developed rainbands and gradually became better organized. By December2, the system had an elongated low-level circulation, located to the south of the convection. At 0600UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression about 735km (450mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 1800UTC on December 2 the agency classified the system as Tropical Depression 31W.

5|$|In {{the second}} week of December, a frontal trough stalled south of Bermuda.

5|$|The {{intertropical}} {{convergence zone}} spawned a tropical disturbance on January19, developing a circulation just west of St. Brandon. That day, the Météo-France on Réunion (MFR) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical disturbance, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> low-pressure area a day prior. The system intensified into Tropical Storm Gretelle late on January20, by which time the JTWC gave it the designation Tropical Cyclone 20S. Due to a large ridge centered near Île Amsterdam, the storm tracked generally southwestward toward the Mascarene Islands. Early on January22, the JTWC upgraded the storm to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, and later that day, the MFR upgraded Gretelle to tropical cyclone status, or with 10minute sustained winds of at least 120km/h (75mph).|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Koni developed {{as an area}} of deep convection within an active monsoon trough well south of Guam on July12. Though atmospheric conditions were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the tropical disturbance failed to maintain consistent shower activity. Late on July14, however, the system developed organized rainbands. This prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) to classify <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression at 0000UTC on July15, well north of Palau. Shortly after, the storm entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA), immediately classifying <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression and designating it with the name Gilas; the JTWC later classified the system as such at 1200UTC that day. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the depression westward for much of its initial stages.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} May 2010, a {{surge in}} the monsoon {{produced}} widespread convection, or thunderstorms, off the southwest coast of India in the southeastern Arabian Sea.

The circulation became more defined within the building convection, which was amplified by outflow from an anticyclone over the northern Arabian Sea. At 03:00Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on May31, the IMD designated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> depression about 1,000km (620mi) west-southwest of Mumbai, India, or about 1,260km (785mi) southeast of Muscat, Oman.

5|$|A trough {{developed}} {{along the}} northeast monsoon on 25October 2015 off the southwest coast of India, {{consisting of a}} fragmented area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system was located within an environment of moderate wind shear, which prevented early development, although conditions were anticipated to become more favorable. On 26October, the system developed a distinct low pressure area. The low gradually consolidated, and the circulation became better defined, amplified by decreasing wind shear and good outflow {{to the north and}} south. At 03:00UTC on 28October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> depression.

5|$|An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted west of Guam on September13, in {{association}} with the monsoon trough. The system gradually developed a low-level circulation and rainbands, aided by low wind shear from an anticyclone aloft. Late on September14, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression to the east of the Philippine island of Luzon. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 12W. A nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough limited the depression's outflow to the north, although convection continued to increase. The depression moved northwestward along the southwestern periphery of a ridge. At 03:00UTC on September15, the Philippine-based PAGASA began warning on the system, giving it the local name Inday. Nine hours later, the JMA named the system Tropical Storm Fanapi.|$|E
5|$|At 1800UTC on March22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} disturbed {{weather in}} the central Indian Ocean, approximately 685km (425mi) southeast of Christmas Island. The system was embedded mostly in the monsoon trough, surrounded by favorable environmental conditions, which prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0030UTC on March24. Convection increased as vertical wind shear decreased, and the system developed a curved band pattern. Throughout the day, the storm showed signs of potential rapid intensification, due to its quick organization. The Bureau of Meteorology's Perth Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (Perth TCWC) noted <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical low at 1000UTC on March24, and the JTWC issued its first warning two hours later.

5|$|Cold {{air from}} the {{remnants}} of a cold front became entrained within the circulation; however, the cold air gradually warmed. On October9, winds increased to gale-force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. By October10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane-force winds roughly 15mi (25km) {{from the center of the}} storm. Following this finding, the National Hurricane Center reclassified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical system and renamed it Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo. Upon becoming tropical, Fran developed a strong outflow and several convective feeder bands. Additionally, the storm had developed a 35mi (55km) wide eye.|$|E
5|$|Continued {{effects from}} shear {{stripped}} the cyclone of all deep convection, and by September14 only {{a band of}} cirrus clouds remained in association with Uleki.

5|$|Drifting {{generally}} northward, {{the disturbance}} slowly organized within {{a region of}} low to moderate wind shear and favorable outflow aloft.
