One hundred miles would constitute a day's work, and crews would not receive allowances for <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> delays at stations. Various meetings of railroad employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but he declined to meet.|$|E

In July 2008, the band performed at the VH1 tribute to The Who alongside Foo Fighters, Incubus and The Flaming Lips. In the days prior to Election Day 2008, Pearl Jam digitally released through its official website a free documentary film, entitled Vote for Change? 2004, which follows the band's <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the 2004 Vote for Change tour.|$|E

NBN Television broadcast fifty-six hours in its first week of transmission, setting the Australian television record for the most <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> air in {{a week for a}} new television station.|$|E
5|$|In the thelytokous ant Platythyrea punctata, colonies are clonal; therefore, {{workers are}} all equally related genetically, and worker {{policing}} {{is not expected}} {{as there is no}} genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Although Southern California and Mexico were {{considered}} for the main unit filming, the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i (where Stiller has a home) was selected {{for the majority of}} the shooting. Kaua'i was chosen over Mexico because a tax credit for in-state spending was negotiated with the Kaua'i Film Commission. John Toll, the cinematographer, stated the island was also selected for its similarity to Vietnam, based on its dense foliage, variety of terrains, and weather. Kaua'i was first scouted as a possible location to film Tropic Thunder in 2004. Stiller spent more than 25 hours over 6 weeks exploring the island, using all-terrain vehicles, boats, and helicopters. After the film was greenlit by DreamWorks in 2006, pre-production lasted for six months, most of this <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> scouting additional locations for filming. Filming for the Los Angeles and interior scenes occurred on sets at Universal Studios in Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
5|$|Even as the XF-108 {{program was}} {{progressing}} well, {{there were signs}} that would ultimately lead to its eventual cancellation. Unconfirmed Soviet bomber threats, the overwhelming trend toward offensive and defensive nuclear missiles in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as rising costs, contributed to the termination of the XF-108. The cancellation was announced on 23September 1959. North American continued refining the design through 1960 in hopes that the program might be revived. Despite the extra money and <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the Rapier, it was not wholly in vain; the North American A-5 Vigilante supersonic carrier-based nuclear strike bomber developed for the U.S. Navy, which was later modified into a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft, retained the fuselage/weapon package and systems design of the Rapier. In many ways the Vigilante {{could be seen as}} the successful application of the Rapier design principles in a Mach 2 supersonic design.|$|E
5|$|According to {{director}} Hajime Tanigawa, its gameplay {{was based}} around prevalent South Korean online role-playing games for PC. Tanigawa joined when the title shifted {{to being an}} MMORPG, and he estimated development time in this form at ten months. At the beginning of development, the team decided to release a working form of the game within a year. This was managed by narrowing the amount of <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the early concept work, instead taking inspiration directly from other titles, including titles within the Megami Tensei series: Tanigawa said that without this, development might have lasted up to three years. When the closed beta began, many of the game's final functions {{had yet to be}} implemented. A free-to-play model was adopted as the team wanted to bring in the maximum number of players into the game. While making the game completely free and using in-game advertising as a means of earning money was an option, this had yet to become commercially viable in Japan at the time. In early 2007, CAVE partnered with Gung Ho Online Entertainment, a Japanese company experienced with online games who could co-manage the game with CAVE. According to Tanigawa, the partnership with Gung Ho Online opened up the possibility of expansion into Asian and Western markets.|$|E

25|$|Starting in the 1990s, several {{scientific}} journals (including the high impact journal Nature in 2006) started experiments with hybrid peer review processes, allowing the open peer reviews in {{parallel to the}} traditional model. The initial evidence {{of the effects of}} open peer reviews was mixed. Identifying reviewers to the authors does not negatively impact, and may potentially have a positive impact upon, the quality of reviews, the recommendation regarding publication, the tone of the review and the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> reviewing. However, more of those who are invited to review decline to do so. Informing reviewers that their signed reviews might be posted on the web and available to the wider public did not {{have a negative impact on}} quality of reviews and recommendations regarding publication, but it led to a longer <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> reviewing, besides a higher reviewer decline rate. The results suggest that open peer review is feasible, and does not lead to poorer quality of reviews, but needs to be balanced against the increase in review time, and higher decline rates among invited reviewers.|$|E

50|$|Forrester {{recently}} reported that brand interaction on organic Facebook posts is now squeezed to 0.073 percent. Social advertising spend continues to rise, though {{as a whole}} it still doesn't match <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> overall <b>on</b> social. Only on Facebook has spending outstripped <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> - 6 percent of U.S. adults' digital media <b>time</b> is <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> Facebook, but 10 percent of U.S. digital ad spending is now assigned to Facebook. But that's because for most brands, Facebook means social. And Facebook's ad products continue to improve in sophistication. As other platforms get their ad products launched, spending there will increase, too. Again, where Facebook leads, others will follow.|$|R

It's also possible in these scenarios that a lack of tracking also increases <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> task, since the therapist does not properly see what level the patient is performing at.|$|E
