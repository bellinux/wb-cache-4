40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal International Journal of Human Factors Modelling and Simulation and the definitive published version is available at [URL] interior designs for vehicles may improve the safety of pregnant occupants without compromising the safety of non-pregnant occupants. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the implications of the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>unit</b> orientation by using ‘Expecting’, the Computational Pregnant Occupant Model developed at Loughborough University. Three steering column angles and three steering wheel angles are modelled in a subcompact mini-car interior in MADYMO. A standard 3 -point seat belt and an airbag are used as restraint systems. The strain values at the placental location of the uterus of ‘Expecting’ for frontal impacts with 15, 30, 45 kph are predicted for various steering <b>wheel</b> <b>unit</b> configurations and the resulting distance between the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>unit</b> and the abdomen and sternum of ‘Expecting’. Recommendations are made to improve safety...|$|R

50|$|The glider had a deep, {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage, straight edged and roughly rhomboidal in profile. The underside sloped up rearwards, with an all-moving tailplane hinged at its extremity. Fin and rudder had a cropped parallelogram form, sloping up to allow clearance between rudder and elevator.

50|$|The TB was an {{improved}} {{version of the}} Martin T3M. It was constructed of all dural, with a fabric covering. The equal-span wings were large and unstaggered, and could be folded aft, reducing the span to 21 ft for storage. The wheeled undercarriage was a conventional configuration that could be interchanged with floats. As a landplane, the main gear <b>units</b> carried <b>twin</b> <b>wheels.</b> The underside of the fuselage incorporated a glazed station for the bombardier.|$|R
5000|$|The twin-engined F.50 flew for {{the first}} time in early 1918, powered by two [...] Lorraine 8Bb engines, as an unequal-span biplane with a slab-sided {{fuselage}} and a single fin and rudder.

The vehicle was designed from the outset for off-road use, like the earlier Scammell Pioneer and unlike the road-going Diamond T it was eventually to replace.|$|R
50|$|The Gulfstream I is a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a semi-monocoque {{aluminium alloy}} fuselage structure.

50|$|First {{flown in}} November 1914 the Two-Seat Scout was {{developed}} from the 1914 Circuit of Britain seaplane. It was two-bay unswept biplane with equal span wings and ailerons fitted on all four wings and a braced tailplane and a single rudder. It had a fixed tailskid landing gear with a cross-axle type main gear with <b>twin</b> <b>wheels</b> carried on vee legs under the fuselage. It was powered by a nose-mounted 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine driving a two-bladed propeller. It had two tandem open cockpits and could carry small bombs under the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The fixed {{landing gear}} has <b>twin</b> <b>wheels</b> {{on each of}} the three {{vertical}} shock absorber-equipped struts. The main leading gear units are mounted on triangulated tubular structures, while the nose gear is bracketed to the cockpit bulkhead via a watertight seal in the planing bottom. The main wheels have hydraulic brakes operated from the pedals, complete with a parking hand brake, while the nose unit is fully castoring. The nose, which is covered by large glazed panels, has a bow chine and planing bottom built as a unit with the flight deck, which is higher than the main cabin floor.|$|R
