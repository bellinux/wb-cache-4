40|$|Beam shaping is {{important}} technique to improve holographic and interferometric technologies, and refractive field mapping beam shapers like piShaper demonstrate strong capabilities in increasing predictability and reliability as well simplifying {{the realization of}} the mentioned technologies. Most often the piShaper are implemented as telescopic systems with collimated beams at entrance and exit. At the same time the fiber-coupled TEM 00 laser sources become more popular in holography and interferometry because of their high beam quality, reduced high frequency noise due to spatial filtering in a TEM 00 fiber and convenience in usage. Therefore, the beam shapers should be compatible with those fiber-coupled lasers featured with high beam divergence. Basic piShaper design principles allow to implement a system combining the functions of beam shaping and collimation, as result divergent Gaussian laser beam from TEM 00 fiber is transformed, almost lossless, to collimated flattop beam with low divergence, flat wave front, extended depth of field, reduced noise; such a beam is optimum for SLM-based technologies of CGH, Dot-Matrix mastering of security holograms, multi-colour Denisyuk holography, holographic data storage, holographic projection, lithography, interferometric techniques of Volume Bragg Gratings recording, periodic structuring, etc. Achromatic design of the <b>telescopic</b> and collimating <b>beam</b> shapers allows working with several laser sources with different wavelengths simultaneously that is, for example, important in multi-colour Denisyuk holography. This paper will describe some design basics of collimating refractive beam shapers of the field mapping type and optical layouts of their applying in holographic systems. Examples of real implementations and experimental results will be presented as well...|$|R
40|$|To {{achieve the}} maximum benefit of {{conformal}} radiation therapy {{it is necessary}} to obtain accurate knowledge of radiation beam penumbras based on high-resolution relative dosimetry of beam profiles. For this purpose there: is a need to perform high-resolution dosimetry with well-established routine dosimeters, such as ionization chambers or diodes. Profiles measured with these detectors must be corrected for the dosimeter's nonideal response, caused by finite dimensions and, {{in the case of an}} ionization chamber, the alteration of electron transport and a contribution of electrons recoiled in the chamber wall and the central electrode. For this purpose the line spread function (LSF) of the detector is needed. The experimental determination of LSFs is cumbersome and restricted to the specific detector and beam energy spectrum used. Therefore, a previously reported analytical model [Med. Phys. 27, 923 - 934 (2000) ] has been extended to determine response profiles of routine dosimeters: shielded diodes and, in particular, ionization chambers, in primary dose slit beams. The model combines Compton scattering of incident photons, the transport of recoiled electrons by Fermi-Eyges small-angle multiple scattering theory, and functions to limit electron transport. It yields the traveling direction and the energy of electrons upon incidence on the detector surface. In the case of ionization chambers, geometrical considerations are then sufficient to calculate the relative amount of ionization in chamber air, i. e., the detector response, as a function of the detector location in the slit beam. In combination with the previously reported slit beam dose profiles, the LSF can then readily be derived by reconstruction techniques. Since the spectral contributions are preserved, the LSF of a dosimeter is defined for any beam for which the effective spectrum is known. The detector response profiles calculated in this study have been verified in a <b>telescopic</b> slit <b>beam</b> geometry., and were found to correspond to experimental profiles within 0. 2 and 0. 3 mm (full width at half-maximum) for a Wellhoefer IC 15 chamber in a 6 and 25 MV-X x-ray beam, respectively. For a shielded diode these figures were found to be 0. 2 and 0. 1 mm, respectively. It is shown that a shielded diode in a primary beam needs only a small size-based correction of measured profiles. The effect of the LSF of an IC 15 chamber on penumbra width has been determined for a set of model penumbras. The LSFs calculated by the application of the analytical model yield a broadening by 2 mm of a 3 mm wide penumbra (20 %- 80 %). This is 0. 5 mm (6 MV-X) to 1 mm (25 MV-X) smaller than found with the experimental LSFs. With a spatial correction based on the LSFs that were determined in this study, this broadening of up to 2 mm is eliminated, so that ionization chambers like the IC 15 can be used for high-resolution relative dosimetry on a routine basis.

5000|$|<b>Telescopic</b> <b>beam</b> {{expanders}} include refracting {{and reflective}} telescopes. [...] A refracting telescope commonly used is the Galilean telescope which can {{function as a}} simple beam expander for collimated light. The main advantage of the Galilean design is that it never focuses a collimated beam to a point, so effects associated with high power density such as dielectric breakdown are more avoidable than with focusing designs such as the Keplerian telescope. When used as intracavity beam expanders, in laser resonators, these telescopes provide two-dimensional beam expansion in the 20-50 range.|$|E
50|$|Extra cavity {{hybrid beam}} transformers: using a <b>telescopic</b> <b>beam</b> expander, {{followed}} by a convex lens, {{followed by a}} multiple-prism beam expander, a laser beam (with a circular cross section) can be transformed into an extremely elongated beam, in the plane of propagation, while extremely thin in the orthogonal plane. The resulting plane illumination, with a near one-dimensional (or line) cross section, eliminates the need of point-by-point scanning and has become important for applications such as N-slit interferometry, microdensitometry, and microscopy. This type of illumination can also be known in the literature as light sheet illumination or selective plane illumination.|$|E
40|$|This thesis work {{is carried}} out in Cargotec Sweden AB, Bromma Conquip to study the {{behavior}} of load carrying welded joints in different weld metal strength mismatch conditions and various penetration ratios. Static and fatigue strength calculations have been made using FEA and experimentation. The joint in the <b>Telescopic</b> <b>beam</b> of the spreader STS 45 has been analyzed. <b>Telescopic</b> <b>beam</b> {{is one of the}} critical and main parts in the spreader, which is directly subjected to the load of containers at various ports. Previous studies show that this joint limits the strength of the spreader, it has thus been analyzed. To check the effect of different strength mismatch conditions in the weld metal, static strength calculations have been carried out. The effect of different penetration ratios on static and fatigue strength has also been studied. A cruciform test specimen is designed according to the joint configuration and the capacity of testing machine. Criteria for the selection of consumables has also been developed and following standards: Eurocode 3, AWS D 1. 1 and BSK 07, have been compared for static joint design. Sub modelling, effective notch stress and beam theory techniques have been used to study the effect of weld metal penetration and size of weld throat on the fatigue strength of the welded joint in the <b>Telescopic</b> <b>beam.</b> The study show that matching or slight under matching in the filler material along with full penetration increases the ultimate strength capacity as well as the ductility in the joint. Results of Eurocode 3, AWS D 1. 1 and BSK 07 are close to each other. Apart from strength mismatch and penetration ratios, it is observed that the weld geometry and joint preparation has also effect on the strength of the joint. Fatigue analysis of the weld in the <b>Telescopic</b> <b>beam</b> using 3 D Finite element analysis show that effective notch concept is not applicable to this part of the spreader...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} in this project was directed, firstly towards gaining {{an understanding of the}} effect excited-state absorption (ESA) has on gain and lasing in broadly tunable Ce:LiLuF lasers and secondly towards the development of Ce:LiLuF lasers suitable for spectroscopic applications. Detailed measurements of the single-pass, small-signal gain in Ce:LiLuF were undertaken, with a gain coefficient as high as 30 ± 1 cm - 1 at 309 nm, with an absorbed pump fluence of 0. 46 Jcm - 2. Further, the ESA in Ce:LiLuF at 261 nm and 349 nm was measured. Using both the gain and ESA results in a computer model, the effective gain cross-sections at 309 nm and 327 nm and the ESA cross-sections at 261 nm, 309 nm, 327 nm and 349 nm were determined. The ESA cross-sections were found to be of the order of 10 - 18 cm 2. The effective gain cross-section in Ce:LiLuF was found to increase with decreasing temperature. This was proposed to arise from a decrease in the ESA cross-section with decreasing temperature in the Ce:LiLuF. An in-depth parametric study of Ce:LiLuF laser operation and tunability was undertaken. The results of these studies, together with computer modelling, enabled the importance of ESA and other effects on lasing to be established. In particular, the gain competition effects and ESA were found to lead to inefficient laser operation unless σ-polarised lasing was suppressed. With polarisation selection, efficient operation was obtained, with continuous tunability between 305 nm - 335 nm. Narrow bandwidth operation of Ce:LiLuF for use in OH radical detection in the atmosphere was investigated. Narrow bandwidth operation was achieved {{for the first time in}} Ce:LiLuF using a Eittrow grating with a <b>telescopic</b> and prism <b>beam</b> expansion system. Tunable lasing between 306. 5 nm and 311. 5 nm was obtained, with a spectral bandwidth of 0. 7 cm - 1. Finally, highly efficient Ce:LiLuF lasing was achieved with a new all-solid-state, 289 nm frequency-quadrupled Raman-shifted Nd:YAG laser. Slope efficiencies as high as 62 ± 3 % were achieved. This slope is believed to be the highest obtained in any cerium laser to date. The IR-to-UV conversion efficiency was 0. 41 % and the UV-to-UV conversion efficiency was 41 %. These high efficiencies were attributed to high pump beam quality and good mode matching. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a compact}} master-oscillator power-amplifier laser system {{incorporating}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>beam</b> expansion in a high-gain double-pass amplifier is presented. A miniature (0. 5 W) master-oscillator copper vapor laser {{is used to}} efficiently extract over 37 W of high-beam-quality (full transverse coherence) output power from a kinetically enhanced nominally 35 -W copper vapor laser at 12 -kHz pulse repetition frequency. By configuring the oscillator for low coherence output and using a multimode optical fiber between the oscillator and the double-pass amplifier, a high-power (34 W) low-divergence output beam having a well-defined flat-top far-field beam profile was also produced. The flat-top farfield beam profile arises from control of the spatial coherence of a flat-top near-field beam, rather than the usual techniques for producing flattened Gaussian beams from coherent Gaussian beams. Use of the flat-top focused beam for high-speed percussion drilling of high quality 100 -μm diameter holes in metals was demonstrated, as well as high-power (34 -W average power, 80 -kW peak power) damage-free power transmission through 100 -μm core diameter step-index optical fibers. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} for a two-segment deploying <b>telescopic</b> <b>beam</b> are derived through application of Lagrange's equation. The outer tube of the beam is fixed {{at one end and}} the inner tube slides freely relative to the fixed segment. The resulting nonlinear, non-autonomous set of equations is linearized and simplified to the standard Euler-Bernoulli partial differential equations for an elastic beam by freezing the deployment process at various stages of deployment, and examining the small amplitude and natural modes of vibration of the resulting configuration. Application of the natural boundary conditions and compatibility of motion relations for the two segments in their common region of overlap leads to a transcendental characteristic equation in the frequency parameter Beta(L). Numerical solution of the equation for the characteristic roots determines the modal frequencies, and the corresponding mode shapes are obtained from the general solution of the Euler-Bernoulli equation tailored to the natural boundary conditions. Sample results of modal frequencies and shapes are presented for various stages of deployment and discussed. It is shown that for all intermediate stages of deployment (between 0 and 100 percent) the spectral distribution is drastically altered by the appearance of regions of very closely spaced modal frequencies. The sources of this modal agglomeration are explored...|$|E
40|$|In most laser micro-machining {{applications}} using copper vapour lasers, {{the system}} is configured for near-diffraction limited beam quality. This enables the beam to be tightly focussed to very small spot sizes {{and can be used}} for drilling very small holes or trepanning larger ones. The focused spot has a gaussian-like profile. In this paper a new laser system is presented that has a flat-top beam when focused. This has many advantages over gaussian beams when applied to percussion drilling and certain other applications. This system has demonstrated high speed percussion drilling of high quality 100 micron diameter holes in metals. We also report high speed (> 200 holes/sec) percussion drilling in green sheet ceramic.

By configuring an oscillator for low coherence output and using a multimode optical fibre between the oscillator and a double-pass amplifier, high power (up to 34 W) low divergence output beams having well defined flat-top far field beam profiles have been produced. This scheme generates a flat-top far-field beam profile by control of the spatial coherence of a flat-top near-field beam rather than the usual techniques of producing flattened gaussian beams from coherent gaussian beams.
