The other parent of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Pejić and Edi Maletić (University of Zagreb) to be Dobričić, an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of Šolta.|$|E
5|$|The BORAX Experiments were {{a series}} of {{destructive}} tests of boiling water reactors conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. The BORAX-1 test was conducted under Zinn's supervision in 1954. He had the control rods removed {{to demonstrate that the}} reactor would shut down without trouble, and it immediately blew up with a loud bang and a tall column of dark smoke, a turn of events that he had not anticipated. He shouted to Harold Lichtenberg to put the control rods back in again, but Lichtenberg pointed out <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> already flying through the air. Zinn later had to testify on the experiment before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.|$|E

Matthew Soteriou {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} authoritatively knowing one’s own mental acts which depends on a surprising assumption: One cannot truly judge <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> judging. After briefly criticizing his account of <b>one’s</b> awareness <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> judging, I critically scrutinize two of his arguments against the possibility of truly judging <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> judging. Firstly, assuming such a possibility leads to a regress. Secondly, the second-order judgement inevitably replaces the first-order judgement such as to make the former wrong. Matthew Soteriou (2005) has provided a thorough analysis of our intuitive claims to be directly and authoritatively aware of our own mental activity. Soteriou opposes non-occurrent belief and conscious judgement. The latter is a mental act, the former is not. Conscious judgement is identified with occurrent belief (Soteriou 2005, 96). While one can have a non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> believing <b>that</b> p despite not believing <b>that</b> p, <b>one’s</b> non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> now judging <b>that</b> p cannot be subject to such a mistake. Whenever <b>one</b> <b>is</b> judging <b>that</b> p, <b>one</b> has a non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> judging <b>that</b> p (Soteriou 2005, 95). Whenever one has a non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> judging <b>that</b> p, this belief cannot be false...|$|R

2500|$|Non-contingent {{self-esteem}} {{is described as}} true, stable, and solid.

Some remained flying until 1940 as bombing and gunnery trainers, being declared obsolete in July 1939, with two used as glider tugs until April 1941. At least two examples found experimental use; one for airborne radar {{and the other for}} inflight refuelling, and it is reported <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> still stored as late as 1944.|$|E

However, 44% believed <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> abstinent after genital touching and 33% believed one could have oral sex and still remain abstinent. Of anal and vaginal sex, 14% believed one could engage in the former and 12% said one could participate in the latter while still remaining abstinent.|$|E

25|$|The War Cabinet met (8 April) to discuss, in Hankey's words, “the {{desirability}} {{of getting rid}} of Haig”, who had recently offered to resign. Hankey recorded that sentiment was “unanimously agst Haig” but Wilson’s opinion was that there was no obvious successor and that he suggested waiting for Haig’s report on the March retreat before making a decision. However, in his own diary Wilson later claimed (11 May) he had urged that Haig be sacked, and told Haig so (20 May). Haig and Wilson gradually established a warily respectful relationship, and Lloyd George was soon complaining <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> Scotch and one Irish, but both were whiskies.|$|E
25|$|The {{rights of}} {{citizenship}} {{were based on}} the principle of jus soli, signifying that rights would be granted to all those born on the territory. However, this was not applied uniformly and in some cities as for example in Nijmegen, citizenship could be acquired only by jus sanguinis. Furthermore, as was the case prior to the establishment of the Dutch Republic, citizenship could be purchased if one had lived in the particular city for a period of time. The price for citizenship likewise varied from place to place. This unique way of naturalization of the 18th century was accompanied by rights, obligations and an oath of allegiance to the community of burghers <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> becoming part of.|$|E

5000|$|Usually, {{the color}} green means <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> single {{and looking for}} a {{relationship}}. Red means <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> in a relationship, or not looking for one. Yellow may mean [...] "unsure" [...] or [...] "maybe," [...] or could mean <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> in a relationship but still open to advances. The purpose of a stop light party is to decrease the apprehension associated with approaching potential mates at parties. It also serves the purpose of providing an easy indicator of one's unavailability, to fend off unwelcome advances. The color codes derive from the traffic light signal colors indicating red for stop, yellow for caution/slow down, and green for go.|$|R
25|$|February 10: Heavy air {{activity}} continues {{over the}} battlezone. During the morning, the FAP sends in A-37Bs and Sukhoi Su-22 to strike Ecuadorian positions. The FAE steps in. At 12:42, the Ecuadorian radars pick up five enemy targets approaching {{for another round}} of attacks. Two FAE Mirage F.1JAs and two IAI Kfir C.2s are sent to intercept the incoming aircraft. In the ensuing action an A-37B subsonic aircraft is shot down by a Kfir and two Peruvian Sukhoi Su-22s were claimed to be shot down by the Ecuadorian Mirage F1 respectively. Peru, however, denied that the two Sukhoi Su-22s were shot down by Mirages, stating <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> struck by Ecuadorian anti-aircraft artillery during a low flying ground-attack mission, and the second because of an engine fire.|$|E
25|$|On 10 February 1995, {{a pair of}} Mirage F1JAs, piloted by Maj. Raúl Banderas and Capt. Carlos Uzcátegui, were {{directed}} over five targets approaching the combat zone in the Cenepa valley. After making visual contact, the Mirages fired their missiles, claiming two Peruvian Su-22Ms shot down, while a Kfir claimed a further A-37B Dragonfly. Sources in Peru, however, deny {{the claim that the}} Sukhois Su-22Ms were shot down by Ecuadorian aircraft, stating <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> shot down by Ecuadorian anti-aircraft artillery fire during a low flying ground-attack mission, while the second was lost because of an engine fire.

25|$|The count {{that took}} place on {{election}} night gave Flood a one-vote lead. On March 18, the Westchester County Board of Elections recounted the votes, giving Malloy a one-vote lead. Turning to two unopened absentee ballots, the board found <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> for Flood, resulting in a tie. The other absentee ballot was not opened as {{the name on the}} envelope did not match any names on the voter-registration list. Susan B. Morton, who had registered to vote as Susan Brenner Morton, stepped forward three days later and demanded that her vote for Malloy be counted. For several months afterward, various suits, motions, and appeals were filed in state courts. On October 20, the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, denied requests by Malloy and Morton, leaving the election in a tie. To comply with state law, the village had to use random lots to decide the winner.|$|E
