5|$|The RAAF's Chinook fleet {{suffered}} two serious accidents. On 26 June 1975, A15-011 crashed {{when one}} of its engine turbines disintegrated. No. 3 Aircraft Depot was assigned responsibility for repairing the helicopter, {{but it did not}} reenter service until 21 May 1981 as the maintenance unit lacked experience with major helicopter repairs. On 4 February 1985, A15-001 struck power lines and crashed into Perseverance Dam near Toowoomba, Queensland, while undertaking a navigation exercise. The helicopter's pilot, an exchange officer from the Royal Air Force, was killed and the other three aircrew suffered minor injuries. The helicopter was written off and used as a fire <b>training</b> <b>aid</b> at Amberley. The court of inquiry into this incident found that the air crew were unaware of the presence of the power lines as they were not marked on the maps used to plan the flight, and were difficult to see. However, the inquiry also judged that the mission had been inadequately planned and recommended that No. 12 Squadron update the master map used for preparing operations in the Amberley region to ensure that it included all flying hazards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Scaffolding is a {{well-established}} instructional approach that facilitates learning by incrementally removing <b>training</b> <b>aids</b> as the learner progresses. By combining multiple <b>training</b> <b>aids</b> (i. e. multimodal interfaces), a trainer, either human or virtual, must make real-time decisions about which aids to remove throughout the training scenario. A significant problem occurs in implementing scaffolding techniques since {{the speed and}} choice of removing <b>training</b> <b>aids</b> must be strongly correlated to the individual traits of a specific trainee. We detail an agent-based infrastructure that supports the customization of scaffolding routines per individual user.
