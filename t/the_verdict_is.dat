Ali Al-Ekri {{was sentenced to}} five years imprisonment, another doctor to three years and seven were given from one month to one year. Two other doctors did not appeal their sentences of 15 years' imprisonment, instead fleeing the country. On 1 October, the Court of Cassation, the country's highest court, closed the first case involving twenty medics by upholding jail sentences on the remaining nine. Although <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> final, activist Mohamed al-Maskati said that they could still be pardoned by the king.|$|E
5|$|Before his trial, Tony {{attempts}} suicide. Whitney {{tries to}} visit but is refused, and Bianca {{sees it as}} a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after {{the first day of the}} trial, he flushes the SIM card down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.|$|E

500|$|Now, though, having irreparably {{destroyed}} his reputation and ties with both papal courts, Paul {{was left with}} no option other than to return to Constantinople. In 1394, {{he was back in}} the Byzantine capital, where he appeared before Patriarch Antony IV, before whom he confessed his sins, abjured his conversion to Catholicism, and pleaded for mercy. As Nicol writes, [...] "Only on one point did he protest that he had been wrongfully accused; for, despite rumours and tales contrived against him, he had never indulged in fornication, miracle-mongering, or the practice of magic". The Patriarch passed Paul's case on to the full patriarchal synod, before which Paul was obliged to repeat his confession twice, and then once more before an assembly of the people. The records of these sessions, kept by the patriarchal scribe Perdikes, are the main source on Paul's life. The final portion of the manuscript, containing <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> <b>is</b> missing, but both the synod and the people had recommended a pardon, so it is likely that he was forgiven. His subsequent life is unknown.|$|E

2500|$|Scholars {{disagree}} about {{the themes of}} Ecclesiastes. Is it positive and life-affirming, or deeply pessimistic? Is Kohelet coherent or incoherent, insightful or confused, orthodox or heterodox? Is the ultimate message of the book to copy Kohelet, the wise man, or to avoid his errors? At times Kohelet raises deep questions; he [...] "doubted every aspect of religion, from the very ideal of righteousness, to the by now traditional idea of divine justice for individuals." [...] Some passages of Ecclesiastes seem to contradict other portions of the Old Testament, and even itself. One suggestion for resolving the contradictions is {{to read the book}} as the record of Kohelet's quest for knowledge: opposing judgments (e.g., [...] "the dead are better off than the living" [...] (4:2) vs. [...] "a living dog is better off than a dead lion" [...] (9:4)) are therefore provisional, and it is only at the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> delivered (11–12:7). On this reading, Kohelet's sayings are goads, designed to provoke dialogue and reflection in his readers, rather than to reach premature and self-assured conclusions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{legal systems}} based on English tradition, {{findings}} of fact by a jury, and jury conclusions that could be supported by jury {{findings of fact}} even if the specific factual basis for <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> not known, are entitled to great deference on appeal. [...] In other legal systems, it is generally possible for an appellate court to reconsider both findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the trial court, and in those systems evidence may be presented to appellate courts in {{what amounts to a}} trial de novo (new trial) of appealed findings of fact. [...] The finality of trial court findings of fact in legal systems based on the English tradition has major impact on court procedure in these systems. [...] This makes it imperative that lawyers be highly prepared for trial because errors and misjudgments related to the presentation of evidence at trial to a jury cannot generally be corrected later on appeal, particularly in court systems based on the English tradition. [...] The higher the stakes, the more this is true. [...] Surprises at trial are much more consequential in court systems based on the English tradition than they are in other legal systems.|$|E
2500|$|The 50% {{dependable}} {{water year}} is considered as normal water year whose total water availability {{in the basin}} is 740 TMC. [...] All the unused water in the reservoirs (≥ 3 TMC storage) {{at the beginning of}} water year in the basin are also considered for arriving the total available water in a water year to be shared by the riparian states. Tamil Nadu has to use 10 TMC for minimum environmental flows downstream of Lower Coleroon Anicut and supply 7 TMC to Puducherry out of the 192 TMC water released by Karnataka in a normal water year. Kerala can use 21 TMC from Kabini river basin, 6 TMC from Bhavani river basin and 3 TMC from Pambar river basin in a normal year. Water going waste to sea at Lower Coleroon Anicut in excess of 4 TMC (other than 10 TMC minimum environmental flows) in any water year forms part of utilisable water share of Tamil Nadu. The ambiguity in <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> that utilisable water (clauses IV and V) in the basin is allocated among the states but it has not defined how to measure the same. Instead clause XIV of final order defines how to measure the beneficial water uses which is not equal to the utilisable water.|$|E

2500|$|Luca and Mateiu Caragiale's stylistic {{affiliation}} with Symbolism illustrated a secondary {{stage in the}} development of Romania's own Symbolist current. This ideological choice, literary historian George Călinescu notes, pitied Luca against his father, a noted adversary of first-generation Symbolists such as Alexandru Macedonski: [...] " [...] disliked the Symbolists and he anguished Luki so badly, that the latter broke out crying and declared his father to be without understanding for 'real poetry'." [...] Critics offer differing perspectives on Caragiale's overall contribution. According to Călinescu, his lyrical texts were generally [...] "verbose and dry", while his other works lacked [...] "the art of a prose writer." [...] Ioana Pârvulescu also opines that, while Mateiu, whom his father credited with the least talent, was able to impose himself in Romanian literature, Luca's [...] "vaguely Symbolist" [...] poetry only displayed [...] "the involuntary expressiveness that one finds in any first attempts." [...] <b>The</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> common among other authors: Barbu Cioculescu and Ion Vartic mainly see young [...] "Luki" [...] as a mimetic and histrionic artist. For Șerban Cioculescu, the overall nature of young Caragiale's contribution was outstanding: [...] "Luca Ion was in fact a virtuoso who tried his hand on all instruments and keyboards with the same dexterity, in search of not just a poetic fixation, but in one's own fixation among the chaos of one's time. Beyond the mirages that his unquestionable talent puts on display for us, one catches a glimpse of a dramatic process of consciousness." ...|$|E
