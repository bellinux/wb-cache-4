5|$|Aetosauria {{was first}} named in 1889 by English naturalist Richard Lydekker and {{zoologist}} Henry Alleyne Nicholson. They considered Aetosauria {{to be one}} of three suborders of the order Crocodilia, the other two being Parasuchia (a Triassic group) and Eusuchia (a group including all post-Triassic crocodiles). At the time, Cope considered Aetosauria to belong to Rhynchocephalia, an order of reptiles that includes the living tuatara. He also thought that the <b>tightly</b> <b>fitting</b> osteoderms, which were thought to be fused to the ribs, indicated that aetosaurs were transitional between rhynchocephalians and turtles. Nicholson and Lydekker placed a single family within the suborder, Aëtosauridæ. They considered aetosaurs to be similar to living crocodilians apart from their elongated metatarsals, which were compared to those of dinosaurs. In fact, Marsh considered aetosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs because both had similar metatarsals.|$|E

It consists of piled up petri-dishes placed {{on top of}} a water reservoir with an air-water lifting tube. Each of the seperately removable units is composed of the bottom of a petri-dish glued on top of the lid of another one.

50|$|The {{two halves}} of a hummingbird's bill have a {{pronounced}} overlap, with the lower half (mandible) <b>fitting</b> <b>tightly</b> inside the upper half (maxilla). When a hummingbird feeds on nectar, the bill is usually opened only slightly, allowing the tongue to dart out and into the interior of flowers. Hummingbird bill sizes range from about 5 mm to as long as 100 mm (about 4 in). When catching insects in flight, a hummingbird's jaw flexes downward to widen the gape for successful capture.|$|R
25|$|Underwear is worn for {{a variety}} of reasons. They keep outer {{garments}} from being soiled by perspiration, urine, semen, menstrual blood and feces. Women's brassieres provide support for the breasts, and men's briefs serve the same function for the male genitalia. A corset may be worn as a foundation garment to alter a woman's body shape. For additional support and protection when playing sports, men often wear more <b>tightly</b> <b>fitting</b> underwear, including jockstraps and jockstraps with cup pocket and protective cup. Women may wear sports bras which provide greater support, thus increasing comfort and reducing the chance of damage to the ligaments of the chest during high-impact exercises such as jogging.|$|E
25|$|When a tooth {{is picked}} up, it {{should always be}} grasped by the enamel on the crown. Finger {{pressure}} on the tooth root cells will cause cell crushing. Any attempt to clean off any debris should be avoided. Debris should always be washed off gently with, at the very least, a physiologic saline. Even {{with the use of}} a physiologic saline, the “scrubbing” of the tooth root to remove debris must be avoided. When placed in a physiologic solution, the tooth should be gently agitated to permit the cleansing of the tooth root. At the same time that this agitation occurs, the bumping of the tooth root against a hard surface such as glass, plastic or even cardboard must also be avoided. For the same reasons, the method in which the knocked-out teeth are transported must be carefully selected. Placing the knocked-out teeth in transporting vehicles such as tissues and handkerchiefs can be damaging and transporting them in glass or cardboard containers can also be potentially damaging to the cells. In addition to the potential damage that the hard surface can cause, glass containers have the added possibility of breakage or leakage of the physiologic storage fluid. If the glass container does not have a <b>tightly</b> <b>fitting</b> top, then during the transportation, the physiologic storage solution can spill out and the teeth can fall, once again, on the floor and, at the same time, be out of a physiologic environment.|$|E
500|$|Rapid {{sequence}} induction and intubation (RSI) is {{a particular}} method of induction of general anesthesia, commonly employed in emergency operations and other situations where patients are assumed to have a [...] "full stomach". The objective of RSI is to minimize the possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during the induction of general anesthesia and subsequent tracheal intubation. RSI traditionally involves preoxygenating the lungs with a <b>tightly</b> <b>fitting</b> oxygen mask, followed by the sequential administration of an intravenous sleep-inducing agent and a rapidly acting neuromuscular-blocking drug, such as rocuronium, succinylcholine, or cisatracurium besilate, before intubation of the trachea.|$|E
50|$|While wires may be crimped, {{they should}} not be heavily tinned with solder prior to {{installation}} in a screw terminal, since the soft metal will cold flow, resulting in a loose connection and possible fire hazard. Screw connectors sometimes come loose if not done up <b>tightly</b> enough at <b>fitting</b> time. Verifying adequate tightening torque requires calibrated installation tools and proper training. In the UK, all screw connectors on fixed mains installations are required to be accessible for servicing, for this reason.|$|R

She commonly wears black gothic dresses to match her hair, <b>tightly</b> form <b>fitting,</b> with a hobble skirt, with fringe of thick octopus-like cloth [...] "tentacles" [...] at the lower hem. According to Wednesday, Morticia applies baking powder to her face instead of actual makeup. In each episode, she easily allures her husband Gomez by speaking French (or any other foreign language for that matter). Morticia is musically inclined, and is often seen freely strumming a Japanese shamisen. She frequently enjoys cutting the buds off of roses, which she discards (keeping only the stems), likes cutting out paper dolls with three heads and making sweaters with three arms, collecting the mail from the hand-in-the-box Thing, and cooking unusual concoctions for her husband; including eye of newt. She also has a carnivorous plant, an African Strangler named Cleopatra, which she enjoys feeding. Morticia also has an affinity for making certain that her family upholds the traditional Addams way, and is usually the most taken aback when one of the clan goes astray and does something [...] "pleasant." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2012 a third [...] "stem aetosaur" [...] was {{described}} from the Middle Triassic Manda Beds of Tanzania. It differs from other Middle Triassic pseudosuchians {{in having a}} long skull, a small antorbital fenestra that fits into a large antorbital fossa {{in front of the}} eye socket, sharp and curved teeth, and osteoderms covering much of its body. Like aetosaurs and Revueltosaurus, it has a maxilla that fits into the jugal. Revueltosaurus, Turfanosuchus, and the unnamed Tanzanian pseudosuchian are all good fits for the hypothesized ancestor of aetosaurs because they both have double rows of leaf-shaped osteoderms along their backs that could potentially have evolved into the <b>tightly</b> <b>fitting</b> paramedian osteoderms of aetosaurs.|$|E
2500|$|Churidars, or more {{properly}} churidar pyjamas, are <b>tightly</b> <b>fitting</b> trousers worn by {{both men and}} women in South Asia. Churidars are a variant of the common salwar pants. Salwars are cut wide at the top and narrow at the ankle. Churidars narrow more quickly, so that contours of the leg are revealed. [...] They are usually cut on the bias, making them naturally stretchy. Stretch is important when pants are closefitting. They are also longer than the leg and sometimes finish with a <b>tightly</b> <b>fitting</b> buttoned cuff at the ankle. The excess length falls into folds and appears like a set of bangles resting on the ankle (hence 'churidar'; 'churi': bangle, 'dar': like). When the wearer is sitting, the extra material is the [...] "ease" [...] that makes it possible to bend the legs and sit comfortably. [...] The word churidar is from Urdu and made its way into English only in the 20th century. Earlier, tight fitting churidar-like pants worn in India were referred to by the British as Moghul breeches, long-drawers, or mosquito drawers.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This report {{considers}} {{feasibility of}} conducting a UK trial of combination devices for tinnitus, {{using data from}} the study which evaluated different listener programmes available within the pre-market version of Oticon Alta with Tinnitus Sound Generator. DESIGN: Open and closed questions addressed the following feasibility issues: (1) Participant recruitment; (2) Device acceptability; (3) Programme preferences in different self-nominated listening situations; (4) Usability; (5) Compliance; (6) Adverse events. STUDY SAMPLE: Eight current combination hearing aid users (all males) aged between 62 - 72 years (mean age 67. 25 years, SD[*]=[*] 3. 8). RESULTS: All eight participants reported the physical aspects and noise options on the experimental device to be acceptable. Programmes with amplification and masking features were equally preferred over the basic amplification-only programme. Individual preferences for the different programme options varied widely, both across participants and across listening situations. CONCLUSIONS: A set of recommendations for future trials were formulated which calls for more "real world" trial design rather than <b>tightly</b> controlling the <b>fitting</b> procedure...|$|R
60|$|That {{evening when}} Hector {{returned}} to his room after he had finished his meal, he found Paolo waiting outside his door. His appearance had so changed {{that he would not}} have known him. His hair had been cut short in the front and left long behind, as was the custom of the day, hanging down on to his collar. He was neat and tidy. He wore a dark blue doublet reaching to the hips, with a buff leather belt, in which was stuck a dagger. His leggings, <b>fitting</b> <b>tightly</b> down to the ankles, were of dark maroon cloth, and he wore short boots of tanned leather. A plain white collar, some four inches deep, was worn turned down over the neck of the doublet, and a yellow cloth cap, with a dark cock's feather, was stuck on one side of his head. In his hand he held a bundle containing a leather jerkin and breeches of the same material, and a pair of buff leather riding boots that would reach to the knee.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to histologically {{evaluate}} the performance of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) when compared with a blood clot in addition to an occlusive barrier in the bone regeneration process for bone defects in a rabbit model. Prefabricated metallic capsules with 4. 5  mm and 3. 5  mm dimensions were placed in five adult rabbit skulls. At the right side, the capsule was filled with DBM, and the clot was located on the left side. The barriers were supplied with a 0. 5  mm horizontal peripheral flap and a vertical edge, <b>fitting</b> <b>tightly</b> into a circular slit prepared by a trephine in the skull. After a healing period of three months, the animals were sacrificed, and the samples were prepared for histological and histomorphometric analyses after capsule removal. Trabecular and medullar bone percentages were calculated from the different areas of the newly formed bone inside the metallic barriers, and non-parametric statistical analysis was used to describe the findings. The results showed a complete filling of newly formed bone inside the capsules of both groups. Less mature bone tissue was observed in the upper third of all samples, and a higher trabecular area was observed in the samples with DBM. The use of barriers resulted in the augmentation of newly formed bone in a three-month period. However, a higher trabecular area was observed in the barriers filled with DBM...|$|R
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{thermodynamics}} {{as a scientific}} discipline generally begins with Otto von Guericke who, in 1650, built and designed the world's first vacuum pump and demonstrated a vacuum using his Magdeburg hemispheres. [...] Guericke was driven to make a vacuum in order to disprove Aristotle's long-held supposition that 'nature abhors a vacuum'. Shortly after Guericke, the English physicist and chemist Robert Boyle had learned of Guericke's designs and, in 1656, in coordination with English scientist Robert Hooke, built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed a correlation between pressure, temperature, and volume. [...] In time, Boyle's Law was formulated, which states that pressure and volume are inversely proportional. [...] Then, in 1679, based on these concepts, an associate of Boyle's named Denis Papin built a steam digester, which was a closed vessel with a <b>tightly</b> <b>fitting</b> lid that confined steam until a high pressure was generated.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the larger}} multiplace chambers, {{patients}} inside the chamber breathe from either [...] "oxygen hoods" [...] – flexible, transparent soft plastic hoods with a seal {{around the neck}} similar to a space suit helmet – or <b>tightly</b> <b>fitting</b> oxygen masks, which supply pure oxygen and may be designed to directly exhaust the exhaled gas from the chamber. During treatment patients breathe 100% oxygen {{most of the time}} to maximise the effectiveness of their treatment, but have periodic [...] "air breaks" [...] during which they breathe chamber air (21% oxygen) {{to reduce the risk of}} oxygen toxicity. The exhaled treatment gas must be removed from the chamber to prevent the buildup of oxygen, which could present a fire risk. Attendants may also breathe oxygen some of the time to reduce their risk of decompression sickness when they leave the chamber. The pressure inside the chamber is increased by opening valves allowing high-pressure air to enter from storage cylinders, which are filled by an air compressor. Chamber air oxygen content is kept between 19% and 23% to control fire risk (US Navy maximum 25%). If the chamber does not have a scrubber sysytem to remove carbon dioxide from the chamber gas, the chamber must be isobarically ventilated to keep the CO2 within acceptable limits.|$|E

Command was imprinted in every line of his strong, square-set face and erect, powerful frame. Above the medium size, with a vast spread of shoulder, a broad aggressive jaw, and bright bold glance, his whole pose and expression spoke of resolution pushed to the verge of obstinacy.

40|$|Most {{existing}} {{studies of}} text classification {{assume that the}} training data are completely labeled. In reality, however, many information retrieval problems can be more accurately described as learning a binary classifier from a set of incompletely labeled examples, where we typically have {{a small number of}} labeled positive examples and {{a very large number of}} unlabeled examples. In this paper, we study such a problem of performing Text Classification WithOut labeled Negative data (TC-WON). In this paper, we explore an efficient extension of the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, called SVMC (Support Vector Mapping Convergence) [17], for the TC-WON tasks. Our analyses show that when the positive training data is not too under-sampled, SVMC significantly outperforms other methods because SVMC basically exploits the natural "gap" between positive and negative documents in the feature space, which eventually corresponds to improving the generalization performance. In the text domain there are likely to exist many gaps in the feature space because a document is usually mapped to a sparse and high dimensional feature space. However, as the number of positive training data decreases, the boundary of SVMC starts overfitting at some point and end up generating very poor results. This is because when the positive training data is too few, the boundary over-iterates and trespasses the natural gaps between positive and negative class in the feature space and thus ends up <b>fitting</b> <b>tightly</b> around the few positive training data...|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the rifle-musket and the {{widespread}} adoption of rifled barrels by military forces, the spherical projectile eventually died out — though the new elongated bullets were still called balls in the military (indeed, full metal jacket ammunition is called ball ammunition to this day). While both conical bullets and balls were used with rifles, both in cartridge and loose form for several hundred years, the mid 19th century Minié ball contained a number of important innovations that allowed rifled weapons to be adopted by the main infantry units, rather than being the preserve of elite skirmisher and rifle units as had been the case before. Minie balls were manufactured in a smaller diameter than the bore of the weapon it was to be used in, just like a normal musket ball; this allowed for easy loading, even when the gun was fouled, while a rifle ball had to be forced down the tight-fitting barrel by force, even using a mallet. When fired, the pressure of the gases would force the bullet to expand, <b>fitting</b> <b>tightly</b> into the rifling grooves, unlike the loose-fitting and inaccurate musket ball. This was achieved by including a deep cavity in the rear, into which fitted (initially) an iron hemispherical cup, later a conical clay or timber plug, which caused the base of the projectile to expand upon firing, sealing the skirt to the bore, allowing an undersized projectile to be used for ease of loading without a patch. (Eventually {{it was found that the}} pressure of the powder gases expanded the base to fit the bore, without any plug or filler.) Another was a number of grooves around the projectile, the leading edges of which are intended to scrape out the fouling but were found better used making the projectile more accurate when filled with a lubricant (traditionally made of beeswax and rendered animal fat.) As noted before, this lubricant also serves to keep soft the black powder fouling, thus making the fouled barrel much easier to reload.|$|R
2500|$|Henschel was a German {{locomotive}} manufacturer. Soon after Hitler's rise to power, Henschel {{decided to}} start designing aircraft, {{one of the first}} being the Hs 123. The aircraft was designed to meet the 1933 dive bomber requirements for the reborn Luftwaffe. Both Henschel and rival Fieseler (with the Fi 98) competed for the production contract requirement, which specified a single-seat biplane dive bomber. The first prototype Hs 123, the Hs 123V1 was cleared for its maiden flight on 1 April 1935, and General Ernst Udet, a World War I ace, flew the first prototype on its first public demonstration flight on 8 May 1935. [...] The first three Henschel prototypes, with the first and third powered by 485kW (650hp) BMW 132A-3 engines and the second by a 574kW (770hp) Wright Cyclone, were tested at Rechlin in August 1936. Only the first prototype had [...] "smooth" [...] cowlings; from that point on, all aircraft had a <b>tightly</b> <b>fitting</b> cowling that included 18 fairings covering the engine valves. The Henschel prototypes did away with bracing wires and although they looked slightly outdated with their single faired interplane struts and cantilever main landing gear legs attached to smaller (stub) lower wings, the Hs 123 featured an all-metal construction, clean lines and superior maneuverability.

60|$|They {{were dressed}} in the costume of the country: most of them wore light-blue cloth capotes, girded tightly round them by scarlet or crimson worsted belts. Some of them had blue, and others scarlet, cloth leggings, ornamented more or less with stained {{porcupine}} quills, coloured silk, or variegated beads; while some might be seen clad in the leathern coats of winter-deer-skin dressed like chamois leather, fringed all round with little tails, and ornamented much {{in the same way}} as those already described. The heavy winter moccasins and duffel socks, which gave to their feet the appearance of being afflicted with gout, were now replaced by moccasins of a lighter and more elegant character, having no socks below, and <b>fitting</b> <b>tightly</b> to the feet like gloves. Some wore hats similar to those made of silk or beaver which are worn by ourselves in Britain, but so bedizened with scarlet cock-tail feathers, and silver cords and tassels, as to leave the original form of the head-dress a matter of great uncertainty. These hats, however, are only used on high occasions, and chiefly by the fops. Most of the men wore coarse blue cloth caps with peaks, and not a few discarded head-pieces altogether, under the impression, apparently, that nature had supplied a covering which was in itself sufficient. These costumes varied not only in character but in quality, according to the circumstances of the wearer; some being highly ornamental and mended--evincing the felicity of the owner in the possession of a good wife--while others were soiled and torn, or but slightly ornamented. The voyageurs were collected, as we have said, in groups. Here stood a dozen of the youngest-- consequently the most noisy and showily dressed--laughing loudly, gesticulating violently, and bragging tremendously. Near to them were collected a number of sterner spirits--men of middle age, with all the energy, and muscle, and bone of youth, but without its swaggering hilarity; men whose powers and nerves had been tried over and over again amid the stirring scenes of a voyageur's life; men whose heads were cool, and eyes sharp, and hands ready and powerful, in the mad whirl of boiling rapids, in the sudden attack of wild beast and hostile man, or in the unexpected approach of any danger; men who, having been well tried, needed not to boast, and who, having carried off triumphantly their respective brides many years ago, needed not to decorate their persons with the absurd finery that characterised their younger brethren. They were comparatively few in number, but they composed a sterling band, of which every man was a hero. Among them were those who occupied the high positions of bowman and steersman, and when we tell the reader that on these two men frequently hangs the safety of a boat, with all its crew and lading, it will be easily understood how needful it is that they should be men of iron nerve and strength of mind.|$|R
