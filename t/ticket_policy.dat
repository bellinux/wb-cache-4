50|$|With {{increasingly}} expensive Broadway ticket prices, Seller and McCollum invented Broadway's first rush <b>ticket</b> <b>policy</b> {{early on}} in the production of Rent. The idea was to keep the show accessible for people “in their 20s and 30s, artists, Bohemians—the people for whom Jonathan Larson wrote the show.” A select number of front row tickets would be sold for $20 on a first come per-serve basis. Rush tickets became so popular that people began to sleep on the streets outside the theater to get a spot {{at the front of the}} line. Out of concern for the safety for those who participated in the Rush policy Seller and McCollum created Broadway's first lottery <b>ticket</b> <b>policy,</b> which kept cheap tickets accessible to a young audience by selling $20 tickets to the winners of a drawing.|$|E

5000|$|On October 29, 2012, Radakovich {{accepted}} {{position of}} {{athletic director at}} Clemson University. [...] In 2014, Radakovich pushed for a controversial proposal to implement a $350 student athletic fee which would have raised approximately $6 million in revenues for the Clemson Athletic Department. Radakovich's proposal would have been mandatory for all undergraduate students and voluntary for graduate students who chose to attend athletic events. Ultimately, the plan failed due to resistance from Clemson's Undergraduate Student Government, including a poll which indicated that 85% of students opposed the fee. Only months after the proposed athletic fee failed, Radakovich went before the South Carolina legislature asking for approval to purchase a $4.5 million Cessna Citation CJ2 for the Clemson Athletic Department. Lawmakers approved purchasing the private jet. As of April 2016, Radakovich is again embroiled {{in a fight with}} students over athletic funding. The Clemson Athletic Department announced a new student <b>ticket</b> <b>policy</b> which would require students to pay $225 for season tickets in the coveted lower deck seats of the student section. Students who choose not to pay for tickets may attend games in the upper deck, effectively stratifying students who choose to attend football games into those who can afford to pay for a season ticket and those who cannot. Clemson students are again mobilizing against changes to ticketing policies with a petition written to Radakovich, Clemson President Jim Clements, and the Clemson Board of Trustees in circulation. Additionally, Student Body President Joey Wilson has come out in opposition to the new ticketing policy.|$|E

40|$|Transit {{providers}} {{around the}} world are progressively migrating from automatic fare collection systems to state-of-the-art contactless smartcard systems. The introduction of this new technology provides a unique opportunity for transit agencies to review fares and <b>ticketing</b> <b>policy</b> and leverage the full functionality of these new ticketing systems. Research being undertaken at the University of Queensland seeks to develop recommendations on potential fares and <b>ticketing</b> <b>policy</b> reform using contactless smartcard technologies. Recent experience indicates that introduction of many of the new ticketing systems have been technology- rather than policy-driven. The fare structure is basically a relationship between fare levels and distance travelled, including flat, distance based, time-based and zonal fare structures. Transit fares policy results from trade-offs between competing objectives, such as economic, social or political, but examples of actual policies are extremely hard to find. The availability of new smartcard technology provides the opportunity to provide a 2 ̆ 7 closed 2 ̆ 7 fare collection system, without physical barriers, allowing more differentiated fare structures based on distance travelled. In addition, there are significant opportunities for integrated ticketing and product innovation...|$|R

50|$|The Quad {{is located}} in the center of Lafayette's campus and served as the venue of the first Lafayette-Lehigh in 1884 and other games through 1893. Baseball was also played on the Quad. Sources from the period {{indicate}} that games were played on the level ground between McKeen Hall and college buildings to the south (known today as the Quad). Since football was a new sport and organized by the undergraduates, games were played on the open field in the central area of campus. Small, but manageable crowds would attend the games, mostly consisting of students, alumni, and faculty. Spectators stood or sat alongside the unenclosed field, while undergrads watched the games from their dormatories that flanked the Quad. Around 1888 and 1889, crowds at Lafayette football games began to surge. Attempts were made to collect money for ticket revenues to offset the costs of athletic equipment, a trainer, and a training table. Policemen would be stationed at the entrances of the College to enforce the new <b>ticket</b> <b>policies,</b> however, it was not difficult to avoid paying the small fee. Young boys and many citizens of Easton would easily gain admittance, with only alumni wishing to support the new, informal athletic association paid for tickets. The need to raise revenue from ticket sales, as well as growing crowds, a few spectator incidents, and the persistent destruction of the Quad's grass, {{led to the formation of}} the Alumni Advisory Committee that soon raised funds for the new enclosed March Field.|$|R

2500|$|On the Australian Promo Tour, Snow Patrol's {{promoter}} Frontier Touring Co. {{employed a}} strict <b>ticketing</b> <b>policy</b> {{because of the}} shortage of tickets for the one-off show at the 1,350 capacity Metro Theatre. General sale tickets were available through phone, website, or the venue box office one day before the event (18 November) from 9am and could only be purchased with a credit card. One card holder could only buy two tickets, and the system was designed such that it'd reject attempts of subsequent bookings that bore the same e-mail, phone number or address. The buyer received a confirmation number {{at the time of}} booking and not the physical ticket itself. There were other ways of obtaining tickets too. Snow Patrol's official website held a small competition for members where ten pairs of tickets were up for grabs. Universal Music Australia also ran a competition for fans where they had to buy the album or the single [...] "Take Back the City" [...] from iTunes or JB Hi-Fi and write in telling a reason why they needed to see the band. Winners received tickets for front row and centre. On 19 November, 12pm (the day of the concert), wristbands were made available at the venue. To obtain the bands, a photo ID, the credit card used for purchase and the confirmation number were required. The ticket purchaser and a friend had to arrive together with all proof to be wristbanded. As the show was for people in the 18+ year old bracket, a photo ID was necessary to ensure the attendee was old enough. The tickets were priced at $66 and were non-exchangeable nor transferable. Anyone with a tampered wristband was refused entry.|$|R

40|$|Electronic tickets (e-tickets) are {{electronic}} {{versions of}} paper tickets, which enable users to access intended services and improve services's ciency. Generally, to buy discounted tickets, users must convince ticket sellers that their attributes (i. e. age, profession, location) satisfy the <b>ticket</b> price <b>policies.</b> Hence, privacy {{issues have been}} the primary concerns of e-tickets users. In this paper, a privacy-preserving electronic ticket scheme with fine-grained pricing (PPETS-FGP) is proposed to protect users' privacy and implement fine-grained pricing. The proposed PPETS- FGP scheme captures the following features: (1) Users can buy different price tickets from ticket sellers without releasing their exact attributes; (2) Each user's transaction records cannot be linked; (3) Tickets cannot be transferred and double spent; (4) The security of the proposed PPETS-FGP is formally proven and reduced to well- known (q-strong Diffie-Hellman) complexity assumption.

40|$|Rapid {{advances}} in information and communications {{technology in the}} recent past have opened up new possibilities for ticketing in public transit systems. These systems offer several benefits like replacing cash, deployment of a richer fare structure and minimizing queuing times. Although smart card ticketing systems have existed for several years now, the full potential of the developments in information technology have yet to be leveraged in terms of cost effectiveness and diverse fare collection strategies. In 2002, TfL (Transport for London) has introduced the Oyster card as a means of smart card ticketing. However TfL has the option to extend or possibly depart from the Oyster Card system in the years 2010 or 2015, when the existing contractual agreements for are open to change. With the aim of understanding the future requirements of ticketing systems, TfL wants to explore <b>ticketing</b> <b>policy</b> and technology options that would be effective and feasible over the next 5 to 10 years. The study results will then guide the development of hardware and software concepts to support such systems. We have proposed seven options for future ticketing systems, which can be broadly categorized into seven categories based on their principal technologies used. (cont.) The present work is aimed at guiding TfL to specify the system requirements of the future technology that will best suit the needs of TfL and its customers. A software model has been developed to analyze the effectiveness of the several possible alternatives by estimating their costs and the potential revenues that each of them can generate. The system costs and revenues that can be generated highly depend upon the fare structure used for pricing tickets which in turn depend on the ticketing media, organization that handles the transactions and type of technology used for fare collection. Another goal of the project is to estimate the transaction times required to validate tickets and possibly use real time pricing by performing simulations using the Java card environment. The analysis will help in understanding the hardware requirements and physical properties of the card. by Saumil Mehta. Thesis (M. Eng.)
