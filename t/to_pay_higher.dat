5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>higher</b> prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes were}} met with {{critical}} reception in the province. Many students are now required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>higher</b> sports fees to cover higher transportation costs. Some schools {{do not have access}} to approved vehicles because the Education Act prohibits schools and school districts from owning vehicles. To get around this they use corporate entities to operate vehicles for extracurricular activities. These require money to buy new vehicles and the required insurance, which often requires schools to conduct extra fundraising.|$|E
5|$|In 894 Stylianos Zaoutzes, basileopator {{and leading}} {{minister}} of Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), convinced the emperor {{to move the}} Bulgarian market from Constantinople to Thessaloniki. That move affected not only private interests but also the international commercial importance of Bulgaria and the principle of Byzantine–Bulgarian trade, regulated with the Treaty of 716 and later agreements on the most favoured nation basis. The Bulgarian merchants were allowed to live in Constantinople, resided in their own colony and paid favourable taxes. The city was a major destination of trade routes from all over Europe and Asia and {{the transfer of the}} Bulgarian market to Thessaloniki cut short the direct access to goods from the east, which under the new circumstances the Bulgarians would have to buy through middlemen, who were close associates of Stylianos Zaoutzes. In Thessaloniki the Bulgarians were also forced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>higher</b> tariffs to sell their goods, enriching Zaoutzes' cronies.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{workers in}} 3D professions are well paid, {{due to the}} undesirability of the work, and the {{resulting}} need <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>higher</b> wages to attract workers.

This concept proves itself in the economic theory of quantity supplied and quantity demanded (see Quantity adjustment), the wages paid to these workers is higher due to the undesirable nature of their professions.|$|E
25|$|Debate on {{a second}} gas {{pipeline}} from Alberta to California served as {{a good example of}} changing values during this period. For decades, California consumers opposed rival pipelines for fear of having <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>higher</b> gas prices to cover pipeline construction. Deregulation made the pipeline companies common carriers so that any producer or marketer could buy space on the pipeline to move its gas. Gone were the days when the pipeline company moved the gas and also marketed it.|$|E

Ukraine took steps to change the payments for the transition of Gazprom's gas to Europe from barter to cash.

25|$|Industry jobs {{refer to}} private sector jobs at for-profit corporations.

25|$|Studies have show a {{significant}} number of consumers were content <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>higher</b> prices for Fairtrade products, in the belief that this helps the very poor. One main ethical criticism of Fairtrade is that this premium over non-Fairtrade products does not reach the producers and is instead collected by businesses, employees of co-operatives or used for unnecessary expenses. Furthermore, research has cited the implementation of certain Fairtrade standards as a cause for greater inequalities in markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.|$|E

Lastly, he guaranteed {{the safety of the}} population that might choose to remain in the city.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{researchers}} (David Rodda, Jacob Vigdor, and Janna Matlack), argue that a shortage of affordable housing – {{at least in the}} US – is caused in part by income inequality. David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (Rhoda 1994:148). Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>higher</b> market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.|$|E

25|$|These events {{ruined the}} Byzantine hopes to exert {{influence}} over the newly Christianized country, and emperor Leo VI (r. 886–912) soon {{had a chance to}} retaliate. Some members of the Byzantine court had an interest in moving the market of the Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, which meant that the Bulgarian merchants would have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>higher</b> taxes. That move affected not only private interests but also the international commercial importance of Bulgaria, regulated with the Byzantine–Bulgarian Treaty of 716. The ousting of the merchants from Constantinople, which was a major destination of trade routes from all over Europe and Asia, was a heavy blow for Bulgarian economic interests. The merchants complained to Simeon I, who in turn raised the issue with Leo VI, but the appeal was left unanswered. Simeon, who was seeking a pretext to declare war and begin implementing his plans, launched an invasion of Byzantine Thrace, resulting in what has sometimes been called the first commercial war in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Roh's ambitious initial {{promises}} to establish Korea {{as an international}} business hub in Asia faded soon after his election. Instead, Korea under Roh suffered negative publicity in the foreign business community due to prosecutorial investigations on the purchase and sale of Korea Exchange Bank by the Lone Star Fund, spurring foreign investors to join their domestic counterparts in leaving the country. When housing prices soared, To prevent speculative bubble like Japanese asset price bubble crisis, Roh introduced additional 1~3% of property tax on real estate exceeding 600 million won(about 600,000US$). This efficiently slowed down the bubble, but this policy met high opposition by the riches who had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>higher</b> tax. At the same time, Roh also increased welfare spending by 18% a year, and drastically increased spending by increasing {{the size of the}} civil service by more than 95,700 new hires, or approximately 60 people a day. Criticism of lax discipline among the civil service and police force was high during his government.|$|E
25|$|With a few limited exceptions, the High Court has the {{jurisdiction}} {{to hear and}} try any action in personam (that is, directed towards a particular person) where the defendant is served with a writ of summons or other originating process in or outside Singapore, or where the defendant submits to the Court's jurisdiction. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction – it can hear any type of case no matter how trivial or serious. In practice, though, parties may be penalized by having <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>higher</b> costs (legal fees) {{if they choose to}} bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. Generally, except in probate matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are commenced in the High Court only if the value of the deceased's estate exceeds $3 million, or if the case involves the resealing of a foreign grant of probate or letters of administration.|$|E
