40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{analysing}} {{the moment}} effects at the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point</b> {{and at the}} central axis, {{in the framework of}} a turning process. A testing device in turning, including a six-component dynamometer, is used to measure the complete torsor of the cutting actions in the case of self-excited vibrations. Many results are obtained regarding the mechanical actions torsor. A confrontation of the moment components at the tool tip and at the central axis is carried out. It clearly appears that analysing moments at the central axis avoids the disturbances induced by the transport of the moment of the mechanical actions resultant at the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point.</b> For instance, the order relation between the components of the forces is unic. Furthermore, the order relation between the moments components expressed at the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point</b> is also unic and the same one. But at the central axis, two different order relations regarding moments are conceivable. Are associated to these two order relations a modification in the rolling moment localization in the (y, z) tool plan. Thus, the moments components at the central axis are particularly sensitive at the disturbances of machining, here the self-excited vibrations...|$|E

This paper {{is dedicated to}} the study of the self-excited vibrations incidence on various major mechanics characteristics of the system workpiece / tool / material. The efforts (forces and moments) measurement using a six components dynamometer confirms the tool tip moments existence. The fundamental frequency of 190 Hz proves to be common to the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point</b> displacements, the action application point or at the torque exerted to the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point.</b> The confrontation of the results concerning displacements and efforts shows that the applications points of these elements evolve according to similar ellipses located in quasi identical planes. The large and the small axes of these ellipses are increasing with the feed rate motion values accordingly to the mechanical power injected into the system. Conversely, the respective axes ratios of these ellipses are decreasing functions of the feed rate while the ratio of these ratios remains constant when the feed rate value is increasing. In addition, some chip characteristics are given, like the thickness variations, the width or the hardening phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|SummaryAlthough tool use {{is known}} to occur in species ranging from naked mole rats [1] to owls [2], {{chimpanzees}} are the most accomplished tool users [3 – 5]. The modification and use of tools during hunting, however, is still {{considered to be a}} uniquely human trait among primates. Here, we report the first account of habitual tool use during vertebrate hunting by nonhumans. At the Fongoli site in Senegal, we observed ten different chimpanzees use tools to hunt prosimian prey in 22 bouts. This includes immature chimpanzees and females, members of age-sex classes not normally characterized by extensive hunting behavior. Chimpanzees made 26 different tools, {{and we were able to}} recover and analyze 12 of these. Tool construction entailed up to five steps, including trimming the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> to a <b>point.</b> <b>Tools</b> were used in the manner of a spear, rather than a probe or rousing tool. This new information on chimpanzee tool use has important implications for the evolution of tool use and construction for hunting in the earliest hominids, especially given our observations that females and immature chimpanzees exhibited this behavior more frequently than adult males...|$|R

40|$|The goal {{of machine}} tools for Ultra High Precision Machining is to {{guarantee}} high specified performances {{and to maintain}} them over life cycle time. In this paper the design of an innovative mechatronic subsystem (platform) for Active Vibration Control (AVC) of Ultra High Precision micromilling Machines is presented. The platform integrates piezoelectric stack actuators and a novel sensor concept. During the machining process (e. g. milling), the contact between the cutting tool and the workpiece surface at the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point</b> generates chattering vibrations. Any vibration is recorded on the workpiece surface, directly affecting its roughness. Consequently, uncontrolled vibrations lead to poor surface finishing, unacceptable in high precision milling. The proposed Smart Platform aims to improve the surface finishing of the workpiece exploiting a broadband AVC strategy. The paper describes the steps throughout the design phase of the platform, beginning from the actuator/se nsor criteria selection taking into account both performance and durability. The novel actuation principle and mechanism and the related FE analysis are also presented.

40|$|The {{tool path}} {{composed}} of consecutive short linear segments (G 01 blocks) {{is still the}} widespread tool path representation form in five-axis machining. The inherent shortcoming of linear tool path is first-order discontinuity at the corner, which is the bottleneck to achieve high-speed and high-accuracy machining. In this article, a dual-Bézier path smoothing algorithm for five-axis linear tool path in workpiece coordinate system is proposed. There are three steps involved in our method. First, the corner error distribution model is introduced to assign the given tolerance to the smoothing approximation error constraint and the chord error constraint to ensure the interpolation trajectory error within the given tolerance. Second, segment junctions of the linear tool path in workpiece coordinate system are smoothed by double G 2 continuous cubic Bézier curves. One cubic Bézier curve is used to round {{the corner of the}} <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point</b> path, and the other Bézier curve is used to round the corner of the tool axis point path. This algorithm takes the conditions of approximation error constraint, the parameterized synchronization constraint, and continuous curvature constraint into consideration. Hence, the tangency and curvature continuities are both guaranteed in the new path. Third, an adaptive feedrate scheduling method is introduced to interpolate the new path. Simulation and experiment are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in five-axis tool path smoothing, speed smoothing, and trajectory accuracy controlling...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of digital manufacturing in creating increasingly complex products with small batch sizes, requires effective methods for production process planning. Toolpath generation {{is one of}} the challenges for manufacturing technologies that function based on the controlled movement of an end effector against a workpiece. The current approaches for determining suitable tool paths are highly dependent on machine structure, manufacturing technology and product geometry. This dependence can be very expensive in a volatile production environment where the products and the resources change quickly. In this research, a novel approach for the flexible generation of toolpaths using a mathematical formulation of the desired objective is proposed. The approach, based on optimisation techniques, is developed by discretising the product space into a number of grid points and determining the optimal sequence of the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> visiting these <b>points.</b> To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, the context of milling machining has been chosen and a genetic algorithm has been developed to solve the optimisation problem. The results show that with meta-heuristic methods, flexible tool paths can indeed be generated for industrially relevant parts using existing computational power. Future computing platforms, including quantum computers, could extend the applicability of the proposed approach to much more complex domains for instantaneous optimisation of the detailed manufacturing process plan...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{deformations}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} significant factors that affects machine tool (MT) positioning accuracy. These induced errors are complex for accurate representation by a model, nevertheless they need to be evaluated and predicted in order to increase the machining performance. This paper presents a novel approach to calibrate a machine tool in real-time, analyzing the thermo-mechanical errors through fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors embedded in the MT frame. The proposed configuration consists of an adaptronic structure of passive materials, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP), equipped with FBG sensors that are able to measure in real-time the deformed conditions of the frame. By using a proper thermo-mechanical kinematic model, the displacement of the end effector may be predicted and corrected when it is subjected to external undesired factors. By starting from a set of Finite Element (FE) simulations to develop a model able to describe the MT structure stresses, a prototype has been fabricated and tested. The aim of this study was to compare the numerical model with the experimental tests using FBG sensors. The experimental campaign has been performed by varying the structure temperature over time and measuring the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point</b> (TTP) positions.

This paper {{is dedicated to the}} experimental displacements analysis of the block tool / block workpiece with self-excited vibrations. In connexion with turning process, the self-excited vibrations domain is obtained starting from spectra of two accelerometers. The existence of a displacements plane attached to the tool edge point is revealed. This plane proves to be inclined compared to the machines tool axes. We establish that the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point</b> describes an ellipse. This ellipse is very small and can be considered as a small straight line segment for the stable cutting process (without vibrations). In unstable mode (with vibrations) the ellipse of displacements is really more visible. A difference in phase occurs between the tool tip displacements on the radial direction and on the cutting one. The feed motion direction and the cutting one are almost in phase. The values of the long and small ellipse axes (and their ratio) shows that these sizes are increasing with the feed rate value. The axis that goes through the stiffness center and the tool tip represents the maximum stiffness direction. The maximum (resp. minimum) stiffness axis of the tool is perpendicular to the large (resp. small) ellipse displacements axis. FFT analysis of the accelerometers signals allows to reach several important parameters and establish coherent correlations between tool tip displacements and the static - elastic characteristics of the machine tool components tested...|$|E

We examine this question by studying the fish ponds in the Dombes region, France. These waterbodies are characterized by a high diversity of species. High levels of nutrients due to certain fish farming practices may cause significant eutrophication leading to loss in biodiversity and a shift from high coverage of aquatic vegetation to phytoplankton dominance may also be observed. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess <b>tipping</b> <b>points,</b> thresholds for effect, along a gradi- ent of chlorophyll ̨ in different taxonomic groups: aquatic vascular plants, phytoplankton, dragonflies and aquatic macro-invertebrates. <b>Tipping</b> <b>points</b> are analyzed with three different statistical methods: a method which evaluates <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> with a difference in the mean (TMEAN), a second method which evaluates <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> by comparing the mean and linear regressions before and after the <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> (FSTAT) and third a method which evaluates linear regressions with a pivotal <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> (SEGMENTED). We also compare <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> for the different taxonomic groups using five different diversity indices: Observed richness, Jackknife first order, Fisher’s alpha, Simpson index and Evenness.

We argue that safety <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> occur when managerial escalation policies are exhausted and workload variability buffers are depleted. Front-line clinical staff is forced to ration resources and, at the same time, becomes more error-prone as a result of elevated stress hormone levels. We confirm the existence of safety <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> for in-hospital mortality using the discharge records of 82, 280 patients across six high-mortality-risk conditions from 256 clinical departments of 83 German hospitals. Focusing on survival during the first seven days following admission, we estimate a mortality <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> at an occupancy level of 92. 5 %. Among the 17 % of patients in our sample who experienced occupancy above the <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> during the first seven days of their hospital stay, high occupancy accounted for one in seven deaths.

In order to apply the theoretical framework of <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> to real-world occurrences, data on stream-insect response to agricultural and urban land uses from the Great Lakes states of IL, WI, and MI are analyzed using the conceptual framework developed in Chapter 2. ^ The application of <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> in management is rather rare due to deficits in long-term monitoring capabilities, and reliable early warning signal measures or useful indicators. We are also unable to account for or predict emergent, unexpected properties, which may have large consequences on system dynamics and generate <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> if they are of high magnitude. However, recognizing that the study of <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> strictly related to the natural sciences is still in its infancy, there is currently ample opportunity for breakthrough developments in <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> predictability, which in turn may yield valuable information about coupled natural human systems. ...|$|R
