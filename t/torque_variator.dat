40|$|The <b>torque</b> <b>variator</b> with {{permanent}} {{engagement of}} cogwheels is a planetary mechanism with two degree of freedoms. It has the superimposed differential constraint providing the certain motion of cogwheels under operation of forces. In automobile automatical boxes of transfers the differential constraint {{is used as}} the device having hydrodynamic adapting effect. That is connected with power losses. At passed time the materials of three World congresses under the theory of machines and mechanisms (Italy, Milan- 1995, China, Tianjin- 2004, France, Besancon- 2007) about effective mechanisms with differential constraints without power losses are published. In afforded work the <b>torque</b> <b>variator</b> having {{two degrees of freedom}} and differential constraint which is provided by geometrical parameters of cogwheels at absence of power losses on creation of adapting effect is considered. The variator contains input structural group with two degrees of freedom (rack, input carrier, satellite) and the joining kinematic chain with zero mobility (two blocks of the central cogwheels, output satellite, output carrier). The joining kinematic chain superimposes a differential constraint on relative motion of the input satellite. The geometrical parameters of cogwheels are such that the efforts transmitted to the input satellite by the joining kinematic chain, are not equal one to other. Equilibrium of the satellite at equality of input and output powers can take place only in motion at the account of speeds of application points of forces. The connection of acting forces with speeds of their application points by a principle of possible works defines the external differential constraint superimposed on motion of input structural group. In afforded work for gear variator the structure, the kinematics and the dynamics are considered. The discovered regularities open new possibilities of research and practical use in machine industry and in automotive industry. 2.
