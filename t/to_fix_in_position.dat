50|$|Transfer {{of power}} to the track is {{accomplished}} by a drive wheel, or drive sprocket, driven by the motor and engaging with holes in the track links or with pegs on them to drive the track. In military vehicles, the drive wheel is typically mounted well above the contact area on the ground, allowing it <b>to</b> be <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> <b>position.</b> <b>In</b> agricultural crawlers it is normally incorporated {{as part of the}} bogie. Placing suspension on the sprocket is possible, but is mechanically more complicated. A non-powered wheel, an idler, is placed {{at the opposite end of}} the track, primarily to tension the track, since loose track could be easily thrown (slipped) off the wheels. To prevent throwing, the inner surface of the track links usually have vertical guide horns engaging grooves, or gaps between the doubled road and idler/sprocket wheels. In military vehicles with a rear sprocket, the idler wheel is placed higher than the road wheels to allow it to climb over obstacles. Some track arrangements use return rollers to keep the top of the track running straight between the drive sprocket and idler. Others, called slack track, allow the track to droop and run along the tops of large road wheels. This was a feature of the Christie suspension, leading to occasional misidentification of other slack track-equipped vehicles.|$|R

Technical constraints push researchers and operators to provide solutions allowing users to acquire high performances independently of their geographical distance from Base Station (BS). In addition to the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technology, relays are among the principal features of the fourth generation (4 G) wireless systems. Relaying technologies, inspired from ad hoc multihop networks, are currently receiving much attention to improve cellular network’s performance where bandwidth and power are limited. Instead of deploying BS, relay stations become a solution to reduce high deployment cost and can provide capacity and coverage comparable to small cells. Relaying data aims to upgrade user’s performance especially in cell border where users suffer from large signal attenuation. Relaying topology and behavior are standardized in both long term evolution (LTE) Advanced [1] and International Mobile Telecommunication Advanced (IMT-Advanced). In these standards, relays have <b>to</b> be <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> beforehand planned by the operators and {{become a part of}} the fixed access network.

L shows two 3 -(hydroxy) - 1 -(carbonylmethylen) - 2 (1 H) -pyridinone moieties as side-arms of a tetra-aza-macrocyclic base. The keycoupling of side-arms was studied and the most significant results were obtained by activating the 3 -(benzyl-oxy) - 1 -(carboxymethyl) - 2 (1 H) -pyridinone as pentafluorophenol ester. The acid–base properties of L and its capability to interact with simple ammonium cations were investigated by potentio-metric measurements iin aqueous solution (298. 10. 1 K, I ¼ 0. 15 mol dm 3). Protonated species of L can bind NH 4 + or primary ammonium cations such as MeNH 3 + discriminating them from secondary or tertiary ammonium cations such as Me 2 NH 2 + or Me 3 NH+ which are not bound in aqueous solution. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra showed the existence in solution of two conformers on the NMR time scale due to the rotational restriction of the two N–C=O groups.
