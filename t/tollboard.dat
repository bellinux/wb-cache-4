50|$|Many tollhouses {{were built}} by turnpike trusts in England, Wales and Scotland during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Those {{built in the}} early 19th century often had a {{distinctive}} bay front to give the pikeman {{a clear view of}} the road and to provide a display area for the <b>tollboard.</b> In 1840, according to the Turnpike Returns in Parliamentary Papers, there were over 5,000 tollhouses operating in England. These were sold off in the 1880s when the turnpikes were closed. Many were demolished but several hundred have survived as domestic houses, with distinctive features of the old tollhouse still visible.|$|E
