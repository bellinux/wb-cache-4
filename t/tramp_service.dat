25|$|Over 180 {{ships of}} the type had been built before the design was abandoned, 176 of them by William Doxford and Sons. They were used in both line voyage and <b>tramp</b> <b>service</b> until retired, wrecked, or lost in the First or Second World War. The Scotland-based Clan Line, which traded {{globally}} in cargos such as foodstuffs, timber, metals, manufactured goods, case oil, jute, tea, nitrates, and general cargo, used 30 {{of the type}} for those purposes.|$|E
5000|$|The Mitsui Line was {{originally}} the shipping {{department of the}} trading company Mitsui Bussan Kaisha. Mitsui Bussan was established in 1876 and obtained exclusive rights to export and market the coal mined at the state-run Miike mines. It chartered boats and transported coal on its own account. In 1878 it bought a steamship, and in 1888 it bought the mines. Mitsui Bussan became an industrial carrier and the shipping section was established in 1898. The section expanded to become the Shipping Department and moved to Kobe in 1904. The company then owned 9 ships aggregating , and {{on the eve of}} World War I the fleet totalled 15 ships with , increasing to 30 ships totalling [...] in 1919. The third general manager, Teijiro Kawamura, expanded the business of the department during World War I; in 1914 it began a <b>tramp</b> <b>service</b> carrying the company's own cargo and that of other companies. In 1917 it constructed a shipyard and set up the shipbuilding department and in 1920 it opened a semi-liner service from Dalian via Kobe to Seattle, whereby a liner service operated on outbound voyages but on the return voyage, owing to insufficient cargo at Seattle, ships had to stop and collect cargo at other ports.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTramp {{shipping}} {{constitutes a}} prominent {{segment of the}} shipping market. As customers increasingly seek value from service providers for low price but yet high quality services, there is a pressing need to understand critically what construe the service quality for the tramp sector. In this respect, however, no prior {{research has been conducted}} for this market segment. This study recognises the gap in the existing maritime literature and aimed to propose and validate a service quality (SQ) model to address such a gap. The study employs a triangulation approach, utilising literature review, interviews and surveys to develop, refine and verify the SQ model proposed. Interviews were conducted with various parties in the tramp sector while a survey using a sample size of 343 tramp shippers and 254 <b>tramp</b> <b>service</b> providers was also conducted with tramp shippers and <b>tramp</b> <b>service</b> providers. It was revealed that the SQ model of six dimensions of Corporate Image, Customer Focus, Management, Outcomes, Personnel and Technical, and their 18 associated attributes {{could be used as a}} reliable tool to measure service quality in tramp shipping. This research contributes to fill the gap in the existing literature by introducing and validating a new SQ model specifically for tramp shipping. Meanwhile, the model can also be used by practitioners to receive their customers’ evaluation of their service quality as well as a benchmarking tool for continuous improvement. This study is, however, confined to a small-sized data collected in Singapore and to the bulk commodity context. Further studies on the practicality of the SQ model involving larger sample size and in other regions and for the general and specialized cargoes would be required to enhance its reliability...|$|E
50|$|Belgrano {{spent most}} of her career sailing for Hamburg-Südamerikanische Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft (Hamburg-Süd) between Hamburg and South American ports, but was also used for <b>tramping</b> <b>services.</b> She was renamed Santa Barbara in September 1965.|$|R
50|$|Pacific Forum Line (PFL) is a multi-government run {{shipping}} line, {{an example}} of regional co-operation among Pacific Forum nations. It was born from concern over the deterioration of traditional island <b>tramp</b> <b>services</b> due to containerisation. Several studies showed that a South Pacific Regional Shipping Service was viable and Pacific Forum Line set sail in 1978.|$|R
50|$|In {{early years}} of Polsteam's existence, the ship owner's vessels navigated on short and {{midrange}} sea routes (i.e. the Baltic Sea, North Sea and Mediterranean Sea). During {{the course of the}} first five years, they carried coal, wood, and iron ore. 80-90% of shipping involved <b>tramping</b> <b>services</b> and although the ship operator had three lines since 1951 namely: Szczecin - Stockholm, Szczecin - London - Rouen and Szczecin - Hamburg - Rotterdam - Antwerp.|$|R
5000|$|Stockard Steamship Company of New York was {{the major}} agent of Ivaran for many years. Ivaran had an {{involvement}} with Stockard resulted from World War II as they operated a <b>tramping</b> <b>service</b> between the East Coast of USA and South America which was previously managed by fellow Norwegian company A/S Holter Sørensens.In Merchant Ships (The Macmillan Company; 1944), E.C. Talbot-Booth shows the vessels Ivaran and Lise {{in the name of}} Ivaran Lines which fits with the name based New York given by F. J. N. Wedge in Brown’s Flags and Funnels (Brown, Son and Ferguson; 1951). [...] Subsequently Ivarans appear to have re-established in Oslo under their own name.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{types of}} cargo vessels include {{container}} ships and bulk carriers (technically tankers {{of all sizes}} are cargo ships, although they are routinely {{thought of as a}} separate category). Cargo ships fall into two further categories that reflect the services they offer to industry: liner and <b>tramp</b> <b>services.</b> Those on a fixed published schedule and fixed tariff rates are cargo liners. Tramp ships do not have fixed schedules. Users charter them to haul loads. Generally, the smaller shipping companies and private individuals operate tramp ships. Cargo liners run on fixed schedules published by the shipping companies. Each trip a liner takes is called a voyage. Liners mostly carry general cargo. However, some cargo liners may carry passengers also. A cargo liner that carries 12 or more passengers is called a combination or passenger-cum-cargo line.|$|R
2500|$|Ragnhild was a [...] {{cargo ship}} {{which was built}} in 1941 for the British Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) as Empire Carey. In 1942 she was {{transferred}} to the Norwegian Government in exile and renamed Ragnhild. Her war service is very well documented, and serves to illustrate a typical <b>tramp</b> ship's <b>service</b> life during the Second World War.|$|R
30|$|Another useful {{application}} of SOS Allocator {{is that it}} calculates the gross profit of the new ship each year of its lifetime when it is added to old fleet units in the allocation plan. SOS Appraiser, as described in SOS Appraiser section, can then calculate three appraisal values, corresponding to three levels of stochastic cargo transport demand: an upper limit, deterministic-equivalence, and lower limit. The case study in this section calculates the three net present values for an oil tanker to be purchased for <b>tramp</b> shipping <b>service</b> and demonstrates how the deterministic-equivalent value represents the most likely value {{in a range of}} values bounded by lower and upper limits.|$|R
40|$|On 18 October 2006, tramp {{shipping}} pools became {{subject to the}} enforcement powers of the European Commission by the adoption of Council Regulation 1419 / 2006. The changes brought about by Council Regulation 1419 / 2006 generated huge waves in the shipping industry. Council Regulation 1419 / 2006 repealed Council Regulation 4056 / 86 and amended Council Regulation 1 / 2003 by including in its scope international <b>tramp</b> <b>services.</b> As arguably {{the most common type}} of arrangement in the tramp sector, it is interesting to see which challenges {{tramp shipping}} pools now face. The Guidelines on the application of Article 101 TFEU (previously Article 81) to maritime transport services provide some assistance to tramp shipping pool participants needing to determine whether their arrangement is in compliance with competition law rules by conducting a self assessment of their arrangement. This thesis will exclusively focus on self assessments of tramp shipping pools. Whilst the Guidelines on the application of Article 101 TFEU to maritime transport services will be to a certain extent assessed, this will only be done in the prevailing analysis of typical clauses of a tramp shipping agreement. These clauses will be the subject of an assessment under Article 101 TFEU and the step by step analysis required to determine whether they infringe Article 101 TFEU. The second chapter of this thesis will expand on the rationale behind self assessments as evidenced by the enforcement and investigative powers of the European Commission along with possible enforcement actions by individuals. The third chapter of this thesis will analyse the legal framework necessary to conduct a self assessment as conducted in the fourth chapter which will examine typical clauses of a tramp shipping pool agreement. The fifth chapter will go into the structural alternatives to tramp shipping pools and best practice options that need to be considered during the course of a self assessment...|$|R
5000|$|Furness, Withy {{operated}} both <b>tramp</b> and liner <b>services.</b> The latter included transatlantic Royal Mail {{and passenger}} routes, initially from West Hartlepool to Boston and New York, and later from Liverpool to St John's, Newfoundland, Halifax, Nova Scotia and Boston. The Liverpool — Boston route was worked {{by a pair}} of sister ships, RMS Newfoundland and RMS Nova Scotia. The first Newfoundland and [...] were built in 1925 and 1926 but were requisitioned in 1940 and 1941. Both were lost to enemy action: Nova Scotia as a troop ship in 1942; Newfoundland as a hospital ship in 1943.|$|R
