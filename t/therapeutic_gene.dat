25|$|In May a team {{reported}} {{a way to}} prevent the immune system from rejecting a newly delivered gene. Similar to organ transplantation, gene therapy {{has been plagued by}} this problem. The immune system normally recognizes the new gene as foreign and rejects the cells carrying it. The research utilized a newly uncovered network of genes regulated by molecules known as microRNAs.

25|$|Gene therapy {{involves}} supplying {{a functional}} gene to cells lacking that function, {{with the aim}} of correcting a genetic disorder or acquired disease. Gene therapy can be broadly divided into two categories. The first is alteration of germ cells, that is, sperm or eggs, which results in a permanent genetic change for the whole organism and subsequent generations. This “germ line gene therapy” is {{considered by many to be}} unethical in human beings. The second type of gene therapy, “somatic cell gene therapy”, is analogous to an organ transplant. In this case, one or more specific tissues are targeted by direct treatment or by removal of the tissue, addition of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>gene</b> or genes in the laboratory, and return of the treated cells to the patient. Clinical trials of somatic cell gene therapy began in the late 1990s, mostly for the treatment of cancers and blood, liver, and lung disorders.|$|E

50|$|The {{success of}} gene therapy {{depends on the}} {{efficient}} insertion of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>genes</b> at the appropriate chromosomal target sites within the human genome, without causing cell injury, oncogenic mutations or an immune response. The construction of plasmid vectors is simple and straightforward. Custom-designed ZFNs that combine the non-specific cleavage domain (N) of FokI endonuclease with zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) offer a general way to deliver a site-specific DSB to the genome, and stimulate local homologous recombination by several orders of magnitude. This makes targeted gene correction or genome editing a viable option in human cells. Since ZFN-encoding plasmids {{could be used to}} transiently express ZFNs to target a DSB to a specific gene locus in human cells, they offer an excellent way for targeted delivery of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>genes</b> to a pre-selected chromosomal site. The ZFN-encoding plasmid-based approach has the potential to circumvent all the problems associated with the viral delivery of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>genes.</b> The first <b>therapeutic</b> applications of ZFNs are likely to involve ex vivo therapy using a patients own stem cells. After editing the stem cell genome, the cells could be expanded in culture and reinserted into the patient to produce differentiated cells with corrected functions. The initial targets will likely include the causes of monogenic diseases such as the IL2Rγ gene and the b-globin gene for gene correction and CCR5 gene for mutagenesis and disablement.|$|R

In the most advanced stages, the use of chemotherapy induces a poor response and is usually accompanied by other tissue damage.

50|$|<b>Therapeutic</b> <b>gene</b> {{modulation}} {{refers to}} the practice of altering the expression of a gene at one of various stages, with a view to alleviate some form of ailment.

The specific goals were to evaluate compatibility of these polyplexes with extended plasma circulation, molecular targeting, and ultrasound-enhanced transfection activity. It was demonstrated that using polyplexes based on reducible polycations allows increasing transfection activity and preserving extended plasma circulation half-life observed for control polyplexes based on non-reducible polycations. In addition, the reversibly stabilized polyplexes were compatible with both molecular targeting using protein ligands as well as physical targeting using ultrasound-directed cavitation in vitro.

40|$|While the {{systemic}} {{route of administration}} enables <b>therapeutic</b> <b>genes</b> to spread through the bloodstream and access target cells, {{it is a challenge}} to achieve this. Several studies demonstrate that systemic administration of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>genes</b> or other nucleic acid-based constructs such as siRNA to solid tumors as well as cancer metastases are better with nanoparticulate systems compared to administration of free (uncomplexed) nucleic acids. Nanoparticle-based nucleic acid delivery systems might be more pertinent, due to the several privileges in terms of enhanced tissue penetrability, improved cellular uptake and to a lesser extent, targeted gene delivery to the cells of interest provided targeting ligands are used. Systemic delivery of nanoplexes has already been reported with different nanoparticles containing DNA via various routes of administration. The goal of the present article is to review the current state of intravenous delivery of nanoparticles for gene therapy of cancer. ...|$|R

METHODS: Expression of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>genes</b> in transduced thyroid carcinoma cells was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Ganciclovir sensitivity of infected cells was assessed in vitro in thyroid carcinoma cell lines and in vivo in nude mice bearing xenografted thyroid cancers. The combined effect of IL- 2 /HSV-TK was compared with the effect of IL- 2 alone. RESULTS: Expression of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>genes</b> was higher in differentiated than in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells.

By using the retroviral vector expressing IL- 2 /HSV-TK, treatment with ganciclovir led to complete eradication of anaplastic tumors and a > 80 % reduction of the size of differentiated thyroid carcinomas. Histological analysis of tumor specimens showed extensive necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltrates.

Clostridium was genetically modified to express tumor necrosis factor ct or cytosine deaminase. Expression of these proteins was assayed. Northern blot hybridizations were used to detect genes which are radio-induced. Results: Clostridium gave a selective colonization of tumors.

40|$|AbstractAdenoviral vectors {{are highly}} {{efficient}} at transferring genes into cells and are broadly used in cancer gene therapy.
