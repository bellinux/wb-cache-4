60|$|Clement Darpent, who {{had been}} {{separated}} from his work by his injury, and had not resumed it, so far as I could learn, was doing his best as a deputy at the Hotel de Ville to work on those whom he could influence to stand firm to their purpose of not admitting the King's enemies, but, on the other hand, of not opening their gates to the royal arm itself till the summons to the States-General should be actually issued, {{and the right of}} Parliament <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>registration</b> acknowledged. His friends among the younger advocates and the better educated of the bourgeois had rallier round him, and in the general anarchy made it their business to protect the persons whom the mob placed in danger. My mother, in these days of terror, had recurred to her former reliance on him, and admitted him once more. I heard there had been no formal reconciliation with Annora, but they had met as if nothing had happened; and it was an understood thing that he should follow her to the Hague so soon as there should be an interval of peace; but he had a deep affection for his country and his city, and could not hear of quitting them, even for Annora's sake, in this crisis of fate, while he had still some vision of being of use, and at any rate could often save lives. Whenever any part of the mob was composed of real poor, who had experienced his mother's charities, he could deal with them; and when they were the mere savage bandits of the partisans, he and his friends scrupled not to use force. For instance, this I saw myself. The Duke of Orleans had summoned the Prevot des Marchands and two of the echevins to the Luxembourg, to consult about supplies. The mob followed them {{all the way down the}} street, reviling them as men sold to Mazarin, and insisting that they should open the gates to the Prince. When they were admitted the wretches stood outside yelling at them like wolves waiting for their prey. I could not help appealing to Mademoiselle's kindness of heart, and asking if they could not be sheltered in the palace, till the canaille grew tired of waiting. She shrugged her shoulders, and called them miserable Mazarinites, but I think she would have permitted them to remain within if her father had not actually conducted them out, saying, 'I will not have them fallen upon IN HERE,' which was like throwing them to the beasts. We ladies were full of anxiety, and all hurried up to the roof to see their fate.|$|E

50|$|In December 2014 the European Citizen Action Service (ECAS) and the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) {{organised}} {{a conference}} entitled “ECI Legal Framework - Need for Reform?”. During the conference the findings and recommendations {{of a study}} recently undertaken by ECAS and the Law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer on the legal basis of the refused ECIs were presented and discussed. The overall conclusions of the Study are that the legal admissibility requirements are applied in a too narrow fashion by the Commission, that the decision <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>registration</b> has been arbitrary and that the reasons given for a rejection have been incomplete.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, President Richard Nixon {{created the}} Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and shifted control of {{pesticide}} regulation from USDA and FDA {{to the newly}} created EPA. By this time public awareness of potential human health and environmental health effects had increased. In addition, {{some members of congress}} began to express concerns about the adequacy of pesticide regulation. [...] The growing public concern created political pressure for pesticide regulation reform. These changes contributed to an environment that enabled an overhaul of pesticide regulation. FIFRA was amended in 1972 by the Federal Environmental Pesticides Control Act (FEPCA). FEPCA required manufacturers of new pesticides to perform a variety of tests to prove that the pesticide did not have “unreasonable adverse effects” on human health or the environment. The EPA was given the authority <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>registration</b> to any pesticide it concluded was unsafe. In addition, pesticide registration data was required to be made available to the public after a pesticide had been registered. Pesticides that had been registered prior to 1972 could only be banned after a special review board was convened and determined the pesticide was hazardous. If this occurred, the indemnity clause of FEPCA required the EPA to compensate pesticide manufacturers, distributors, and users for the value of any unused stock they possessed. FEPCA also required EPA to review the registration data from pesticides registered prior to 1972, but did not appropriate funds for the task.The reregistration process was beset by difficulties throughout the 1970s. FEPCA required the reregistration process to be complete by 1976; however EPA did not begin reregistration until the fall of 1975. Shortly after beginning the reregistration process, congressional investigations revealed that the EPA was taking shortcuts that undermined the purpose of reregistration. EPA was confirming the presence of registration data rather than determining whether the data was adequate. Shortly after this was revealed, an investigation into Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories (IBT) found that it had been routinely falsifying tests. IBT was the nation’s largest independent laboratory that conducted toxicity tests. The EPA and the Canadian Department of Health and Welfare determined that “only about 10% of the over 2000 IBT studies which had been submitted in support of pesticide registrations were valid.” After these two setbacks, EPA suspended its reregistration program in August 1976. EPA did not restart reregistrations until 1978.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, the {{trademark}} manual for examination requires under 1202.14 that a hologram used in varying forms does not {{function as a}} mark {{in the absence of}} evidence that consumers would perceive it as a trademark. See In re Upper Deck Co., 59 USPQ2d 1688 (TTAB 2001), where the Board held that a hologram used on trading cards in varying shapes, sizes, and positions did not function as a mark, because the record showed that other companies used holograms on trading cards and other products as anti-counterfeiting devices, and {{there was no evidence that}} the public would perceive applicant's hologram as an indicator of source. The Board noted that [...] "the common use of holograms for non-trademark purposes means that consumers would be less likely to perceive applicant's uses of holograms as trademarks." [...] 59 USPQ2d at 1693. Therefore, in the absence of evidence of consumer recognition as a mark, the examining attorney should refuse registration on the ground that the hologram does not function as a mark, under §§1, 2 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052 and 1127. Generally, if a hologram has two or more views, the examining attorney should also refuse registration under §§1 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051 and 1127, on the ground that the application seeks registration of more than one mark. In re Upper Deck, supra. See TMEP §807.01. Provided the applicant can demonstrate that the use of a hologram or moving image both serves as a mark and is not functional, an application for such a mark may be made to either register. That being said, Examining Attorneys are instructed to refuse an application for registration of a hologram if the applicant does not provide evidence of consumer recognition of the hologram as a mark. the applicant seeking registration of a hologram must submit a drawing of the mark that captures the dimensions thereof. Further, Examiners are instructed <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>registration</b> of any holograms that show two different images on the grounds that the application is seeking protection for two separate marks. Further, the application must include detailed written description of the mark. During publication the drawing pages for these marks are published and thereafter the drawing page is incorporated into the registration certificate which is made available at the USPTO as well as the USPTO website, see first external link.|$|E

5000|$|While the {{law does}} not {{prohibit}} proselytizing by registered religious groups, it limits such activity by forbidding spreading religious views to nonbelievers by [...] "force, pressure, material incentives, deception, or means which harm health or morals or are psychologically damaging." [...] There were no instances of prosecutions under this law during the reporting period. A Ministry of Education directive bans mixing foreign language or other training with religious teaching or instruction. Monitoring of the ban, particularly in the capital area, is strict. There were no reported violations of the ban in recent years. Religious groups that violate the law may not receive an extension of their registration. If individuals violate the law, the Government may ask their employers to terminate their employment. No such cases were reported during the reporting period. Registration and reregistration are burdensome for all religious groups. The length and documentation requirements of the process discourage some organizations from applying. Some Christian groups stated that local officials believed there were [...] "too many" [...] churches, or that there should at least be parity in the registration of new Buddhist temples and new Christian churches. No churches were known <b>to</b> have been <b>refused</b> <b>registration</b> in Ulaanbaatar during the reporting period; the applications of four religious organizations remained under consideration.|$|R
