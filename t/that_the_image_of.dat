5|$|With {{an economy}} {{fundamentally}} dependent upon a single industry, {{there was a}} scarcity of paid employment for women in Rhondda's coalmining heyday. The Encyclopaedia of Wales notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the Welsh Mam, {{a wife and mother}} constantly at home and exalted as the queen of the household, was essentially a Rhondda creation. However the Rhondda did produce the suffragette and social reformer Elizabeth Andrews, one of only nine women among a list of a hundred greatest Welsh heroes chosen by ballot in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Father Octavian orders them to set {{out through}} a cave system to reach the Byzantium, using a gravity globe to {{illuminate}} the cave. The Doctor and River comment on the various statues they pass, believing they are made by the planet's natives, until they recall the natives are two-headed beings and the statues are only single-headed. They conclude they must be weakened Weeping Angels, and that the Angel on the Byzantium purposely crashed the ship here to rescue its kind. The Angels start to pursue the group. Amy finds that she cannot move, and the Doctor realises <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the Angel still exists in her eye and is making her believe this; he bites her wrist to prove she is still mobile, {{and they continue to}} flee.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the nine}} figures depicted, five are looking {{directly}} {{out at the}} royal couple or the viewer. Their glances, along with {{the king and queen}}'s reflection, affirm the royal couple's presence outside the painted space. Alternatively, art historians H. W. Janson and Joel Snyder suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the king and queen is a reflection from Velázquez's canvas, the front of which is obscured from the viewer. Other writers say the canvas Velázquez is painting is unusually large for a portrait by Velázquez, and is about the same size as Las Meninas. Las Meninas contains the only known double portrait of the royal couple painted by Velázquez.|$|E

5|$|The {{most natural}} and {{convenient}} {{way to express}} the relation involves the algebraic concept of exact sequences: sequences of objects (in this case groups) and morphisms (in this case group homomorphisms) between them such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> one morphism equals the kernel of the next. In general, this does not allow (co)homology groups of a space to be completely computed. However, because many important spaces encountered in topology are topological manifolds, simplicial complexes, or CW complexes, which are constructed by piecing together very simple patches, a theorem {{such as that of}} Mayer and Vietoris is potentially of broad and deep applicability.|$|E
5|$|The {{tolerance}} of violence within mainstream American {{culture is the}} central theme of the record, which takes a critical look at the roles gun culture, conservative American Christianity, and traditional family values play in the glorification of violence. A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> his crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against {{the credibility of the}} Bible's content, for the purpose of Holy Wood, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Vithoba's image {{replaces the}} {{traditional}} representation of Buddha, when depicted as the ninth avatar of Vishnu, in some temple sculptures and Hindu astrological almanacs in Maharashtra. In the 17th century, Maratha artists sculpted {{an image of}} Pandharpur's Vithoba in the Buddha's place on a panel showing Vishnu's avatars. This {{can be found in}} the Shivneri Caves. Stevenson goes so far as to call devotees of Vithoba (Vithal-bhaktas) Buddhist Vaishnavas (Bauddho-Vaishnavas), since they consider Vithoba to be the ninth—namely Buddha—avatar of Vishnu. Some of the poet-saints praised Vithoba as a form of Buddha. B. R. Ambedkar, an Indian political leader and Buddhist convert, suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Vithoba at Pandharpur was in reality the image of the Buddha.|$|E

5|$|In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in {{prominence}} {{because he}} was married and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his wife did not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor {{in order to secure}} the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title. In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry the Jew Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351. The conflict climaxed in 1355–1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans. According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir should have come next in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. A hint of the feud between father and son is the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Ivan Sratsimir {{was not included in the}} Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. That could mean either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.|$|E
25|$|In set theory, the axiom schema of {{replacement}} is a schema of axioms in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) that asserts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> any set under any definable mapping {{is also a}} set.

25|$|An old result due to Schur and Horn {{states that}} the set of {{possible}} diagonal vectors of an Hermitian matrix with given eigenvalues is the convex hull of all the permutations of the eigenvalues. Atiyah proved a generalization of this that applies to all compact symplectic manifolds acted on by a torus, showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the manifold under the moment map is a convex polyhedron, and with Pressley gave a related generalization to infinite-dimensional loop groups.|$|E
25|$|Yet it is {{striking}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> women projected by women's literature of the 1930s is clearly contrary to traditional views of sweet housewife spread by Rosenberg and Goebbels. The heroines of women's novels during this period are often a strong and tenacious type of woman, while the sons and husbands are quickly delivered to death. Everything happens as if one perceives through these fictions a true antagonism between the sexes generated by the constant mobilisation of these two groups independent of one another.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiment}} uses a setup {{similar to}} that for the double-slit experiment. In Afshar's variant, light generated by a laser passes through two closely spaced circular pinholes (not slits). After the dual pinholes, a lens refocuses the light so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> each pinhole falls on separate photon-detectors (Fig. 1). A photon that goes through pinhole number one impinges only on detector number one, and similarly, if it goes through pinhole two it impinges only on detector number two, {{which is why we}} see the pinholes separately in the image plane close to the mirrors before the photon-detectors.|$|E

25|$|Among {{artists and}} {{scientists}} during the Renaissance, {{it was the}} prevailing belief {{that the study of}} the male form was in itself a study of God. Michelangelo's David is based upon this artistic discipline, which is known as disegno. Under this discipline, sculpture is considered to be the finest form of art because it mimics divine creation. Because Michelangelo adhered to the concepts of disegno, he worked under the premise <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> David was already in the block of stone he was working on—in {{much the same way as}} the human soul is thought by some to be found within the physical body.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the center}} of each beamline, and taking up the {{majority}} of the total length, are spatial filters. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down to a tiny point in {{the center of}} the tube, where a mask cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the Cyclops laser, an earlier LLNL experiment.|$|E
25|$|Another {{representation}} is obtained by noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> any closure operator on a complete lattice is again a complete lattice (called its closure system). Since the identity function is a closure operator too, {{this shows that}} the complete lattices are exactly the images of closure operators on complete lattices. Now the Dedekind-MacNeille completion can also be cast into a closure operator: every set of elements is mapped to the least lower (or upper) Dedekind cut that contains this set. Such a least cut does indeed exist and one has a closure operator on the powerset lattice of all elements. In summary, one can say that every complete lattice is isomorphic {{to the image of}} a closure operator on a powerset lattice.|$|E
