5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fan</b> {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> blades. The lower speed allows <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|The use of props in Noh is minimalistic and stylized. The most {{commonly}} used prop in Noh is <b>the</b> <b>fan,</b> as it is carried by all performers regardless of role. Chorus singers and musicians may carry their fan in hand when entering the stage, or carry it tucked into the obi (the sash). <b>The</b> <b>fan</b> is usually placed at the performer's side {{when he or she}} takes position, and is often not taken up again until leaving the stage. During dance sequences, <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> is typically used to represent any and all hand-held props, such as a sword, wine jug, flute, or writing brush. <b>The</b> <b>fan</b> may represent various objects {{over the course of a}} single play.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} it was not {{mandatory}} to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.|$|E
5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} <b>the</b> <b>fan,</b> {{as well as a}} letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. <b>The</b> <b>fan</b> would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{when another}} fan tried {{to climb the}} stage, Blythe {{thought that it was}} Pořádek again. Blythe testified that he {{approached}} <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him, which it did not. Jiří Choroš, author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek, testified that <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up. Blythe insisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about Nosek's death.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the main}} event match, Piper {{revealed}} that <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> humiliated by Lawler in the King's Court segment would be in Piper's corner during the match. Piper started the match by throwing his kilt in Lawler's face and attacking him. The match consisted mainly of brawling, and Lawler was frequently distracted by <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> who was standing in Piper's corner. Lawler gained the advantage by performing a sleeper hold and a piledriver on Piper. He attacked Piper with a foreign object, which knocked Piper to the mat. Then, while trying to pin Piper, Jerry Lawler placed {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage. <b>The</b> <b>fan</b> at ringside pushed Lawler's feet off, however, which allowed Piper to perform a back suplex and get the victory.|$|E

5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). <b>The</b> <b>fan</b> and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.|$|E

5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop.

5000|$|In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> {{began to}} boycott matches after a match against Widzew Łódź. <b>The</b> <b>fans</b> claim that <b>the</b> police {{assaulted}} <b>fans,</b> when preventing Zawisza and ŁKS Łódź <b>fans</b> from entering <b>the</b> stadium. Following <b>the</b> incident, <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> {{asked to see}} the security footage, however, the footage was claimed to be lost due to an alleged [...] "technical fault". The club chairman, Radosław Osuch, and {{a large portion of}} the media and public opinion, attributed the incident to football hooliganism. The players supported the chairman, sparking fury from <b>the</b> <b>fans.</b> Osuch threatened to relocate the club, and has openly declared war against <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> He changed <b>the</b> club crest to the similar crest used by the relocated Zawisza in 2006, further angering <b>the</b> <b>fans.</b> Since 2014, <b>the</b> boycott has been upheld, meaning that there has been low attendances and support during matches, including the historic Polish Cup win. In January 2015, a group of <b>fans</b> broke into <b>the</b> stadium and placed 15 coffins on the pitch, depicting 14 players and the chairman, and a banner with the words [...] "Osuch's whore spares, you are morally dead", as a protest against the chairman and the players. The club issued a criminal investigation into the incident. In May 2015, after Górnik Łęczna keeper Sergiusz Prusak displayed a T-shirt showing his support to <b>the</b> Zawisza <b>fans,</b> <b>the</b> Zawisza <b>fans</b> decided to break their boycott for one match only to come and thank him in a match against Górnik. In order to prevent <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> from coming to Zawisza, Osuch subsequently raised the match ticket price to a very high 200zł in order to stop <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> attending. After 5 years, Osuch decided to leave the club, however upon this announcement the players and staff also all resigned. Without investment, the club was disbanded by Osuch as last act, stating that there is a poor atmosphere surrounding Polish football. <b>The</b> <b>fans</b> reformed <b>the</b> club and had to start the new season from the lowest level on the football pyramid.|$|R
