30|$|Apart from codec and packet loss, other degradations need to {{be taken}} into account by a future WB E-model as well. For example, speech level [48] has proven to be {{different}} for NB and WB transmission in some preliminary studies. Besides degradations affecting the listening-only situation, the conversational impact of <b>talker</b> <b>echo</b> and delay needs to be modeled. In this way, a complete WB version of the E-model can be set up, and first steps are already documented by Raake et al. [49]. The method described in this paper will be very helpful in order to guarantee that the final model is fully based on input parameters which can be derived from instrumental models, without a further need for auditory tests to specify the parameters.|$|E
40|$|Introduction NTT {{has been}} {{studying}} an objective model for evaluating telephone transmission performance [39], [40], [41], [42]. This describes OPINE (Overall Performance Index model for Network Evaluation), focussing on practical use. OPINE deals with transmission loss, circuit noise, room noise, attenuation/frequency distortion (fundamental factors), quantizing distortion, <b>talker</b> <b>echo</b> and sidetone. It models the auditory-psychological process of evaluation by human beings of telephone transmission performance based on these factors. It is therefore {{the second type of}} model according to the classification of 2 (British Telecom). The model's basic principle is the fact that evaluation of psychological factors (not physical factors) on the psychological scale is additive. The model is extended from the first revision to take additional physical factors into account. OPINE was first constructed for fundamental factors in 1983 [39]. The opinion test data used for coefficient trai...|$|E
40|$|Introduction This Recommendation {{contains}} {{advice to}} Administrations on conducting subjective tests {{in their own}} laboratories. The tests {{carried out in the}} CCITT Laboratory by using reference systems are described in Section 3 of this Volume. In the course of developing items of telephone equipment, it is necessary to conduct various kinds of specialized tests to diagnose faults and shortcomings; such tests dedicated to the study of specific aspect of transmission quality are not discussed here. The present purpose is to indicate methods that have been found suitable for determining how satisfactory given telephone connections may be expected to be if offered as such for use by the public. The methods indicated here are intended to be generally applicable whatever the form of any degrading factors present. Examples of degrading factors include transmission loss (often frequency dependent), circuit and room noise, sidetone, <b>talker</b> <b>echo,</b> nonlinear distortion of various kinds, pro...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the electro-acoustic factors {{affecting}} {{the quality of}} telephone speech are categorized as:- listening factors such as loudness, noise, frequency response, and listener echo,- talking factors such as <b>talker</b> <b>echo</b> and sidetone, and- conversational factors such as delay. Listening factors in particular are emphasized and qualitatively interpreted in terms of acoustic pressures at the ear relative to the thresholds of hearing and pain. Typical telephone connections are then considered in which {{a number of the}} above factors are manifested; this is done {{in the context of a}} network simulation facility used by Bell-Northern Research to simulate various telephone network impairments for the purposes of objective and subjective evaluation. Grade^of-service results that relate customer opinion of transmission quality to the level of a trans mission parameter are also discussed. These include listener echo and delay, and subjective-equivalence modelling of speech-correlated digital noise in terms of continuous analog noise...|$|E
40|$|In a 4 -wire {{telephone}} set, echo {{may arise}} both by electrical crosstalk in the cord and by acoustical coupling between earpiece and mouthpiece in the handset. The echo loss for these paths {{has been determined}} for two analogue 2 -wire telephone sets. This data is used to derive the echo loss of a hypothetical 4 -wire set having SLR + RLR = 3 dB, and acoustical and electrical properties {{the same as the}} 2 -wire telephone sets. I. 1 Introduction It has been pointed out in several contributions that the choice of LRs for digital telephone sets has to be made considering aspects of loudness and echo in a complete 4 -wire connection. To enable a study of the risk of objectionable echo, Study Group XVI has asked Study Group XII to present information on the subjective effect of <b>talker</b> <b>echo</b> as a function of delay, overall LR and echo path loss. In a digital 4 -wire connection, including 4 -wire subscriber lines and digital telephone sets, the main echo paths are found in the telephone set itself: [...] - t [...] ...|$|E
30|$|This work {{concentrates}} on the other main category, namely signal-based methods. They predict quality based on evaluation of a test speech signal at {{the output of the}} channel. They can be divided into two further sub-categories, intrusive or non-intrusive. Intrusive signal-based methods use an original reference and a degraded signal, which is the output of the system under test. They identify the audible distortions based on the perceptual domain representation of two signals incorporating human auditory models. Several intrusive models have been developed during recent years. The ITU-T Recommendation P. 861 (PSQM), published in 1996, was a first attempt to objectively model human listeners and predict speech quality from subjective listener tests. It was succeeded in 2001 by P. 862, commonly known as PESQ, a full-reference metric for predicting speech quality. PESQ has been widely used and was enhanced and extended over the next decade. It was originally designed and tested on narrowband signals. It improved on PSQM and the model handles a range of transmission channel problems and variations including varied speech levels, codecs, delays, packet loss, and environmental noise. However, it has a number of acknowledged shortcomings including listening levels, loudness loss, effects of delay in conversational tests, <b>talker</b> <b>echo,</b> and side tones [1]. An extension to PESQ was developed that adapted the input filters and MOS mapping to allow wideband signal quality prediction [3].|$|E
