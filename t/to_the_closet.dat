Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E

On the other hand, Robbie Daw of Idolator deemed it tiresome, calling it a [...] "visual snoozefest". He wrote, [...] " [...] goes to a salon, orders up Rihanna's Rated R haircut and sasses men who are wrongin' the ladies. Hey, girls—her love has a limit!

2500|$|Following Suesan's death, Theresa Knorr began {{directing}} {{the majority of}} her anger and abuse towards her daughter Sheila. In May 1985, Knorr forced Sheila into prostitution to support the family. Knorr did not work and received money {{from the state of}} California. Knorr was initially pleased with this arrangement due to the large amounts of money Sheila was earning and allowed Sheila to leave the house whenever she pleased. After a few weeks, Knorr became angry and accused Sheila of being pregnant and contracting a sexually transmitted disease which Knorr claimed she caught from Sheila via a toilet seat. Sheila initially denied the accusations. So Knorr beat her, hog tied her and locked her in a hot closet with no ventilation. Knorr forbade her other children to give Sheila food or water or to open the door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet.</b> Terry Knorr disobeyed her mother and gave Sheila a beer. Terry Knorr later said, [...] "She [...] wanted Sheila to confess. That was mother's way. Beat them until they confess." [...] To end the punishment, Sheila confessed to being pregnant and having an STD but Knorr would not let her out of the closet claiming that Sheila was lying. Sheila died three days later, on June 21, 1985, of dehydration and starvation. Knorr left Sheila's body in the closet for an additional three days before discovering that Sheila was dead. Once again, Knorr ordered her sons William and Robert to dispose of Sheila's body which had begun to decompose causing an odorous smell that filled the apartment. The boys placed Sheila's body in a cardboard box which they disposed of near the airport in Truckee, California.

One day, Madame de Merret's husband {{returned}} early from a business trip when her lover was at the house.

In response, Monsieur de Merret sent for a mason <b>to</b> wall up <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> trapping <b>the</b> lover inside.

40|$|Afew {{years ago}} the movie “Overboard” was released. This is a movie about a rich woman (JoAnna) who was {{accustomed}} to having everything her own way.

In response, Dean indicates that <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> is made of oak. His response pushes JoAnna over the edge. She says that she wanted <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>to</b> be made of cedar. The carpenter responds that if she wanted <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>to</b> be made out of cedar, she should have asked for cedar. He tells her {{that he would be}} glad <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> out of cedar, but that his estimate would be more than double because he would have <b>to</b> re-do <b>the</b> whole project. <b>To</b> which she responded, “the whole civilized world knows that closets are made of cedar!” She further indicates that she is not going to pay for “his ” mistake! <b>The</b> confrontation escalates <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point that she pushes Dean overboard.
