5|$|It is {{difficult}} to assess how Cranmer's theological views had evolved since his Cambridge days. There is evidence that he continued to support humanism; he renewed Erasmus' pension {{that had previously been}} granted by Archbishop Warham. In June 1533, he was confronted with <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> not only disciplining a reformer, but also seeing him burnt at the stake. John Frith was condemned to death for his views on the eucharist: he denied the real presence. Cranmer personally tried to persuade him to change his views without success. Although he rejected Frith's radicalism, by 1534 he clearly signalled that he had broken with Rome and that he had set a new theological course. He supported the cause of reform by gradually replacing the old guard in his ecclesiastical province with men who followed the new thinking such as Hugh Latimer. He intervened in religious disputes, supporting reformers to the disappointment of religious conservatives who desired to maintain the link with Rome.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E
5|$|Treloar {{became the}} acting {{director}} of the Australian War Museum in 1920 after Gullett resigned from the position and became head of the Australian Immigration Bureau. Gullet later wrote the official history of Australia's involvement in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Treloar was 26 years of age at the time he became director of the Museum and was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> establishing the institution. Between 1920 and 1922 he personally undertook much of the work associated with developing the Museum's first major exhibition, which opened in Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building on Anzac Day 1922. During this period the staff of the Australian War Museum were also responsible for providing administrative support for a program to distribute captured German equipment as war trophies to the Australian states. Treloar {{was a member of the}} committee overseeing this effort, and the associated administrative load came close to overwhelming him.|$|E

5|$|Also on Nanking's {{eastern side}} but further south, other {{units of the}} SEA faced <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> fording the large moat {{standing}} between them {{and three of the}} city gates, Zhongshan Gate, Guanghua Gate, and Tongji Gate, though the speed of Japan's earlier advance played in their favor as key Chinese units slated to be deployed here were not yet in position. That evening, Japanese engineers and artillerymen closing in on Guanghua Gate managed to blow a hole in the wall. A Japanese battalion launched a daring attack through the gap and planted a Japanese flag on a portion of the gate, but was immediately pinned down by a series of determined Chinese counterattacks. The Chinese brought up reinforcements, including tanks, and they poured down grenades and even flaming, gasoline-soaked lumber onto the Japanese battalion, which was only saved from annihilation by timely bursts of concentrated artillery fire from the rest of their division. The battalion succeeded in holding its position {{for the rest of the}} battle despite losing eighty of its eighty-eight men.|$|E

50|$|In 1930 the Grand Coalition {{fell apart}} and Heinrich Brüning, from the moderate-conservative {{wing of the}} party, was {{appointed}} as Chancellor. Brüning was confronted with economic crises exacerbated by the Great Depression and had to tackle <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>of</b> consolidating both budget and currency when faced with rising unemployment, and of also negotiating changes to the war reparations payments. His course of strict budget discipline, with severe cuts in public expenditure, and tax increases made him extremely unpopular among the lower and middle classes as well as among the Prussian Junkers.|$|R
25|$|Notation {{is not a}} {{new concept}} in Indian music. However, Carnatic music {{continued}} to be transmitted orally for centuries without being written down. The disadvantage with this system was that if one wanted to learn about a kriti composed, for example, by Purandara Dasa, it involved <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> finding a person from Purandara Dasa's lineage of students.|$|E
25|$|The Tarnetar Fair is {{held during}} the first week of Bhadrapad, (September–October {{according}} to Gregorian calendar), and mostly serves as a place to find a suitable bride for tribal people from Gujarat.

He led the Manila Council, assisted by Claud Russell and Samuel Johnson. During his administration in the Philippines, his term was scandalized by bitter quarrels with various military officers, including Major Fell, Capt. Backhouse, and Capt. Brereto. Drake [...] "had <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>of</b> collecting <b>the</b> ransom, promoting trade, and defending the perimeter.

25|$|In the {{toolmakers}} paradigm, {{words do}} not contain ideas, so POEM1 cannot contain POEM2; therefore, a distinction between them must be preserved. Although {{there is only one}} POEM1 in most cases, the differences in mental content among people (and <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> assembling it based on instructions in the text) mean that there are as many POEM2s as there are people. These internal POEM2s will only come to resemble one another after people expend effort comparing their mental content.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} the Landsgemeinde in the new constitution, the cantonal {{elections}} on 3 December 1848 brought a conservative majority parliament. However, the cantonal councils then selected a liberal-conservative and liberal government. The government had <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> reunifying the canton and supporting the new federal government, which 75% of Schwyzer opposed. Over the next few years the new government focused, almost exclusively, on integrating the canton into the new Confederation. Federal forgiveness of the Sonderbund War debt in 1852 and hosting the Federal Officers Festival in 1856 and the Federal Shooting Festival of 1867 all helped to reintegrate the canton.|$|E
25|$|The Cistercians {{acquired}} a reputation in <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> administering the building sites for abbeys and cathedrals. St Bernard's own brother, Achard, {{is known to}} have supervised the construction of many abbeys, such as Himmerod Abbey in the Rhineland. Others were Raoul at Saint-Jouin-de-Marnes, who later became abbot there; Geoffrey d'Aignay, sent to Fountains Abbey in 1133; and Robert, sent to Mellifont Abbey in 1142. On one occasion the Abbot of La Trinité at Vendôme loaned a monk named John to the Bishop of Le Mans, Hildebert de Lavardin, for the building of a cathedral; after the project was completed, John refused to return to his monastery.|$|E

25|$|Regarding the {{perennial}} issues of Vietnam, {{a country in}} civil war, Helms led as an important institutional player in the political mix of Washington. Yet CIA people were themselves divided on the conflict. As the DCI, Helms' daily duties involved <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> updating CIA intelligence and reporting on CIA operations to the American executive leadership. Vietnam then dominated the news. Notoriously, the American political consensus eventually broke. The public became sharply divided, with the issues being vociferously contested. About the so-called Vietnamese 'quagmire' it seemed confusion reigned within and without. Helms saw himself as struggling to best serve his view of America and his forceful superior, the President.|$|E
25|$|His fielding {{was almost}} a minus quality. Hassett would be saddled with <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> hiding him away from busy corners all day long.

There were only five good fieldsmen in the group of twelve chosen. These were Harvey, Miller, Morris, Loxton and Archer, and Archer was the supernumerary.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Irish Fusiliers {{pushed through}} the {{northern}} end of the town, fighting was stubborn and hard; two German Panzer MKIII's created the most problems; there were no British tanks up in support and these were knocked out eventually by PIAT weapons. The Irish brigade then had <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>task</b> <b>of</b> house to house fighting which proved difficult against the tough paratroopers, by the evening it was thought the town was cleared but the Germans counterattacked and although it was largely repelled some units sneaked back in to snipe as the Irish cleared the streets and houses. Throughout the night more men from 38th Brigade moved into the town to reinforce those already there. Finally the Germans launched another counterattack but this time it was weak and easily repelled after which resistance began to fade.|$|E
