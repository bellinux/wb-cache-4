Children first plan what materials <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work with, what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, and whom <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it with (this can be done formally or informally in small groups). Once {{they have made a}} plan, however vague, of what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>they</b> can go and do it. Then, after this chosen worktime, the children discuss what they did and whether it was the same as, or different from, what they had planned.|$|R

As independence approached, the Belgian government organised Congolese elections in May 1960. These resulted in a broad MNC majority.|$|E

Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.|$|E
