The results obtained support the main hypotheses derived from industrial organization theories as to the poor working of quality competition under incomplete and asymmetric information on the side of consumers.

Transaction costs economics, search theory and principal agent theory provide arguments on product quality {{differences between the two}} main distribution channels in insurance markets (exclusive agents vs. independent intermediaries). The present paper uses a sample of 927 <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in Germany. By performing OLS estimations we test the impact of the different distribution channels, but also of other factors relating to the information processing activities on intermediaries’ service quality. Depending on the proxies used for service quality, we find mixed evidence for the “product quality” hypothesis according to which independent intermediaries provide better service quality than exclusive agents. We find that service quality depends also to a large extent on the information gathering and processing activities of the individual intermediaries. ...|$|R

5000|$|Case E-04/09 Inconsult {{dealt with}} the {{criteria}} an website had to comply with {{in order to be}} considered a “durable medium”, according to Article 2(12) of Directive 2002/92/EC on insurance mediation. The Court noted that for the purposes of consumer protection, the Directive sets out certain minimum obligations relating to the information which <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> must provide to their customers {{and the manner in which}} this is done. By requiring this information to be submitted either on paper or any other durable medium, the Directive facilitates the subsequent verification of the information which an intermediary has provided to his customer. The Court held that a website can constitute a durable medium under Article 2(12) of the Directive, provided that several criteria are met. First, the website must enable the customer to store the information in question. Secondly, the website must enable the customer to store the information in a way which makes it accessible for a period of time adequate to the purposes of the information, that is, for as long as it is relevant for the customer in order to protect his interests stemming from his relations with the <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary.</b> This might cover the time during which contractual negotiations were conducted even if not resulting in the conclusion of an insurance contract, the period during which an insurance contract is in force and, to the extent necessary e.g. for seeking redress, the period after such a contract has lapsed. Thirdly, the website must allow for the unchanged reproduction of information stored. In this respect, the Court held that the information must be stored in a way that makes it impossible for the <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary</b> to change it unilaterally. It is for the <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary</b> to ensure that the methods of electronic communication he employs permit this kind of reproduction. Finally, the Court held that for an website to qualify as a durable medium it is irrelevant whether the customer has expressly consented to the provision of information through the internet.|$|R

40|$|How should <b>intermediaries</b> {{influence}} the <b>insurance</b> demand decision? The answer must {{refer to the}} interdependence of economic determinants and legal duties. Intermediaries potentially guide demand decisions by delivering objective information and by considering individuals' situation and economic circumstances. The economic theory provides determinants that are essential for the insurance demand decision. Undoubtedly, consumers lack information about certain variables, and therefore misjudge their demand for insurances. In response to the consumer, an intermediaries' task is to discover possible misjudgments and to provide the correct information. Since {{the information in the}} insurance market is asymmetrically distributed, an insurance agent has an incentive to behave opportunistically, a tendency that is reinforced by the remuneration scheme in Germany. In 2007 / 2008, <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> became regulated by law. That law states, among other things, the four basic obligations of <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and a liability rule to sanction violations.
