40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{design of}} an inlet {{stage for a}} two-stage, 10 / 1 pressure ratio, 2 lb/sec flow rate compressor is discussed. Initially a performance comparison was conducted for an axial, mixed flow and centrifugal second stage. A modified mixed flow configuration with <b>tandem</b> <b>rotors</b> and <b>tandem</b> <b>stators</b> was selected for the inlet stage. The term conical flow compressor was coined to describe {{a particular type of}} mixed flow compressor configuration which utilizes axial flow type blading and an increase in radius to increase the work input potential. Design details of the conical flow compressor are described...|$|R

40|$|LPSC, ISRO as part {{of their}} CE 20 {{cryogenic}} engine development program, desired to get the liquid oxygen [LOX] turbo pump turbine profiles tested in the NAL Transonic Cascade Tunnel to obtain basic aerodynamic performance data. The LOX turbine consists of a nozzle, first <b>rotor,</b> <b>stator</b> and second <b>rotor.</b> Similar profiles have been designed for the first <b>rotor,</b> <b>stator</b> and second <b>rotor</b> with minor changes in stagger angle and pitch. Hence, the same cascade blades were used to test the first <b>rotor,</b> <b>stator</b> and second <b>rotor</b> configurations at respective pitch, stagger and flow conditions. The tests on the first <b>rotor</b> and <b>stator</b> configuration have been completed earlier. The test details and results of the LOX second rotor configuration are presented in this report. The LOX second rotor configuration was tested at three different inlet flow angles and six outlets Mach numbers. Performance parameters such as profile loss, exit flow angle, flow velocities and surface Mach number distribution were evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{discusses}} Bifurcation Diagrams of <b>rotor</b> <b>stator</b> contact {{problems and}} the transition from synchronous whirl towards different asynchronous movement patterns. Bifurcation Diagrams based on Poincaré Maps are presented for the model consisting of a Jeffcott rotor and a flexible mounted rigid stator ring. The analysis methods are applied systematically with respect to various motion patterns that have been observed for <b>rotor</b> <b>stator</b> contact in the past. The type of motion is identified using the analysis methods. Also the influence of different parameters on the changes of motion patterns and the transitions that result are described. The unique identification of all motion patterns for <b>rotor</b> <b>stator</b> interaction based on Bifurcation Diagrams is focus of the paper. Further insight on the conditions {{that lead to the}} change of motion patterns is given. ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tandem</b> <b>rotor</b> {{aerodynamics}} is {{a complex}} subject. <b>Tandem</b> <b>rotor</b> helicopters {{have the advantage of}} being able to hold more weight with shorter blades, since there are two sets. However, the rear rotor works in the aerodynamic shadow of the front rotor, which reduces its efficiency. This loss can be minimized by increasing the distance between the two rotor hubs, and by elevating one hub over the other. [...] <b>Tandem</b> <b>rotor</b> helicopters tend to have a lower disk loading than single rotor helicopters.|$|R

40|$|Current {{literature}} on the three dimensional flow through compressor cascades deals with a row of rotor blades in isolation. Since {{the distance between the}} <b>rotor</b> and <b>stator</b> is usually 10 to 20 percent of the blade chord, the aerodynamic interference between them has to be considered for a proper evaluation of the aerothermodynamic performance of the stage. A unified approach to the aerodynamics of the incompressible flow through a stage is presented that uses the lifting surface theory for a compressor cascade of arbitrary camber and thickness distribution. The effects of <b>rotor</b> <b>stator</b> interference are represented as a linear function of the <b>rotor</b> and <b>stator</b> flows separately. The loading distribution on the <b>rotor</b> and <b>stator</b> flows separately. The loading distribution on the <b>rotor</b> and <b>stator</b> blades and the interference factor are determined concurrently through a matrix iteration process...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the known fact that all air gap main flux density {{variations}} are enclosed by permeance slot harmonics, only one component of stray losses in <b>rotor</b> (<b>stator)</b> iron is considered in the new classification, instead of 2 components: <b>rotor</b> (<b>stator)</b> pulsation iron losses, and <b>rotor</b> (<b>stator)</b> surface iron losses. No-load rotor cage (high-frequency) stray losses are usually calculated. No-load stray losses are caused by the existence of space harmonics: the air-gap slot permeance harmonics and the harmonics produced by no-load MMF harmonics. The second result is the proof that the corresponding components of stray losses can be calculated separately for the mentioned kind of harmonics. Determination of the depth of flux penetration and calculations of high frequency iron losses are improved. On {{the basis of}} experimental validation, it is proved that the new classification of no-load stray losses and the proposed method for the calculation of the total value is sufficiently accurate...|$|R

50|$|<b>Tandem</b> <b>rotors</b> are two {{horizontal}} {{main rotor}} assemblies mounted one behind the other. <b>Tandem</b> <b>rotors</b> achieve pitch attitude changes to accelerate and decelerate the helicopter {{through a process}} called cyclic pitch. To pitch forward and accelerate, both rotors increase the pitch at the rear and reduce the pitch at the front (cyclic)keeping torque the same on both rotors, flying sideways is achieved by increasing the pitch {{on one side and}} reducing pitch on the other. Yaw control develops through opposing cyclic pitch in each rotor. To pivot right, the front rotor tilts right and the rear rotor tilts left. To pivot left, the front rotor tilts left and the rear rotor tilts right. All rotor power contributes to lift, and it is simpler to handle changes in the center of gravity fore-aft. However, it requires the expense of two large rotors rather than the more common one large main rotor and a much smaller tail rotor. The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is the most common <b>tandem</b> <b>rotor</b> helicopter.|$|R

The {{results showed that the}} non-uniform pressure distribution of annulus flow is the main factor cause hot gas ingestion. The cavity can be well sealed when the pressure in it is higher than that of annulus flow, otherwise the ingestion happens. The tangential velocity of main flow will enhance the ingestion process. The mixing process between sealing flow and ingestion flow happens near the seal clearance and then goes into the lower location of the cavity by the entrainment effect induced by rotor disc. All these factors should be considered and well organized when new and highly efficient rim seal structure is designed...|$|R
50|$|Single rotor {{helicopters}} need {{a mechanism}} to neutralize the yawing movement produced by the single large rotor. This is commonly accomplished by a tail rotor, coaxial rotors, and the NOTAR systems. <b>Tandem</b> <b>rotor</b> helicopters, however, use counter-rotating rotors, with each cancelling out the other's torque. Therefore all of the power from the engines {{can be used for}} lift (force), whereas a single rotor helicopter uses some of the engine power to counter the torque. An alternative is to mount two rotors in a coaxial configuration. The first successful <b>tandem</b> <b>rotor</b> helicopter was built by Nicolas Florine in 1927.|$|R
