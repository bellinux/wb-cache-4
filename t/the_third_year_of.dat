The United States was by then in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E

AUTHOR: Michaela Hůlová DEPARTMENT: Program for future teachers for secondary schools (I. ST), Master's, combined, Faculty of Education SUPERVISOR: Mgr.

To what extent is the child's physical versatility and overall physical fitness in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> grade of primary school pupils also a lifestyle associated with the place of residence of the village amenities, technical equipment of primary schools and, ultimately, value orientation of {{children and their parents}} the time to a common physical activities? On these questions it tries to answer this thesis. Means to compare the physical fitness of students in this study used a test battery Badge Eventing Olympic champions. Labour is trying to describe possible aspects influencing any difference in physical fitness of students third grade through questionnaires and interviews with physical education teachers and parents.

5|$|The Chronicles {{version of}} events makes it appear that Baldred was driven out shortly after the battle, but this was {{probably}} not the case. A document from Kent survives which gives the date, March 826, as being in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> the reign of Beornwulf. This makes it likely that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent at this date, as Baldred's overlord; hence Baldred was apparently still in power. In Essex, Ecgberht expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown. It may have been delayed until 829, since a later chronicler associates the expulsion with a campaign of Ecgberht's in that year against the Mercians.|$|E

Third year type refers to the Welin breech block on which design began in 1914, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> the Taishō period. This breech block design was also used on the 20cm (7.9 inch), 15.5cm (6.1 inch), 14cm (5.5 inch), 12.7cm (5 inch), and 12cm (4.7 inch) naval guns.|$|E
5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E

5|$|Stebbins {{was born}} in Lawrence, New York, the {{youngest}} of three children. His parents were George Ledyard Stebbins, a wealthy real estate financier who developed Seal Harbor, Maine and helped to establish Acadia National Park, and Edith Alden Candler Stebbins; both parents were native New Yorkers and Episcopalians. Stebbins was known throughout his life as Ledyard, to distinguish himself from his father. The family encouraged their sons' interest in natural history during their periodic journeys to Seal Harbor. In 1914, Edith contracted tuberculosis and the Stebbins moved to Santa Barbara, California to improve her health. In California, Stebbins was enrolled at the Cate School in Carpinteria where he became influenced by Ralph Hoffmann, an American natural history instructor and amateur ornithologist and botanist. After graduating from high school, he embarked on a major in political studies at Harvard. By <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> his undergraduate study, {{he had decided to}} major in botany.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} {{cinematic}} scenes {{was written by}} Naoki Mori, who joined the project for one and a quarter years in his role: the cinematic director was Shigeki Yoshida, who was brought on {{at the same time}} as and worked on the storyboards with Mori. The initial script was proposed by Fujibayashi based on his perception of the game's structure. As the game's theme was the use of the sword, and the sword most associated with the series was the Master Sword, the team decided to make it an origin story for the weapon. An early element was whether to incorporate the creation of Hyrule, while also needing to explain the creation of Skyloft: this initial stage of story development ended up being difficult as their initial story plans were full of contradictions to established series lore due to them wanting to create an origin story for the entire series. These issues were further complicated by <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> development with the necessity of finalizing the gameplay and environments. Feigning illness, Fujibayashi shut himself away in a hotel room and wrote the synopsis in a single day. Mori wrote the dialogue based on Fujibayashi's synopsis, who needed to work out the fine details with Fujibayashi. A scene Fujibayashi was intent on including was where Zelda jumped from the edge of Skyloft and Link caught her: this was fitted in for the two characters after the end of Link's exam. The early part of the story was quite different from earlier Zelda titles, playing out in a similar way to a school drama. Once the script was finished, it was handed to Yoshida so his team could create the cinematics. The total number of cinematics was estimated as 79, coming to over 120 minutes.|$|E

Many schools also offer voluntary study groups for the purpose of learning other languages. At which stage students begin learning {{a foreign language}} differs from state to state and is tailored according to the cultural and socio-economical dynamics of each state.
