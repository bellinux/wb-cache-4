5|$|By the 1970s, the Auxois {{had almost}} become extinct, and the French {{government}} began pushing the breeding of all native draft horses for meat production, {{as opposed to}} agricultural usage. However, <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> the Auxois was not considered high quality, and this, combined with a lower-than-expected market for meat, led to a continued decline in French draft horse populations. In the 1990s, the French government reversed its position on breeding for meat, and began promoting draft breeds for leisure pursuits. The Auxois continues to be rare, having the eighth-smallest population numbers of the nine native French draft breeds. An annual breed show is held in Semur-en-Auxois, and the Auxois is frequently seen at the Paris International Agricultural Show.|$|E

The breast and thigh <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> three Korean native chicken breeds including Woorimatdak, Hyunin black and Yeonsan ogye, and three commercial poultry breeds including the broiler, White Leghorn and Pekin duck (Anasplatyrhyncos domesticus) were studied. The analyses of the antioxidant enzymes activity, iron content and lipid oxidation were performed in raw and cooked samples. The activity of catalase (CAT) in <b>the</b> thigh <b>meat</b> was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breast <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> three Korean native chickens and the broiler, respectively. The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in <b>the</b> uncooked thigh <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> three Korean native chickens was higher than that of the breasts. <b>The</b> breast <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> Woorimatdak and Pekin duck had higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity than the others, while only <b>the</b> thigh <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> Pekin duck had the highest activity. Cooking inactivated CAT and decreased the activity of GPx and SOD. <b>The</b> thigh <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> Woorimatdak, White Leghorn, Yeonsan ogye and Hyunin black contained more total iron than <b>the</b> breast <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> those breeds. <b>The</b> heme-iron lost during cooking ranged from 3. 2 % to 14. 8 %. It is noted that <b>the</b> thigh <b>meat</b> had higher thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values than the breast in all chicken breeds. Though Woorimatdak showed higher antioxidant enzyme activity and lower released-iron percentage among Korean native chickens, no differences were found on lipid oxidation.

Highland cattle can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. The most profitable way to produce Highland beef is on poor pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland. The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as the beef is low in cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|Seals {{typically}} consume {{their prey}} underwater {{where it is}} swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to be torn apart. The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently swing its prey back and forth until it is decapitated. The elaborately cusped teeth of filter-feeding species, such as crabeater seals, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by suction feeding, using its tongue to suck <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> a bivalve out of the shell. While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from the food they eat.|$|E
5|$|An early trader, Emilian Basov, traded at Bering Island in 1743, {{collecting}} a {{large number}} of sea otter, fur seal, and blue Arctic fox furs. Basov made four trips to Bering Island and nearby Medny Island and made a fortune, inspiring many other traders. From 1743 to the founding of the Russian-American Company in 1799, over 100 private fur-trading and hunting voyages sailed from Kamchatka to North America. In total, these voyages garnered over eight million silver rubles. During {{the early part of this}} era, the ships would typically stop at the Commander Islands to slaughter and preserve <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> Steller's sea cows, a defenseless sea mammal whose range was limited to those islands. They were hunted not only for food, but also for their skins, used to make boats, and their subcutaneous fat, used for oil lamps. By 1768, Steller's sea cow was extinct. As furs were depleted on nearby islands, Russian traders sailed farther east along the Aleutian chain. By the 1760s, they were regularly sailing to Kodiak Island. Notable Russian traders in the early years of the trade include Nikifor Trapeznikov (who financed and participated in 10 voyages between 1743 and 1768), Maksimovich Solov'ev, Stepan Glotov, and Grigory Shelikhov.|$|E

5|$|The {{requirements}} for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, {{little is known about}} what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in the sacred space. They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be celibate, but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> an animal that represented the god. The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the Third Intermediate Period. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and {{the most important of these}} consorts, the God's Wife of Amun, even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.|$|E
