5|$|After {{several more}} French {{attempts}} at conciliation had failed, in September 1664 Marguerite Louise left her apartment in Palazzo Pitti, refusing to return. As a result, Cosimo moved her into Villa di Lappeggi. {{where she was}} watched by forty soldiers, and where six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere because it was feared she would abscond. The following year, she changed tack, and was reconciled with the Grand Ducal family. <b>That</b> <b>particular</b> reconciliation collapsed, however, after the birth in 1667 of Anna Maria Luisa.|$|E
5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme {{served in}} the First World War, and {{it was decided that}} those who died should be commemorated. Various ideas, {{including}} a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic around <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> place there have been suggestions for moving it to a quieter area.|$|E

5|$|Black Beauty {{was first}} {{released}} only in Japan by CBS/Sony in 1973 without individual songs {{specified in the}} track listing. Columbia Records, Davis' American record label, had difficulty identifying the compositions for royalty purposes, and the album was not released in the United States until 1997. Critics were generally positive toward Black Beauty, although some were critical of its sound quality and Grossman's solos; Corea said the recording was an accurate document how <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> band of Davis' played live.|$|E
5|$|By October 11, {{investigators}} had conducted 124 interviews and had found 174 {{pieces of evidence}} related to the case. They were also investigating the West Nickel Mines School shooting in Pennsylvania, which had occurred {{five days after the}} shooting in Bailey. As a result of the September 27 incident, Platte Canyon High School increased its security, leaving only one school entrance unlocked. It plans to install more security cameras. Park County Sheriff Fred Wegener proposed having a guard there during the school day, but he stated that <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> suggestion was outside the current budget.|$|E
5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E

Also, even in the Ivan Allen College, the Institute does not offer a Bachelor of Arts degree, only a Bachelor of Science.|$|E

5|$|Rat Mups bind {{different}} small chemicals. 1-Chlorodecane is {{the most}} common ligand, with 2-methyl-N-phenyl-2-propenamide, hexadecane and 2,6,11-trimethyl decane found to be less prominent. Rat Mups also bind limonene-1,2-epoxide, resulting in a disease of the host's kidney, hyaline-droplet nephropathy, that progresses to cancer. Other species do not develop this disorder because their Mups do not bind <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> chemical. Accordingly, when transgenic mice were engineered to express the rat Mup their kidneys developed the disease.|$|E
