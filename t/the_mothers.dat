First is the (A) group which contains the vowels, then the (Ka), (Cha), (Ta), (ta), (Pa), (Ya) and (Ksha) groups. The seven mother goddesses (Saptamatrikas) correspond to the seven consonant groups; when the vocalic (A) group is added to it, the eight mother goddesses (Ashtamatrikas) are obtained. The Shaktas hold that <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> preside over impurities (mala) and over sounds of the language. <b>The</b> <b>Mothers</b> were identified with fourteen vowels plus the anusarva and visarga– making their number sixteen.|$|E

Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one.

5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly {{before or after the}} birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E

5|$|This {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> debuted on Zappa's next solo album Chunga's Revenge (1970), which was {{followed}} by the double-album soundtrack to the movie 200 Motels (1971), featuring <b>the</b> <b>Mothers,</b> the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Ringo Starr, Theodore Bikel, and Keith Moon. Co-directed by Zappa and Tony Palmer, it was filmed in a week at Pinewood Studios outside London. Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting. The film deals loosely with life on the road as a rock musician. It was the first feature film photographed on videotape and transferred to 35mm film, a process that allowed for novel visual effects. It was released to mixed reviews. The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the Royal Albert Hall after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.|$|E
5|$|Zappa uniquely {{contributed to}} the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, {{sampling}} radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also {{contributed to the}} radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.|$|E
