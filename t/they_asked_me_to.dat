We didn't have a lot of time, because <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'."

500|$|Despite all the {{transformations in}} the industry, by 1961 the average {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature film was still only —after adjusting for inflation, less than 10 percent more {{than it had been}} in 1950.

In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, Hercules Unchained, opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. A suspense film, Terror Is a Man, ran as a [...] "co-feature" [...] with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: [...] "The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'" [...] That year, Roger Corman took AIP down a new road: [...] "When <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color." [...] The resulting House of Usher typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification. It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But it is generally seen as a B movie: the schedule was still a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000 (one-tenth the industry average), and its 85-minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B: [...] "Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes." ...|$|E

What's smart about the studio and the producers is they have always wanted to push it a bit. Chris Columbus did a wonderful job of casting and making this world incredibly popular. But rather than do more of the same, they said, 'Let's bring in Alfonso Cuarón and let him run with it. Then later, let's bring in David Yates, who's done all this hard-hitting stuff on TV.'
