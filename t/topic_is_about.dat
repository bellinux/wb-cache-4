50|$|Valley New School {{students}} use research projects aligning with their interests to gain school credit and cover state-issued learning standards. Although projects range {{across a wide}} variety of topics, each follows the same basic process. The process has five phases: proposal, research, planning, production and evaluation. In the proposal phase, students choose a topic and perform preliminary research to further understand what the <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> <b>about.</b> After that, they create a rationale detailing their interests in the project topic and a list of questions they plan to answer {{in the course of the}} project. The proposal phase ends when students meet with two advisors in a proposal meeting and discuss the plan for the project. Then students begin the research phase, during which they takes notes from a variety of sources. After students answers the questions they set out to resolve, they start the planning phase. In this phase, students meet with their advisors and decide how to represent their research in a product. Students then creates their products and written products in the production phase. In the evaluation phase, student write an analysis evaluating their progress over the course of the project as well as their learning and level of thinking. Finally, students meet with their advisors and discuss their performance and what they learned. Students earn school credit based on the time spent (typically 1 credit per 100 hours) and the quality of the project.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{three issues}} encountered by a shipper {{in the context}} of truckload transportation. In all of the studies, we utilize optimization techniques to model and solve the problems. Each study is inspired from the real world and much of the data used in the experiments is real data or representative of real data. The first <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> the freight consolidation in truckload transportation. We integrate it with a purchase incentive program to increase truckload utilization and maximize profit. The second <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> supporting decision making collaboration among departments of a manufacturer. It is a bi-objective optimization model. The third <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> procurement in an adverse market. We study a modification of the existing procurement process to consider the market stochastic into marking decisions. In all three studies, our target is to develop effectively methodologies to seek optimal answers within a reasonable amount of time...|$|E

Another interesting <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> the learning process that seems to be a trial and error process. In this work, we present mechanisms about how to produce a reconfigurable logical cell based on the tent map. The reconfiguration is realized by modifying its internal parameters generating several logical functions in the same structure. The logical cell is built with three blocks: the initial condition generating function, the tent map, and the output function. Furthermore, we propose a reconfigurable structure based on a chaotic system and an evolutionary algorithm is used in order to tune the parameters of the cell via trial and error process...|$|E

30|$|Strikingly, the technoscience {{discourse}} evokes major topics widely discussed {{under the}} label of “deconstructivism” and, more provocatively, of “postmodernism” in the 1980 s. At that time, the hot <b>topics</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> the blurring or dissolution of the boundaries considered as constitutive cornerstones for the self-understanding of the modern age. Accordingly, the term “technoscience” extends the postmodernist discourse and brings a fresh flair of postmodernism to the fortress of science and technology. Granted, it might be less provocative to speak about late, reflexive or second modernity and to omit the term “post”; even so, this does not alter the actual content.|$|R
