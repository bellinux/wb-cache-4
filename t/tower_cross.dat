50|$|When Jaume Figueres and {{his wife}} María Sagues Molíns {{commissioned}} Gaudí for the project in 1900, {{all that remained of}} the initial structure were a few walls and the patio. Still, Gaudí was aware of the important history this location bore to Catalonia, so he worked to preserve the medieval spirit of the ruins, as is evident in the exterior resemblance to a medieval castle, complemented by signature aspects of Gaudí’s architectural style. As always, Gaudí sought to blend the construction with its natural surroundings, hence the exterior is made with stone slate. Through Gaudí's incorporation of decorative elements resonant of natural surroundings together with traditional gothic characteristics, the façade of the structure is still best understood as neogothic, though there is no denying the modernist elements in the actual Torre Bellesguard. Gaudí designed the home in a period where he himself was still developing his unique style. For instance, while the building displays Gaudí's iconic mosaic detailing and incorporation of natural elements, it does not include Moorish accents and bright colors (aside from the stripes on the <b>tower</b> <b>cross),</b> which are key distinctive characteristics in much of his later works.|$|E

40|$|With {{the number}} of wind power units (WPUs) on the rise worldwide, it is {{inevitable}} that some of these would be exposed to natural disasters like tsunamis and it will become a necessity to consider their effects in the design process of WPUs. This study initially attempts to quantify the forces acting on an existing WPU due to a tsunami bore impact. Surge and bore heights of 2 m, 5 m and 10 m are used to compute the forces using the commercially available full 3 D Navier Stokes equation solver FLOW 3 D. The applicability of FLOW 3 D to solve these types of problems is examined by comparing results obtained from the numerical simulations to those determined by small scale laboratory experiments. The simulated tsunami forces on the WPU are input into a simplified numerical structural model of the WPU to determine its dynamic response. The tsunami force is also used to obtain base excitation which when applied on the WPU would be equivalent dynamically to the tsunami forces acting on it. This base excitation is useful to obtain the response of the WPU experimentally, the setup for which is available at University of California, San Diego's (UCSD) Large High Performance Outdoor Shake Table (LHPOST). The facility allows full scale experimental setup capable of subjecting a 65 kW Nordtank wind turbine to random base excitations. A stress analysis of turbine <b>tower</b> <b>cross</b> section is performed in order to assess the structural integrity of the WPU. It has been determined that the WPU is unsafe for bore/surge heights above 5 m. It has also been postulated that the structural responses could be considerable in case of the taller multi megawatt wind power units of present day...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} numerical validation {{of two different}} failure test data. These are: (1) suspension insulator failure test and (2) conductor failure test. The first failure scenario deals with {{the study of the}} effect of dynamic load on adjacent towers due to a broken suspension insulator; while the second scenario deals with the effect of dynamic load on a tower when the adjacent tower has failed due to conductor rupture. The published data were gathered from full scale as well as scale model tests for model validations. A finite element model of the line was developed using three different element types. Incremental nonlinear dynamic analysis was carried out in the time domain using a commercially available software package. [...] Using full-scale test data from broken insulator at the suspension point, a numerical model was developed. Upon validation of the numerical model with the test results, a sensitivity study was carried out for various insulator lengths, ice thicknesses and initial tensions {{to determine the effects of}} these parameters on the impact loads on the <b>tower</b> <b>cross</b> arm. Results of the study show that the impact loads are less sensitive to the change in insulator length and initial tension but they do vary significantly when the ice loads are increased. The magnitude of the effect of incremental ice thickness has not been quantified in any previous study. A coordination of strength study showed that a suspension insulator failure can increase the conductor tension considerably thus initiating conductor rupture and therefore, a possible cascade failure in the longitudinal direction. [...] Using the scale model test data for broken conductor, a numerical model was developed where a number of towers were allowed to fail (one at a time) in a preferred sequence and the peak forces predicted on the surviving tower. This predicted peak force was compared to the experimental results and a reasonable correlation was established. Results show clearly that by allowing a few structures to fail, the longitudinal peak load on the surviving tower can be reduced significantly. This information can then be used in the design of the anti-cascading tower for proper cascade failure containment. [...] The study results show clearly that the analysis of dynamic load assessment on transmission system is possible and is cost effective using commercially available finite element software. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 It {{has become}} a {{challenging}} exercise to obtain land {{in order to further}} develop the electrical infrastructure in South Africa. The {{reason for this is that}} high voltage transmission towers visually impacts the surroundings and require a large servitude in order to accommodate these structures. The requirements for low visible towers with small foundation footprints may be achieved with double circuit power line towers. However, the structural loading in tower member's increase drastically as a result of large conductor bundles, higher reliability, smaller foundation footprints and a increase in wind loading because of the taller structures. This limits the further economical use of standard angular hot rolled sections and requires that alternative cross sections are considered in the design of power line towers. The aim of this research is to focus on the practical and cost-e ective implementation of circular hollow sections (CHS) in power line towers. The design of a power line system consist of a family of tower structures which include a large number of structural and non-structural members as well as many connections resisting various combinations of loads. The outcome of this research proves that a feasible and practical way exist to implement circular hollow sections in power line tower design using current design software, current design standards and current manufacturing techniques for South African conditions. It is recommended that connections between tower elements should be similar to existing connection practices where possible. This will reduce the requirements for specialized software or connection standards. This will also facilitate the design of hybrid tubular and angular member towers. Hence a review of current angular member and connection design practices are given for the reader. Before the design of a tubular power line tower may be done, various hollow section connections and stability criteria are reviewed. The CIDECT manuals provide an excellent resource for hollow section connections for static and dynamic conditions. It is important to note that it is not the intention of the author to question or improve on the existing hollow section design formulae, but rather to show their ease of implementation in the power line industry. A tubular tower was designed and fabricated in order to combine the theory and practical implementation thereof. In the design of this test tower, the author introduced a novel cross arm design. The new con guration cross arm has only three main chords compared with the conventional cross arm with four main chords. It is envisaged that this new cross arm con guration will reduce overall tower cost as well as construction cost. An analytical and numerical structural analysis was used to design the test tower. An isolated analysis was also performed on the <b>tower</b> <b>cross</b> arm in order to compare and validate the use of less expensive structural software. The comparison considered a full nite element analysis (ANSYS) compared with a beam element analysis (Prokon). The results show that there is an excellent correlation between the two models given that speci c, yet simple modeling techniques are used to model the tower elements. In order to conclude the validity of the recommended design approach and the integrity of the test structure, physical testing was done at the Eskom tower test facility. The structure was securely xed to the base of the test bed and strain gauges were tted on several of the tower members. Steel wire ropes with load cells were tted to the cross arms of the structure and three typical load cases were evaluated. Comparing the physical test results with the Prokon model, a 10 % variation between member loads were recorded. The loads in the test tower was in most cases higher compared with the Prokon model. In summary, the design process proposed here may successfully be used to design and manufacture CHS power line towers. The design process uses current design software, current design standards and current manufacturing techniques. Further investigation on full scale structures are required in order to study the economics of tubular towers versus angular member towers. This study should include fabricators and construction experts in order to comprehend the impact on the power-line industry. The author suspects that the fabrication cost of CHS towers will be slightly higher but the construction cost will be signi cantly less. Master...|$|E
