5000|$|In {{carrying}} out his work Nabil Kanso appears calm and quiet. But {{the light of}} fire in the paintings look like nightmares which he has to work through, often spending several months on one painting. Kanso’s outstanding mural-scale paintings are a cross between the specificity of Goya’s ‘Horror of War’ and the universality of Picasso’s Guernica. To stand in the central space surrounded by Nabil Kanso’s 12-foot-high paintings {{is as close as}} you get to being {{in the middle of a}} fire. Using lurid oranges, yellows and reds, Kanso fills every inch of canvas with visions of violence and human suffering that rival medieval descriptions of Hell. One painting went the entire length of the room, maybe 30 feet. I felt like a coward. It was almost impossible to look at the power and extravagance of these scenes, so I turned instead and looked at the faces of the other onlookers. In their faces were the reflections of the painted holocaust around us. I turned again to the painting which now entrapped is in a cage of feeling. It is noted by some critics that [...] "Kanso’s highly expressive personal style evokes experiences and visions that reveal the inner essence of a reality lying beyond its external aspects". A view of a troubled world is portrayed in compositions whose imageries carry the art towards issues of human concern. They record intense, harrowing images of haunting themes voicing universal expressions on human brutality and suffering. In the opinion of some art critics [...] "Kanso strong colors and powerful brushstrokes blend with the subject matter: world chaos." [...] It is further noted that the battle against large formats cannot be won but with a strong determination and an absolute mastery of technique. These are inseparable and preconceived. The dynamic handling of the pictorial layout has a total identification with Kanso’s <b>topical</b> <b>matter.</b> His powerful themes could in no way be handled with softer and milder style designed to make them palatable. By way of parallelism, Kanso’s work is a harmony of style and subject matter.|$|E

40|$|Summary Estimating the {{likelihood}} of future climate change has become a <b>topical</b> <b>matter</b> within the research community. This is the case because of the advancement of science, user demand and the central role played by prediction in guiding policy. But are probabilities what climate policy really needs? This paper reviews three key questions: (1) why might we need probabilities of climate change? (2) what are the problems in estimating probabilities? (3) how are researchers estimating probabilities? The first question is primarily analysed {{within the context of}} adaptation to climate change, but mitigation and integrated assessment are also briefly discussed. The second question explores the types and sources of uncertainties involved in estimating probabilities of climate change and how their characterisation can be controversial. For the third question, an extensive review of the literature is conducted on research that is creating the building blocks towards estimating {{the likelihood}} of climate change. Overall, we conclude that {{the jury is still out}} on whether probabilities are useful for climate policy. The answer is highly context dependent and thus is a function of the goals an...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the paper}} the {{formation}} of world-class research universities is analysed. The paper studies {{the history of the}} research university, prerequisites of its appearance, formation and its development toward modern research university. The modern research university is being cautiously viewed nowadays. The crisis of the university is its reality. The question of the corporate culture formation is now considered to be a <b>topical</b> <b>matter</b> in connection with globalization process, Methods: The authors implemented comparative analysis by comparing Humboldt's model of the research university and the modern one. Results: The comparison is made in regard to the idea of university, its criteria and mission. Special emphasis is laid on the analysis and comparison of corporate culture systems. Conclusions: Corporate culture is a novel criterion of the classical university that has recently arisen in the information society and now characterizes the university in a complementary way: on the one hand, as a competitive market entity, and on the other hand, as a guardian of its traditional, historically formed humanitarian criteria, ideas and mission. The following conclusion has been reached: the updated parameters have the identical form to those found by W. von Humboldt, only essence has changed...|$|E

40|$|Preaching on {{political}} issues {{is a very}} <b>topical</b> <b>matter,</b> especially in the current situation in South Africa. This matter is extensively dealt with in literature {{in the field of}} the Old and New Testament, Homiletics and Ethics. The aim with this article is to explore the Pauline paranesis in Romans 12 - 15 to discern concrete guidelines on handling political issues in preaching. As point of departure the expression God’s mercy (Romans 12 : 1) is investigated closely, as the concept of God’s mercy is the foundation stone of the total paranesis in Romans 12 - 15. Regarding preaching {{on political}} issues, the fact that the new aeon has already come and will finally come, leads to certain conclusions. The responsibility of the congregation to test and approve what God's will is - also in political matters - is stressed. The kingdom of God as the predominant kingdom, relativises earthly (political) kingdoms. The responsibility to equip the congregation to discern political issues in the light of Scripture is dealt with in this regard. Finally, perspectives are given on the relation between state and believer. In conclusion the command to Christians to love each other as believers, to live in peace with everyone and to love enemies is also highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Background. Lipid {{metabolism}} {{disorders in}} the organism affected by environmental pollutants, including poisoning with {{cadmium and lead}} salts are of <b>topical</b> <b>matter</b> nowadays. Objective. The study was aimed to examine biochemical features of lipid metabolism in rats subjected to toxic damage by lead and cadmium salts and treated with carnitine chloride and Algigel. Methods. Experiments were carried out on white mature outbred male rats weighing 180 - 200 g. To cause the toxic damage the animals were administered with aqueous solution of cadmium chloride and lead acetate daily {{for the period of}} 30 days using intra-gastric lavage. The indices of lipid metabolism were detected by biochemical methods. Results. In animals treated with cadmium chloride and lead acetate the following changes were observed: HDL-cholesterol concentrations significantly decreased, resulting in 87 % of the levels in the intact animals on the third day, 84 % on the fifth and 80 % on the seventh day. Conversely, concentrations of HDL-cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol significantly increased during the experiment. Respectively, the ratios for HDL-cholesterol are 240 %, 352 %, and 388 %; and for VLDL-cholesterol 108 %, 116 %, and 132 %. Conclusions.

40|$|Abstract: Personalised {{education}} is a <b>topical</b> <b>matter</b> today {{and the impact of}} ICT on education has been covered extensively. The adaptation of education to various types of student is an issue of a vast number of papers presented at diverse conferences. The topic incorporates the fields of information technologies and eLearning, but in no small part also the field of pedagogy. By interconnecting eLearning with the requirement for personalized education, we obtain a new term – automatic adaptive learning. We asked ourselves a question if the process of automatic adaptive learning (i. e. going through the electronic study course which suits student’s preferences and learning style) can be modeled. The optimal adaptive process will respect students ’ differences based on determined learning styles and with regard to their knowledge and skills as changed during the course. On the basis of identification of their personal characteristics and qualities, students will be presented with a study material which suits them the most. One of the basic building blocks of adaptive {{education is}} the storage of study materials. In {{order to be able to}} prepare tailored education for every type of student, study material must be prepared in many different variants, in different form. This form should be different from the classic form of text-books. This article presents the issues connected with the creation of study materials suitable for adaptive education in more detail; the basis for this is the pedagogical analysis of the starting prerequisites applicable in eLearning. In conclusion, a particular way of use of such created study material in electronic adaptive education will be outlined...|$|E

40|$|Modernisation, globalisation, {{neoliberalism}} and {{the increase}} in immigration have morphed into xenophobia, as they have resulted in structures that increased inequalities and competition for scarce resources, although there are other factors such as the global recession that is deepening inequalities and social classes. In South Africa, xenophobia is a <b>topical</b> <b>matter,</b> with chronic violent outbursts. The study addresses the gap in knowledge in the relationship between language and xenophobia. Language is central to human communication and to human socialisation and is not neutral but is embedded in ideologies that favour specific interest groups. The neoliberal ideology compels people as human capital to develop linguistic capital. The paradox is that globalisation transcends the national to transnational, {{while at the same time}} being conscious of the local or the indigenous language. Globalisation promotes hybridity and diversity, while at the same time promoting homogeneity or Westernisation, which is contrary to the nationalist ideology to protect the cultural heritage of the locals. This thesis is guided by a range of classical and more contemporary development theories. It includes the use of Marxist theory with regard to ownership and unequal distribution of resources. The culture of violence that manifests in xenophobia in South Africa can also be related to the violence of the colonial and apartheid periods. This thesis is also guided by the post-colonial theory. It also looks at theories of modernity and of globalisation, suggesting that a truly ‘modern’ society should be transformed in all spheres and should value multifaceted human well-being (and not only in terms of economic ‘growth’). A primary objective of this study is to explore the role of language in social institutions such as education in order to understand how matters of language exacerbate xenophobia and to document the challenges related to language that ‘foreigners’ from other parts of Africa face in South Africa. Questions asked include whether they can survive/thrive without knowledge of local languages, whether they are victims of crime because they cannot speak the local languages and whether and how they are being assimilated into South African society. This research therefore, recommends that language planning in South Africa should maintain a balance in the use of the English language as a lingua franca and the use of the indigenous languages so as to avoid the language endangerment of the indigenous languages and monolingualism, as well as subtractive bilingualism. This research is against institutional discrimination of foreigners by use of language as a gate keeper or an entry fee into the higher domains. The results of this research lead to the recommendation on language planning that leads to economic opportunity, higher economic productivity, educational development, enrichment in the sense of creativity innovation, cognitive flexibility, and more effective social integration, while restoring citizens’ sense of self-worth and their experience of emotional and social security, and also promoting social integrity and nation-building. Good language planning should be a crucial aspect of development planning. This research contributes to the field of Development Studies in that it analyses the conflicting issues within language and xenophobia in South Africa, while using the complexity theory to restore a modernised society with modern values that are not xenophobic but open to the global society. It also contributes to the politics of culture by keeping a balance between the endogenous culture versus the exogenous culture; a localised culture versus a globalised culture...|$|E
2500|$|The century {{also saw}} Birmingham {{emerge as the}} centre of a vibrant and {{sophisticated}} culture of popular street literature, as the town's printers produced increasing numbers of the broadsides and chapbooks that formed the primary reading matter of the poor. Cheaply printed and carrying traditional songs, newly written ballads on <b>topical</b> <b>matters,</b> simple folk-tales with wood-cut illustrations, and news – particularly salacious coverage of gruesome crimes, executions, riots and wars – broadsides and chapbooks were sold or exchanged by itinerant chapmen – also called [...] "patterers" [...] or [...] "ballad-mongers" [...] – who often displayed their goods in the street on a small table or pinned to a wall. Although much of this work was by its nature ephemeral and low in literary quality, Birmingham was unusual in that the town's high level of social mobility meant that printers of street literature often overlapped with printers of weightier material, some writers of street literature were highly educated and of respectable social standing, and several writers of Birmingham broadside ballads had a lasting influence on the town's literary culture. Job Nott – probably a pseudonym of Theodore Price of Harborne – was a largely conservative figure who produced {{a wide range of}} pamphlets and broadsides on <b>topical</b> <b>matters,</b> attracting imitators as far afield as Bristol. John Freeth's influence was even greater: nearly 400 of his political ballads were published and distributed nationally in a dozen separate collections between 1766 and 1805, the best-known being his 1790 collection The Political Songster. An outstanding figure in the radical circles of the late-Georgian town, he hosted the Birmingham Book Club at John Freeth's Coffee House, giving him a national political importance and placing him at the heart of Birmingham's developing political self-consciousness during the upheavals of the American Revolution.|$|R
