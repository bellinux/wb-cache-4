These species show high {{variability}} but are threatened with genetic erosion. To study {{the management of}} genetic resources of neglected vegetatively propagated crop species, we studied genetic diversity and structure of these species in an in situ diversity microcenter (Huanuco, Peru). A sample of 15 varieties of oca, 15 of ulluco, and 26 of mashua was analyzed with the inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) molecular markers. Mean genetic distances and global genetic diversities were high for the three species, with higher values for mashua than for oca and ulluco. Assignment technique divided both oca and ulluco samples into two genetic clusters; the mashua sample probably belongs to a single genetic cluster. Inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) technique showed intravarietal genetic variability for most varieties, suggesting an underestimation of the in situ genetic variability. These results are discussed considering how variation in breeding systems and farmers' practice influenced patterns of genetic diversity.

40|$|In Asia, {{the role}} of {{tropical}} root and <b>tuber</b> <b>crops</b> is changing from being food staples to sources of raw materials for processed food products and animal feed. The growing utilization of root and <b>tuber</b> <b>crops</b> in these expanding markets depends critically on price competitiveness relative to other commodities, especially maize. In this paper, price relationships among commodities in Asia are examined to assess the potential of cassava and sweetpotato in starch and feed markets. For starch, cassava is competitive in Southeast Asia. Sweetpotato is competitive in selected starch markets in China, but faces increasing competition from maize. Crop breeding to increase starch yield from cassava and sweetpotato will improve their competitiveness in these markets. In feed markets, millers are likely to prefer maize over root and <b>tuber</b> <b>crops</b> {{due in part to}} the higher cost of protein supplements when using root and <b>tuber</b> <b>crops.</b> Sweetpotato is a viable feed option for small farmers who grow their own feed so long as the protein rich-rich foliage can be effectively incorporated along with starchy roots in feed rations...|$|R

Female-headed households may depend on home gardens more than average households to supply and supplement the household's diet when labour is constrained for field cropping. This paper compares household characteristics, dietary diversity, labour allocated to crop husbandry and home garden biodiversity amongst 22 HIV/AIDS-afflicted female-headed households, 15 non-HIV/AIDS-afflicted female-headed, 10 HIV/AIDS-afflicted dual-headed and 33 non-HIV/AIDS-afflicted dual-headed households in rural communities in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Information on household characteristics and labour allocation to home garden management was obtained through a cross-sectional survey and in-depth interviews. Dietary diversity score was estimated for each household based on a 24 -hour qualitative dietary recall. Plant species in each home garden were recorded. HIV/ AIDS affliction did not affect home garden diversity but afflicted households had more on-farm sources of income and a higher dietary diversity and allocated more adult labour to home garden activities than non-afflicted households. Dual-headed households had more diversity in the home garden and allocated more adult male labour to the home garden than female-headed households. Statistically significant interactions between HIV/AIDS affliction and headship were observed for Shannon-Wiener index, number of crop species, number of annual crop species and number of root and <b>tuber</b> <b>crop</b> species in the home gardens: there were no headship effects when households were afflicted whereas dual-headed households had higher values than female-headed households in non-afflicted households. HIV/AIDS-afflicted households had significantly more annual crop species and more root and <b>tuber</b> <b>crop</b> species than non-afflicted households for female-headed households, whereas {{there were no significant}} differences for dual-headed households. Faced with confinement to the homestead in caregiving and by the obligation to ensure household food and nutritional security, HIV/AIDS-afflicted households spent more (female] labour on home garden management than non-afflicted households to produce crops for sustenance and dietary diversity...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{utilization}} of sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) by waterfowl was studied at Bear River Miqratory Bird Refuge by comparing amounts of sago production {{on a series}} of plots on Unit Four. One plot was available to carp and waterfowl; one only to carp; and one available to neither. The cage used to eliminate carp and waterfowl use of a plot caused a significant increase in sago production. The increase was attributed to less turbidity and less wind and wave action within the cage. Carp distribution was limited to deep-water portions of Unit Four, a small area, and they had no significant effect on sago production. Therefore, sago production from carp and open plots was compared to determine {{utilization of}} sago by waterfowl. Waterfowl utilization of sago in summer and spring was not significant; however, 52 percent of the <b>tuber</b> <b>crop</b> was used by waterfowl in fall. The method of study did not allow detection of waterfowl use of windrowed or submersed seed. Water depths between 2 and 10 inches had little or no effect on waterfowl use of tubers in fall; however depths between 5 and 14 inches in spring and 4 and 13 inches in summer may have prevented full use of tubers. Tubers were most available to ducks in the first 6 inches of soil but were utili zed to 8 inch depths. A series of 50 foot-square pens (2, 500 square feet) were stocked with semi-domestic mallards to determine the effect of certain levels of utilization on sago growth.
