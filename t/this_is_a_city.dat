The formal, conceptual and aesthetic choices offered in the {{analysis of the}} film aim to explore alternative possibilities of analyzing representations of Joburg. I have positioned my filmic practice as one of the multi entry points to epistemologies that are concerned with the representation of Joburg discursively. If <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> audio visual enquiry framed around theoretical concerns articulated in the literature about the critical interrogation of urban spaces in general, and Joburg in particular. The film operates as an evaluation of the prevailing theoretical body of work by accentuating the disparities between the theoretical frameworks and the everyday spatial practices of experiencing the city...|$|R

When choosing their name, the band seemed to be inspired by an ambiguous relationship towards their hometown which they felt to be rather provincial. In a review of The Best of..., the liberal Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny stated that [...] "coming from Mysłowice, the band entered the new, wonderful world of show business with a small-town complex"http://muzyka.onet.pl/mr,23699,1,recenzje.html. In {{an interview with the}} Montreal Mirror (see above), Guitarist Przemek Myszor called Mysłowice [...] "depressing" ... like all small towns are. In Poland there are few big towns. And by big town I mean where there is culture. You know, towns that have big clubs. We still live in Mysłowice, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> to die in, not to live. Our region of Poland, in the south, is very industrial, coal mining, hard industry" [...] http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2002/112802/music2.html.For statements like these, Myslovitz were sometimes chided for fouling their own nest; paradoxically, however, they even helped to sanitize the city's image. Says the music journalist Leszek Gnoiński (author of the [...] "standard work" [...] Encyklopedia Polskiego Rocka): [...] "Mysłowice is a city of some 100,000 people. Until the early 90s, it was known, at best, for its coalmines - until these five guys with guitars turned the mining town into a place that could be located on any map of Poland." [...] Myslovitz's impact was one factor which stimulated the development of a local music scene. By now, with bands such as Negatyw and Supermusic, a lively Alternative rock and hip hop culture is flourishing in Mysłowice. Far away from Warsaw as the centre of the commercial Polish entertainment industry, it even benefits from its image as being peripheral, obscure, and non-commercial - not totally unlike the British Madchester phenomenon in the 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E

In a climate of recession after the First World War, concrete represented a hope for the future that was readily expressed by the most innovative of the city’s commercial firms.

40|$|Tokyo is a {{boundless}} {{synthesis of}} many cities and villages. In this {{and in many}} other respects, Tokyo is a celebration of motion. And with motion comes rapid change. Today, the metropolis thrives on this almost ritualistic phenomenon of destruction and rebuilding. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> of no beginning and no end, where stories are spliced together and juxtaposed, sometimes in harmony, but more frequently in chaos. How can one possibly begin to conceive of urban space {{in the midst of}} all this apparent confusion? How can one claim to hold memories of Tokyo when the locus and language by which they are painted are in perpetual flux? The question must involve a rigorous redefinition of Western notions of space and its representation. Ever so slowly, amidst the clutter emerges an immutable harmony that, like almost everything about Tokyo, spurns words for the silences in between—a naked urban haiku that washes transparent dreams over this jungle of concrete, this tangle of time. Space seems to merge with its representations, buildings shed their facades and forms jut into a skyline of multifarious screens and resplendent banners. And so we ask, how does Tokyo rewrite our memories? What is the nature of memory in a city that so swiftly assimilates into its mutable aesthetic all inscriptions of the previous, the already, the long ago?...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the use of visual methods such as {{participatory}} video is crucial to co-producing sensory and embodied knowledges of belonging in Australian cities. These knowledges of belonging that focus on affectivity and passion have the potential to expand the worlds that racialised bodies of colour inhabit, but contemporary urban research shows an overwhelming focus on ‘talk’. This paper therefore takes the risk by engaging in a research process that is experimental, flexible and adaptive to explore diverse sensory cultures of belonging through a focus on Darwin, a small north Australian city. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> with a polyethnic history where Indigenous-migrant-settler race relations are recognised as more complex in comparison to large south Australian cities. The paper draws on participatory videos of two eventsin suburban Darwin - a Vigil {{on the side of the}} road opposite Airport Lodge, an asylum seeker detention centre, and an afternoon walk along Casuarina beach where Aboriginals who live ‘rough’ camp. Using short video clips, long-term residents, migrant newcomers and asylum seekers (on bridging visas) compose an expressive narrative of the road and beach in Darwin, as places where refrains of welcome expand worlds that racialised bodies of colour inhabit. Using digital technologies the flow and juxtaposition of video clips of these events provides the possibility to craft sensory and embodied knowledges of belonging in a north Australian city with a history of assimilationist and racially discriminatory policies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} urban discourses as {{powerful}} instruments {{intertwined with the}} dialectic of inclusion and exclusion. First, three dominant contemporary urban discourses developed {{in the field of}} urban planning are scrutinized on their inclusiveness of families and daily family life. The attractive city, the creative city and the city as an emancipation machine are examples of urban discourses communicated top-down via reports, debates and media attention. It is argued that these three discourses do not address families as urban citizens nor the very notion of reproduction and its daily manifestation. The exclusionary character of contemporary urban discourses does not only result in a neglect of urban families, it also legitimates non-intervention when it comes to family issues. This conclusion activated the search for an alternative discourse as expanded {{in the second part of}} the paper. This alternative discourse is constructed from the bottom-up and is rooted in the day-to-day experiences of urban families themselves. It is a refined discourse, with interrelated geographical scales including the city as a whole, the neighbourhood, the street and the home. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> that integrates—as families themselves do—the different domains of life. The city is appreciated for its qualities of proximity, the neighbourhood for its ethnically mixed children’s domains, the street as an urban haven and the house as the place that accommodates private life for each member of the family. This alternative discourse is called the balanced city. The empirical basis is drawn from middle-class urban families in Rotterdam, The Netherlands...|$|E
