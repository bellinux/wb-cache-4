5|$|Author Edward Macan views British symphonic pop as a {{splinter}} of {{the progressive}} rock genre that relied on straightforward songwriting, rich vocal arrangements and quasi-orchestral fullness, citing Supertramp, ELO, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project, and Al Stewart as examples. By the late 1970s, the era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing had ended. Corporate artists and repertoire staff began exerting an increasing amount of control over <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process</b> that had previously belonged to the artists. Some of the major progressive bands transitioned to a more commercial sound and deemphasized the evocation of art music. By the early 1980s, the prevailing view was that the progressive rock style had ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|Cyberpunk is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock vocalist Billy Idol. A concept album, it was {{released}} in 1993 by Chrysalis Records. Inspired by his personal interest in technology and his first attempts to use computers {{in the creation of}} his music, Idol based the album on the cyberdelic subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Heavily experimental in its style, the album was an attempt by Idol to take control of <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process</b> in the production of his albums, while simultaneously introducing Idol's fans and other musicians to the opportunities presented by digital media.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea {{each had}} their own {{separate}} rooms {{at each end of}} the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For over thirty days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment which allowed him to complete the rest of the lyrics. During production, the band agreed to let Flea's brother-in-law document <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process</b> on film. When the album's recording was complete, the Chili Peppers released the film, titled Funky Monks.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of Burnout 3: Takedown, UK-based development studio Criterion had been collaborating with publisher Electronic Arts (EA) on a skating video game. However, disagreements over the game's creative direction led to its cancellation and falling out between the two companies. EA later approached Criterion about reuniting and partnering on a game, and so Criterion began developing Burnout 3: Takedown in June 2004 on the condition that EA would not interfere in <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process.</b> Over a year later, EA acquired Criterion and the Burnout series; their high expectations for Burnout 3: Takedown was influential in the acquisition. The game launched in September 2004 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox video game consoles.|$|E

40|$|Is it {{possible}} to map Human Creativity in a way {{similar to that of}} the Human Genome? • Do mechanisms of <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>processes</b> cross <b>the</b> boundaries of disciplines? • Are there optimal conditions that may enhance human creativity? • How does cooperation/collaboration affect creativity? To shed some light on all of the above questions, we provide a unifying framework within which <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>processes</b> (and hence creativity) can be understood and analysed. The unification here is in the sense that the proposed framework is discipline-independent. Co-creation and the effect of collaboration on <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>processes</b> are properly addressed as concurrency is treated as a fundamental dimension within our theory.

Creativity maps from a number of disciplines (art and engineering) are produced as illustrative examples of the approach...|$|R

5|$|Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) is {{the second}} solo album by English {{musician}} Brian Eno. Produced by Eno, it was originally released by Island Records in November 1974. Unlike his previous album Here Come the Warm Jets, Eno used a core band of five instrumentalists (keyboards, guitars, bass, drums and percussion) and used fewer guest musicians. Also participating was guitarist and co-writer Phil Manzanera, who had played with Eno in Roxy Music. To help guide {{the production of the}} album, Eno and Peter Schmidt developed instruction cards called Oblique Strategies to use through <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process</b> of the album.|$|E

5|$|The era {{of record}} labels {{investing}} in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited {{control over their}} content and marketing, ended with the late 1970s. Corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount of control over <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process</b> that had previously belonged to the artists, and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for a harder sound {{in the style of}} arena rock.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} how VR and AR interfaces affect <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> design <b>process</b> in design education. Theories from cognitive psychology, information sciences, and design cognition are provide an explanatory mechanism to indicate that epistemic action reduces cognitive load, thereby reducing fixation in the design <b>process</b> and enhancing <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> design <b>process.</b> Thirty undergraduate design students were randomly divided into two groups that used AR or VR to complete a simple project that required students to design the interior of an office. Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods were used. A linkography protocol was used to understand the effect of different interfaces on <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> design <b>process</b> and a questionnaire was administered to examine the effect of user characteristics on <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> design <b>process.</b> Results of the study indicated that AR interfaces tend to encourage more epistemic actions during the design process than the VR interfaces. Epistemic actions were found to reduce the cognitive load thereby reducing fixation in <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> design <b>process.</b> From calculating entropy of the design process, AR appeared to provide a more conducive environment for creativity than VR. The second part of the study focuses on how individual characteristics of the students moderate the effect of technology traits in enhancing <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> design <b>process.</b> Learner preferences were analyzed through learning styles and technology acceptance was measured to understand how different learning styles affect technology acceptance of the two media types of AR and VR. The theoretical background suggests that perceived ease of use correlates with creativity. Hence, learner preferences were hypothesized to affect the use of different types of media in <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> design <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> results did not indicate that learner preferences affected <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> design <b>process</b> but did support the conclusion that certain user preferences lead to higher acceptance levels for technology...|$|R
5|$|Invisible Circles is {{the third}} studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band After Forever. It was {{released}} on 25 March 2004, by the small Dutch label Transmission Records. It is After Forever's first full-length album since the dismissal of guitarist and composer Mark Jansen, whose musical tastes had strongly influenced {{the sound of their}} first work Prison of Desire (2000) and their successful second offering Decipher (2001). In this work After Forever choose a new musical direction, mostly revolving around elements of progressive metal instead of the gothic and symphonic metal of previous albums. <b>The</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process</b> for Invisible Circles took {{more than a year and}} required the use of three recording studios in the Netherlands and Germany. A long tour to support the album brought the band to some of the most important European rock festivals and to Central and South America.|$|E
5|$|Sander Gommans {{started the}} {{composition}} of the basic melodies for Invisible Circles at the beginning of 2003 in his home studio in Reuver, working at the same time on new songs for the EP Exordium. This part of <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process</b> had been shared with Mark Jansen for the previous albums and it would be shared with keyboard player Joost van den Broek for the following ones. Gommans wrote the songs for the new album with the precise idea of pushing the music of the band closer to progressive metal, reducing the gothic atmospheres of the previous releases to a minimum and adopting as many different musical styles as he felt necessary to the convey the message of the songs. Meanwhile, his fiancée Floor Jansen was writing the lyrics and shaping the plot for the concept album.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{producers}} and creators presented material in a narrative format {{instead of the}} more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research {{was part of the}} creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process.</b> Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures.

A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999.

5|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} conceived by Jun Maeda, who also wrote the screenplay and composed {{some of the}} music, with original character design by Na-Ga. Both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! in 2010. Maeda had thought up the concept for Charlotte long before he was approached in early 2012 to work on another anime series after Angel Beats!. Maeda narrowed down the number of main characters compared to Angel Beats! and attempted to put more of a focus on their behavior. Instead of employing the same staff that had worked on Angel Beats!, the aim for Charlotte was to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process</b> to prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!.|$|E
5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> <b>process,</b> and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats! and who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats!, and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E

Methods: Semi-structured interviews concerning <b>the</b> artistic <b>creative</b> <b>process</b> and <b>the</b> role of psychoactive substance use were recorded with 72 artists and analyzed using content analysis. The participants were classified according to their substance use in three groups (Cannabis Group, Alcohol Group, and Control Group).
