5|$|Each {{in their}} own way is making the same point, that Bewick's work is more <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> illustration. Its liveliness and truth to {{experience}} appeals to the imagination of the reader and calls forth an individual response that goes beyond the text.|$|E
5|$|Roger in turn desires Barbara's dowry {{of land in}} London, {{which he}} hopes to develop into an opulent estate and townhouses; {{she and her mother}} travel to London to make {{arrangements}} for the betrothal. Due to Diana's greed, negotiations almost fall apart until the intervention of the Duchess results in Barbara and Roger finally marrying. The couple travel to Paris. While learning to navigate through Parisian society, Barbara remains in love with her husband but Roger has no thoughts at all for his young bride other <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> fondness.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Jackson {{moved to}} reorganize {{the agency in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report. They streamlined procedures for gathering and disseminating intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference between the President and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, readable, conclusive, and useful rather <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, another major intelligence failure.|$|E

5|$|The Capobiancos {{argued that}} it takes more <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> biology to invoke the {{provisions}} of the ICWA, and under South Carolina law, a father must not only reside with the mother for the six-month period preceding the birth of the child but also contribute to pregnancy-related expenses in order to have paternity rights. However, the Court determined that the ICWA does not defer to state law, and the trial court properly determined that the ICWA grants Indian fathers greater rights than state law.|$|E
5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E
5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require help or advice, and earlier sources suggest that both help and advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice was treated as if he himself had committed the crime. Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers to be liable. Republican jurists were harder on accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have gone as far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, {{as long as they were}} otherwise lost to the owner.|$|E

5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> combinatorics.|$|E

25|$|It may {{be highly}} desirable, while a {{sensitive}} operation is in progress, {{to have the}} HN conduct distracting operations.

25|$|Voronoff's {{experiments}} {{launched from}} this starting point. He believed glandular transplants would produce more sustained effects <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> injections.

He moved on to transplanting the testicles of executed criminals into millionaires, but, when demand outstripped supply, he turned to using monkey testicle tissue instead.|$|E

25|$|Since most double {{stars are}} true binary stars rather <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> optical doubles (as William Herschel {{had been the}} first to discover), they orbit around one another's {{barycenter}} and slowly change position over the years. Thus Struve made micrometric measurements of 2714 double stars from 1824 to 1837 and published these in his work Stellarum duplicium et multiplicium mensurae micrometricae.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent times}} more {{systematic}} hill lists {{have been produced}} based upon topographical prominence and height, rather <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> visual appeal. Most relevant to Crinkle Crags are the lists of Hewitts and Nuttalls.

25|$|The {{prevailing}} academic opinion {{today is}} that the Israelites were a mixture of peoples predominantly indigenous to Canaan, although an Egyptian matrix of peoples may {{also played a role}} in their ethnogenesis, with an ethnic composition similar to that in Ammon, Edom and Moab, and including Hapiru and Šośu. The defining feature which marked them off from the surrounding societies was a staunch egalitarian organization focused on Yahweh worship, rather <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> kingship.|$|E
25|$|Possibly it was {{recognition}} of services thus rendered by the Jews of Babylonia, {{and by the}} House of David in particular, that induced the Parthian kings to elevate the princes of the Exile, who until then had been little more <b>than</b> <b>mere</b> tax collectors, to the dignity of real princes, called Resh Galuta. Thus, then, the numerous Jewish subjects were provided with a central authority which assured an undisturbed development of their own internal affairs.|$|E
