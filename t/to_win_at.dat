His success resulted in the velodrome for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow being named in his honour.

5|$|The {{draw for}} the semi-finals meant Manchester City played the away leg first in every round, {{this time in}} Germany, where Schalke 04 were the opposition. Manchester City lost the first leg by a single goal. Needing <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>at</b> Maine Road by at least two goals, Manchester City used a very attacking approach. It worked; City led 3–0 at half-time, and won the match 5–1. In the final, City faced Górnik Zabrze of Poland, who had progressed via a coin toss after three matches with AS Roma could not produce a winner in the other semi-final.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes than female ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming {{that there are more}} opportunities for men <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>at</b> the highest level than there are for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's league {{campaign}} {{started on}} 9 August 1997, with an away fixture at Leeds United. The match {{ended in a}} 1–1 draw; Ian Wright scored his first goal of the season, before a mix up in defence meant Leeds striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink equalised for the home team. Two days later, at home to Coventry City, Wright scored both goals in Arsenal's 2–0 win, leaving the striker one goal away from equalling Cliff Bastin's club goalscoring record. Two goals from Dennis Bergkamp and a debut goal by midfielder Marc Overmars, the following week helped Arsenal <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>at</b> Southampton. In spite of Bergkamp scoring a hat-trick against Leicester City, Arsenal drew the match 3–3, having conceded a third in the sixth minute of stoppage time. A further draw at home to rivals Tottenham Hotpsur, for whom defender Sol Campbell particularly impressed, meant Arsenal ended August in fifth position.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the events}} of the summer, Alonso made a {{confident}} start to the season and both his peers and the press praised his strength of character, citing his influence as a factor in the team's strong opening to the season. Alonso's importance to the team was further underlined when he scored the only goal, through a deflection, in a 0–1 victory against Chelsea, making Liverpool the first away team <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>at</b> Stamford Bridge in over four years. Statistical analysis reflected Alonso's good form: on 11 December, figures from Opta Sports revealed that he was the first Premier League player to complete 1,000 successful passes in the season. His last goal for Liverpool came in their 1–3 away win at Hull City on 25 April, striking after his free kick deflected off the Hull wall.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{started his}} {{season at the}} Brisbane International.

In Dubai, Federer successfully defended his title with a straight-set victory over Novak Djokovic in the final, marking his seventh title at the tournament and, after Wimbledon and Halle, was the third time he had won seven or more titles in a tournament. Additionally, Federer became the fourth person since 1991 to surpass 9,000 career aces. In March, he reached the final of the Indian Wells, but lost in three sets to defending champion Djokovic.|$|E

5|$|Federer triumphed in five sets {{despite being}} a break down {{early in the}} {{deciding}} 5th set. This {{was the first time}} Federer won a major since Wimbledon in 2012, the first time he defeated Nadal at a major since the Wimbledon final of 2007, and the first time that Federer defeated Nadal in a Grand Slam match outside the grass courts of Wimbledon. With this win, Federer increased his all-time record to 18 major titles, became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam tournament, at age 35, since Ken Rosewall at the Australian Open in 1972, and became the first ever man <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>at</b> least 5 singles majors in 3 different Grand Slam tournaments each.|$|E

On December 10, 2007, he was featured in a ladder match at the Raw 15th Anniversary against Jeff Hardy for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, which Hardy won. Carlito defeated Cody Rhodes to qualify for the money in the bank ladder match at Wrestlemania 24. He failed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>at</b> the event. Carlito then formed a tag team with Santino Marella. The team was placed in several matches involving the World Tag Team Championship, twice being named the number one contenders; however, they lost the relevant championship matches.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} game of December, Nelson failed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>at</b> Seedhill {{for the first time in}} the season.

After a two-week break from League football because of the FA Cup, Nelson returned to action with a 4–1 home win over Rotherham County in the only match ever played between the two sides at Seedhill. On Christmas Day, half-back Ambrose Harris made his first appearance for Nelson as the side beat Chesterfield 1–0 thanks to Bill Ellerington's first goal for the club. The same team was defeated by the same scoreline the following day in the reverse fixture at Saltergate. Inside forward Arthur Wolstenholme scored the only goal of the match as Nelson recorded their first away victory of the season in the final fixture of 1924.|$|E

The second set which Djokovic won was the only set Nadal lost in the entire championships. This would prove to become the main rivalry in tennis over the next 18 months.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies' loss to Kansas {{lowered its}} bowl winning {{percentage}} since 1993 to 40percent.

Despite the loss to the Jayhawks {{and the loss of}} several graduating players, Virginia Tech was a popular pick to repeat as ACC champions heading into the off-season. The seniors who graduated following the Orange Bowl game were the winningest team in Virginia Tech history, becoming one of just three teams in Division I <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>at</b> least 10 games each of the previous four years. Junior Sean Glennon's second consecutive failure to win a bowl game, however, re-opened the question of whether he or Tyrod Taylor would be the Hokies' starter at quarterback in 2008.|$|E

With threegames remaining in the season, Navy needed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>at</b> least one more to become bowl eligible. Sponsors had arranged for Navy (which was unaffiliated with any college football conference) to play in the Poinsettia Bowl if they won six games.
