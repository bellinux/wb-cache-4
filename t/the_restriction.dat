5|$|Two Air Corps historians {{state that}} no {{evidence}} exists that the Navy {{was behind the}} order. One explained that Craig believed the Air Corps violated War Department policy on publicity, while the second asserted that Craig was unhappy about not being provided details of the mission before it was publicly announced, and thus issued the order to ensure full notification before granting exceptions to <b>the</b> <b>restriction.</b> Deputy chief of staff Embick made the claim that <b>the</b> <b>restriction</b> had been issued only as a safety measure. Greer, however, in his history of Air Corps doctrine, firmly attributes <b>the</b> <b>restriction</b> to the Navy, noting that in November 1938 it achieved a new modification of the Joint Action statement specifically granting it the authorization for long-range land-based flights that the Army was denied, and immediately prepared six major bases to conduct them. A fourth historian, in a biography of Arnold, stated that <b>the</b> <b>restriction</b> had actually been promulgated on 1 September 1936, {{at the insistence of}} the Navy, but was not enforced by Craig until after the Rex incident.|$|E
40|$|Does {{imposing}} no-arbitrage {{help when}} using the term structure to forecast future bond yields or macroeconomic activity? Standard intuition says that if we know <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> are correct, imposing them increases estimation efficiency and forecast accuracy. This paper argues that for affine models, if <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> hold exactly, they must be irrelevant. <b>The</b> <b>restrictions</b> can affect forecasts only if we weaken them by allowing for measurement error in yields. Even in this case, empirical evidence indicates <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> have no practical effect on forecast accuracy. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{are more likely to}} be useful if they are false. Then deviations from <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> can help detect model misspecification...|$|R

5|$|Nucleases are {{enzymes that}} cut DNA strands by catalyzing the {{hydrolysis}} of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from {{the ends of}} DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are <b>the</b> <b>restriction</b> endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of <b>the</b> <b>restriction</b> modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting.|$|E
40|$|Does {{imposing}} no-arbitrage {{help when}} using the term structure to forecast?

This paper argues that something close to the reverse is true, at least in the context of Gaussian models. Imposing <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> does not noticeably increase forecast accuracy when they are true, but examination of no-arbitrage restrictions can help detect misspecification of a broader model that nests <b>the</b> <b>restrictions...</b>|$|R
