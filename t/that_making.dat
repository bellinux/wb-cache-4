5|$|Abramski v.

In the Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a gun for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the gun for himself.|$|E

5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered <b>that</b> <b>making</b> certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E

He has said that song fragments are composed separately, and then the band makes a compact structure from them. Drummer Shawn Drover stated that Mustaine had saved many riffs over the years and that some recent material is based on those demo recordings. Ellefson stated that the band constantly creates new material, and <b>that</b> <b>making</b> a recording begins with exchanging ideas after which the band enters the studio and discusses the concept, direction, artwork, and song titles.

Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt <b>that</b> <b>making</b> him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E
5|$|The church faced {{internal}} {{dissent in}} 1991 over {{its decision to}} publish The Destiny of The Mother Church. Written and privately printed in 1943 by Bliss Knapp, {{former president of the}} Mother Church, the book suggested that Eddy was the Woman of the Apocalypse of the New Testament. Knapp and his family bequeathed $98 million to the church on condition that it publish and authorize the book by 1993; otherwise the money would go to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The church published and made the book available in Christian Science reading rooms. One senior employee was fired for failing to support the church's decision, and 18 of the 21 editorial staff of the religious journals resigned. In the end the other parties disputed <b>that</b> <b>making</b> the book available in Reading Rooms constituted authorization, and the bequest was split three ways.|$|E
5|$|The {{materials}} used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the membrane. Mulberry trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance—instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The Yakuts believe <b>that</b> <b>making</b> drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature.|$|E

5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added <b>that</b> <b>making</b> the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{lasted until}} August 10, 1974 when the players {{returned}} to training camp without a new CBA, instead choosing to pursue free agency through the Mackey lawsuit filed three years before. While the courts {{ruled in favor}} of the players in 1976, the union found <b>that</b> <b>making</b> progress in bargaining was more difficult to achieve. The Rozelle Rule was invalidated by the court which found it constituted a refusal to deal and was therefore in violation of the Sherman Act as it deterred franchises from signing free agents. However, the change did not achieve true free agency as compensation remained tied to draft picks that were awarded based on the salary of the departing free agent and teams still maintained a right of first refusal. The NFL and NFLPA agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in March 1977 that ran until 1982.|$|E
5|$|To {{give each}} world a theme, they were each {{designed}} {{with a particular}} gameplay element in mind. This approach created a structure where players would be introduced to new gameplay mechanics frequently. The intention {{was to keep the}} game engaging and continually expand the depth of gameplay as players progressed through the game. The first stage of each world is designed to be a simple puzzle that teaches players the new mechanic. Initially, the development team were creating large stages that would take a fairly long time to complete. However, they later decided that players should be able to complete them quicker, and thus the level structure was changed and the amount of content per stage was reduced. Story elements were also added to encourage players to keep playing. Creating an intuitive and easy control scheme was an important factor as the development team wanted to ensure that the action of creating boxes was comfortable and fun. The development team had considered implementing a multiplayer mode for BoxBoy!. Utimately, the feature was excluded as they believed <b>that</b> <b>making</b> a fun single-player experience should be the priority.|$|E

5|$|Trainspotting {{director}} Danny Boyle was the producers' {{first choice}} {{to direct the}} film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, {{but he was not}} interested in pursuing the project and went on to make A Life Less Ordinary instead. Peter Jackson was also approached, but declined as he could not get excited about an Alien film. In 1995, after the release of The Usual Suspects, 20th Century Fox approached Bryan Singer to direct. Jean-Pierre Jeunet was asked to direct, as the film's producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to Amélie and was surprised he was offered the job for Alien Resurrection, as he thought the franchise had finished with Alien 3 and believed <b>that</b> <b>making</b> a sequel was a bad idea. Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70 million. He required an interpreter as he did not speak much English when filming began.|$|E
5|$|That {{game was}} Computer Space, {{developed}} by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They {{had found the}} Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered <b>that</b> <b>making</b> a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100. By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed {{for a short time}} in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy. Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation. Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!. Galaxy Games prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{brought forward}} bank statements {{that showed that}} Cisneros withdrew US$5,000 from a US$100,000 family safety deposit box on July 7, 1992 and March 3, 1993, the morning Fischer was killed. The defense stated {{that there was nothing}} illegal about visiting the safety deposit box or making the withdrawal. They stated that the US$5,000 was for a family trip to Mexico. The prosecution suggested that the money was to pay off the murderers, but they were unable to provide evidence linking the two actions. On May 11, the defense introduced two witnesses to rest their case after six days of prosecution arguments. Most of the testimonies from the prosecution that day were done by Garza, who stated that Martínez never mentioned Cisneros's name as the person of who she was working with to have Fischer killed. Garza stated that he consulted Martínez on his marriage, but that she would interrupt to ask him if he had found anyone who was willing to carry out her client's request and hurt Fischer. Garza claimed that he had at least four calls from phone booths in San Fernando and Matamoros, two Mexican cities. The defense stated that Garza told the FBI that he made collect calls, but Garza said they were mistaken. He said <b>that</b> <b>making</b> collect calls from Mexico was difficult, though he did not discard the possibility of having made one to Martínez. The prosecution did not enter evidence showing that Garza made calls from Mexico to the U.S., and one of the defense witness showed that Martínez's phone bill did not have any collect calls from Matamoros. The defense stated that Garza made the claim of the phone calls from Mexico to get a reduced sentence, while Garza responded that he was testifying to make sure everyone involved in the murder gets punished. The defense responded by showing the jury letters from Garza's jail stating {{that he was willing to}} cooperate with the FBI in the trial for a reduced sentence. Garza responded by saying that those letters were written by one of his English-literate inmates on his behalf. The other defense witness was a restaurateur who saw Cisneros a few hours after the murder and recalled seeing her behaving normally.|$|E
