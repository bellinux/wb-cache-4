5|$|A {{securely}} attached toddler will explore freely while <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> departs, and {{happy to see}} <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> departs but ambivalent when <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers {{much the same as}} caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with <b>the</b> <b>caregiver,</b> these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.|$|E
5|$|An infant's {{internal}} working {{model is}} developed {{in response to}} the infant's experience of the outcomes of his or her proximity-seeking behaviors. If <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> is accepting of these proximity-seeking behaviors and grants access, the infant develops a secure organization; if <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> consistently denies the infant access, an avoidant organization develops; and if <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> inconsistently grants access, an ambivalent organization develops.|$|E
5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> departs, and is generally happy to see <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E

50|$|With {{structure}} and advice from St. Camillus, <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> established their own support groups to transfer knowledge among themselves about home care, income-generating activities, and food security. They gathered to discuss difficult issues, share advice; and provide emotional support to each other. The groups prepared status reports, first monthly and then quarterly. The reports {{were used by}} the Centre to share successes and challenges {{and to ensure that}} government and aid groups received the information required for on-going support. <b>The</b> <b>caregivers</b> would use their reports to provide feedback to the Centre and government agencies on their needs, concerns, and recommendations for improvement. The Centre conducted regular site visits to meet with <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> and to meet with village chiefs and leaders as needed, provide follow up training to <b>the</b> <b>caregivers,</b> and to join <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> in visiting OVC and PLWHA to assess how well the programs were meeting their needs. The Centre often included cooking and food preservation demonstrations for the villages so that all could learn important techniques for improving food security and nutritional status.|$|R
5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants {{was in fact a}} mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> and does not feel reassured when <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E

5|$|After {{the second}} year, {{as the child}} begins to see <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> as an {{independent}} person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed. Children begin to notice others' goals and feelings and plan their actions accordingly. For example, whereas babies cry because of pain, two-year-olds cry to summon their caregiver, and if that does not work, cry louder, shout, or follow.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, {{it is clear}} that Seth's mental states (desires, beliefs, etc.) have causal effects on his body and vice versa: A child touches a hot stove (physical event) which causes pain (mental event) and makes her yell (physical event), this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> (mental event), and so on.|$|E
5|$|Insecure {{attachment}} {{styles in}} toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The children may snub the returning caregiver, or {{may go to}} the person but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with <b>the</b> <b>caregiver,</b> but then persistently cling to him/her, and fail {{to return to their}} previous play. These children {{are more likely to have}} later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.|$|E
30|$|About {{one in five}} of <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> {{answered}} {{this question}} affirmatively; they were also asked about the reason for giving this answer, which country they would their children {{like to go to}} and whether formal education was important to work in the particular destination country. The two main reasons they stated were the absence of job opportunities in Moldova and a better way of life abroad. Family reunions were only mentioned by roughly 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> as a reason. In line with the two major migration corridors of Moldova, about 41 % of <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> named Russia as the most preferable destination followed by 20 % who wanted their children to go to Italy. Irrespective of the destination, there was a broad consensus regarding the importance of formal education: 96 % of <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> said that it would be an important requisite for working in the destination country.|$|R

5|$|Social pragmatic theories, also in {{contrast}} to the constraints view, focus on the social context in which the infant is embedded. According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation. Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, body language, gesture, and smile help infants to understand the meanings of words. Social pragmatic theories stress the role of <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E
5|$|A {{small group}} of {{toddlers}} show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E
5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with <b>the</b> <b>caregiver.</b> In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a system with a flexible RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) antenna mat to assist caregivers in a group home. In Japan, a group home {{is a type of}} home-based care service for elderly persons who suffer from dementia. <b>The</b> <b>caregivers</b> working in <b>the</b> group home must always pay attention to such persons. Since the level of dependency of each elderly person is different, <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> must check whether the person requires support or not. However, the checking demands extra efforts on part of <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> in addition to the support tasks. To simplify this task, we introduce a system consisting of RFID antenna sheet sensors and RFID tags embedded in inner shoes or slippers of the elderly persons. The system can assist <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> to monitor <b>the</b> activities of the persons with dementia by specifying whether the person passed through the sheet on the corridor. It not only helps <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> to understand such persons by reviewing their activities but also keeps them informed about the person’s ongoing activities.

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{considerable}} variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies {{have little or no}} evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise obedience and parental control. These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than <b>the</b> <b>caregiver.</b> An estimated six children have died {{as a consequence of the}} more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that eye gaze affects infants’ processing of novel objects. In the current study we address the question whether presenting a highly familiar face vs. a stranger enhances the effects of gaze cues on object processing in 4 -month-olds. Infants were presented pictures of <b>the</b> infant's <b>caregiver</b> and another infant's caregiver (stranger) either turning eye gaze toward an object next to the face or looking away from the object. Then objects were presented again without the face and event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded. An enhanced positive slow wave (PSW) was found for objects that were not cued by <b>the</b> <b>caregiver's</b> eye gaze, indicating that these objects required increased encoding compared to objects that were cued by <b>the</b> <b>caregiver's</b> gaze. When a stranger was presented, a PSW was observed in response to objects regardless of whether the objects were gaze-cued or not. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>caregiver's</b> eye gaze had a larger effect on infants’ object processing than the stranger's gaze. This suggests that at 4 months of age <b>the</b> <b>caregiver's</b> eye gaze is easier to process for infants, more salient, or both. The findings are discussed in terms of early social cognitive development and face processing models...|$|R
