Other characters such as Jane Maxwell, McDullen Harts (called Magdalene Harts in the remake), Emma Hetfield, Mariel, and Zed {{will be able}} to join and the player may switch them into the battlefield. All of the dungeons have completely different puzzles and layouts.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that more <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed {{them to be more}} agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> prey of arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was seen as more <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> simple renaming of an international tendency that was already in existence. It was argued that the Third International had now degenerated completely and was therefore {{to be seen as}} a counter-revolutionary organisation that would in time of crisis defend capitalism. Trotsky believed that the coming World War would produce a revolutionary wave of class and national struggles, rather as World War I had done.|$|E
5|$|The nearby Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel {{is being}} planned to connect northeastern New Jersey and Long Island, with portals in Brooklyn and in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tunnel is being planned {{as a result}} of {{passenger}} and commuter traffic frequencies being at capacity and precluding freight movements. As early as the 1920s, this tunnel had been planned to cross the entire New York Harbor rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> Narrows. As a precursor to the planned project, which could cost up to $11 billion to build, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) compiled a Tier 1 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in November 2014.|$|E

5|$|David's first book, A Book of Mediterranean Food, {{frequently}} {{referred to}} by the abbreviated title of Mediterranean Food, was published by John Lehmann in 1950, only a year after David's first articles had started appearing in British periodicals. The original typescript of the book consisted almost entirely of reused versions of her recent articles. It was submitted to and turned down {{by a series of}} publishers, one of whom told her that it needed something more <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> bare recipes. David took note, and wrote some linking text, interspersing her own brief prose with relevant excerpts {{from a wide range of}} authors known for their writings about the Mediterranean. They included Norman Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Gertrude Stein, D. H. Lawrence, Osbert Sitwell, Compton Mackenzie, Arnold Bennett, Henry James and Théophile Gautier.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} a {{respective}} nation's jury was required to rank every song, except that of their own country. The voting results from each {{member of a}} particular nation's jury were combined to produce an overall ranking from first to last place. Likewise, the televoting results were also interpreted as a full ranking, {{taking into account the}} full televoting result rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> top ten. The combination of the jury's full ranking and the televote's full ranking produced an overall ranking of all competing entries. The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points, while the tenth-best ranked song received 1-point. In the event of a televoting(insufficient amount of votes/technical issues) or jury failure(technical issue/breach of rules), only a jury/televoting was used by each country.|$|E

In May 2016, Johnson confirmed his attachment to The Janson Directive as Paul Janson. The film will be produced by Universal Studios, with the intent to adapt more of Robert Ludlum's work in the future in a larger project <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> announced first installment. Later that same month, it was announced that he would star in Legendary Entertainment's Skyscraper movie which will be an action-thriller film with Rawson Marshall Thurber signed on as director and writer. The same month it was announced that he would star as a rebooted version of the character Doc Savage in a film written and directed by Shane Black. Johnson is {{signed on to}} film a remake of Big Trouble in Little China. In July 2016, Johnson announced another television series which he will be involved in, named Muscle Beach, about the Southern California beach of that name. Johnson will be involved behind the scenes of the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of televoting and jury voting results underwent changes that were detailed {{in the official}} rules for the 2013 contest. Each member of a respective nation's jury was required to rank every song, except that of their own country. The voting results from each member of a particular nation's jury were combined to produce an overall ranking from first to last place. Likewise, the televoting results were also interpreted as a full ranking, {{taking into account the}} full televoting result rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> top ten. The {{combination of}} the jury's full ranking and the televote's full ranking produced an overall ranking of all competing entries. The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points, while the tenth-best ranked song received 1-point. It was announced in the official Media Handbook that an official app would also be available for voters to vote via during the contest.|$|E
5|$|Hastati (singular: Hastatus) were a {{class of}} {{infantry}} employed in the armies of the early Roman Republic who originally fought as spearmen, and later as swordsmen. These soldiers were the staple unit after Rome threw off Etruscan rule. They were originally some of the poorest men in the legion, and could afford only modest equipment—light chainmail and other miscellaneous equipment. The Senate supplied their soldiers with only a short stabbing sword, the gladius, and their distinctive squared shield, the scuta. The hastatus was typically equipped with these, and several soft iron tipped throwing spears called pila. This doubled their effectiveness, {{not only as a}} strong leading edge to their maniple, but also as a stand-alone missile troop. Later, the hastati contained the younger men rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> poorer, though most men of their age were relatively poor. Their usual position was the first battle line. They fought in a quincunx formation, supported by lighter infantry. The enemy was allowed to penetrate the first battle line consisting of hastati, after which the enemy would deal with the more hardened, seasoned soldiers, the principes. They were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms of 107 BC.|$|E
5|$|The third era {{deviates}} {{from the}} original plot considerably. When Lara was young she travelled with her parents on many of their archaeological expeditions which helped to shape the woman she was becoming. It was {{on one of these}} expeditions that her mother vanished and was presumed dead and a few years later her father presumably took his own life, she was then left in the care of Conrad Roth. Even though she was left with a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London. This decision required her to pay her tuition and rent by working many jobs. Though this was a much tougher choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been. She also ended up meeting her best friend, Samantha Nishimura, during her time at UCL. It was because of Sam's free spirit and wild streak that Lara was able to experience much more of London <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> universities and museums that she loved so much. After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end up on an expedition to the Dragon's Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilisation of Yamatai. It is on this expedition that Lara is stranded on a remote island full of natural, human and supernatural dangers, which enables her to develop from a vulnerable girl to a survivor. And after experiencing the supernatural powers of the ancient world, she comes to realise her father was right about his theories and her hunger for adventure awakens.|$|E

25|$|Although Jean-Jacques Rousseau is {{associated}} with very different political ideas, {{it is important to}} view Machiavelli's work from different points of view rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> traditional notion.
