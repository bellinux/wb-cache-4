40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out, {{measuring}} the degree of the fibre fineness and its variability of the shoulder, thigh and <b>tail</b> <b>wool,</b> and analysing the correlations {{of the degree of}} the fiber fineness and its variability between the tail and shoulder and thigh wool in lamb's docking time of the Corriedale sheep, with the object of determining whether the degree of the fibre fineness and its variability over the fleece of the adult sheep can be predicted and so whether the sheep uniform in the degree of the fibre fineness over the fleece can be selected, by discrimirating macrcscopically the degree of the fiber finenes and its variability of the <b>tail</b> <b>wool</b> in the early age of lamb. A total of 12 Corriedale lambs was used in this study. A few staples on the threes body regions were cut from each lamb on the day of docking, and the wool samples to be examined were taken from these staples. The samples were washed by immersing them in bath of ether, and were then mounted with balsam, and microscopically examined. The diameters of the wool fibres were subsepuently measured with an ocular, micrometer and then the coefficients of variation of the degree of the fibre fineness were calculated. The results obtained are as follows; 1. In general, the mean diameter of the <b>tail</b> <b>wool</b> was greater than those of the shoulder and thigh wool in such early age as in dccking time of the Corriedale lamb. 2. In the early age of lamb, relatively high positive correlations of the degree of fibre finenss between the tail and shoulder and thigh wool were found and thus, {{it can be said that}} more the mean diameter of the tall wool greater, the more those of the shoulder and thigh wool greater. 3. Positive correlations of the variability of the degree of the fibre fineness were found between the tail and the shoulder and thigh wool, and especially between the tail and thigh wool, a high correlation of the variability of the degree of the fiber fineness was found. So it may be concluded that generally the more the variability of the degree of the fibre fineness of the <b>tail</b> <b>wool</b> greater, the more those of the shoulder and thigh wool greater, especially the variability of the degree of the fibre fineness of the thigh wool greater. 4. It seems that the degree of the fiber fineness and its variability of the adult fleece can be predicted, and a selection of the sheep uniform in the degree of the fibre fineness over the fleece can be made by discriminating macroscopically the degree of the fibre fineness and its variability in the early age of lamb of the corriedale sheep. The auther is grateful to the Tsuyama livestock farm of the Okayanma prefecture, for their help and for providing all the wool samples tested...|$|E

The wool was traditionally used for handicrafts and the pelts were used for woolskin rugs. [...] The adult live weight of ewes is between 70 and 80 kg. The mean litter size is 1.8 lambs born per year. Lambs are generally slaughtered at 6 months age (30 to 40 kg live weight).|$|R
5|$|In Ethiopia, {{there are}} several {{varieties}} of sheep landrace. Attempts {{have been made to}} classify the sheep based on factors such as <b>tail</b> shape and <b>wool</b> type, and H. Epstein made an attempt at classifying them this way by dividing the breeds into 14 types based on those two factors. However, in 2002, further genetic analysis revealed that there are only four distinct varieties of Ethiopian sheep: short-fat-tailed, long-fat-tailed, fat-rumped, and thin-tailed.|$|R
5000|$|... coils - These {{are used}} for AVF, aneurysms, or trauma. They are very good for fast-flowing vessels because they {{immediately}} clot the vessel. They are made from platinum or stainless steel. They induce clots due to the Dacron <b>wool</b> <b>tails</b> around the wire. The coil itself will not cause mechanical occlusion. Since it is made of metal, it is easily seen in radiographic images. The disadvantage is that large coils can disrupt the radiographic image. The coil may also lose its shape if the catheter is kinked. Also, {{there is a small}} risk of dislodging from the deployed location.|$|R
40|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) in pet dogsand cats {{is usually}} recognized {{because of a}} com-pulsive component (ritualistic, stereotypic behaviors). Obsessive-compulsive behaviors in dogs can include those characterized by circling, tail chasing, flank suck-ing (particularly in Doberman Pinschers), fence run-ning, fly biting, self mutilation, hair or air biting, pica, pacing or spinning, staring and vocalizing, some aggres-sions, self-directed vocalizing, and fabric sucking or chewing. In cats, self-mutilation, excessive grooming, <b>tail</b> chasing, and <b>wool</b> or fabric sucking or chewing are also signs of OCD. 1 - 6 Because behaviors seen in OCD are often normal behaviors performed in an inappropriate, excessive, or out-of-context manner, 7, 8 history becomes particularly important in elucidating whether the patient truly has OCD.

40|$|A genetic {{solution}} to breech strike control is attractive, {{as it is}} potentially permanent, cumulative, would not involve increased use of chemicals and may ultimately reduce labour inputs. There appears to be significant opportunity to reduce the susceptibility of Merinos to breech strike by genetic means although {{it is unlikely that}} in the short term breeding alone will be able to confer the degree of protection provided by mulesing and tail docking. Breeding programmes that aim to replace surgical techniques of flystrike prevention could potentially: reduce breech wrinkle; increase the area of bare skin in the perineal area; reduce <b>tail</b> length and <b>wool</b> cover on and near the tail; increase shedding of breech wool; reduce susceptibility to internal parasites and diarrhoea; and increase immunological resistance to flystrike. The likely effectiveness of these approaches is reviewed and assessed here. Any breeding programme that seeks to replace surgical mulesing and tail docking will need to make sheep sufficiently resistant that the increased requirement for other strike management procedures remains within practically acceptable bounds and that levels of strike can be contained to ethically acceptable levels...|$|R
