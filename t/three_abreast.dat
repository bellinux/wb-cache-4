5|$|Union troops retreated in {{different}} states of order. The brigades on Seminary Ridge {{were said to}} move deliberately and slowly, keeping in control, although Col. Wainwright's artillery was not informed of the order to retreat and found themselves alone. When Wainwright realized his situation, he ordered his gun crews to withdraw at a walk, not wishing to panic the infantry and start a rout. As pressure eventually increased, Wainwright ordered his 17 remaining guns to gallop down Chambersburg Street, <b>three</b> <b>abreast.</b> A.P. Hill failed to commit any of his reserves {{to the pursuit of}} the Seminary defenders, a great missed opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Earnhardt {{moved back}} into the lead on lap 68, when Vickers' right-front tire blew in the tri-oval on the same lap, {{starting}} a multi-car accident involving Gilliland, Truex, Kahne, Skinner, McMurray, Terry Labonte, Raines and Almirola. A fourth caution was triggered initially because of the accident before a red-flag was shown shortly afterward to stop the race to allow officials to clear the track of debris. The race resumed seventeen minutes later as the field elected to make pit stops. Earnhardt led on the lap-72 restart, followed by Menard, Burton, Harvick and Montoya. By lap 74, Montoya had the lead before Hamlin passed him at the start-finish line to lead the lap. Johnson moved {{to the front of}} the field two laps later, before losing the lead to teammate Earnhardt on lap 78 as the pack ran <b>three</b> <b>abreast</b> at the start-finish line.|$|E
5|$|Hamlin was {{extracted}} from his car, {{and placed on}} a stretcher and transported to a local hospital for further evaluation. Riggs led the field back up to speed at the restart on lap 104, ahead of Menard. On the following lap, Riggs lost the draft allowing Menard {{to move into the}} lead. The field went <b>three</b> <b>abreast,</b> as Menard lost the lead to Stewart on the 107th lap, but Menard reclaimed the position one lap later. Stewart retook the lead on lap 112 after he received assistance from Montoya. Burton challenged Stewart for the lead on lap 115 as both drivers ran side-by-side at the start-finish line, before Burton moved in front of Stewart two laps later. Harvick moved back into the lead on lap 120, after running on the inside lane. Harvick, Ragan and Stewart formed a single line, {{as the rest of the}} field ran in double-file.|$|E
60|$|The carriage, {{which was}} drawn by <b>three</b> horses <b>abreast,</b> went on very rapidly through these scenes--so rapidly, in fact, that Mrs. Gray had not {{time to look}} at the various groups as much as she wished.|$|R
5000|$|Troika: a sleigh {{drawn by}} <b>three</b> horses {{harnessed}} <b>abreast.</b> Occasionally, a similar wheeled vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The 1953 Clipper was {{an attempt}} {{to cash in on the}} era's burgeoning microcar market. A tiny glass-fibre-bodied car powered by a {{rear-mounted}} 346 cc Villiers twin-cylinder motorcycle engine, it claimed to seat <b>three</b> people <b>abreast</b> with room for two children in an optional Dicky seat. About 20 were made.|$|R
5|$|Jamie McMurray {{took the}} lead by the 53rd lap, when a third caution was {{deployed}} after Reutimann's right-rear tire blew on the backstretch, causing Gordon to take evasive action by turning right and heavily damaged the nose of his car when he collided with the outside wall. Reutimann's tire broke Johnson's front splitter brace. All drivers, including McMurray, chose to make pit stops. Vickers elected {{to stay on the}} track and led the field at the restart on lap 58, ahead of Kvapil and Skinner. Two laps later, Hamlin used the draft to take over the lead, with Labonte moving into second. Kahne used the outside lane to claim first position, before Reed Sorenson also drove on the outside lane to claim first place on the next lap. The pack drove <b>three</b> <b>abreast</b> on lap 63, as Truex moved into first place on the 64th lap. McMurray reclaimed the first position when he got ahead of Truex at the start-finish line on lap 65, and Kahne dropped to 26th position by the same lap. Truex re{{took the lead}} from McMurray {{at the start of the}} following lap, and Harvick moved into first on lap 67.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} Nato, Haryanto and Binder went <b>three</b> <b>abreast</b> at the Casino hairpin {{which saw}} Haryanto squeezed wide at the corner's exit by Nato and {{was unable to}} leave the turn, causing a brief usage of the VSC to allow the three cars to be extracted from the circuit by a trackside crane. Nato was able to continue but made a pit stop for repairs and was issued with a ten-second time penalty because he was judged to have caused the collision. The race resumed on the second lap with Stanaway leading Maricello and Sirotkin. Stanaway pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Leal was overtaken for fourth place by Canamasas at Sainte Dévote on the seventh lap's start and narrowly made the corner. Stanaway led the field by three seconds at the race's mid-way point while Maricello was two seconds in front of Sirotkin. Stanaway's team cautioned him about the possibility of his tyres degrading if he continued to push hard. Few overtaking manoeuvres took place as the field spread out. Rossi and Vandoorne intentionally fell back from the leaders and both drivers started to record fastest lap times in an effort of earning the accolade of one point for setting the event's fastest lap. Vandoorne temporarily claimed the award with a lap time of one minute and 21.926 seconds, before Nato gained the accolade on the 30th lap with a time of one minute and 21.886 seconds.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1945, ten B-25Js led by Col. Hawes {{attacked}} the Japanese aircraft carrier Kaiyo (海鷹), beached in Beppu Bay on Kyushu. Flying <b>three</b> <b>abreast</b> at low level through a thick haze, six of the ten aircraft struck the carrier with five 1000-pound delayed-action demolition bombs. Hawes and his crew were killed when a wingtip of their bomber struck a tree, then the carrier itself, and crashed beside the ship after releasing its bombs. Hawes' Mitchell was the last lost by the group during World War II.|$|E
50|$|By 1959 the Eshelman company, now {{renamed the}} Eshelman Motors Corporation, {{introduced}} {{a trio of}} much larger $1,395 two-cylinder air-cooled closed models, the fiberglass-bodied Models 902 delivery vehicle, 903 coupe and 904 pickup truck, all advertised as seating <b>three</b> passengers <b>abreast.</b> However, according to reports only about twelve or so were produced.|$|R

"Halket-head!--the tide will {{be running}} on Halket-head by this time like the Fall of Fyers!--it was a' I could do to get round it twenty minutes since--it was coming in <b>three</b> feet <b>abreast.</b> We will maybe get back by Bally-burgh Ness Point yet. The Lord help us!--it's our only chance. We can but try." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 1 June, Volckmann {{started his}} renewed attack with <b>three</b> regiments <b>abreast.</b> They cleared the Lamagan and Lower Cadsu Ridges by 5 June. Magun Hill was {{captured}} by 10 June, and the Upper Cadsu Ridge was taken by 12 June. On 10 June, the units of 121st launched a final assault and by 14 June, the [...] "last opposition melted away". Cervantes was secured by 15 June.|$|R
25|$|The service ran at a {{loss and}} had been {{supported}} by government subsidies until these were abolished for all long-distance passenger trains in 1989. New Zealand Rail changed the seating configuration by replacing the very generous seat pitch <b>three</b> <b>abreast</b> configuration with a more standard four abreast, with reduced (but still generous compared to bus) seat pitch. The full service buffet car was replaced with a buffet servery. Both measures reduced costs significantly, but the service was challenged by {{the increasing number of}} low-cost shuttle bus services, particularly between Christchurch and Dunedin, which were significantly cheaper than the train. Nonetheless, the Southerner still operated seven days a week, one service each way.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} marching from Melville Barracks to the Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham, {{to attend a}} boxing tournament. It was divided into three platoons; the rear platoon {{consisted}} of new recruits {{who had not yet}} received uniforms. They were generally under the command of cadet non-commissioned officers (NCOs); the only adult present was the contingent adjutant, Lieutenant Clarence Murrayfield Carter, a regular Royal Marines officer. The column was about fifteen yards long and was marching <b>three</b> <b>abreast</b> on the left-hand side of the road. It was showing no lights, there being no official requirement to do so, and the boys in uniform were wearing Royal Marines standard-issue dark blue battledress and berets, although they had white belts and white lanyards on their shoulders.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandatory}} virtual pit stops, {{during which}} all drivers {{need to change}} into a second car, started {{at the end of}} lap seven when Bird entered the pit lane. Pahkala opted to bow out of a multi-car battle with Uusi-Jaakkola, Greco and Graham Carroll for third place {{at the end of the}} next lap to make his mandatory stop. Pahkala left with a clear track ahead of him, and since no other driver was close enough to impede his progress, he recorded a series of quick lap times. On the tenth lap, Graham Carroll got a run on Uusi-Jaakola leaving the final corner and steered onto the inside line heading towards the first turn. Greco made it <b>three</b> <b>abreast</b> on the outside with him and Uusi-Jaakola making contact and the latter touched Graham Carroll's left-rear wheel. Two of the cars barrel rolled through the trackside catch fencing and some palm trees. The cars glitched quickly and re-rendered themselves back onto the circuit. Uusi-Jaakola and Greco had each lost one of their wheels and fell down the running order. As the eRace progressed, race leader Huis made an error, allowing Rosenqvist to close to within less than two seconds of him.|$|E
60|$|Olsen {{had sent}} <b>three</b> mowers <b>abreast</b> {{down the whole}} length of the barley-field before the fire reached that line. It was a wise move, and if {{anything}} could do so it would save the day. The leaping flame, thin and high, and a mile long, curled down {{the last of the}} standing wheat and caught the fallen barley. But here its speed was checked. It had to lick a way along the ground.|$|R
50|$|As Brenier's men {{had gotten}} {{lost in the}} hills, Solignac {{attacked}} the northeast ridge. This brigade changed tactics deploying in an attack formation with <b>three</b> battalions <b>abreast.</b> Even so, each battalion formed a column one company wide and eight companies deep. If the French intended to form into line once the enemy position was detected, they waited too long. They marched into the kill zone of Nightingall and Fergusson's brigades before they could deploy. Smashed by British volleys, Solignac's men fled.|$|R
5000|$|Vehicles {{pulled by}} one animal (or by animals in tandem - single file) have two shafts which attach {{either side of}} the {{rearmost}} animal (the wheel animal or wheeler). Vehicles which are pulled by a pair (or by a team of several pairs) have a pole which attaches between the wheel pair. Other arrangements are also possible, for example <b>three</b> or more <b>abreast</b> (a troika), a wheel pair with a single lead animal (a [...] "unicorn"), or a wheel pair with <b>three</b> lead animals <b>abreast</b> (a [...] "pickaxe"). Very heavy loads sometimes had an additional team behind to slow the vehicle down steep hills. Sometimes at a steep hill with frequent traffic such a team would be hired to passing wagons to help them up or down the hill.|$|R
500|$|The 19 {{drivers who}} survived the crash scene {{returned}} to their cars, and every crew member stood silently in their pit boxes. [...] The scoring pylon was blanked except for the top position, where the No. 77 was displayed. The remaining cars lined up <b>three</b> <b>abreast</b> on pit road, as in the Indy 500 starting formation, with Kanaan, Ed Carpenter in the No. 67 Dallara, and Ryan Briscoe in the Dallara leading. Out of respect for Wheldon's death, the No. 98 Dallara fielded by Bryan Herta Autosport was parked. The car was driven to victory in Indianapolis by Wheldon and its driver on this day, Alex Tagliani, normally drove the No. 77 car that Wheldon had taken over ...|$|E
500|$|Dunstan {{subsequently}} {{directed the}} clearance of the bunker system {{that had been}} located the previous day, and a combined force of D Company, 1 RAR and 1 Troop C Squadron {{under the command of}} Major Tony Hammett was tasked with carrying out a reconnaissance-in-force. Departing at 06:00 {{on the morning of the}} 26 May, the lead Australian infantry platoon was contacted at 12:27 by small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades [...] from Coral, after having paused to direct an air strike by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron RAAF onto a nearby bunker system. In what would become the first Australian combined infantry and tank assault since the Bougainville campaign against the Japanese in the Second World War, the tanks were called forward and attacked the bunkers with anti-tank solid shot and machine-guns, while the infantry indicated targets with their M79 grenade launchers. Moving forward two or <b>three</b> <b>abreast,</b> the Centurions crushed many of the bunkers with their tracks and engaged others at point-blank range with their main armament. Further bunkers were exposed when the foliage was cut away by canister rounds and the infantry followed the tanks using rifles and grenades, while assault pioneers provided support with a flame-thrower as artillery and mortar fire engaged depth targets.|$|E
500|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Junqueira felt {{he could}} have won the race had a caution flag not been displayed. Franchitti was disappointed not to finish: [...] "It's such a shame because I really think we had {{a shot at the}} million dollars. We weren't really stretching the engine, either. We were just cruising along. We didn't want to lead the thing because of fuel consumption. We were running in the draft, looking real good." [...] Despite his crash on lap 196, Fernández was pleased with his car as he felt comfortable driving along the race track: [...] "We were having a great race. This {{was one of the best}} cars I have had at a superspeedway." [...] Bräck stated his car experienced oversteer while driving alongside other competitors but felt his car ran efficiently. Tracy said his engine failure was a [...] "disappointment" [...] for his team and felt he had a car that could win the race. He said the event summed up a [...] "season of frustration" [...] but affirmed that his team would refocus and prepare for 2002. Autosport described it as similar to [...] "a NASCAR restrictor plate race" [...] because the cars often drove two or <b>three</b> <b>abreast</b> while racing in packs.|$|E
5000|$|Six Kiran trainer jets streak barely 50 metres {{above the}} ground in an {{arrowhead}} formation.

5000|$|Philip {{assembled}} {{his army}} in traditional feudal fashion: <b>three</b> battles <b>abreast.</b> He himself commanded the right, while the centre {{was under the}} command of the marshal, Broglio dei Bonsi, and the left Thomas II Sanseverino, count of Marsico. Frederick too followed typical medieval tactics and aligned his forces in three columns side-by-side. Frederick commanded his own centre, composed entirely of infantry. The left he put under command of Blasco I of Alagona, with a little cavalry and some Almogàvers. The right was composed mainly of cavalry under the direction of Frederick's premier vassals, the victors of Montaperti.|$|R
60|$|Betimes in {{the morning}} the Exhibition omnibuses begin to trundle along, and pass at {{intervals}} of two and a half minutes through the day,--immense vehicles constructed to carry thirty-nine passengers, and generally with a good part of that number inside and out. The omnibuses are painted scarlet, bordered with white, have <b>three</b> horses <b>abreast,</b> and a conductor in a red coat. They perform the journey from this point into town in about half an hour; and yesterday morning, being {{in a hurry to get}} to the railway station, I found that I could outwalk them, taking into account their frequent stoppages.|$|R
2500|$|Building the Canadian Shield leg {{required}} continual blasting. For one [...] stretch, {{the construction}} crew drilled [...] holes into the rock, <b>three</b> <b>abreast,</b> at 56-centimetre intervals. Dynamite broke up other stretches, [...] at a time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design was}} a four-engine high-wing {{monoplane}} with tricycle undercarriage, originally designed for 14 (<b>three</b> <b>abreast</b> seating with six additional seats {{mounted on the}} side) and eventually converted to take 20 passengers. The side [...] "couch seats" [...] were also able to be folded away so that cargo could be carried internally in the cabin. Individual storage space was provided for each passenger seat on the fuselage side above the seat. In order to accommodate a larger cargo load, a cargo hatch was located near the pilot's compartment.|$|E
2500|$|The second race {{started at}} 16:00 local time. Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the race were dry and sunny with an air temperature between [...] and a track temperature ranging from [...] When the second race began, Rosenqvist maintained his pole position advantage going into the first turn. Buemi, behind remained in second position. Both Virgin cars of López and Bird drove alongside each other entering the first corner but López fended off his teammate to keep third place. Rosenqvist managed to build a healthy lead over Buemi by the time they exited the turn three chicane. As the field went <b>three</b> <b>abreast,</b> Engel attempted to pass Duval around the outside at turn six but was unsighted by the Dragon vehicle and the two cars collided. Sections of Engel's front suspension were bent and made an unscheduled pit stop for car repairs. Heidfeld made the best start in the field, moving up five positions by the end of the first lap, while Duval lost nine places over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, Rosenqvist led Buemi by two seconds, who was followed in turn by López, Bird, Vergne, Turvey, di Grassi, Abt, Prost, Evans, d'Ambrosio, Félix da Costa, Frijns, Carroll, Piquet, Heidfeld, Dillmann, Sarrazin, Duval and Engel.|$|E

5000|$|A troika (тройка, [...] "triplet" [...] or [...] "trio") is a {{traditional}} Russian harness driving combination, using <b>three</b> horses <b>abreast,</b> usually pulling a sleigh. It differs from most other three-horse combinations in that the horses are harnessed abreast. The middle horse is usually harnessed in a horse collar and shaft bow; the side horses are usually in breastcollar harness. The troika is traditionally driven so that the middle horse trots and the side horses canter; the right-hand horse {{will be on the}} right lead and the left-hand horse on the left lead. The troika is often claimed to be the world's only harness combination with different gaits of the horses.|$|R

This was commanded by a tutor. A governess and two young daughters then advanced; {{and then came the}} extreme rear, the sutlers of the camp, in the persons of two footmen in rich liveries, who each bore a basket on his arm, filled with various fancy articles, which had been all purchased during the promenade of this nation through only part of the bazaar.|$|R
