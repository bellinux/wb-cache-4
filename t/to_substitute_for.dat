5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were made}} to take Jason away from Crystal Lake and place him in a larger {{environment}} for the eighth film. New York City {{was selected as the}} main setting, with Jason spending approximately a third of the movie on a boat before reaching New York. The film was then subtitled Jason Takes Manhattan. Ultimately, the character spent the majority of the time on the cruise ship, as budget restrictions forced scenes of New York to be trimmed or downgraded. Vancouver had <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> the majority of the New York scenes.|$|E
5|$|Andy and Angela play Mad Libs, a phrasal {{template}} word {{game where}} one player prompts another {{for a list}} of words <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> blanks in a story, usually with funny results. Ryan chides Jim for being a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, a professional American football team. While Daryl is telling Michael how gang members deal with problems, he mentions that {{he was a member of}} the Newsies (the name of a 1992 musical drama) and The Warriors (the gang in the 1979 cult action film of the same name). Near the end of the episode, Michael does a succession of comedian impressions. These include badly performed spoofs of Rodney Dangerfield, Henny Youngman, Jeff Foxworthy, Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat, and Jerry Seinfeld.|$|E

30|$|The second market force relates <b>to</b> <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> products. As the {{chemical}} industry is mainly driven by economies of scale for basic chemicals and by economies of scope in the specialty chemicals business, <b>substitutes</b> seem <b>to</b> be rather unlikely. However, the rise of non-oil raw materials might lead to new products, which could serve as <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> existing products.|$|R
50|$|Another {{striking}} point of overcrowding model is productivity. Since {{women in the}} F jobs cost less, it is rational <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> labor <b>for</b> capital. On the contrary, it is rational <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> capital <b>for</b> labor in the M jobs. Therefore, overcrowding causes wage differentials and it makes women less productive although they were potentially equally productive initially.|$|R
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, and {{ingestion}} {{may lead}} to acute lead poisoning, as is applicable for all soluble lead compounds. All inorganic lead compounds are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as probably carcinogenic to humans (Category2A). They {{have been linked to}} renal cancer and glioma in experimental animals and to renal cancer, brain cancer and lung cancer in humans, although studies of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to arsenic. Lead is known <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> zinc in a number of enzymes, including δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (porphobilinogen synthase) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase, important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 1861, Crittenden {{tried to}} salvage his plan by recommending {{to the full}} Senate that it be {{submitted}} {{to the people in}} referendum. It was widely believed that a referendum would recommend adoption of Crittenden's plan, and Republicans in Congress used a variety of procedures to prevent a vote on allowing it. On January 16, with procedural delays exhausted, New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark moved <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> Crittenden's plan a resolution stating that constitutional amendments were unnecessary to preserve the Union, and that enforcement of the Constitution and the present laws would eliminate the need for special sectional guarantees. With the senators from southern states (both those that had seceded and those that had not) refusing to vote, Republicans were left with a majority in the chamber and passed Clark's substitute resolution, effectively killing Crittenden's proposal.|$|E
5|$|Set in the People's Republic of China {{during the}} 1990s, the film {{centers on a}} 13-year-old {{substitute}} teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese countryside. Called in <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> a village teacher for one month, Wei is told not to lose any students. When {{one of the boys}} takes off in search of work in the big city, she goes looking for him. The film addresses education reform in China, the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.|$|E

5|$|Squidward gets a {{call from}} his former high school classmate, Squilliam Fancyson, who is very {{successful}} and has succeeded in everything in which Squidward has failed, such as music. Squilliam reveals to Squidward that he has become {{the leader of a}} band and that they are supposed to play at the Bubble Bowl; but he will be busy at that time and {{will not be able to}} attend so Squilliam asks Squidward to allow his band <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> his at the Bubble Bowl, believing that Squidward does not have one. However, Squidward insists that he has a band and accepts the offer. He assembles a large marching band composed of various Bikini Bottom residents.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen-year-old Wei Minzhi {{arrives in}} Shuiquan village <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> the village's only teacher (Gao Enman) while {{he takes a}} month's leave to care for his ill mother. When Gao discovers that Wei {{does not have a}} high school {{education}} and has no special talents, he instructs her to teach by copying his texts onto the board and then making the students copy them into their notebooks; he also tells her not to use more than one piece of chalk per day, because the village is too poor to afford more. Before leaving, he explains to her that many students have recently left school to find work in the cities, and he offers her a 10 yuan bonus if all the students are still there when he returns.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's first {{preseason game}} {{was a victory}} over the Bills in Akron. The Browns scored three touchdowns in the first quarter, first on an {{interception}} return by Cliff Lewis and then {{on a pair of}} passes from quarterback Otto Graham to Dean Sensanbaugher and Mac Speedie. Sensanbaugher scored another touchdown in the second quarter on a pass from Lewis, who came in <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> Graham. By the time fullback Marion Motley ran for a short touchdown in the third quarter to make the score 35–0, coach Paul Brown had pulled most of the team's starters. Buffalo proceeded to mount a comeback, scoring one touchdown in the third quarter and two in the fourth. Buffalo's final score came on a punt return received by Rex Bumgardner. As he was about to be tackled at the Cleveland 20-yard line, Bumgardner pitched the ball to teammate Bill Heywood, who ran {{the rest of the way}} for the touchdown. Cleveland and Buffalo both had 12 first downs and 206 yards of rushing, but the Browns had 159 yards of passing to Buffalo's 127, helping secure the 35–21 win.|$|E

5|$|Narayan {{moved to}} Mysore {{to live with}} his family when his father was {{transferred}} to the Maharajah's College High School. The well-stocked library at the school, as well as his father's own, fed his reading habit, and he started writing as well. After completing high school, Narayan failed the university entrance examination and spent a year at home reading and writing; he subsequently passed the examination in 1926 and joined Maharaja College of Mysore. It took Narayan four years to obtain his bachelor's degree, a year longer than usual. After being persuaded by a friend that taking a master's degree (M.A.) would kill his interest in literature, he briefly held a job as a school teacher; however, he quit in protest when the headmaster of the school asked him <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> the physical training master. The experience made Narayan realise that the only career for him was in writing, and he decided to stay at home and write novels. His first published work was a book review of Development of Maritime Laws of 17th-Century England. Subsequently, he started writing the occasional local interest story for English newspapers and magazines. Although the writing did not pay much (his income for the first year was nine rupees and twelve annas), he had a regular life and few needs, and his family and friends respected and supported his unorthodox choice of career. In 1930, Narayan wrote his first novel, Swami and Friends, an effort ridiculed by his uncle and rejected by a string of publishers. With this book, Narayan created Malgudi, a town that creatively reproduced the social sphere of the country; while it ignored the limits imposed by colonial rule, it also grew with the various socio-political changes of British and post-independence India.|$|E

25|$|At Shanghai, the new missionaries first {{needed to}} learn the local Wu dialect, as well as Mandarin and the {{literary}} Wen-Li language. They soon learned that of the about twenty missionaries who had traveled to Shanghai to work under Bishop Boone since 1845, only about half remained—many experienced health problems, {{as well as the}} strains of cultural adjustment and physical dangers. Soon, they were able <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> the British chaplain who assisted foreign sailors, and by December Williams could read prayers in Chinese well enough <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> the bishop. Bishop Boone ordained both Williams and Liggins to the priesthood on 11 January 1857. They soon began making missionary journeys to various cities in the Yangtze River delta from their Shanghai base.|$|E

25|$|The {{rivalry between}} the two actresses is cited as an {{alternative}} to the Martina Lawrence-Elizabeth Bergner origin of Mary Orr's short story, The Wisdom of Eve (1946), the basis of the 1950 film All About Eve. Broadway legend had it that Bankhead was being victimized by Scott, who was supposedly the real-life Eve Harrington. During her eight months as the understudy, Scott never had an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> Bankhead, as Scott's presence guaranteed Bankhead's.|$|E
25|$|Other {{research}} findings report {{a projection of}} opposite trend. Although the demand for nurses continues to increase, the rate of employment has slowed down since 1994 because hospitals were incorporating more less-skilled nursing personnel <b>to</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> nurses. With the decrease in employment, the earnings for nurses decreased. Wage among nurses leveled off in correlation with inflation between 1990 and 1994. The recent economic crisis of 2009 has further decreased the demand for RNs.|$|E
