40|$|The Mexican artists Nahum B. Zenil and Julio Galán {{have become}} <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> being gay and Mexican in {{contemporary}} art criticism. Critics have drawn comparisons between Zenil and Galán {{because of their}} thematic treatment of gay sexuality and Mexican nationalism. These comparisons, however, have often assumed that Zenil and Galán are representing a monolithic gay sexuality that is unaffected by their social class, their relationships to nationalism and Catholicism, and {{their views on the}} role of art in social activism. This paper aims to analyze specifically how Zenil and Galán represent two distinct gay identities, all the while employing the similar themes of suffering, the vulnerability of the gay male body, and the use of nationalist and Catholic symbols. Through a close reading of visual texts and the methodological lens of queer theory and art history, the paper will show that both artists represent homosexuality as a social construction that is influenced by the other identity categories the artists inhabit...|$|R

Any attempt to narrowly define statistics (it is estimation, it is prediction, it is decision theory, it is model selection) is doomed. But I will not be going too far {{out on a limb}} to state that one major theme of classical statistics is significance testing, that is, deciding whether what is seen is real or merely a chance occurrence. Even a fair coin is unlikely to land heads exactly 50 times in 100 flips.

The canonical “pure ” randomization situation starts with a number of people, and randomly assigns half to receive a drug, and half to receive a placebo.

The question is whether, assuming the null hypothesis is true, the observed test statistic looks extreme enough to cause one t...|$|R
5|$|After {{the release}} of Red Letter Day, Dewees became a {{full-time}} member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, Vagrant Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund {{the production of the}} album. On September 21, 1999, the band released Something to Write Home About on Vagrant Records. The album's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. Something to Write Home About has been singled out as the band's only 'true' emo album, as the album's aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre. Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie labels in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> emo, but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene's DIY ethic.|$|R

In particular, this paper examines the ways that Eminem’s status as a white man who has achieved both critical and commercial success within a predominantly black cultural idiom serves to challenge dominant social constructions of race in the US by de- and re-constructing popular understandings of both whiteness and blackness...|$|R
40|$|Marked by a {{sense of}} rupture and discontinuity, the post-war {{generation}} of Turkey yearned for a sense of belonging and legacy. Atatürk, whose name literally means 'Father of the Turks', gave them all and more. Turks became the heirs of a future that was difficult to foresee but was painted for them in the most vivid colours. Women were Atatürk's passion and the true force majeure of his reforms. They became <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> his reforms at home and gave him cult status abroad. After a failed marriage to Latife Hanoum, the adoption and education of young girls became Atatürk's obsession. It is through the memoirs, letter and interviews of Afet Inan, Sabiha Gökçen and Ülkü Adatepe, that we get the most intimate glimpse into the private quarters of Kemal Mustafa Atatürk. Theirs were lives purposely lived {{out in front of the}} eyes of a nation which struggled and dreamt of a better future, much as they did. At the roots of their - and the nation's - memory lay rupture. At once rejecting their own familial past and choosing orphanhood, their political birth coincided with Atatürk's appearance in their lives - much like the rest of Turkey. My essay takes us onto a time travel into the flamboyant houses of Turkey's founder and first president, Kemal Mustafa Atatürk and challenges us to rethink our notion of Turkey as a nation caught between East and West, when it actually was, and remains to be, a country looking for its past in an uncertain future...|$|R

5000|$|In 1972, then-news {{director}} Ernie Schultz hired Pam Henry as {{the first}} female news reporter on Oklahoma television, later becoming the state's first female anchor. Henry worked in television news for 30 years, despite walking on crutches due to having contracted polio at 14 months old (Henry had served as <b>the</b> national <b>poster</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> March of Dimes in 1959). In 1990, the station implemented the [...] "24-Hour News Source" [...] concept, involving the production of 30-second newsbriefs airing {{at or near the}} top of every hour outside of regular newscasts; by 2006, these were reduced to two afternoon updates serving mainly to promote the evening newscasts. In August 1992, KFOR became the first Oklahoma City station to debut newscasts on weekend mornings, originally running from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m.; a weekday afternoon newscast at 4:30 p.m. was added in 1994, followed in 1996 by the debut of a 6:30 p.m. newscast (which focuses mainly on national and feature stories). During coverage of the April 19, 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing, the station erroneously reported during that day's coverage that a member of the Nation of Islam took credit for the bombing (actually orchestrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols), even though it cautioned that the claim might have been a crank call.|$|R
500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to savor the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as <b>the</b> new <b>poster</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> everything wrong with that approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23. As with Gray, Zawisza [...] "was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case." ...|$|R
