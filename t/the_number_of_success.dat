Papaspyridakos et al. reported a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> criteria and the success rate: the higher <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> criteria, the lower the reported success rate [32]. Also, the common criterion of bone loss being <[*] 2.0  mm {{during the first year of}} function, followed by <[*] 0.2  mm annually thereafter, may no longer be suitable, particularly with new implant systems, such as platform-switching implants, which lead to minimal crestal bone remodeling (Prosper et al. and Trammell et al. cited in [32]). Over the 5 -year study period, we report <[*] 2.0  mm bone level change for all implants, 0.1 – 0.5  mm for 40 %, and no bone loss or bone gain for 38 % of all implants. Additionally, bone loss was 0.32 [*]±[*] 0.66  mm and 0.13 [*]±[*] 0.29  mm for the platform-switching and platform-matching subgroups. Of note, in this study, the platform-matching and platform-switching groups were very unbalanced (67 vs. 206 implants) because the decision to choose abutment type was the clinician’s choice according to the clinical situation. Furthermore, very few radiographs were available for the platform-matching subgroup; thus, differences between the two subgroups are not conclusive. Nevertheless, the minimal crestal bone loss of 0.32  mm observed for platform-switching implants is comparable with the data reported in other studies on platform-switching implants [17, 23]. The bone gain of 0.12 [*]±[*] 0.42  mm at 1 -year follow-up [17] and of 0.16 [*]±[*] 0.53  mm at 3  years follow-up [23] have been reported.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the number, n, of trials, given {{a sequence of}} k independent success counts obtained by replicating the n-trial experiment is reconsidered in this paper. In contrast to existing methods it is assumed here that more information than usual is available: not only the numbers of successes are given but also the number of pairs of consecutive successes. This assumption is realistic {{in a class of}} problems of spatial statistics. There typically k = 1, in which case the classical estimators cannot be used. The quality of the new estimator is analysed and, for k> 1, compared with that of a classical n-estimator. The theoretical basis for this is the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> pairs in Bernoulli trials, which can be determined by an elementary Markov chain argument. 1.

Indeed association measures demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> responses occurred in front of failure in certain number of Bernoulli independent experiments. In parameter estimation, existing indicators values is not sensitive to the parameter values, whereas the proposed indicators are sensitive to the estimated parameters during the iterative procedure.

Among the common biometric identification methods are facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, speaker verification and so on, present a new solution for applications that require a high degree of security. Among these biometric methods, iris recognition becomes an important topic in pattern recognition, and it depends on the iris which is located in a place that still stable through human life. Furthermore, the probability to find two identical iris's approaching to zero value is quite easy. The identification system consists of several stages, and segmentation is the most crucial step. The current segmentation methods still have limitation in localizing the iris due to circular shape consideration of the pupil. Therefore, in this research, two segmentation methods of iris are suggested: Daugman method and Gupta method to investigate the feasibility of these segmentations in iris recognition. An enhanced method based on the techniques of the mentioned two methods is proposed, which can guarantee the accuracy of the iris identification system. The proposed method takes into account the elliptical shape of the pupil and iris. Eyelid detection is another step that has been included in this study as a part of segmentation stage.
