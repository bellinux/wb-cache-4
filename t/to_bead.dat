25|$|Although most injury {{responses}} {{include a}} calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is rapid {{separation of the}} proximal and distal ends within 30 minutes of injury. Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma, and eventually leads <b>to</b> <b>bead</b> like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions {{at the site of}} injury. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases (caused by influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process. Thus the axon undergoes complete fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hrs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and longer in the CNS. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are currently unknown.|$|E

Mouse spermatozoa preferentially bound <b>to</b> <b>beads</b> coated with heparin (average values ranging between 6. 2 and 8. 8 sperm per bead were obtained in different experiments) and with chondroitinsulfate (6. 2 - 7. 0), and also, although with significant differences across replicate experiments, <b>to</b> <b>beads</b> coated with laminin (7. 9 - 15. 6 sperm per bead) and with collagen type I (6. 1 - 18. 5).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to set up and {{evaluate}} a novel method for studies of platelet adhesion and activation in blood and platelet suspensions such as platelet concentrate (PC) samples using protein-coated polystyrene beads and flow cytometry. To demonstrate its usefulness, we studied PCs during storage. PCs were prepared by aphaeresis technique (n[*]=[*] 7). Metabolic variables and platelet function was measured on day 1, 5, 7 and 12 of storage. Spontaneous and TRAP- 6 -induced adhesion to fibrinogen- and collagen-coated beads was analyzed by flow cytometry. P-selectin and phosphatidyl serine (PS) expression was assessed on platelets bound <b>to</b> <b>beads</b> as well as on non-adherent platelets. Platelet adhesion <b>to</b> fibrinogen <b>beads</b> had increased by day 12 and adhesion <b>to</b> collagen <b>beads</b> at day 7 of storage (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). TRAP- 6 stimulation significantly increased the platelet adhesion <b>to</b> fibrinogen <b>beads</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) as well as the P-selectin and PS exposure on platelets bound <b>to</b> <b>beads</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) during the first 7 days of storage, but by day 12, significant changes were no longer induced by TRAP- 6 stimulation. We demonstrate that our adhesion assay using protein-coated polystyrene beads can be used to assess the adhesion properties of platelets during storage without the addition of red blood cells. Therefore it may offer a useful tool for future studies of platelet adhesive capacity in transfusion medicine and other settings...|$|R

40|$|Fimbriae are {{considered}} {{important in the}} adherence and colonization of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the oral cavity. It has been demonstrated that purified fimbriae bind to whole human saliva adsorbed <b>to</b> hydroxyapatite (HAP) <b>beads,</b> and the binding appears to be mediated by specific protein-protein interactions. Recently, we expressed the recombinant fimbrillin protein (r-Fim) of P. gingivalis corresponding to amino acid residues 10 to 337 of the native fimbrillin (A. Sharma, H. T. Sojar, J. -Y. Lee, and R. J. Genco, Infect. Immun. 61 : 3570 - 3573, 1993). We examined the ability of individual salivary components to promote the direct attachment of r-Fim <b>to</b> HAP <b>beads.</b> Purified r-Fim was radiolabeled with 125 I and incubated with HAP beads which were coated with saliva or purified individual salivary components. Whole, parotid, and submandibular-sublingual salivas increased the binding of 125 I-r-Fim <b>to</b> HAP <b>beads.</b> Submandibular-sublingual saliva was most effective in increasing the binding of 125 I-r-Fim <b>to</b> HAP <b>beads</b> (1. 8 times greater than that <b>to</b> uncoated HAP <b>beads).</b> The binding of 125 I-r-Fim <b>to</b> HAP <b>beads</b> coated with acidic proline-rich protein 1 (PRP 1) or statherin was four and two times greater, respectively, than that <b>to</b> uncoated HAP <b>beads.</b> PRP 1 and statherin molecules were also found to bind 125 I-r-Fim in an overlay assay. The binding of intact P. gingivalis cells <b>to</b> HAP <b>beads</b> coated with PRP 1 or statherin was also enhanced, by 5. 4 and 4. 3 times, respectively, over that <b>to</b> uncoated HAP <b>beads.</b> The interactions of PRP 1 and statherin with 125 I-r-Fim were not inhibited {{by the addition of}} carbohydrates or amino acids. PRP 1 and statherin in solution did not show inhibitory activity on 125 I-r-Fim binding <b>to</b> HAP <b>beads</b> coated with PRP 1 or statherin. These results suggest that P. gingivalis fimbriae bind strongly through protein-protein interactions to acidic proline-rich protein and statherin molecules which coat surfaces...|$|R
