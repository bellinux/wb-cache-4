Speaking of this class, the abolitionist Orestes Brownson derisively remarked that [...] "the Morrill Tariff moved them more than the fall of Sumter." [...] In one such example the New York Times, which had previously opposed Morrill's bill on free trade grounds, editorialized that the <b>tariff</b> <b>imbalance</b> would bring commercial ruin to the North and urged its suspension until the secession crisis passed. [...] "We have imposed high duties on our commerce {{at the very moment}} the seceding states are inviting commerce to their ports by low duties." [...] As secession became more evident and the fledgling Confederacy adopted a much lower tariff of its own, the paper urged military action to enforce the Morrill Tariff in the Southern states.|$|E

We find that increasing unpredictability leads to more expensive physical balancing of the gas system. Cost recovery by means of non-market based settlement faces the problem of defining an appropriate unique penalty that covers the balancing costs and incentivizes shippers.

Although specific tariffs for wind generation for ancillary services are uncommon, we anticipate that balancing authorities (control areas) and other entities will move toward such tariffs.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade a high amount of {{photovoltaic}} and wind power generators have been connected to the electric grid, introducing operational problems for {{transmission and distribution system}} operators due to the variability and the non-programmability of solar radiation and wind. The paper concerns an analysis on the benefits in adopting storage systems to reduce the imbalance costs associated to renewable energy sources. An analysis on a photovoltaic system has been performed considering different battery technologies. Discrete-time Markov chains have been used to generate a 20 years' time series of irradiance, that has been used to calculate the PV power production. Markov simulation parameters have been deeply studied in order to optimize them and obtain reliable synthetic data of ground irradiance. This data was then used as input of a hybrid PV and storage model allowing to obtain realistic economic and technical results, improving thus the results respect to the methods based on probabilistic weather simulations. An <b>imbalance</b> <b>tariff</b> has been assumed and its cost has been analysed in relation to the storage system costs. An optimal size for the different battery technology has been investigated considering the reduction of variability of the photovoltaic production and the economic convenience of the hybrid system. The use of Markov chains for the optimization of the battery size can be considered as the major novelty of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{gas system}} in Europe is facing {{increasing}} unpredictability {{due to the}} interactions with the electricity generation system. Indeed, gas fired power plants make up an important back-up technology to deal with intermittency induced by wind-power integration. Therefore, the flexibility needs with respect to unpredictable power generation are actually transferred to the gas market. Applying the well-known electric power generation concepts of 'unit commitment' and 'dispatching' to the gas market, a hypothetical gas-transmission system has been modeled to verify, first, the physical impact of wind power forecasting errors on the gas system, and, second, {{its effect on the}} organization of gas-imbalance settlement for non-market-based and market-based design options. Increasing unpredictability leads to more expensive physical balancing of the gas system. These costs should be borne as much as possible by those effectively causing them. From a regulatory point of view in the European context, cost recovery by means of non-market-based settlement faces the problem of defining an appropriate cost-neutral penalty that covers the balancing costs and incentivizes shippers. Market-based settlement relates the variable <b>imbalance</b> <b>tariffs</b> to the actual system imbalance and thus any factor that strongly impacts on the system state like unpredictability.

40|$|As {{the use of}} {{wind energy}} {{increases}} in the United States, there has been significant interest in assessing the integration cost of wind. With higher penetration, these costs {{have been shown to}} increase, but are generally modest relative to the price of wind energy. Although specific tariffs for wind generation for ancillary services are uncommon, we anticipate that balancing authorities (control areas) and other entities will move towards such tariffs. Tariffs for regulation and imbalance services should be costbased, recognize the relevant time scales that correspond with utility operational cycles, and properly allocate those costs to those entities that cause the balancing authority to incur the costs. In this paper we present methods for separating wind’s impact into regulation and load following (imbalance) time scales. We show that approximating these impacts with simpler methods can significantly distort cost causation, and even cause confusion between the relevant time scales. Correctly calculating and allocating cost impacts provides a market signal that can encourage economic efficiency, and avoids subsidies. We present results from NREL’s wind data collection program to illustrate some of the dangers of linearly scaling wind resource data from small wind plants to approximate the wind resource data from large wind plants. Errors in scaling can cause a significant over-estimate of wind impacts in the regulation and load following time frames and result in cross-subsidies in the resulting tariff. Finally, we provide a framework for developing regulation and <b>imbalance</b> <b>tariffs,</b> we outline methods to begin examining contingency reserve requirements for wind plants, we provide guidance on the important characteristics to consider, and we provide hypothetical cases that the tariff can be tested against to see if the results are what are desired...|$|R
40|$|The {{liberalization}} {{of the electricity}} markets {{as well as the}} growing environmental concerns have triggered the widespread use of distributed generation technologies, especially renewable energy resources and combined heat and power generation (CHP). Nevertheless, the intermittency of some of these technologies such as photovoltaicnbsp;and wind turbines, yields an important challenge to the electric grid operator. In this context it is proposed to group controllable and intermittent generation devices in what is known as a virtual power plant (VPP). This kind of aggregation will facilitate not only the participation of distributed generators in the electricity market but it also might help to compensate the forecast errors of renewables by using the flexibility of controllable devices. The aim of this work is to develop several control strategies for the economic optimal operation of distributed generation devices that are aggregated into a virtual power plant incorporating thermal‑demand aspects. The main focus is on the role that cogeneration can play in increasing the flexibility of the system and the profits of the virtual power plant operator. In this respect, three main research questions are assessed: the ability to reduce the imbalance volume and the associated costs using residential micro‑CHPs, the opportunity to provide passive balancing with an aggregation of micro‑CHPs andnbsp;ability of cogeneration district heating to compensate for the uncertainty in the system. It is shown that micronbsp;are able to partially compensate for the deviations between local electric power demand and local power generation. Nevertheless, this imbalance volume reduction does not always lead to a reduction of the imbalance cost. It is demonstrated that a control strategy aiming to minimize imbalance volumes disregarding the <b>imbalance</b> <b>tariffs</b> can lead to an increase in operational costs, especially during spring and summer. Furthermore, the results indicate that even in the best case scenario, the level of savings are not to be sufficiently high to motivate CHP owners to join a VPP. The possibility to provide real-time balancing services or passive balancing is assessed for an aggregation of micro-CHP devices installed in different households and service buildings. The resultsnbsp;a clear indication that providing passive balancing leads to a total cost decrease in all the seasons compared to a case in which the electricity is traded only in the day‑ahead market. Finally, the added value of using CHP linked to a district heating network (CHP‑DH) to compensate for the uncertainties regarding electricity generation and market prices development is investigated. Stochastic programming isnbsp;to explicitly model the uncertainties innbsp;system. It is shown that using the flexibility of the CHP‑DH together with a thermal‑storage unit results in an increase in profits during spring and summer. However, due to the high demand for heat during the winter, the CHP‑DH can offer less flexibility during these months resulting in a lower added value. In addition, if the VPP is allowed to react in real time to the current imbalance prices the profit increase is even larger. nrpages: 165 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Global warming now poses one of {{the most}} serious {{challenges}} to the well-being of humanity at large. The projected increase in the Earth's mean surface and ocean temperatures will have a severe impact on human health in both the developed and developing regions of the world. As the burning of fossil fuels contributes significantly to worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, there has been a concerted policy reform effort in both the US and abroad to transform the electricity sector by increasing the displacement of conventional fossil fuel-based thermal generation with clean renewable generation such as wind and solar. California, for example, has set a target of 33 % renewable energy penetration by the year 2020. Wind and solar energy will play a key role in realizing such aggressive targets. However, at these deep penetration levels, the inherent variability of wind and solar power production poses serious engineering and market challenges. These are due to the uncertainty, intermittency, and uncontrollability of wind and solar power. They are essentially random [...] a stark contrast to conventional thermal power generation. How is variability in wind an solar power production dealt with today? Today, wind and solar energy are assimilated into the grid through legislative mandates, feed-in <b>tariffs,</b> lenient <b>imbalance</b> penalty pricing, guaranteed grid access, tax relief, and/or construction subsidies. Specifically, in California, the Participating Intermittent Renewable Program (PIRP) legislation compels the independent system operator (ISO) to accept all produced wind power subject to certain contractual constraints. This amounts to a system take-all-wind modus operandi in which wind power is treated as a negative load and the subsequent increase in the variability of net-load is absorbed by a portfolio of reserve generation capacity, whose cost is allocated amongst the load serving entities (LSE). Moreover, this socialisation of added reserve costs amongst the LSEs constitutes an implicit subsidy for variability costs to participating wind power producers. We submit to the reader that the current extra-market approach to renewable energy integration will become untenable as wind and solar energy penetration increases. Under this system-take-all-power regime, the attendant intermittency and limited forecastability of wind and solar power production will lead to a significant increase in the reserve generation requirements necessary to maintain system balance [...] an unacceptable consequence. It is too expensive. Ergo, it will rapidly become infeasible to continue the implicit subsidization of the variability costs among the load serving entities. Moreover, it severely mitigates the net greenhouse gas benefit of renewable energy, as regulating reserves are normally supplied by fast-acting, fossil fuel based thermal generators such as natural gas turbines. The current strategy cannot scale. Clearly, strategies that mitigate the need for additional reserve requirements will be an essential means to supporting deep integration of variable renewable energy. Throughout this dissertation, we will focus explicitly on wind, however, much of the analysis is directly applicable to solar power generation as well. How will variability be dealt with tomorrow? In the near term, we argue that wind power producers will be forced to participate in conventional electricity markets alongside traditional dispatchable generation, where they will face ex-post financial penalties for deviations from contracts offered ex-ante in forward markets [...] thus eliminating the implicit subsidy for variability costs. In response to the financial risk emanating from uncertainty in wind power production, a rational wind power producer will be forced to curtail its projected output, thus decreasing the amount of variability that has to be compensated for with reserve generation by the system operator. However, such a removal of the implicit subsidy for variability cost may result in significant profit loss to the wind power producer. Consequently, it will become necessary for the wind power producer to develop and evaluate strategies that aid in the mitigation of wind power output variability. In this dissertation, we quantify, within the setting of a perfectly competitive market, the maximal expected profit achievable by a wind power producer through optimal bidding. Moreover, as wind is an inherently variable source of energy, we explore the sensitivity of optimal expected profit to uncertainty in the underlying wind process and quantify the marginal economic value of various firming mechanisms that aid in the mitigation of power output variability. Specifically, we appraise the benefit of improved forecasting and quantify the added value of recourse opportunities afforded by the co-location of an energy storage system and/or fast-acting thermal generation with the wind power producer. Further, we explore the extent to which a group of N independent wind power producers can exploit the statistical benefits of aggregation and risk sharing by forming a willing coalition to pool their variable power to jointly offer the aggregate output as single entity into a forward energy market...|$|R
