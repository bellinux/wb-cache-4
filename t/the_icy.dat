5|$|Clay-like {{minerals}} (specifically, phyllosilicates), {{often associated}} with organic matter on Earth, have been detected on <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> crust of Europa. The presence of the minerals {{may have been the}} result of a collision with an asteroid or comet.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as a teacher at <b>the</b> <b>ICY,</b> White closely collaborated with Octavius Catto, an {{important}} civil rights activist and long-time friend of White's who shared a similar social group and views on education. Both men, former cricket players at <b>the</b> <b>ICY,</b> believed baseball was another outlet for African Americans to promote social reform and prove their right for full citizenship. In the spring of 1866, White and Catto established the Philadelphia Pythians, a baseball club composed mainly of men from the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization. Catto, a hard-hitting shortstop and second baseman, was the de facto captain on the field, while White became the team's secretary, responsible for scheduling games, arranging festivities, and recording statistics. Soon, Pythian games became a popular fixture of the black community.|$|E

5|$|White was {{initially}} {{enrolled at the}} Lombardy Street Public School. After completing his grammar schooling, he matriculated at the Institute for Colored Youth (ICY) in 1853. Founded by the Society of Friends (Quakers), <b>the</b> <b>ICY</b> emphasized high moral standards for its students and offered a classical study of Latin, Greek, and trigonometry. While enrolled, White expressed an acute awareness of black society and psychological concepts in essays he presented. On May 24, 1855, he addressed Governor James Pollock at a special reception for the institute, touching {{on the issue of}} African American citizenship. The same year, White was elected secretary of the Banneker Institute, a student instructional society that convened weekly to have scholarly discussions. White was his class's lone graduate from <b>the</b> <b>ICY</b> on May 6, 1857; he earned praise for his popularity among classmates and professors alike.|$|E
5|$|Among Scott's first acts as {{governor}} was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first {{address to the}} legislature on December 13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when he slipped on <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term {{as governor}}.|$|E
5|$|Flight 663 {{was unable}} to recover from its unusually steep bank and plunged into <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> water of the Atlantic Ocean, where it {{exploded}} with bright orange flames. The Pan American 707 {{was the first to}} relay news of the crash, as it was receiving permission to land. Air Canada Flight 627, which had departed a few minutes prior to Flight 663, also radioed news of an explosion in the water.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{television}} critics praised Muldaur's performance, {{with one}} noting her [...] "wry, no-nonsense warmth that plays nicely off {{of some of}} <b>the</b> <b>icier</b> regulars". <b>The</b> addition of Muldaur, along with Whoopi Goldberg, also served to redress the absence of women from the principal cast, as the departure of McFadden and Denise Crosby had left only Marina Sirtis, a rapid attrition of women that recalled the imbalance of the original Star Trek series.|$|R
5|$|Game of Thrones {{is roughly}} {{based on the}} storylines of A Song of Ice and Fire, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the {{continent}} of Essos. The series chronicles the violent dynastic struggles among the realm's noble families for the Iron Throne, while other families fight for independence from it. It opens with additional threats in <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> North and Essos in the east.|$|E
5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert {{in the northwest}} and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E
5|$|One tourism {{activity}} {{unique to the}} Arctic North is iceberg watching. During the summer season of April to July, {{it is possible to}} watch icebergs moving down rivers while the ice around them melts. In addition, watching the floe edge is also a popular activity due to wildlife movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres from the ice, polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> water and amphibious animals often bring themselves up onto dry land or onto the ice to sunbathe.|$|E

The genial warmth of a Roman April {{kindling}} into May was in the atmosphere around them; but when Miriam saw that involuntary movement and heard that sigh of relief (for so she interpreted it), a shiver ran through her frame, as if <b>the</b> <b>iciest</b> wind of <b>the</b> Apennines were blowing over her.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>icy</b> Galilean moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, all {{generate}} induced magnetic {{moments in}} response to changes in Jupiter's magnetic field. These varying magnetic moments create dipole magnetic fields around them, which act to compensate {{for changes in the}} ambient field. The induction is thought to take place in subsurface layers of salty water, which are likely to exist in all of Jupiter's large icy moons. These underground oceans can potentially harbor life, and evidence for their presence {{was one of the most}} important discoveries made in the 1990s by spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (317km) is about 54% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 40% of the moon’s mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Umbriel is about 0.24GPa (2.4kbar). The current state of <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, there has been great interest in studying <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> moons in detail. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. The Europa Orbiter was a planned NASA mission to Europa, which was canceled in 2002. Its main objectives included determining {{the presence or absence of}} a subsurface ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter), which was canceled in 2005, and a European Jovian Europa Orbiter mission were also studied, but were superseded by the Europa Jupiter System Mission.|$|E

5|$|Callisto's {{battered}} surface lies {{on top of}} a cold, stiff, and icy lithosphere that {{is between}} 80 and 150km thick. A salty ocean 150200km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10km. The existence of an ocean is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer can be as thick as 250300km. Failing an ocean, <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300km.|$|E
5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). The current state of <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Oberon may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (480km) is about 63% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 54% of the moon's mass—the proportions are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Oberon is about 0.5GPa (5kbar). The current state of <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Oberon may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core–mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, is up to 40km and its temperature is around 180K. However, the internal structure of Oberon depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known at present.|$|E

5|$|The film {{begins with}} a maid whose home is {{occupied}} by the Hessian officers when they enter Trenton. Despite her hatred of the British red coats she accepts them and by her conduct dismisses their doubts about her loyalty. When they are resigned to a drunken sleep, for which the maid gladly offered, she takes a message from her wounded American sweetheart. She disguises herself and sets off to deliver the message to George Washington. The maid then leads Washington and his men in crossing <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> Delaware River. When they arrive at the maid's home, her wounded sweetheart lets them in so the historic capture can take place.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} great {{interest}} in studying <b>the</b> <b>icy</b> moons in detail because {{of the possibility of}} subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter) was cancelled in 2005. A subsequent proposal was developed for a joint NASA/ESA mission called EJSM/Laplace, with a provisional launch date around 2020. EJSM/Laplace would have consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter. However, ESA had formally ended the partnership by April 2011, citing budget issues at NASA and the consequences on the mission timetable. Instead, ESA planned to go ahead with a European-only mission to compete in its L1 Cosmic Vision selection.|$|E

Amaterasu and Issun {{embark on}} a journey across Nippon, first {{arriving}} at Ryoshima Coast and Sei-An City, the capital of Nippon. There, they work with the beautiful priestess Rao, the legendary submarine Dragon Kingdom, and the reclusive Queen Himiko to rid the coastline and city of Orochi's influence, including destroying a demonic plague and retrieving a mystical weapon from a sunken trading ship. However, it is revealed that the real Rao was killed before Amaterasu arrived, and the Rao they had {{been working with the}} false fox god, Ninetails, who murders Himiko before returning to her fortress on the elusive Oni Island.
