In August 1930, two months before Aiello's death, the state's attorney conducted a raid on Aiello's home, obtaining records as part of a series of raids by the United States government to fight against gangland activities in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the war; however, as the war progressed {{and the number of}} casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E

On October 23, 2012, Gary Johnson participated in a third-party debate that was aired on C-SPAN, RT America, and Al Jazeera English. A post-debate online election allowed people to choose two candidates from the debate they thought had won to face each other head to head in a run-off debate.

President Johnson, in 1866, declared the civilian government restored in Texas. Despite not meeting reconstruction requirements, Congress resumed allowing elected Texas representatives into the federal government in 1870. Social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues.|$|E

They carried the standard eight 15cm guns, the forward wing mounts were placed a deck higher to improve their firing arc. They were otherwise identical to the preceding light cruiser designs.|$|E

5|$|This was {{virtually}} {{the only part}} of the Western Front, during the Phoney War, where there was significant aerial activity in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the war, as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases. So it did not take long for Specht to score his first victories: two Handley Page Hampden medium bombers in a squadron conducting an armed reconnaissance operation near Heligoland, shot down on 29 September. Needing a long-range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance, I./ZG 26 was thus the next Gruppe selected for re-equipping onto the Bf 110.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbeek was {{a strong}} proponent of the {{proposed}} arena in Newark, which first received funding from the city council during Puck Holdings' ownership in 2002. After legal battles over both eminent domain and the city's financial participation in the arena project, the final deal was approved by council in October 2004, during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the lockout, and the groundbreaking occurred almost exactly a year later. Nonetheless, in January 2006, financial issues threatened to halt the deal, as the Devils did not provide the city with a required letter of credit until the last possible day.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win {{by a margin of}} 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E
50|$|Drusus' {{legislation}} was probably passed in <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 91 BC. However, {{even at that}} early stage he faced considerable opposition. On the day of voting, the consul Philippus tried to stop proceedings, and was only deterred when one of Drusus' supporters throttled Philippus {{to the point that}} the consul started bleeding. And when Caepio continued to oppose his legislation, Drusus threatened to have the praetor hurled from the Tarpeian Rock, an archaic punishment for treasonable magistrates.|$|R

After the war Lexington remained on the California coast, a source of stability and security during the territory’s transition to U.S. control and in <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gold rush of 1849.|$|R
