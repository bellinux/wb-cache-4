500|$|In a four-star review, Allmusic editor Alex Henderson called Coltrane for Lovers [...] "an {{excellent}} {{collection that}} has no problem reminding us just how warm and expressive his ballad playing could be." [...] After discussing how Coltrane's ballad-playing has been undervalued in comparison to his more experimental recordings, in a December 21, 2001 article for The New York Times, writer Ben Ratliff wrote that [...] "This collection ... presents all the argument you need." [...] Some, however, have criticized the album and Verve negatively for repackaging Coltrane material for an unnecessary cash-in compilation. In [...] The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD, Richard Cook and Brian Morton gave the album {{one out of four}} stars and commented, [...] "Oh, for goodness' sake! We're tempted to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> contains a previously unreleased rehearsal of Ascension, which we have long regarded as excellent make-out music, but it does not. Needless to say, the music is fine ... It's the concept we have problems with. Avoid." ...|$|E

Referencing her experience as a black woman in the White House, she said that although {{she lives in a}} [...] "house that was built by slaves," [...] seeing her children play on the White House lawn fills her with hope. She said: [...] "Don't let anyone ever <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> country is not great. That somehow we need to make it great again. Because this right now is the greatest country on Earth." [...] The Atlantic described the speech as the best of the night and called it a speech [...] "for the ages", a qualification echoed in other publications. David Smith of The Guardian called it a [...] "profound, moving and devastating riposte to Donald Trump".|$|E
2500|$|There are those, however, who {{deny that}} Jesus was a pacifist and state that Jesus never {{said not to}} fight, citing {{examples}} from the New Testament. One such instance portrays an angry Jesus driving dishonest market traders from the temple. [...] A frequently quoted passage is Luke 22:36: [...] "He said to them, 'But now, {{the one who has}} a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.'" [...] Pacifists have typically explained that verse as Jesus fulfilling prophecy, since in the next verse, Jesus continues to say: [...] "It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." [...] Others have interpreted the non-pacifist statements in the New Testament to be related to self-defense or to be metaphorical and state that on no occasion did Jesus shed blood or urge others to shed blood.|$|E
