40|$|<b>Firing</b> <b>the</b> {{manager is}} a drastic measure {{employed}} by firms {{to deal with}} poor performance. However, data on within-firm dynamics are scarce, and <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> individual managers is rarely recorded in the firm level data currently available. This makes <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> a manager difficult to assess. Data on sports offer {{a unique opportunity to}} study this phenomenon because <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> a coach is usually well-publicized. Using data on soccer, the author evaluates <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> a coach on team performance. As teams do not face the same opponents before and after a coach is <b>fired,</b> <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> sample selectivity is addressed. ...|$|R

5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Steuart {{was sent}} as a {{prisoner}} of war to Charleston, South Carolina, and was later imprisoned at Hilton Head, where he and other officers were placed under <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> Confederate artillery. The fighting at Spotsylvania was to prove the end of his brigade. Johnson's division, 6,800 strong {{at the start of the}} battle, was now so severely reduced in size that barely one brigade could be formed. On May 14 the brigades of Walker, Jones, and Steuart were consolidated into one small brigade under the command of Colonel Terry of the 4th Virginia Infantry.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the duel between the two ironclads, Monitor had been struck twenty-two times, {{including}} nine hits to the turret and two hits to the pilothouse. She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. Virginia had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor from <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> Monitor and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. In the opinion of Virginias commander Jones and her other officers, Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E
5|$|Aside from a brief {{break in}} firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the , damaged by gunfire, New Jersey was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, {{supporting}} {{the movement of}} the U.S. X Corps. The pattern again was harassing fire by night, destruction of known targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted by <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> her big guns. A bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions, pillboxes, bunkers, and two ammunition dumps were demolished.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War Two the British Government created the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, and {{appointed}} Kenneth Clark as its Chairman. Despite the public hostility between Clarke and himself, Nevinson was disappointed not to be offered a commission by WAAC. He submitted three paintings to WAAC in December 1940 which were also rejected. He worked as a stretcher-bearer in London throughout the Blitz, during which his own studio and the family home in Hampstead were hit by bombs. WAAC eventually purchased two pictures from him, Anti-aircraft Defences and a depiction of a fire-bomb attack, <b>The</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> London, December 29th – An Historic Record.|$|E

5|$|By then, Farnese, unwilling {{of having}} {{for a longer}} time his troops close to Antwerp's cannons, made drums and {{trumpets}} to call for withdrawal and gathered his men at Borgerhout. Meanwhile, people from Antwerp sallied to carry the wounded French, British and Walloon officers and soldiers into the city to receive treatment. The Spanish soldiery, once <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> Borgerhout was finished, looted the basements of the burned buildings and had a meal before praying to thank God. After that, the Spanish Army marched across the roads of Lier and Herentals to Turnhout, where Farnese wanted to arrive the next day.

5|$|French tirailleurs {{occupied}} the dominant positions, especially {{one on a}} knoll overlooking {{the square of the}} 27th.

During Kratos' second quest, Gyges {{revealed}} that he had planned to use the Ambrosia to revive his brothers, Briareus and Cottus, and then reclaim the world, but Kratos' initial retrieval thwarted that plan.

5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge. There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April 1918, at El Kefr, Egypt, {{during an}} attack, Rifleman Karanbahadur Rana {{and a few}} other men crept forward with a Lewis gun under intense fire to engage an enemy machine-gun. No. 1 of the Lewis gun team opened fire but was shot almost immediately, whereupon the rifleman pushed the dead man off the gun, opened fire, knocked out the enemy gun crew and then silenced <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> the enemy bombers and riflemen in front of him.

5|$|Pure {{alkali metals}} are dangerously {{reactive}} with {{air and water}} and must be kept away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, halocarbons, plastics, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride, so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective, depriving <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{plan would}} still fail if {{sufficient}} ground {{could not be}} taken quickly in Belgium to squeeze the allies against two fronts. Preventing this from happening were the defences of Fort Eben-Emael and the Albert Canal. The three bridges over the canal were the key to allowing Army Group B a high operational tempo. The bridges at Veldwezelt, Vroenhoven and Kanne in Belgium, and Maastricht on the Dutch border were the target. Failure to capture the bridges would leave Reichenau's German 6th Army, the southern-most army of Group B, trapped in the Maastricht-Albert Canal enclave and subjected to <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> Eben-Emael. The fort had to be captured or destroyed.|$|E
