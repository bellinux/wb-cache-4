500|$|An {{additional}} specimen {{was described}} as a possible Sphecomyrma male, but it was never assigned to a specific species. The specimen numbered AMNH NJ-242 was collected from the White Oaks outcrop in 1995 and is currently preserved in the [...] American Museum of Natural History. The entire body of the male specimen is completely preserved. As most ant genera are based on the morphology of workers, assigning males to a species or a genus is rarely done unless they are taken from a colony. However, its size, petiole structure, the absence of the trochantellus and basal antennal structure are similar to that of a Sphecomyrma worker. It is a small ant, measuring [...] with three ocelli present on the vertex. Stiff hairs can be found on its frons and vertex. It has large eyes and the face has two pairs of long setae along with smaller setae. The scape is short and is around the same length as the flagellomere (one of the three main segments of the antenna); the pedicel is only slightly longer than the flagellomere by 0.3 times, and the total length of the antenna is [...] Most of its mouthparts are covered in bubbles from the amber, but two palpals (a pair of appendages found near the mouth) are seen protruding. The mesosoma is [...] in length and the petiole is , which has pairs of long setae on the apex of the nodus. Both <b>tibias</b> have a pair of setose and the apical spurs on the hind tibia is pectinate. The forewings measure [...] and the hindwings are 0.7 times the length of the forewings. The shape of the wings is consistent with other formicids. The hindwings have seven hamuli but none is found around the anterior portions. The gaster is [...] long and the first and second segments are equally as long as each other (these two segments alone cover two-thirds of the gaster). The terminalia (the last segments of the abdomen) is difficult to examine due to a layer of froth covering the area, but there are two pairs of setose lobes.|$|E
2500|$|In season eight, Jewel and Nancy O'Dell {{were injured}} {{before the season}} even began and could not compete. Jewel was {{diagnosed}} with fractured <b>tibias</b> in both legs; she came back {{later in the season}} to perform [...] "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" [...] on a results show. O'Dell suffered from a torn knee cartilage. [...] They were replaced by Holly Madison and Melissa Rycroft who would be dancing with their partners {{for the rest of the}} season (Dmitry Chaplin and Tony Dovolani).|$|E

50|$|The holotype {{bones of}} Eionaletherium - femurs, <b>tibias,</b> vertebrae, scapulae, astragalus and rib {{fragments}} - {{were discovered in}} the Urumaco Formation of Venezuela. The relevant area of the formation had previously only yielded fossils of turtles and crocodiles.|$|E
50|$|A Tibia Clausa {{is a type}} of {{pipe organ}} pipe. It is a large-scale, stopped wood flute pipe, usually with a leathered lip. The rank was invented by Robert Hope-Jones. Tibia Clausas {{provides}} the basic foundation tone of the organ with few overtones or harmonics. The Tibia Clausa is arguably the most important rank of pipes in a theatre pipe organ, with some organs having as many as 5. The stop shares similarities with the Bourdon and the Gedackt found in some church pipe organs. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Tibia Clausa was sometimes used as an alternate name for Doppelflöte. Most <b>tibias</b> are made from wood, as by Wurlitzer etc., although examples of metal <b>tibias</b> may be found made by the John Compton Organ Company.|$|E
50|$|The {{adults are}} to 10 - 13 mm long. The thorax and head are {{brilliant}} black, clypeus, labrum and {{the base of}} mandibles are yellow, the abdomen is black with a transversal yellow band and a yellow tip, femoras and <b>tibias</b> are black. The wings are brown and transparent.|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{the season}} was advertised as the first U.S. season where {{a husband and wife}} would compete against each other: rodeo {{champion}} Ty Murray and singer-songwriter Jewel. The two had married the previous year after a ten-year courtship. However, just prior to the series, Jewel fractured both her <b>tibias</b> and was unable to perform. She was replaced on the show by Playboy model Holly Madison. Murray chose to continue on the show, and Jewel appeared during the season as a special musical guest.|$|E
50|$|She {{spent her}} first years in Uvalde, Texas, {{and then moved}} to Austin and then Lago Vista, Texas, where she {{attended}} middle and high school. Diagnosed {{at the age of}} 4 with McCune-Albright syndrome, she experienced a number of bone fractures (leg, hip, and arm) and surgeries to remedy the impact of the disease. This required her to use body casts, crutches and a wheelchair at various times. Her femurs and <b>tibias</b> were eventually rodded with steel and titanium rods.|$|E

50|$|Females have a {{body length}} up to 20 mm, males up to 17 mm. Their legs are {{approximately}} three times longer. They are reddish brown, but young spiders may be much paler {{up to the last}} moult. Up close, they are easily differentiated from T. domestica by the lengths of their legs: the front pair is almost as long as species in the genus Eratigena, while the hind pair is unshortened and similar to T. domestica. They also have more abundant hair on their <b>tibias.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some animal {{bones were}} only {{used to create}} tools. Due to their shape, the ribs, fibulas, and metapodia of horses were good for awl and barb creation. In addition, the ribs were also {{implemented}} to create different types of smoothers for pelt preparation. The shapes of polar hare bones are also unique, and as a result, the ulnas were commonly used as awls and barbs. Reindeer antlers, ulnas, ribs, <b>tibias,</b> and teeth were utilized {{in addition to a}} rare documented case of a phalanx.|$|E
50|$|Lygus gemellatus {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 5.5 - 6.2 mm in males, of 5.2 - 5.7 mm in females. These bugs are usually pale grayish green, {{sometimes}} with brownish or reddish tinge. Black spot on scutellum usually are bifid apically. However, in this species color and of dark patterns on pronotum and scutellum shows high variability. Corium has black spots at the margin and cuneus has a black distal angle. Membrane is smoke gray, with yellowish-gray veins. Legs are yellowish-gray to brown. Femora have two distal black rings, while <b>tibias</b> show black thorns.|$|E
50|$|Mammoth {{remnants}} {{were also}} {{among the most popular}} due to the abundance of tusks. However, ribs, long bones, and molars were also documented. It is clear in this case as well, that some of the mammoth bones were also used for decorative purposes. Although not as popular in quantity as the mammoth, wolf remains were the most varied of all of the animals. Many parts of the wolf’s skeleton were used for tool production and decoration. These include the ribs, humeri, radii, ulnas, femurs, <b>tibias,</b> fibulas, metapodia, and perforated teeth.|$|E
50|$|The setae of {{this species}} have a uniformly rusty appearance. The {{coloration}} {{is very similar to}} that of the six species of Brachypelma that are endemic to the west coast. B. boehmei is similar, having black tarsi, orange-yellow metatarsi, <b>tibias</b> and patellas, black femora and coxae and orange-yellow hairs on the opistosoma. It differs only in the carapace, which is yellow-orange in B. boehmei and black in B. klaasi. Another very similar species is B. baumgarteni. Adults of B. klaasi have a body length of about 16 cm.|$|E
5000|$|At birth, {{only the}} metaphyses of the [...] "long bones" [...] are present. The long bones {{are those that}} grow {{primarily}} by elongation at an epiphysis {{at one end of}} the growing bone. The long bones include the femurs, <b>tibias,</b> and fibulas of the lower limb, the humeri, radii, and ulnas of the upper limb (arm + forearm), and the phalanges of the fingers and toes. The long bones of the leg comprise nearly half of adult height. The other primary skeletal component of height is the spine and skull.|$|E
5000|$|Ptilotula {{are derived}} from an unknown {{ancestor}} which occupied dry woodland in central Australia. Walter Boles described a fossil leg bone found in Riversleigh, Queensland from an as yet unnamed Pliocene species as characteristic of <b>tibias</b> from the Lichenostomus-Meliphaga complex. It is most similar in size to those of P.keartlandi and P.plumulus, two species which are resident in the region [...] and closely related sister species. The environment has been dry woodland since the late Miocene to early Pliocene hence the similarities to extant species indicate this fossil may represent an ancestor to these species.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s George A. Agogino and {{a crew of}} {{excavators}} {{went out to the}} site to dig test pits. Agogino {{at the time of the}} excavation taught anthropology course and the University of Nebraska. The pits the crew dug were about 18 inches in depth and contained femurs, <b>tibias,</b> and fragments of skulls. The remains were found to belong to at least three different individuals. In 1965, the Nebraska State Historical Society sent a crew led by John Garrett and Wendell Frantz on a ten-week excavation of the area. During this time the crew excavated 30 pits, three burials, a house, and several other features such as hearths.|$|E
5000|$|Structure 10 {{appears to}} have been partly rebuilt around 2,800 BCE, {{probably}} due to structural instability. [...] It was used until around 2,400-2,200 BCE. At this time it {{appears to have}} been [...] "closed" [...] in an extraordinary and unique episode of demolition involving the slaughter of several hundred cattle. Bones of approximately 400 cattle—tibias (shin bones) comprise the vast majority of bones found—were laid around structure 10 and an upturned cow skull was placed within it. The <b>tibias</b> appear to have been cracked to extract the marrow, suggesting that this slaughter was accompanied by a feast. All the killing seems to have taken place in a single event.|$|E
50|$|More recently, Mutu has {{exhibited}} sculptural installations. In 2006, Mutu and British architect David Adjaye collaborated on a project. They transformed the Upper East Side Salon 94 townhouse in New York into a subterraneous dinner party-setting titled Exhuming Gluttony: A Lover’s Requiem. Furs and bullet holes adorned the walls while wine bottles dangled in a careless chandelier-like form above the stained table. The table’s multiple legs resembled thick femurs with visibly delicate <b>tibias,</b> {{and the whole}} space had a pungent aroma. The artists strove to show a moment of gluttony. This vicious hunger {{was seen as a}} connection between images of The Last Supper, the climate of the current art-buying world, and the war in Iraq.|$|E
50|$|Stromboideans have {{medium to}} large shells, {{attaining}} {{a wide variety}} of lengths depending on the species (20-400 mm from the smallest aporrhaids to the largest strombids). A stromboidean shell has a medium (e.g. spider conchs, Lambis spp.) to high spire (e.g. <b>tibias,</b> Tibia spp.), and a thickened and frequently expanded outer lip (e.g. the queen conch, Lobatus gigas, or the goliath conch, Lobatus goliath) that may be ornamented by long spines (e.g. the spider conch, Lambis chiragra, common pelican foot, Aporrhais spp.) or digitations (e.g. the millipede spider conch, Lambis millepeda). The anterior portion of the outer lip may present a stromboid notch, an indentation through which one of the animal's long eyestalks may protrude.|$|E
5000|$|To the {{south-east}} of {{the boulevard}} Montparnasse, {{to the bottom}} of the northward-running Avenue Denfert-Rochereau at the square of the same name, is one of Paris' few-remaining pre-1860's [...] "prolype" [...] gateways. The westernmost of these twin buildings holds Paris' most macabre attraction: the Catacombs of Paris. Formerly stone mines, abandoned when Paris annexed the land over them from 1860, the underground hallways became a new sepulture for the contents of Paris' many overflowing and unhygienic parish cemeteries. At its origin but a jumbled bone depository, it was renovated in the early 19th century into uniform rooms and hallways of neatly (and even artistically) arranged skulls and <b>tibias,</b> and opened to the public for paid visits from 1868.|$|E
