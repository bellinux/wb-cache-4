5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for solar energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power plants have been built in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> Desert. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) making them the largest solar power installation in the world. Large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors. <b>The</b> <b>Mojave</b> Solar Park is currently under construction and will produce 280MW when completed.|$|E

50|$|The Dead Mountains are a {{mountain}} range in <b>the</b> southeastern <b>Mojave</b> Desert, in San Bernardino County, California.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> Desert which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> Desert is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E

5000|$|This {{plant is}} {{primarily}} {{found in the}} Sonoran Colorado Desert of southeastern California, and the Sonoran Deserts of southern Arizona and of northwestern Sonora state (Mexico). It is found predominantly in desert washes or bajadas, {{a result of its}} need for water, although occasionally it can be found in creosote desert scrub habitat, accessing seeps in desert hills up to 3,600 ft. [...] Also found in <b>the</b> far eastern <b>Mojave</b> Desert of California in the 'upper' Lower Colorado River Valley, and occasionally in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave's</b> mountains.|$|R

5|$|The Santa Ana River {{watershed}} shares boundaries {{with many}} adjacent river basins. In the northwest is the San Gabriel River, which empties into the Pacific at Long Beach. In Orange County, the San Diego Creek, Aliso Creek, and San Juan Creek watersheds border the Santa Ana watershed on the south. Further south, in San Diego County, the watershed is bordered {{by those of}} San Mateo Creek, the Santa Margarita River, and the San Luis Rey River. On the east the watershed shares borders {{with those of the}} Whitewater River and the Coachella Valley, flowing into the Salton Sea, and on the north with <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> River, which flows into the endorheic basin of <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> Desert.|$|E

5|$|After cresting both {{mountain}} passes, {{the highway}} descends into the Antelope Valley, a large valley within <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> Desert. The highway crosses Angeles Forest Highway and the California Aqueduct in the descent. Route 14 {{serves as the}} primary north–south thoroughfare for the communities of Palmdale and Lancaster. Between Palmdale Boulevard (County Route N2) and Avenue D in Lancaster, SR 14 runs concurrently with SR 138.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Victorville area the scenery changes, as {{suburban}} neighborhoods disappear and the highway traverses <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> Desert. While crossing the desert, the route clips the northeastern corner of Edwards Air Force Base. Just past the base the road intersects SR 58 at Kramer Junction. This is currently an at-grade intersection; however, SR58 is gradually being upgraded to a freeway. After leaving Kramer Junction 395 passes the Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station. US395 crosses the Rand and El Paso Mountains, where the highway crosses into San Bernardino–Kern county line, near Johannesburg. While traversing these mountains the route crosses a former Southern Pacific rail line, {{now owned by}} the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) that loosely follows the route of State Route 14 through <b>the</b> <b>Mojave.</b> Though the railroad is abandoned north of Searles Station, US 395 parallels the old railroad grade from this point to Lone Pine.|$|E

5|$|Dragonflies {{including}} libellulids and aeshnids {{are found}} in desert pools, for example in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> Desert, where they are active in shade temperatures between 18 and 45°C (64.4 to 113°F); these insects were able to survive body temperatures above the thermal death point of insects {{of the same species}} found in cooler places.|$|E

5|$|State Route 247 (SR 247) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California in San Bernardino County. The road passes through <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> Desert, {{connecting}} SR 62 in Yucca Valley to Interstate 15 (I-15). SR 247 was designated by the California State Legislature in 1969; the county roads along that route {{were given to the}} state in 1972.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} {{that makes}} up Yucca Mountain was created by several large eruptions from a caldera volcano and is composed of alternating layers of ignimbrite (welded tuff), non-welded tuff, and semi-welded tuff. The tuff surround the burial sites is expected to protect human health as it provides a natural barrier to the radiation. It lies along the transition between <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> and the Great Basin Deserts.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{more typical}} {{locations}} across <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> Desert, {{many of the}} water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity {{of plant and animal}} species that are not found anywhere else in the world. The existence of these species is due largely to a unique geologic history and the process of evolution that has progressed in habitats that have been isolated from one another since the Pleistocene epoch.|$|E
