60|$|They were in {{this state}} when the Norseman and the Dane fitted out their long ships, and burst upon their coasts. By a {{peculiar}} law, common once to all the Teuton nations, though by that time altered in the southern ones, the land of a family was not divided among its members, but all possessed an equal right in it; and thus, as it was seldom adequate to maintain them all, the more enterprising used their right in it only to fell trees enough to build a ship, and to demand corn enough <b>to</b> <b>victual</b> their crew, which was formed of other young men whose family inheritance could not furnish more than a sword or spear.|$|E
60|$|But my head lay another way. I {{had been}} in the East Indies, and had entertained a notion ever since that, if we went thither, we could not fail of making good work of it, and that we might have a safe retreat, and good beef <b>to</b> <b>victual</b> our ship, among my old friends the natives of Zanzibar, on the coast of Mozambique, or the island of St Lawrence. I say, my {{thoughts}} lay this way; and I read so many lectures to them all of the advantages they would certainly make of their strength by the prizes they would take in the Gulf of Mocha, or the Red Sea, and on the coast of Malabar, or the Bay of Bengal, that I amazed them.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the starving Confederates inside Vicksburg - whose lack of food ultimately doomed their defense of the city, rather than the unsuccessful Federal assaults on their defenses - Battery E {{and the rest of}} the Union Army fared well with regard <b>to</b> <b>victuals</b> during the siege. Rice reported that he had to eat here: [...] "flour, tea, coffee, sugar, hardtack, pork, dried apples, rice, beans and fresh beef every other day."

5000|$|Provincial troops under {{local command}} were {{supplied}} according <b>to</b> colonial <b>victualing</b> regulations. They were more generous than the Victualing Act. The Massachusetts military ration had {{in addition to}} the British ration [...] pound (225 grams) sugar, 1 pint (47 centiliters) molasses and 7 gills (82 centiliters) of rum per week. When provincial troops formed part of the field army they were provisioned through the regular army supply chain and rations were issued according <b>to</b> the <b>Victualing</b> Act. According <b>to</b> Pennsylvania's Militia Supply Act of 1755, the weekly ration was 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) of meat, 1 pound (455 grams) of fish, 10 pounds (4.8 kilograms) of bread and 7 gills (82 centiliters) of rum.|$|R
60|$|After this, we {{exchanged}} some presents of refreshments, and, particularly, {{they sent}} me a hogshead of rum, which, was very acceptable; and I sent them in return a runlet of arrack, excusing myself that I had no great store. I sent them also the quantity of one hundred weight of nutmegs and cloves; but the most agreeable present I sent them was twenty pieces of Madagascar dried beef, cured in the sun, the like of which {{they had never seen}} or tasted before; and without question, it is such an excellent way of curing beef, that if I were to be at Madagascar again, I would take in a sufficient quantity of beef so preserved <b>to</b> <b>victual</b> the whole ship for the voyage; and I leave it as a direction to all English seamen that have occasion to use East-India voyages.|$|E
60|$|These solemn assurances made me {{resolve to}} grant them relief, and to send these two over for that purpose; but when every thing was ready, the Spaniard raised an objection, which carried {{a great deal}} of weight in it: You know, Sir, said he, that having been some time with you, I cannot but be {{sensible}} of your stock of rice and corn, sufficient, perhaps for us at present, but not for them, should they come over presently; much less <b>to</b> <b>victual</b> a vessel for an intended voyage. Want might be as great an occasion for them to disagree and rebel, as the children of Israel did against God himself, when they wanted to break bread in the wilderness. And therefore, my advice is to await another harvest and in the mean time cultivate and improve more land, whereby we may have plenty of provisions in order to execute our design.|$|E
60|$|The Englishmen inquired {{when they}} had a feast of that kind, and they told them two moons ago, {{pointing}} to the moon, and then to two-fingers; and that their great king had two hundred prisoners now which he had taken in his war, and they were feeding them to make them fat for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those prisoners, but the others mistaking them, thought they were desirous to have some of them to carry away for their own eating. So they beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then to the rising; which was to signify, that the next morning at sun-rising they would bring some for them; and accordingly the next morning they brought down five women and eleven men, and gave them to the Englishmen to carry with them on their voyage, just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down to a sea-port town <b>to</b> <b>victual</b> a ship.|$|E
6000|$|... "In this matter," [...] he said, [...] "you will think, perhaps, that my {{demands are}} excessive; but I am of opinion {{that money in}} this way would be well spent. As a rule--though I say it before men {{accustomed}} <b>to</b> <b>victualing</b> ships--our crews are vilely provided for. Salt meat they must eat, for no other can be obtained at sea; {{but it should be}} of good quality, likewise the other provisions. I want not biscuits that are alive with maggots, nor moldy flour, nor peas or other things that cattle would turn up their noses at. I want everything to be the very best of its kind, with cider good, and sound, and in fair abundance.|$|R
