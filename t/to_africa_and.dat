5|$|Cucurbita (Latin for gourd) is a genus of {{herbaceous}} vines in {{the gourd}} family, Cucurbitaceae, {{also known as}} cucurbits, native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five species are grown worldwide for their edible fruit, variously known as squash, pumpkin, or gourd depending on species, variety, and local parlance, and for their seeds. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native <b>to</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> belong to the genus Lagenaria, {{which is in the}} same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe. These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels, and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> took {{command of}} the RPF forces, which {{had been reduced to}} fewer than 2,000 troops. Kagame and his soldiers moved west, through Uganda, to the Virunga Mountains, a rugged high-altitude area where the terrain worked in their favor. From there he re-armed and reorganized the army, and carried out fundraising and recruitment from the Tutsi diaspora. Kagame restarted combat in January 1991, with an attack on the northern town of Ruhengeri. Benefiting from the element of surprise, the RPF captured the town and held it for a day before retreating back into the forests.|$|E
5|$|Several months later, a {{metallic}} artifact with inscriptions is discovered {{on the beach}} of Côte d'Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he begins suffering from a headache, seemingly caused by the rubbings. Mulder's condition worsens, but he gains telepathic abilities. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow) tells them that the symbols on the artifact are Navajo. Eventually, Mulder passes into an aggravated delusional state and is placed under observation at a hospital. Hoping to find an answer, Scully rushes <b>to</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> finds the massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E

After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he falls into a dangerous coma. Hoping {{to find a cure}} for her partner, Scully rushes <b>to</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> discovers a massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the ocean. Skinner and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) desperately attempt to find the truth behind the alien object. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder, but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. The Smoking Man has taken Mulder away to transplant the telepathic part of Mulder's brain into his own cranium, but the surgery is a failure.|$|E
5|$|The Natal {{red rock}} hare or greater red rock hare (Pronolagus crassicaudatus) is {{a species of}} mammal in the family Leporidae (rabbits and hares). It has a {{slightly}} grizzled, grayish brown head and reddish brown upperparts.The dense fur is thick and rougher than other rock hares. It is endemic <b>to</b> <b>Africa,</b> <b>and</b> found in southeastern provinces of South Africa (Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal), eastern Lesotho, Swaziland (Highveld and Lumbobo), and southern Mozambique (Maputo Province). It is aherbivore, primarily feeding on grass. It breeds throughout the year, {{and one or two}} pups are usually born in the summer. It is rated as a species ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{held off}} Hannibal in three battles, but then Hannibal smashed a {{succession}} of Roman consular armies. By this time Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal Barca sought to cross the Alps into Italy and join his brother with a second army. Hasdrubal managed to break through into Italy only to be defeated decisively on the Metaurus River. Unable to defeat Hannibal on Italian soil, the Romans boldly sent an army to Africa under Scipio Africanus to threaten the Carthaginian capital. Hannibal was recalled <b>to</b> <b>Africa,</b> <b>and</b> defeated at the Battle of Zama.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{songs that}} could be considered American popular music, as opposed to the popular music of a particular region or ethnicity, were sentimental parlor songs by Stephen Foster and his peers, and songs meant for use in minstrel shows, theatrical productions that featured singing, dancing and comic performances. Minstrel shows generally used African instruments and dance, and featured performers with their faces blackened, a technique called blackface. By the middle of the 19th century, touring companies had taken this music not only to every part of the United States, but also to the UK, Western Europe, and even <b>to</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> Asia. Minstrel shows were generally advertised as though the music of the shows was in an African American style, though this was often not true.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the domesticated sheep goes back to between 11000 and 9000 BC, and the {{domestication}} of the wild mouflon in ancient Mesopotamia. Sheep are among the first animals to have been domesticated by humans, and {{there is evidence of}} sheep farming in Iranian statuary dating to that time period. These sheep were primarily raised for meat, milk, and skins. Woolly sheep began to be developed around 6000 BC in Iran, and cultures such as the Persians relied on sheep's wool for trading. They were then imported <b>to</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> Europe via trading.|$|E
5|$|While the {{domestic}} horse and donkey (along with their feral descendants) exist worldwide, wild equine populations are limited <b>to</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> Asia. Wild equine social systems {{come in two}} forms; a harem system with tight-knit groups consisting of one adult male or stallion, several females or mares and their young or foals; and a territorial system where males establish territories with resources that attract females, which associate very fluidly. In both systems, females {{take care of their}} offspring but males may play a role as well. Equines communicate with each other both visually and vocally. Human activities have threatened wild equine populations and out of the seven living species, only the plains zebra remains widespread and abundant.|$|E

5|$|Basil cultivars are {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} basil. They {{are used in}} a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody perennials and shrubs native <b>to</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum, or sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate <b>to</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Bamford Cott, (6 July 1900 – 18 April 1987), was a British zoologist, an {{authority}} on both natural and military camouflage, and a scientific illustrator and photographer. Many of his field studies took place in Africa, where he was especially interested in the Nile crocodile, the evolution of pattern and colour in animals. During the Second World War, Cott worked as a camouflage expert for the British Army and helped to influence War Office policy on camouflage. His book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940), popular among serving soldiers, was the major textbook on camouflage in zoology of the twentieth century. After the war, he became a Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. As a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, he undertook expeditions <b>to</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> the Amazon to collect specimens, mainly reptiles and amphibians.|$|E
