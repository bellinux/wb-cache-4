The Patient Protection and Accountable Care Act (PPACA) has been passed through Congress and implementation has commenced in the U.S. healthcare system. Community rating systems will {{be the basis for}} health care premiums in the future exchange system. [...] These ratings, pool people in to demographic groups and charge all members a constant rate. The goal of this system is to prevent medical underwriting and decrease the inequities that occur for clients with higher risks of increased medical utilization present in a risk adjusted system. Goldman et al. conducted a study in California that trialed such clusters of insured clients by pooling at the state level, regional level, and metropolitan level. Results from California’s experiment with such a system conclude that the larger the areas pooled, the greater the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

40|$|Evidence shows {{population}} ageing to be historically {{a product}} of economic development, closely associated with high living standards and national affluence. Nonetheless, fears that an aged population leads to economic stagnation and public bankruptcy are widespread.

40|$|A {{majority}} of employees can choose among {{health insurance plans}} of varying generosity. They may switch plans if prices, information, or their health status change. This paper analyzes switching behavior presumptively caused by changes in health status. We show that people who move to a less generous plan have lower medical spending prior to the switch than the average for the generous plan in which they started, while those who move to a more generous plan appear to anticipate higher spending, which they delay until after the switch. This <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> from a less to a more generous plan increases the burden of adverse selection.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{intermediation}} {{in markets}} with an underlying network structure. A good is resold via successive bilateral bargaining between linked intermediaries {{until it reaches}} one of several buyers in the network. We characterize the resale values of all traders in the network. The seller’s profit depends {{not only on the}} number of intermediaries involved in trade, but on the entire set of competing paths of access to buyers brokered by each intermediary. Local competition shapes the outcomes of intermediation. A decomposition of the network into layers of intermediation power describes the endogenous structure of local monopolies and trading paths. Local competition permits full profit extraction in transactions within the same layer, while hold-up problems impose intermediation rents on exchanges across layers. Layers delimit monopoly power from intermediation power. Only players who serve as gateways to lower layers earn significant profits. Resale values decline exponentially with each progressive layer. Trade does not maximize welfare or minimize intermediation. We provide comparative statics with respect to the network architecture and the distribution of intermediation costs. The elimination of a middleman and vertical integration increase the seller’s profit, as does the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> downstream; horizontal integration has ambiguous effects. 1...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Increasing {{indications}} for warfarin {{therapy has}} led to increased pressure on primary care to undertake therapeutic monitoring. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates a primary care model of oral anticoagulation monitoring which utilises computerized decision support (CDSS) and near patient testing (NPT) within a practice nurse-led clinic. Whilst this {{has been shown to}} be a successful model under trial conditions, this paper reports the first data from a long-standing clinic, outside a formal study. METHOD: A prospective evaluation of therapeutic and clinical control of all patients taking warfarin within one inner city general practice. Data were collected via CDSS. RESULTS: 29 patients were seen in 208 appointments. The mean percentage of patients within therapeutic range was 72 %. The costs to the practice were pound sterling 1751. The costs the practice would have incurred had these patients been seen at the hospital with the same frequency would have been pound sterling 2290. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CDSS and NPT for nurse-delivered oral anticoagulation monitoring could enable the safe transfer of the majority of patients from secondary to primary care. Funding mechanisms to support the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> will be essential for most practices, as will be the maintenance of adequate staff training and quality assurance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{economic}} burden of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Sweden in 1994. The cost structure was compared with costs {{from a similar}} study from 1991 and 3 studies from the UK. The cost-of-illness method, based on the human capital theory, was used to estimate the economic burden of MS in Sweden, and a prevalence approach and a top-down method were chosen. Both direct and indirect costs were estimated. The total cost (in Swedish kronor) of MS was SEK 1. 736 billion in Sweden in 1994. The indirect costs (production losses {{as a result of}} morbidity) accounted for about 80 % of the total cost. While the cost of inpatient care was substantial, the drug cost was minimal by comparison. The same cost pattern was present in 1991 in Sweden; however, since the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> for long term care to the municipalities in 1992, 95 % of total cost of the disease fell outside of the healthcare sector. Similar cost structures have been shown in other studies, for example, in the UK. The cost pattern shown in this study, with low costs for medical care and drugs, reflects the fact that few treatment possibilities have existed for MS. However, new relatively expensive drugs have recently been introduced, which may alter the future cost. At present, there is uncertainty regarding how many patients will be treated and the future prices of these new drugs. The cost pattern of MS may very well change dramatically in the future, and successive cost-of-illness studies is one way to assess the consequences of the introduction of new technology.

The wider project produced a 'Synthesis' document (May 2010) : [URL] which {{formed the basis of}} a 'Draft Decision Framework' issued for consultation in August 2010 : [URL] Key Findings from the Task/Report include: The application of liability regimes, and the different variables, to particular fact patterns found in the CMS Case Studies suggests that there are no general answers to questions relating to the recovery and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and liabilities incurred as a result of operational dredging activities to those who were responsible for historic contamination. Each set of facts will give rise to different considerations. It is possible, however, to identify some general points raised by the application of the polluter pays principle (‘PPP’) in the context of liability for the management, movement and disposal of historic CMS: A Costs and liabilities cannot be transferred or recovered unless there is some specific legal mechanism which allows them to be transferred or recovered. B The application of liability regimes and principles to CMS Case Studies suggests that liability on the part of ‘historic polluters’ will not be imposed in most cases of ‘Operational Management’ liabilities C Whilst liability for remedial works required to address CMS in situ might be more readily established, such cases are generally outside the scope of the project D Even where the requirements for establishing liability in law can be met, there may be significant legal and practical obstacles to actually securing money or actions from other parties E The application of the Environmental Liability Directive (‘ELD’) is limited to Contingent Liabilities F Consideration of the ‘Hypotheticals’ relating to novel operational management techniques suggests that the nature of Contingent Liabilities which might arise can be complex G Ownership of CMS sites, and disposal sites, is important as it can result in liability, but will not usually do so where remedial works are not required H The identity of the ‘polluter’ can be considered from different perspectives, including that of the person creating environmental risks, so that there are justifications for applying the PPP to those undertaking CMS Operational Management activities I A range of structures and techniques for the management of Contingent Liabilities can be employed in order to allocate and address legal risk...|$|E
40|$|Remote {{transactions}} globally transfer {{trillions of}} dollars annually. Many of these information exchanges are mediated, implicitly or explicitly, by a complex web of agencies that add to costs and introduce additional opportunities for error or misconduct. Further, additional records are created {{as part of the}} audit and transaction process. These transaction records may be used to enhance performance and generate new transactions, and are consequently of value. Further, these records provide some protection against error or misconduct by allocating responsibility for each transaction component. The conventional approach to remote transaction security is to add complexity and layers of arbitration to minimise losses at the cost of ease of use and flexibility. This research examined transaction characteristics and explored means of reducing the additional costs while providing transactions with security, flexibility and scalability. The critical issue is the control of transaction information which is principally used for dispute resolution and audit. However, it may also be used for unethical and even illegal purposes. Conventional techniques for information security such as encryption, hashing and signatures are reviewed and, additionally, reduction in participant numbers coupled with broadening of the hardware basis has been explored and recommendations are made for securing particular electronic remote transactions. User-management of transaction components and information is discussed, along with user-based mediation of identity, however, some form of arbitration or adjudication relying on transaction records need be assumed. The principal threat to transaction records is not the anonymous hacker, but the obsolescence imposed by ongoing changes in hardware, software and organisational procedures. Conservation of paper documents is an established discipline however, conservation of electronic records and hardware require additional considerations. The credit card transaction is used as a basis {{for the development of a}} prototype to increase the security of transactions under user control but the processes and methods are applicable to a much wider variety of transactions and can be implemented in a secure, flexible format. A user controlled prototype scheme with electronic signature usage is defined and common attack avenues are examined. The prototype software was developed and tested on Nokia mobile phones and the transactions performed provided flexibility and scalability with strong security. User choices in security levels are implemented and each unique transaction is uniquely processed making the transactions resistant to a variety of attacks. It is considered that while “User mediation” is feasible and may become common in some transactions it is unlikely to replace arbitration in high value transactions. While self-enforcing transactions are feasible in arbitrated and adjudicated regimes with some form of pre-arranged context, the existence of selfenforcing transactions without pre-existing context is not yet decided. In summary, these methods may change the way many current transaction regimes and applications do business and in doing so, will alter the balance of power in transactions by putting control onto the user with concomitant <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|E

The paper closes with a "full" lot cost comparison for selected subdivisions in Dallas and Houston. Lot prices are found to be lower in Houston.
