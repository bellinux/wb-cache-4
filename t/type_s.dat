5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as <b>type</b> <b>S,</b> followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E

40|$|In {{the center}} of active galactic nuclei (AGN), the dusty torus absorb the {{radiation}} from the central engine and re-emit in mid-infrared (MIR). Observations have detected moderate anisotropy in the dust MIR emission, {{in the way that}} type 1 AGNs (<b>type</b> 1 <b>s)</b> are mildly brighter in MIR comparing with type 2 sources (<b>type</b> 2 <b>s).</b> However, <b>type</b> 1 <b>s</b> and <b>type</b> 2 <b>s</b> were found to follow statistically the same tight MIR [...] hard X-ray correlation, suggesting the MIR emission is highly isotropic assuming the hard X-ray radiation is inclination independent. We argue this discrepancy could be solved considering the hard X-ray emission in AGN is also mildly anisotropic as we recently discovered. To verify this diagram, we compare the sub-arcsecond 12 μ m flux densities of <b>type</b> 1 <b>s</b> and <b>type</b> 2 <b>s</b> using [OIV]λ 25. 89 μ m emission line as an isotropic luminosity indicator. We find that on average <b>type</b> 1 <b>s</b> are brighter in nuclei 12 μ m radiation by a factor of 2. 6 ± 0. 6 than <b>type</b> 2 <b>s</b> at given [OIV]λ 25. 89 μ m luminosities, confirming the mild anisotropy of the nuclei 12 μ m emission. We show that the anisotropy of the 12 μ m emission we detected is in good agreement with radiative transfer models of clumpy torus. The fact that type 1 and type 2 AGNs follow the same tight MIR [...] hard X-ray correlation instead supports that both the MIR and hard X-ray emission in AGNs are mildly anisotropic.

40|$|Abstract There is {{increasing}} evidence for ribosome het-erogeneity in biological systems. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the ribosomal protein S 15 a is encoded by six separate genes, which {{fall into two}} evolutionarily distinct categories (Type I and Type II). <b>Type</b> I <b>S</b> 15 a is a universally conserved component of cytosolic ribosomes, whereas there is ambiguity as to the specific subcellular location of <b>Type</b> II <b>S</b> 15 a (cytosolic and/or mitochondrial ribosomes). In this study, we investigated the functional significance of the distinct form of ribosomal protein <b>S</b> 15 a (<b>Type</b> II) in Arabidopsis by examining: the evolutionary relationship of eukaryotic S 15 a proteins with respect to organellar homologs, the expression of individual <b>Type</b> II <b>S</b> 15 a genes during various developmental stages by RT-PCR, and the phenotypes of an insertional mutation into the RPS 15 aE gene. The <b>Type</b> II <b>S</b> 15 a proteins are plant specific, and the duplication event {{that gave rise to}} the <b>Type</b> II <b>S</b> 15 a genes appears to have occurred during the evolution of land plants. The genes encoding <b>Type</b> II <b>S</b> 15 a in Arabidopsis are differentially expressed, and mutant plants in which the gene encoding S 15 aE is knocked down produce larger leaves, longer roots, and possess larger cells than wild-type plants suggesting that the RPS 15 aE isoform of <b>Type</b> II <b>S</b> 15 a may act as a regulator of translational activity. Our results add significantly {{to the understanding of the}} protein constitution of plant ribosomes and the functional signifi-cance of ribosome heterogeneity...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{unification}} {{scheme of}} Seyfert galaxies {{predicts that the}} observed differences between type 1 and type 2 Seyfert galaxies are solely due to the differing orientations of the toroidal-shaped obscuring material around AGN. The observed X-ray spectra of Seyfert <b>type</b> 2 <b>s</b> compared to <b>type</b> 1 <b>s</b> {{are expected to be}} affected by higher absorbing column density due to the edge-on view of the obscuring torus. We study the 0. 5 - 10 keV X-ray spectral properties of Seyfert <b>type</b> 1 <b>s</b> and <b>type</b> 2 <b>s</b> with the aim to test the predictions of Seyfert unification scheme in the X-ray regime. Methods: We use an optically selected Seyfert sample in which <b>type</b> 1 <b>s</b> and <b>type</b> 2 <b>s</b> have matched distributions in the orientation independent parameters of AGN and host galaxy. Results: The 0. 5 - 10 keV XMM-Newton pn X-ray spectra of Seyfert galaxies are in general best fitted with a model consists of an absorbed power-law, a narrow Gaussian fitted to the Fe Kα emission line and an often seen soft excess component characterized by either a thermal plasma model with temperature kT ∼ 0. 1 - 1. 0 keV and/or a steep power-law. The 2. 0 - 10 keV hard X-ray continuum emission in several Seyfert <b>type</b> 2 <b>s</b> is reflection dominated and suggests the Compton-thick obscuration. Results on the statistical comparison of the distributions of the observed X-ray luminosities in the soft (0. 5 - 2. 0 keV) and hard (2. 0 - 10. 0 keV) bands, the X-ray absorbing column densities, the equivalent widths of Fe Kα line and the flux ratios of hard X-ray to [OIII] λ 5007 Å for the two Seyfert subtypes are consistent with the obscuration and orientation based unification scheme.

40|$|Context: The {{unification}} {{scheme of}} Seyfert galaxies hypothesizes that Seyfert <b>type</b> 1 <b>s</b> and <b>type</b> 2 <b>s</b> are intrinsically similar and the observed {{differences between the}} two subtypes are solely due to the differing orientations of toroidal-shaped obscuring material around the AGN. In the framework of the unification scheme, both the Seyfert subtypes are expected to show similar intrinsic nuclear properties, such as the absorption-corrected AGN X-ray luminosity, bolometric luminosity, accretion rate and the mass of the supermassive black hole. Aims: To test the predictions of the Seyfert unification scheme, we make statistical comparison of the distributions of: (i) the absorption-corrected 2. 0 - 10 keV X-ray luminosities, (ii) the bolometric luminosities, (iii) the black hole masses and, (iv) the Eddington ratios, of Seyfert <b>type</b> 1 <b>s</b> and <b>type</b> 2 <b>s.</b> Methods: We use an optically selected Seyfert sample in which <b>type</b> 1 <b>s</b> and <b>type</b> 2 <b>s</b> are matched in properties that are independent to the orientation of the obscuring torus, the AGN axis and the host galaxy. Results: The distributions of the absorption-corrected 2. 0 - 10 keV X-ray luminosities, the bolometric luminosities, the black masses and, the Eddington ratios are statistically similar for the two Seyfert subtypes, consistent with the orientation and obscuration based Seyfert unification scheme. The Eddington ratio distributions suggest that both the Seyfert subtypes are accreting at sub-Eddington level with wide span of Eddington ratios i. e., 10 ^- 4 - 10 ^- 1.

40|$|From multi-wavelength {{observations}} of LAEs,we know that while many LAEs {{appear to be}} young and less massive,a noticeable fraction of LAEs possess much older populations of stars and larger stellar mass. How these two classes of LAEs are concordant with the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario has not been understood clearly so far. In this paper,we model LAEs by three-dimensional cosmological simulations of dark halo merger in a CDM universe. As a result,it is shown that the age of simulated LAEs can spread {{over a wide range}} from 2 * 10 ^ 6 yr to 9 * 10 ^ 8 yr. Also,we find that {{there are two types of}} LAEs, in one of which the young half-mass age is comparable to the mean age of stellar component,and in the other of which the young half-mass age is appreciably shorter than the mean age. We define the former as Type 1 LAEs and the latter as Type 2 LAEs. A Type 1 corresponds to early starburst in a young galaxy,whereas a Type 2 does to delayed starburst in an evolved galaxy,as a consequence of delayed accretion of a subhalo onto a larger parent halo. Thus,the same halo can experience a Type 2 LAE-phase as well as a Type 1 LAE-phase in the merger history. <b>Type</b> 1 <b>s</b> are expected to be younger than 1. 5 * 10 ^ 8 yr,less dusty,and less massive with stellar mass M*< 10 ^ 8 Msun,while <b>Type</b> 2 <b>s</b> are older than 1. 5 * 10 ^ 8 yr,even dustier,and as massive as M*~ 10 ^ 8 - 10 ^ 10 Msun. The fraction of <b>Type</b> 2 <b>s</b> in all LAEs is a function of redshift. <b>Type</b> 2 <b>s</b> discriminated clearly from <b>Type</b> 1 <b>s</b> in two color diagram of z'-H vs J-K. We find that the brightness distribution of LyA in <b>Type</b> 2 <b>s</b> is more extended than the main stellar component,in contrast to <b>Type</b> 1 <b>s.</b> This is not only because delayed starbursts tend to occur in the outskirts of a parent galaxy,but also because LyA photons are effectively absorbed by dust in an evolved galaxy. Hence,the extent of LyA emission may be an additional measure to distinguish <b>Type</b> 2 <b>s</b> from <b>Type</b> 1...|$|R
