5|$|Larsson was {{commissioned}} to decorate all {{the walls of}} the central staircase in the museum except for one, and he wanted <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> last wall as well. He intended the last wall to present a contrast to the other illustrations of the staircase. Whereas the painting Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523 presented a midsummer theme with a triumphant king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself for his people.|$|E
5|$|Paintings from a cave at Hindagala {{date back}} to the late Anuradhapura period, and may even belong to the same period as the Sigiriya {{paintings}}. The paintings of Sigiriya and Hindagala are the only surviving specimens of art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. However, remnants of paintings indicate that walls and ceilings of some buildings and the inside walls of stupas and vahalkadas were also painted.

5|$|The Brancacci Chapel, in the {{basilica}} of Santa Maria del Carmine, was founded around 1366/7 by Piero di Piuvichese Brancacci. The chapel passed to Piero's nephew, Felice Brancacci, who some time between 1423 and 1425 commissioned the painter Masolino <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> walls {{with a series}} of frescoes from the life of Saint Peter. Peter was the name-saint of the founder, and the patron saint of the Brancacci family, but the choice also reflected support for the Roman papacy during the Great Schism.|$|E
5|$|The art {{department}} {{made sure}} that the 2035 underground world would only use pre-1996 technology {{as a means to}} depict the bleakness of the future. Gilliam, Beecroft, and Crispian Sallis (set decorator) went to several flea markets and salvage warehouses looking for materials <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> sets. The majority of visual effects sequences were created by Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio that Gilliam founded in the late 1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston (The Golden Compass, Casino Royale). Additional digital compositing was done by The Mill, while Cinesite provided film scanning services.|$|E
50|$|The couple {{commissioned}} French architect René Sergent in 1911 {{to design}} a mansion for Errazúriz's future retirement from the diplomatic corps, {{in which he had}} been Ambassador to France for a number of years. The ornate Neoclassical structure inspired the Bosch family to commission a similar palace nearby (today the United States Ambassador's residence). Completed in 1916, the couple devoted the following two years <b>to</b> <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> palace, purchasing a large volume of antiques and other objets d'art.|$|R

5|$|The {{sunflowers}} {{were painted}} <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> walls {{in anticipation of}} Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the Yellow House's guest room in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and included them in his Les XX in Brussels exhibit. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{works are}} {{displayed}} on the Richelieu Wing's first floor and in the Apollo Gallery, named by the painter Charles Le Brun, who was commissioned by LouisXIV (the Sun King) <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> space in a solar theme.

The Renaissance art holdings include Giambologna's bronze Nessus and Deianira and the tapestry Maximillian's Hunt. From later periods, highlights include Madame de Pompadour's Sèvres vase collection and NapoleonIII's apartments.|$|E

5|$|Within the books, {{the nature}} of the character's {{political}} opinions were often expressed through the character's rhetoric, and by heavy use of the circle-A as a character gimmick. The character's tools often incorporate the circle-A motif into them. In his earliest incarnation, he would also use red spray-paint to leave the circle-A as a calling card at crime scenes. The circle-A has also been used <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> character's base of operations, either as graffiti or suspended from wall tapestries.|$|E
5|$|A more {{elaborate}} style known as decorated Gothic, applying ornamentation to vaults and pillars, particularly using curved motifs, {{began to be}} adopted {{in the thirteenth century}} and was characteristic of Scottish church building in the fourteenth century. It was used at Dunblane Cathedral, built in the thirteenth century, particularly <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> nave and East end. At Fortrose in the Highlands the elaborate decoration of this style is still visible in the south aisle. One of the finest examples is Sweetheart Abbey near Dumfries, a Cistercian monastery, named after the burial of John de Balliol's heart alongside the body of his wife. The period of the Wars of Independence (1296–1357) saw a large number of ecclesiastical buildings ruined, including Melrose and Jedburgh Abbeys. Church building was largely confined to the parish churches in the relatively secure areas like Fife, as at St. Monans, originally a church of the Dominican friars.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> house for Halloween and is {{reaching}} for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857 Burne-Jones joined Morris, Valentine Prinsep, J.R. Spencer Stanhope and others in Rossetti's ill-fated scheme <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> walls of the Oxford Union. None of the {{painters}} had mastered the technique of fresco, and their pictures had begun to peel from the walls before they were completed. In 1859 Burne-Jones made his first journey to Italy. He saw Florence, Pisa, Siena, Venice and other places, and appears to have found the gentle and romantic Sienese more attractive than any other school. Rossetti's influence still persisted, and is visible, more strongly perhaps than ever before, in the two watercolours of 1860, Sidonia von Bork and Clara von Bork. Both paintings illustrate the 1849 gothic novel Sidonia the Sorceress by Lady Wilde, a translation of Sidonia Von Bork: Die Klosterhexe (1847) by Johann Wilhelm Meinhold.|$|E
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant {{to look as if}} it had been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted over the top and one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E
5|$|The faux {{finished}} {{interior of}} the church incorporates groined vaults in the Gothic architecture style permitting very ample illumination from lateral windows. The steel columns, walls and ceiling were painted by Lorenzo Rocha, Isabelo Tampingco and Félix Martínez to {{give the appearance of}} marble and jasper. Trompe l'oeil paintings of saints and martyrs by Rocha were used <b>to</b> <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> interiors of the church. True to the Gothic revival spirit of the church are its confessionals, pulpit, altars and five retablos designed by Lorenzo Guerrero and Rocha. The sculptor Eusebio Garcia carved the statues of holy men and women. Six holy water fonts were constructed for the church, each crafted from marble obtained from Romblon.|$|E
