50|$|The Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine, or SMARTS for short, is a {{computer}} program designed to evaluate the surface solar irradiance components in the shortwave spectrum (spectral range 280 to 4000 nm) under cloudless conditions.

50|$|Optical systems utilize data {{captured}} from image {{sensors to}} triangulate the 3D {{position of a}} subject between two or more cameras calibrated to provide overlapping projections. Data acquisition is traditionally implemented using special markers attached to an actor; however, more recent systems are able to generate accurate data by <b>tracking</b> <b>surface</b> features identified dynamically for each particular subject. Tracking {{a large number of}} performers or expanding the capture area is accomplished by the addition of more cameras. These systems produce data with three degrees of freedom for each marker, and rotational information must be inferred from the relative orientation of three or more markers; for instance shoulder, elbow and wrist markers providing the angle of the elbow. Newer hybrid systems are combining inertial sensors with optical sensors to reduce occlusion, increase the number of users and improve the ability to track without having to manually clean up data.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{movement}} of the jaw during speech and chewing has frequently been studied by <b>tracking</b> <b>surface</b> landmarks on the chin. However, {{the extent to which}} chin motions accurately represent those of the underlying mandible remains in question. In this investigation, the movements of a pellet attached to the incisor of the mandible were compared with those of pellets attached to different regions of the chin. Method: Ten healthy talkers served as participants. Three speaking contexts were recorded from each participant: word, sentence, and paragraph. Chin position errors were estimated by computing the standard distance between the mandibular incisor pellet and the chin pellets. Results: Relative to the underlying mandible, chin pellets moved with an average absolute and relative error of 0. 81 mm and 7. 30 %, respectively. The movements of chin and mandibular pellets were tightly coupled in time. Conclusion: The chin tracking errors observed in this investigation are considered acceptable for descriptive studies of oromotor behavior, particularly in situations where mandibular placements are not practical (e. g., young children or edentulous adults). The observed amount of error, however, may not be tolerable for fine-grained analyses of mandibular biomechanics. Several guidelines are provided for minimizing error associated with <b>tracking</b> <b>surface</b> landmarks on the chin...|$|E

The tracking method is validated in both simulation and experiment on a silicon breast phantom which has similar elasticity characteristics to human breast tissue. Given mean reprojection error ranges between 0. 3 and 0. 5 pixels for 2 M pixel cameras the end result is sub-millimetre surface tracking of a silicon phantom actuated at 100 Hz. This highly accurate, fast and low cost method of tracking is thus well suited to a DIET system. 1...|$|E
