40|$|Rationale: Mastery {{motivation}} {{is a factor}} underlying behavioural change in pediatric physiotherapy. Parents and children can inform about this concept by filling in the Dimensions of Mastery Questionnaire (DMQ). This study examined if {{children and their parents}} differ in perceptions on mastery motivation. This will inform pediatric physiotherapists about the type of goal setting needed. 	Methods: A group of 29 families were included. A comparative survey design was used. Repeated-measures ANOVA or the Friedman test were used to compare the ratings of fathers, mothers and their children. 	Results: No {{significant differences were found between}} parent- and self-report scores on the total mastery motivation scale of the DMQ. A few differences in perceptions did appear on various other DMQ-subscales. Specifically, children rated themselves lower on object oriented persistence and higher on gross motor persistence than fathers did. Fathers and mothers rated their children lower on social persistence with children than did children rated themselves. Regarding negative reactions to failure, mothers scored higher in their ratings than did their children. Finally, teens rated <b>their</b> <b>general</b> <b>competence</b> higher than mothers did. 	Conclusion: Parents and their children did not differ in their view on the total mastery motivation of the child. This implicates that parents, children and pediatric physiotherapists can work in agreement in setting up treatment goals related to mastery motivation. However, professionals should also be aware of perceptions that could differ between parents and teens, and mothers and children on social aspects and expressive aspects of mastery motivation respectively...|$|E

The nursing skills are necessary competence to perform the nursing profession. Represent this area of knowledge, skills and attitudes that are acquired through education. One of the ways to qualify nurses to the profession, is today a university course. The second method is a specialized education, provided that the candidate meets the conditions for admission and received his professional competence to practice nurses. Determination of the competencies of nurses in the Czech Republic is governed by Law No. 96 / 2004 Coll. Acquisition and recognition of eligibility for non-medical professions and for activities related to providing health care and amending certain related acts, the last decree on the activities of health workers and other professionals, No. 55 / 2011 Coll. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretical cross section contains the history of pediatrics and nursing, selected chapters from health legislation and development of children's ward in České Budějovice Hospital. For the practical part, I chose a qualitative research method of interviewing and pediatric nurses. The research sample consisted of 10 nurses who work or have worked on the inpatient pediatric ward. There were set three goals in this work. The first task was to determine the development of competencies nurses. The second objective was {{to determine the extent of}} the authority nurses at present. In the last part of my job I surveyed whether nurses are aware of <b>their</b> <b>general</b> <b>competence.</b> The research showed that their competencies developed. A large share of this development has the technological development in medicine, new insights in treatment and use of modern diagnostic methods and increasing nursing education.

40|$|The paper {{denotes the}} vital {{need for the}} human-centered pro jects of {{education}} updates and develops {{the idea of the}} culture adequacy raised by Y. V. Larin in «Education in search of the adequacy principle». The author regards culture as a creative basis for upbringing the young generation, and provides the detailed analysis of its semantic content; in his opinion, culture contains neither value neutral nor destructive connotations. The world of culture incorporates the model samples of human subjectivity, based on the main criterion of perfection. By revealing the model samples of cultural heritage to students, a teacher develops <b>their</b> <b>general</b> cultural <b>competences</b> and the related individual, professional and civic qualities. Consequently, the author argues that socio-economic and political problems, including the renovation of social institutions and industrial spheres, can be solved by cultivating and developing the universality and integrity of productive and creative human forces. Additionally, the paper proves the impossibility of separate development of the general cultural and professional competences in educational process.  </p...|$|R

It is necessary to develop a so-called “analytical mentality”. The aim of the project presented in this paper was to develop the theoretical insights and the practical skills of a group of students for this kind of research. They worked together throughout the duration of the project, especially in the collec¬tion of empiric material: i. e. the recording of conversations between foreign and German stu¬dents, the transcription of the material, a group discussion on the data and finally its analysis. This articles aims at showing what students can learn by doing this kind of work, based on examples of the collected empirical material: (1) they will be introduced to the different levels and stages of the research process and have the chance to develop a methodical and methodological competence; (2) <b>their</b> <b>general</b> communicative <b>competences</b> and <b>their</b> special competences of the foreign language will increase, as well as (3) their knowledge of intercultural learning by working with authentic data of intercultural communication.

The course was programmed regardless of the particular individuals and no previous requirements were needed. Two initial tests were passed to {{the students at the}} beginning of the semester: the first one to evaluate their needs and motivation and the second one to measure <b>their</b> <b>general</b> communicative <b>competence.</b> The results were heterogeneous. The students were informed of their results and also of the level they should reach to pass the course, especially those with low marks. With respect to their motivation they manifested two orientations: Labour and integrative reasons. Taking into account their 'labour reasons' some units closely related to their speciality were included and the final evaluation was modified giving some weight also to the specific English component (75 % GE, 25 % ESAP). The analysis reveals that, according to our initial assumption, those students with a better communicative competence {{at the beginning of the}} course obtained the best results in the final exam.

The basal expression of ch-TLR 3, 4, 15 and 21 was studied using real time PCR with SYBR green chemistry using 18 S-rRNA as the housekeeping gene. Results: PBMCs isolated from Kadaknath chicks exhibited a significantly higher (p< 0. 05) constitutive expression of ch-TLR 3, ch-TLR 15 and ch-TLR 21 genes when compared to Aseel chicks. In comparison to Aseel, Kadaknath chicks recorded 14. 774, 7. 182 and 3. 507 fold higher expressions of ch-TLR 3, ch-TLR 15 and ch-TLR 21 genes, respectively. In contrast, the constitutive expression of ch-TLR 4 was found to be higher (by 1. 733 fold) in Aseel chicks. Conclusion: Our results indicate that Kadaknath chicks are equipped with a better innate immune competence in comparison to Aseel chicks. [Vet World 2013; 6 (8. 000) : 568 - 572...|$|R

Today’s curricula in many ways reduce technology to abstract concepts, calculations and models, and create a gap between the academic programs and the practical applications in the society. We explore two (Australia and Norway) initiatives on industry-based student training and discuss how these initiatives address and bridge the gap.

Busca-se compreendê-los à luz de autores que analisam o trabalho e suas transformações, segundo uma perspectiva clínica, a exemplo de Zarifian, Dejours e Schwartz, ao lado daqueles que tratam especificamente do trabalho bancário, como Jinkings, Merlo e Barbarini. Realizaram-se dezesseis entrevistas, com pessoas que exercem gerências gerais ou intermediárias. Evidenciou-se a intensa pressão a que estão submetidos os gerentes quanto à capacitação, alcance de resultados e disponibilidade para a empresa. Constatou-se, entretanto, que, mesmo atendendo aos requisitos exigidos, não há garantia de estabilidade na função. Empresas requisitam sempre mais, solicitando um patamar inalcançável, desgastante para a saúde.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{test whether}} {{higher levels of}} <b>general</b> <b>competence</b> are linked to more {{frequent}} use of refusal assertiveness that is in turn related to less subsequent smoking among inner city adolescents.  METHODS—Longitudinal study conducted during three year middle school or junior high school period. A sample of 1459  students attending 22  middle (ages 11 - 14 years) and junior high (ages 12 - 15 years) schools in New York City participated. Students completed surveys at baseline, one year follow up, and two year follow up. The students self reported smoking, decision making skills, personal efficacy, and refusal assertiveness. Teams of three to five data collectors administered the questionnaire following a standardised protocol. These data were collected in school during a regular 40  minute class period.  RESULTS—Based on the tested structural equation model, decision making and personal efficacy (that is, <b>general</b> <b>competence)</b> predicted higher refusal assertiveness and this greater assertiveness predicted less smoking at the two year follow up. The tested model had a good fit and was parsimonious and consistent with theory.  CONCLUSIONS—Adolescent smoking prevention programmes often teach refusal skills {{in order to help}} youth resist peer pressure to smoke. The present findings suggest that teaching <b>general</b> <b>competence</b> skills as well may help to reduce smoking because youth with better personal efficacy and decision making skills are better able to implement smoking refusal strategies.    Keywords: adolescent smoking; competence skills; refusal assertiveness; peer pressur...|$|R
