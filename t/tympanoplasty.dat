40|$|Introduction This paper {{deals with}} otologic {{surgical}} procedures {{performed in a}} an Ear, Nose and Throat Depertment during a 15 -year period. The authors compared the number of otologic surgical procedures {{with the number of}} laryngomicroscopies and procedures performed in Waldeyer's ring. RESULTS From January 1, 1987 to December 31, 2001, 1184 patients underwent the following surgical procedures in total endotracheal anesthesia: 285 paracenteses, 473 ventilation tubes insertions, 175 antrotomies or mastoidectomies, 194 <b>tympanoplasties,</b> 34 radical mastoidectomies, 4 facial nerve decompressions, 5 exostoses or osteoma of the external auditory canal operations and 14 stapedectomies. DISCUsSION Otologic surgical procedures are presented in table 1. In Yugoslav literature Topolac reports approximately 700 <b>tympanoplasties</b> in a 10 -year period (1968 - 1978). Radonjić and associates report 2272 ear operations in the period 1975 - 1985. Distribution of operations is presented in table 2, whereas in table 3 we can see that the number of operated ears is much greater than the number of operated patients. CONCLUSION We think that the number of operations is not bigger, because we operate only in critical cases. Our human and technical resources should provide advanced ear microsurgery, but only with financial and organizational support...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTympanoplasty aims at {{rebuilding}} {{the tympanic membrane}} with or without middle ear functional recovery. AimTo evaluate the surgical results of <b>tympanoplasties</b> with a retro-auricular surgical approach at a medical residency unit. Materials and MethodsThirty-nine patients with diagnosis of simple chronic otitis media were evaluated; these patients underwent tymplanoplasty by a retro-auricular approach (underlay technique) at a medical residency unit. Patients were included in a prospective medical and audiologic investigation protocol that consisted of a clinical, otomicroscopic and audiometric evaluation. All procedures were supervised by training specialists otorrinolaringology. ResultsThe rate of surgical success - full integration of the graft - was 95 % of cases. Improvement of hearing, as demonstrated in audiometry, occurred in 72 % of cases. Improvement in tinnitus was demonstrated subjectively on a visual analog scale in 69 % of cases. ConclusionTympanoplasty through a retro-auricular approach is easy to perform. Full graft integration occurred in 95 % of cases and was independent of factors deemed by many authors as relevant. The results - improvement {{of the quality of}} hearing and tinnitus - were significant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Uganda Hearing Project is a {{non-profit}} program assisting with teaching of ear surgery in Uganda. The project started with cadaveric temporal bone courses in 2003 and 2005, including donation of operating microscopes and ear instruments. In 2006, three surgical groups started regular surgical teaching visits. Methods A retrospective chart review {{of all cases}} of middle ear surgery performed in Uganda from 2003 to 2009. Surgeries by local surgeons without foreign presence were coded as ‘local’ and those performed with assistance of visiting surgeons were coded as ‘visitors’. Results In 2005, two middle ear surgeries using the operating microscope were done in the Ugandan teaching hospitals by Ugandan Otolaryngologists alone. From the onset of surgical visits in 2006, a total of 193 middle ear surgeries were performed - 115 tympanomastoidectomies, 77 <b>tympanoplasties,</b> and 1 cochlear implant. In 2006 (one surgical teaching visit), 6 middle ear surgeries were performed with visiting surgeon presence and 2 surgeries were performed by the local team alone. This increased in 2007 (2 visits) and again in 2008 (3 visits) to 34 cases with visiting surgeon presence and 48 local cases. Conclusions The temporal bone courses and donation of operating microscopes to Ugandan hospitals have revolutionized middle ear surgery in Uganda. The surgical visits by the Uganda Hearing Project {{have led to a}} 24 -fold increase in annual middle ear surgeries performed with the operating microscope by Ugandan Otolaryngologists. Increased frequency of surgical visits was correlated with an increase in local surgical output, hopefully resulting in improved care for Ugandans with ear disorders...|$|R

40|$|New {{options for}} diode laser {{treatment}} of otherwise therapy-resistant or -refractory otorhinologic diseases were investigated in experimental laboratory settings and in clinical practice. In the everyday work of ENT physicians, recurrent cholesteatoma, rhinitis medicamentosa, recurrent nasal polyposis, therapy-resistant allergic rhinitis, and chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction {{are of particular}} importance within this area. In cholesteatoma, the applied lasers and absorption enhancers proved as potentially suitable instruments of a laser-assisted cholesteatoma surgery. The presented procedures resulted in vitro in a destruction of up to 92 % of all stained and irradiated cholesteatoma cells, while unstained irradiated cells were not impaired. However, selective antibody-mediated staining was not achieved due to cross reactions with middle ear mucosa cells. To reduce cholesteatoma recurrence rate and to realize selective postoperative photodynamic therapy of residual cholesteatoma cells, the chromophore has to be coupled to a particular antibody that binds exclusively to an easily accessible specific cholesteatoma surface antigen. In patients with therapy-refractory rhinitis medicamentosa, the diode laser based reduction of hyperplastic inferior turbinates resulted in a long-term improvement of nasal obstruction. Due to the enhanced nasal airflow, the psycho-physical addiction to topical decongestants („privinism“) was broken in {{the large majority of}} patients followed by complete stop of drug abuse and sustained recovery of damaged nasal mucosa. In chronic rhinosinusitis with recurrent nasal polyposis, the diode laser polypectomy effectively improved the major clinical symptoms nasal obstruction and dys-/anosmia because of an optimized ventilation and reopened polyp-obstructed olfactory clefts. Combination with a high dosed, topical beclomethasone dipropionate aerosol spray application caused in most affected patients a long-lasting stabilization of the local endonasal condition. This minimally invasive, easily reapplicable treatment option increases the patients quality of life and seems to reduce or delay the need for major paranasal sinus surgery under general anaesthesia. In patients with severe seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, endonasal laser ablation of hypertrophic turbinates and obstructing septal pathologies resulted in improvement of all typical allergy-associated nasal symptoms, especially obstruction and rhinorrhea. Dangerous long-term application of topical decongestants and systemic corticosteroids can be avoided, especially in cases of insufficient or contraindicated antiallergic standard therapy. In therapy-resistant chronic tube dysfunction with disturbed equalization of middle ear pressure, laser ablation at the epipharyngeal dorsal ostium of the Eustachian tube realized a durable improvement of middle ear ventilation, associated otological symptoms, and quality of life. The success rate of <b>tympanoplasties</b> in patients with eardrum perforation was increased when a preoperative laser tuboplasty was performed. Diode laser assisted tubal shaping treats not only the consequences of secondarily resulting middle ear diseases, but enables causal treatment directly at the Eustachian tube. In summary, the diode laser proved to be a very suitable, safe and well-tolerated treatment option in the different investigated, otherwise therapy-resistant or -refractory otorhinologic diseases...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tympanoplasty</b> is the {{surgical}} technique of {{removal of the}} retracted area from the middle ear and reconstruction of the tympanic membrane. Some surgeons use cartilage (taken from the outer ear) to stiffen the eardrum {{with the aim of}} preventing further retraction. Surgical removal is required once a cholesteatoma has formed.|$|E
5000|$|Myringoplasty is {{the closure}} of the {{perforation}} of pars tensa of the tympanic membrane. When myringoplasty is combined with ossicular reconstruction, it is called <b>tympanoplasty.</b> The operation is performed with the patient supine and face turned to one side. The graft material most commonly used for the surgery is temporalis fascia. The tragal cartilage [...] and tragal perichondrium are also used as the graft by some surgeons.|$|E
50|$|The {{perforation}} may heal {{in a few}} weeks, or {{may take}} up to a few months. Some perforations require intervention. This may {{take the form of}} a paper patch to promote healing (a simple procedure by an ear, nose and throat specialist), or surgery (<b>tympanoplasty).</b> However, in some cases, the perforation can last several years and will be unable to heal naturally. Such cases are usually a result of a perforation being surgically induced during an operation involving the ear.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} this would be a patient {{breathing}} nitrous oxide in an operating room (surrounded by air). Cuffs on the endotracheal tubes must be monitored as nitrous oxide will diffuse into the air filled space causing the volume to increase. In laparoscopic surgery, nitrous oxide is avoided since the gas will diffuse into the abdominal or pelvic cavities causing an increase in internal pressure. In the case of a <b>tympanoplasty,</b> the skin flap will not lay down as the nitrous oxide will be diffusing into the middle ear.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tympanoplasty</b> can be {{performed}} through the ear canal (transcanal approach), through an incision in the ear (endaural approach) or through an incision behind the ear (postauricular approach). A graft may be taken to reconstruct the tympanic membrane. Common graft sites include the temporalis fascia and the tragus. The surgery takes ½ to 1 hour if done through the ear canal and 1 {{and a half to}} two hours if an incision is needed. It is done under local or general anesthesia.

50|$|Gradually the {{operating}} microscope {{began to be}} used for ear operations. In the 1950s many otologists began to use it in the fenestration operation, usually to perfect the opening of the fenestra in the lateral semicircular canal. The revival of the stapes mobilization operation by Rosen, in 1953, made the use of the microscope mandatory, although it was not used by the originators of the technique, Kessel (1878), Boucheron (1888) and Miot (1890). Mastoidectomies began to be performed with the surgical microscope and so were the <b>tympanoplasty</b> techniques that became known in the early 1950s. The stapes mobilization operation had varying results and was soon replaced by stapedectomy, first described by John Shea, Jr.; this was an operation that was always performed with the microscope.|$|E
5000|$|Neurotologists are {{physicians}} who have specialized in otolaryngology and then further specialized in neurological {{conditions of the}} ear and related structures. Many general otolaryngologists are trained in otology or middle ear surgery, performing surgery such as a <b>tympanoplasty,</b> or a reconstruction of the ear drum, when a hole remains from a prior ear tube or prior infection. Otologic surgery also includes treatment of conductive hearing loss by reconstructing the hearing bones, or ossicles, {{as a result of}} infection, or by replacing the stapes bone with a stapedectomy for otosclerosis. Neurotology encompasses more complex surgery of the inner ear not typically performed by general otolaryngologists, such as removal of complex cholesteatoma, labyrinthectomy, surgery of the endolymphatic sac for meniere's disease and cochlear implant surgery, because of the additional risk of hearing loss, vertigo, and facial nerve paralysis. It is more and more common in the United States as well as around the world for otolaryngologists to obtain additional advanced training in neurotology, which requires an additional one or two years of fellowship training after five years of residency.|$|E
50|$|Otology is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} which studies normal and pathological anatomy and physiology of the ear (hearing and vestibular sensory systems and related structures and functions) {{as well as their}} diseases, diagnosis and treatment. Otologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the middle ear and mastoid related to chronic otitis media, such as <b>tympanoplasty,</b> or ear drum surgery, ossiculoplasty, or surgery of the hearing bones, and mastoidectomy. Otology also includes surgical treatment of conductive hearing loss, such as stapedectomy surgery for otosclerosis. Neurotology, a related field of medicine and subspecialty of Otolaryngology, is the study of diseases of the inner ear, which can lead to hearing and balance disorders. Neurotologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the inner ear or surgery that involves entering the inner ear with risk to the hearing and balance organs, including labyrinthectomy, cochlear implant surgery, and surgery for tumors of the temporal bone, such as intracanlicular acoustic neuromas. Neurotology is expanded to include surgery of the lateral skull base to treat intracranial tumors related to the ear and surrounding nerve and vascular structures, such as large cerebellar pontine angle acoustic neuromas, glomus jugulare tumors and facial nerve tumors.|$|E
40|$|Introduction  Bilateral {{same day}} type I <b>tympanoplasty</b> scores over {{unilateral}} type I <b>tympanoplasty</b> {{in terms of}} convenience and conservation of resources but, it is rarely performed because of theoretical risk of postoperative sensorineural deafness. Materials and Methods A total of 60 patients with central perforation of tympanic membrane of both ears were included in this study. Thirty patients had undergone unilateral type I <b>tympanoplasty</b> and {{an equal number of}} patients were treated with bilateral type I <b>tympanoplasty</b> in the same sitting. The results were compared to evaluate the advantages and efficacy of single sitting bilateral type I <b>tympanoplasty</b> with unilateral type I <b>tympanoplasty.</b> Result Perforation closure was successful in 94. 6 % and 93. 3 % ears while hearing improvement in 82. 1 % and 86. 6 % in group I (bilateral <b>tympanoplasty)</b> and group II (unilateral <b>tympanoplasty)</b> respectively. Mean hearing gain for successfully operated ears in group I (both left and right) and group II is 18. 1 dB and 16. 5 dB. None of the patients developed iatrogenic sensorineural hearing loss. Discussion Bilateral perforations of the TM is a common finding and CSOM is found to be the most common cause in more than 90 % of patients. The outcome of bilateral single stage <b>tympanoplasty</b> is sparse in the literature. Most of the reports pertain to unilateral operations with average success rates of about 60 – 100 %.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} butterfly cartilage <b>tympanoplasty</b> for small- and medium-sized central perforations and compare it with temporalis fascia <b>tympanoplasty.</b> Materials and Methods: A prospective, comparative study was conducted on 110 patients, divided into two groups. Patients of tubotympanic type of chronic suppurative otitis media with 2 – 6 mm size perforation {{were included in the}} study. Fifty-five patients were operated by temporalis fascia Type I <b>tympanoplasty</b> and rest 55 by butterfly cartilage <b>tympanoplasty</b> (transcanal technique) under local anesthesia. Results were compared in terms of pre- and post-operative air-bone gap improvement and success rates. Results: In our study, in terms of outcomes, both techniques had similar results. The success rate was 93. 7 % in butterfly cartilage <b>tympanoplasty</b> and 96. 3 % in temporalis fascia group. However, in terms of time taken, butterfly cartilage <b>tympanoplasty</b> took less time (about 30 min) than temporalis fascia (about 55 min). Conclusion: Transcanal butterfly cartilage <b>tympanoplasty</b> is a very good alternative in small- and medium-sized perforations for conventional temporalis fascia <b>tympanoplasty</b> as it is simple, takes less time, day care procedure, on table hearing improvement, cosmetically no postoperative scar, no need of post aural preparation, and patient can go home within hours...|$|E

40|$|A {{combined}} <b>tympanoplasty</b> method, the mobile-bridge <b>tympanoplasty,</b> {{has been}} applied at the Clinic for Ear, Nose and Throat Diseases in Novi Sad since 1998. Mobile-bridge <b>tympanoplasty</b> is performed at our Clinic by applying Feldmann’s procedure utilizing a microsurgical oscillating saw. It {{is a combination of}} closed and open techniques for surgical treatment of middle ear diseases. In addition to this technique, a method for reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of the external auditory canal was introduced. This procedure is applied in cases of damage or impairment of the bony ear canal wall using mastoid cortical temporal bone graft or modeled cartilage of the concha. Maintenance of general anatomical relations in the middle ear enables good ventilation of pneumatic spaces of the middle ear and Eustachian tube permeability, thus providing good conditions for ossicular chain reconstruction. The incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma in combined mobile-bridge <b>tympanoplasty</b> and <b>tympanoplasty</b> with reconstruction of the posterior bone wall was 6 % in total. The incidence values for the recurrent cholesteatoma in closed <b>tympanoplasty</b> and in cases of open techniques were 10 %.

40|$|Objective: Candidates for {{revision}} <b>tympanoplasty</b> have expe-rienced {{at least}} one failed attempt at repair of the tympanic membrane and are, therefore, at higher risk for subsequent repair failure. The adjunctive use of mastoidectomy with tym-panoplasty in those patients with noncholesteatomatous chronic otitis media {{is often used to}} decrease the risk for subsequent failure. However, at this institution, where we use cartilage <b>tympanoplasty,</b> mastoidectomy is rarely performed in the ab-sence of cholesteatoma. Our objective was to assess outcomes in patients undergoing revision <b>tympanoplasty</b> without mas-toidectomy using cartilage grafting. Study Design: We conducted a retrospective case review. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: A total of 95 patients (42 female, 53 male; 5 – 81 yr of age) with a recurrent perforation who were treated surgically with cartilage <b>tympanoplasty</b> without mastoidectomy were in-cluded in the chart review. Patients must have undergone {{at least one}} previous <b>tympanoplasty</b> without mastoidectomy and had to have complete audiologic and chart follow up. Interventions: An underlay <b>tympanoplasty</b> technique using ei-ther a tragal cartilage–perichondrium island graft or palisaded concha cymba cartilage was used. Ossiculoplasty was per-formed as needed. Main Outcome Measure: Main outcome measures were inci-dence of reperforation of the grafted tympanic membrane, hear-ing result, and prevalence of other complications. Results: Successful closure without reperforation was obtained in 90 of 95 patients (94. 7 %). Average postoperative pure-tone average air–bone gap was 12. 2 ± 7. 3 dB compared with 24. 6 ± 13. 8 dB preoperatively (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Revision <b>tympanoplasty</b> with cartilage provided equivalent results to <b>tympanoplasty</b> with mastoidectomy.

40|$|Introduction Stabilizing the graft can be {{difficult}} with the conventional method of underlay <b>tympanoplasty</b> when the tympanic membrane perforation is subtotal, large or anteriorly placed with thin anterior rim. <b>Tympanoplasty</b> with anterior tunnelling has been tried to overcome this problem. Materials and Methods A prospective study over two-year period was carried out with follow up for three months on 59 patients under two groups- the underlay <b>tympanoplasty</b> with anterior tunnelling and the conventional <b>tympanoplasty</b> with anterior tucking for comparison in terms of pre-and post-operative anatomical correction and physiological improvements Results Follow up at 6 weeks and 12 weeks post operatively gives statistically comparable graft take up, hearing result and residual perforations. Discussion Among various techniques of dealing with these types of perforations, statistical comparability {{of the two groups}} brings in an acceptability to this simple but satisfying procedure of the underlay <b>tympanoplasty</b> with anterior tunnelling. Conclusion Underlay <b>tympanoplasty</b> technique (type-I) for subtotal, large or anteriorly placed perforations with thin anterior rim, can be managed by combining with anterior tunnelling which provides at least comparable results (if not more security against graft medialization) in respect of anatomical closure of perforations and hearing outcomes...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the causes of}} bone con-duction threshold impairment associated with middle ear pathoses and the factors influencing improvement in bone conduction threshold after <b>tympanoplasty.</b> STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The records of 98 con-secutive patients with unilateral chronic otitis media who underwent <b>tympanoplasty</b> were reviewed. Pre-operatively, 15 dB or more depression of bone con-duction threshold at least in 2 frequencies between 500 and 6000 Hz {{was considered to be}} significant.

Material and Methods: 23 consecutive patients with tinnitus due to chronic otitis media underwent <b>tympanoplasty.</b> The patients underwent a medical and audiological protocol for tinnitus before and after <b>tympanoplasty.</b> Results: 82. 6 % of patients had improvement or elimination of tinnitus after <b>tympanoplasty</b> The mean score of postoperative intolerance to tinnitus (1. 91 for 30 and 180 days) was significantly different from preoperative scores (5. 26). As to hearing loss, patients improved medically 30 and 180 days after surgery (3. 65 and 2. 91) compared to the preoperative condition (6. 56). Audiometry revealed improvement at all frequencies from 0. 25 to 6 KHz, except at 8 KHz. The air-bone gap was closed or was within 10 dB in 14 cases (61 %). An intact tympanic membrane was achieved in 78 % of the cases. Conclusion: Aside from the classical improvement of hearing loss, <b>tympanoplasty</b> also offers good control of tinnitus...|$|E
