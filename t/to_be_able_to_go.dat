5|$|The Fringe team discovers a Triad {{gang member}} and ties to several shell {{companies}} the gang {{has set up}} in the US. They interview Elizabeth Jarvis (Ingrid Torrance), one of the companies' large investors, but she seems unaware of her investment's criminal background. While at her house, Peter (Joshua Jackson) observes signs of obsessive compulsive and germaphobe characteristics such as large quantities of hand sanitizer. Walter informs him the worm has a medicinal purpose, not a narcotic one as they previously believed. These two discoveries lead Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv) back to Jarvis' house, and they learn that her son (Colby Paul) has an immunodeficiency disorder. To allow him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> outside, his mother and doctor have been giving him an injection to his spleen once a month, though he is unaware of the medicine's origins.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{validate}} the proposed aircraft's design, and to explore its flight handling characteristics, Fairchild Republic contracted with Ames Industries of Bohemia, New York to build a flyable 62% scale version. Burt Rutan's Rutan Aircraft Factory (RAF) in Mojave, California was contracted to perform the flight test evaluations, with test pilot Dick Rutan doing the flying. The scale version was known at RAF as the Model 73 NGT, this flying on 10 September 1981. One requirement was for the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into a spin, but to also have easy recovery from the spin. This was demonstrated using the Model 73 NTG.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are so excited to finally get out on the road and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been lucky enough to have some amazing support shows... but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and play songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There For Tomorrow and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There For Tomorrow in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E

The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse was the only book Potter published in 1910. She wrote a friend on New Year's Day 1911: [...] "I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ...

[...] "They really fought hard for {{and won the}} right to make an R-rated movie." [...] Paramount executives went as far to prepare graphs displaying how much more money a PG-13-rated South Park feature would perhaps accumulate. The William Morris Agency, which represented Parker and Stone, pushed for movie production to begin as soon as possible, while public interest was still high, instead of several years into its run, as was done with Beavis and Butt-head Do America, possibly because Beavis and Butt-head and South Park were owned by Viacom Global Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom after Doug Herzog left Viacom Media Networks on January 12, 2017.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Warne's death and the purchase of Hill Top, Potter produced tales and illustrations inspired by her farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages.

She published only one book in 1910, The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse, and wrote to a friend on New Year's Day 1911:I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ...
