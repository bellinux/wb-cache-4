25|$|Some {{linotype}} machines {{included a}} paper <b>tape</b> <b>reader.</b> This allowed {{the text to}} be typeset to be supplied over a telegraph line (TeleTypeSetter). It also allowed for several tape perforator operators to prepare paper tape to be processed by a single linotype machine, essentially decoupling the typing speed of the operators from the operating speed of the linotype machine.|$|E
25|$|Electromechanical {{teleprinters}} were heavy, {{complex and}} noisy, {{and have been}} replaced with electronic units. The teleprinter includes a keyboard, which is the main means of entering text, and a printer or visual display unit (VDU). An alternative input device is a perforated <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> and, more recently, computer storage media (such as floppy disks). Alternative output devices are tape perforators and computer storage media.|$|E
25|$|When {{the machine}} first shipped, {{flipping}} {{switches on the}} front panel {{was the only way}} to get programs or data into the machine, and the only output from the programs was the patterns of lights on the panel. Nevertheless, many were sold in this form. Roberts was already hard at work on additional cards, including a paper <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> for storage, additional RAM cards, and a RS-232 interface to connect to a proper Teletype terminal.|$|E
50|$|The DX paper <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> {{operate at}} any speed up to 360 {{characters}} per second via external timing, except EIA. EIA <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> operate at 120 {{characters per second}} if internal timing is used, and up to 314 characters per second if external timing is used. All of the DX paper <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> are adjustable-level, reading 5, 6, 7 or 8-level fully punched or chadless paper tape. The DX series of paper <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> were available in table-top and rack mount models, with an optional verifier data output for use by an external verifier logic to guarantee the accuracy of each character read.|$|R

25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E
2500|$|IBM {{also sold}} a <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> (IBM 2495) {{that could be}} {{connected}} to 360 series mainframes, and would read the MT/ST tapes. [...] Thus a document typed on an MT/ST Selectric could also be entered into a mainframe data file.|$|E
2500|$|Users {{prepared}} {{their programs}} by punching them (in assembler) onto a paper tape. They soon became good at {{being able to}} hold the paper tape {{up to the light}} and read back the codes. When a program was ready it was hung on a length of line strung up near the paper <b>tape</b> <b>reader.</b> The machine operators, who were present during the day, selected the next tape from the line and loaded it into EDSAC. This is of course well known today as job queues. If it printed something then the tape and the printout were returned to the user, otherwise they were informed at which memory location it had stopped. Debuggers were some time away, but a CRT screen could be set to display the contents of a particular piece of memory. This was used to see if a number was converging, for example. A loudspeaker was connected to the accumulator's sign bit; experienced users knew healthy and unhealthy sounds of programs, particularly programs 'hung' in a loop. [...] After office hours certain [...] "Authorised Users" [...] were allowed to run the machine for themselves, which went on late into the night until a valve blew – which usually happened according to one such user.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, Western Union {{introduced}} Plan 55-A, {{the first}} automatic electromechanical {{store and forward}} message switching system. All message storage was performed by paper tape punches paired with paper <b>tape</b> <b>readers,</b> with a bin in between.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tape</b> <b>readers</b> {{may still}} be found on current CNC facilities, since machine tools have a long {{operating}} life. Other methods of transferring CNC programs to machine tools, such as diskettes or direct connection of a portable computer, are also used. Punched mylar tapes are more robust. Floppy disks, USB flash drives and local area networking have replaced the tapes to some degree, especially in larger environments that are highly integrated.|$|R
50|$|Addition took 285 microseconds and {{multiplication}} 20 milliseconds, making arithmetic operations {{much faster}} than the Harvard Mark I. Data {{that had to be}} retrieved quickly was held in electronic circuits; the remainder was stored in relays and as holes in three continuous card-stock tapes that filled another wall. A chain hoist was needed to lift the heavy reels of paper into place. The machine read instructions or data from 30 paper <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> connected to three punches, and another a table look-up unit consisted of another 36 paper <b>tape</b> <b>readers.</b> A punched card reader was used to load data, and results were produced on punched cards or high-speed printers. The 19-digit word was stored on the card stock tape or registers in binary coded decimal, resulting in 76 bits, with two extra bits for indicating positive or negative sign and parity, while the two side rows were used for sprockets. The familiar 80 columns of IBM punched card technology were recorded sideways as one column of the tape.|$|R
5000|$|The {{teleprinter}} circuit {{was often}} {{linked to a}} 5-bit paper tape punch (or [...] "reperforator") and reader, allowing messages received to be resent on another circuit. Complex military and commercial communications networks were built using this technology. Message centers had rows of teleprinters and large racks for paper tapes awaiting transmission. Skilled operators could read the priority code from the hole pattern and might even feed a [...] "FLASH PRIORITY" [...] <b>tape</b> into a <b>reader</b> {{while it was still}} coming out of the punch. Routine traffic often had to wait hours for relay. Many teleprinters had built-in paper <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> and punches, allowing messages to be saved in machine-readable form and edited off-line.|$|R
