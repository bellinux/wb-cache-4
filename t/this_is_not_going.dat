500|$|During the Guadalajara International Book Fair in Mexico {{in early}} December 2016, Martin offered the {{following}} hint {{as to the}} tone of this book:There {{are a lot of}} dark chapters right now ... I've been telling you for 20 years that winter was coming. Winter is the time when things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for. Some of the characters [...] in very dark places.|$|E
500|$|Human Rights Watch {{condemned}} the attack. [...] "The Bahraini army has done what the Egyptian army {{did not do}} and exactly what the United States and its other partners urged it not to do -- it has opened fire on its own people," [...] its Washington director said. Fareed Zakaria, CNN's international affairs analyst, said that the crackdown on protesters was a [...] "rash move that will enrage many of its people and cost the regime international prestige". [...] "This is a terrible mistake and they will pay a heavy price for it. The regime in Bahrain is doing something very rash and unwise; {{it is trying to}} respond by using force and punitive measures. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to work in the end", he added.|$|E
500|$|New York Times {{columnist}} Nicolas Kristof {{described the}} raid as [...] "brutal repression" [...] {{that is usually}} [...] "confined to remote and backward nations" [...] and referred to the government's version of events as [...] "preposterous" [...] and expressed his sadness over the events. Fareed Zakaria, CNNs international affairs analyst, said that the crackdown on the protesters was a [...] "rash move that will enrage many of its people and cost the regime international prestige. This is a terrible mistake and they will pay a heavy price for it. The regime in Bahrain is doing something very rash and unwise; {{it is trying to}} respond by using force and punitive measures. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to work in the end." ...|$|E
50|$|Despite {{efforts by}} the Grand Trunk Railway to turn a profit, {{including}} the former CAR lines, it <b>was</b> fairly obvious <b>not</b> long after the 1905 purchase that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to happen. The separate CAR accounts during the transition period (1905-1914) made that clear.|$|R
5000|$|Ganz became Chairman of the Freeholder {{board on}} January 2, 2013, elected {{unanimously}} by a divided (4:3) freeholder board. The inaugural remarks {{made it clear}} that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> politics as usual because the newly installed chairman saw that the model was “broken” and needed to be fixed: ...|$|R
50|$|Generalmajor Gonell had {{previously}} believed that other German forces would attack and relieve his besieged forces, but by 15 February {{came to the}} realization that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to happen. Incensed, he ordered his troops that were east of the Warta River to attempt to break out, and some 2,000 German soldiers managed to infiltrate the Red Army lines and head west on the following night.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC in October 2005, Walker suggested that the army's recruitment had been adversely affected by the Iraq War. He also commented on the war in Afghanistan, on which he said [...] "There's {{a lot of work to}} be done, of which the military is only a very small part. Ten years, 15 years, long-term. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be solved in a short term". In the same month, he gave {{an interview}} for The Sunday Times, in which he said that soldiers' morale had been damaged by the unpopularity of the war among the British public. Later in 2005, Walker was instrumental in drawing up new procedures for the treatment of British service personnel accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners, following claims that the army had abandoned those soldiers charged in connection with the prisoner abuses. In February 2006, Walker headed up a military delegation to Bulgaria to discuss military cooperation between the British and Bulgarian governments.|$|E
500|$|Consistent with Bolkovac's account, The Whistleblower portrays DynCorp International {{employees}} {{as participants in}} the postwar Bosnian sex trade with the UN turning a blind eye. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be simple or a quick fix." [...] She said {{that in addition to}} Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would [...] "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", she worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact: [...] "I know we are going to hear a lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." [...] Following the theatrical release of The Whistleblower, The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E
2500|$|While Gholam-Hossein Elham, an Iranian politician, {{argues that}} [...] "taqiya" [...] {{does not apply}} here because the fatwa by Khamenei is a primary {{religious}} order and not a secondary one. According to him, Khamenei's fatwa bans massacre of innocent people and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to change in any situations {{because it is a}} primary order. Also, he said that Islamic Jurists have banned deception in Jihad and war, i.e., Islamic leader respects by any commitment he accepts.|$|E
40|$|Two {{photos of}} Carolyn Weathers on left and Judy O'Dea on right rehearsing for the staged reading of Weathers's play "Mouse Soup," {{two hours before}} {{audience}} arrived at Celebration Theater. The director, Susan Bell, told Carolyn {{and the rest of}} the cast that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a staged reading after all, but a fully acted out play, which they were unprepared for, which made for an awkward play. August 16, 1987...|$|R
50|$|Serco-NedRailways' bid {{had assumed}} that some Class 142 Pacer trains would be {{released}} imminently when Manchester Metrolink services started between Manchester and Oldham. Due to a substantial delay in extending the Metrolink, {{it became clear that}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> the case. As a result, the contract signing was delayed, and the services operated by First North Western and Arriva Trains Northern did not transfer to Northern until 12 December 2004.|$|R

The last thing that we want to do is to squander away our hard-earned reserves and leave behind enormous debt for our children and our grandchildren.

2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{way of doing business}} was to make the product as and when it <b>was</b> ordered. <b>This</b> style <b>was</b> very slow, As Deere realized that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand, but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly.|$|R
25|$|On 8 April Haig, {{having learned}} of {{intelligence}} reports of German reserves massing in the British sector, tried again, asking his French liaison officer, General de Laguiche, to ask Foch to send French divisions {{to free up}} six British divisions to form a reserve in Flanders, but Weygand arrived at GHQ to tell Herbert Lawrence in person that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to happen. Wilson arrived in France {{on the morning of}} 9 April, just as the German offensive in Flanders was beginning.|$|R

Comrade Repetto {{and his colleagues have}} come here on business, and nothing will make them forget it. Typical New York men of affairs, they close their minds to all {{influences}} that might lure them from their business. Let us get on, then. What did you wish to see me about, Comrade Repetto?" ...|$|E

5000|$|PureBasic has a [...] "lifetime license model". As cited on the website, {{the very}} first PureBasic user (who {{registered}} in 1998) still has free access to new updates and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to change.|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} further discomforted him. It {{was growing}} upon him that <b>this</b> thing <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> the success he had anticipated. It {{would be necessary}} to proceed warily.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the columns}} {{continued}} to turn towards {{each other and}} only moments before the collision did the captains of the two ships appreciate that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to happen. Even then, they still waited for permission to take the action that might have prevented the collision. Captain Bourke of Victoria asked Tryon three times for permission to order the engines astern; he acted only after he had received that permission. At the last moment, Tryon shouted across to Markham, [...] "Go astern! Go astern!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1982, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) began {{offering}} a $1 million bonus to any singles player to win four consecutive major titles, {{no matter the}} time of completion.

5000|$|Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay {{met with}} Karzai on November 7 to discuss about the ongoing {{deterioration}} of the situation.

50|$|A 1974 {{production}} of The Haunted Host {{marked the first}} time Harvey Fierstein appeared on the legitimate stage as a male (having previously only acted as a drag performer). Years later, Fierstein included a recording of Patrick's monologue, Pouf Positive on his compact disc, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Going</b> to Be Pretty. Pouf Positive was also filmed by Dov Hechtman in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2010, Brewer {{received}} {{criticism for}} her {{comments about the}} Times Square car bomb attempt: [...] There was {{part of me that}} <b>was</b> hoping <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> anybody with ties to any kind of Islamic country, {{because there are a lot}} of people who want to use this terrorist intent to justify writing off people who believe in a certain way or come from certain countries or whose skin color is a certain way. I mean they use it as justification for really outdated bigotry.|$|R
5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> easy as the {{available}} capital was scarce, {{but the first}} sod was cut on 3 April 1875.

Realistically {{there was only one way}} out: a sale at a low price to the North British Railway.

50|$|The {{reform to}} Article 41 of the Mexican Constitution, Chavez in Venezuela, Correa in Ecuador and Morales in Bolivia, among others, teaches {{us that a}} {{democratic}} election does not guarantee democratic institutions. Even if the majority elects a government, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be a democratic one if it begins making legal amendments that would contain power {{at the expense of}} political rights and civil liberties.|$|E
5000|$|Jason Evans of The Wall Street Journal gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} episode, writing: [...] "Wow!
