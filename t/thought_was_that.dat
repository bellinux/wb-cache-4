25|$|Amongst {{the first}} rescuers {{to arrive at}} the scene were Mr and Mrs Dunbar, caretakers at The Old Blacksmith's Shop, Gretna Green. Mrs Dunbar stated that when she heard the crash, her {{immediate}} <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Germans had come. Mrs Dunbar telephoned doctors in Carlisle for assistance. Mr Dunbar spent the day assisting the rescue efforts.|$|E
25|$|The {{consensus}} {{of most of}} the investigating commissions was that the initial break took place at or near the fault line, which had been a problem area since water first covered the area, on the western abutment. The prevailing <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> increasing water percolation through the fault line had either undermined or weakened the foundation to a point that a portion of the structure blew out or the dam collapsed from its own immense weight. This agreement among them was also due, in conjunction, with a chart which was made by the automatic water level recorder located on the dam’s center section. This chart clearly showed that there had been no significant change in the reservoir level until forty minutes before the dam’s failure when, during that forty minutes, a small though gradually increasing amount of loss was recorded.|$|E
25|$|The Caeliar {{offer the}} {{remaining}} humans a merging {{of human and}} Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as time goes on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as time goes on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results {{in the creation of}} the first Borg, the name being created due to the fragmented thought of the first drone as he was assimilated (his last <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he would not become some cyborg, with his individuality ceasing before he could finish thinking the final word). The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were–albeit accidentally–involved {{in the creation of the}} Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.|$|E

500|$|The climactic scene {{depicting}} the mysterious beach near the galactic core where Arroway makes contact, in particular, called for major visual innovations. The goal was an idyllic seashore with a sky blazing with stars that might exist near {{the core of}} the galaxy. Ralston said that [...] "the <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this beach would have a heightened reality. One that might make the everyday world seem like a vague daydream." [...] To keep the question alive whether any of it was real in Arroway's mind, elements such as ocean waves running in reverse and palm tree shadows swaying with sped-up motion were applied.|$|E
500|$|William Plomer, {{writing in}} The Spectator after the book's first publication, thought it mistaken [...] "to regard Mr Waugh's more {{surprising}} situations as farcical or far-fetched; {{they are on}} the whole extremely realistic". However, the mixture of genres was not immediately understood or appreciated by some of Waugh's admirers; Connolly's initial <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Waugh had been [...] "destroyed as a writer", by snobbery and association with country-house living. In Sykes's view, the fleeting appearances in the book of characters from Waugh's farcical world, such as Lady Metroland, are awkward and intrusive—the world of A Handful of Dust is not outlandish: [...] "Evelyn would have done better to have forgotten Lady Metroland and her world altogether".|$|E
500|$|Amaury Nolasco as Fernando Sucre: Sucre {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} Michael during time at Fox River State Penitentiary, where he was his cell-mate. Initially, his character's story focuses on his wish to reunite with his fiancée. Upon receiving the pilot script, Nolasco's first <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "one of those failed pilots that the network did not really want" [...] {{since most of the}} series pilots would have started production by that time. Admitting that he does not like to read, Nolasco was amazed that the script was a [...] "huge page-turner". Prior to his last audition for the role, Nolasco recalled his nervousness, which grew when Paul Scheuring told him that he was their favorite choice. Subsequently, he was cast in the role.|$|E

500|$|The Romanian writer {{also spent}} the Dada period issuing {{a long series}} of manifestos, which were often {{authored}} as prose poetry, and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by [...] "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected [...] "the language of a sophisticated savage". Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for [...] "compress what we think and feel", and, according to Hans Richter, the genre [...] "suited Tzara perfectly." [...] Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs. His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: [...] "Dada means nothing", adding [...] "Thought is produced in the mouth." [...] Tzara indicated: [...] "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none." [...] In addition, Tzara, who once stated that [...] "logic is always false", probably approved of Serner's vision of a [...] "final dissolution". According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> [...] "as long as we do things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society." ...|$|E
500|$|Players at both clubs {{received}} {{the news with}} apprehension. As Ley put it, [...] "When you merge two clubs into one, you cannot have a squad of 45." [...] The Oxford team learned of the impending merger and the new name from Smith {{in the dressing room}} at Belle Vue just before the match against Doncaster on 16 April. Mark Jones, one of the Oxford midfielders, recalled that the room [...] "went totally quiet", and that his first <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it might be hard to him to keep his place in the first team with Reading's players also on the books. According to Jones, Smith attempted to assuage the Oxford players' fears by telling them that [...] "we're only doing it so we can buy Kerry Dixon. All your places are safe". Alan Judge, the Reading goalkeeper, reported his team reacting in a similar way—indeed, he described the Reading players as even more worried as Oxford had far outperformed them in the League that season. Ley, who accompanied the Oxford team on the bus ride home after the game, recalled that the players were almost silent, their victory over Doncaster overshadowed by [...] "a feeling of incredulity, confusion, worry and fear".|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the second}} day was taken up with {{excavating}} a large skull which Darwin found embedded in soft rock, and seemed to him to be allied to the rhinoceros. On 8 October {{he returned to the}} site, and found a jawbone and tooth which he was able to identify using Bory de Saint-Vincent's Dictionnaire classique. He wrote home describing this and the large skull as Megatherium fossils, or perhaps Megalonyx, and excitedly noted that the only specimens in Europe were locked away in the King's collection at Madrid. In the same layer he found a large surface of polygonal plates of bony armour. His immediate <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they came from an enormous armadillo like the small creatures common in the area, but from Cuvier's misleading description of the Madrid specimen and a recent newspaper report about a fossil found by Woodbine Parish, Darwin thought that the bony armour identified the fossil as the Megatherium. With FitzRoy, Darwin went about [...] across the bay to Monte Hermoso on 19 October, and found numerous fossils of smaller rodents in contrast to the huge Edentatal mammals of Punta Alta. In November at Buenos Aires he [...] "purchased fragments of some enormous bones" [...] which he [...] "was assured belonged to the former giants!!", and subsequently took any chance to get fossils [...] "by gold or galloping".|$|E

2500|$|There {{exists a}} popular thought, {{especially}} among economists, that free markets {{would have a}} structure of a perfect competition. The logic behind this <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> market failures <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> caused by other exogenic systems, and after removing those exogenic systems ("freeing" [...] the markets) the free markets could run without market failures.|$|R
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} {{retainer}} sacrifices was [...] "to enable the wealthy noble {{to enjoy the}} same kind of life-style after death as [...] had during [...] lifetime. The <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the next life without that kind of luxury and ease was unthinkable. They also wanted to maintain the same social status they had enjoyed on earth; a social hierarchy that was based upon being served by others. Pharaohs used retainer sacrifices to reinforce the power of the position of the pharaoh, by showing the control they had over their subjects. Pharaohs also used retainer sacrifices to help communicate the idea that the state was literally worth dying for.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{president}} {{is expected to}} [...] "set the job description" [...] for future office holders {{as there is no}} clear idea of how the post would evolve. One body of <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the President would stick to the administrative role as outlined by the treaty, a standard bearer who would simply chair meetings and ensure the smooth running of the body and its policies. This would attract semi-retired leaders seeking a fitting climax to their career and would leave most work to the Commission rather than wield power within the institutions. However another opinion envisages a more pro-active President within the Union and speaking for it abroad. This post would hence be quickly fashioned into a de facto [...] "President of Europe" [...] and, unlike the first model, would be seen on the world stage as speaking for the EU. Persons connected to this position would be more charismatic leaders. The appointment of Herman Van Rompuy (see below) indicated a desire to see the former style of president.|$|E
2500|$|In {{occasional}} political {{comments in}} his Parerga and Paralipomena and Manuscript Remains, Schopenhauer {{described himself as}} a proponent of limited government. What was essential, he <b>thought,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the state should [...] "leave each man free to work out his own salvation", and so long as government was thus limited, he would [...] "prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [...] fellow rats"—i.e., by a monarch, rather than a democrat. Schopenhauer shared the view of Thomas Hobbes on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one). He declared monarchy as [...] "that which is natural to man" [...] for [...] "intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity" [...] and disparaged republicanism as [...] "unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences".|$|E
