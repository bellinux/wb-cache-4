Hip dysplasia is common in the breed; when buying a puppy, the pedigree should be known and be examined by the OFA or by PennHIP for hip disease.

Puppies should eat about <b>three</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> food a day and adults three to five cups, depending on the food and how active the dog is.|$|E
25|$|Rugby union: the Section Paloise, club {{created in}} 1902 {{is one of}} the oldest and most prestigious French rugby clubs.

500|$|Among Bedouins {{and most}} other Arabs {{throughout}} the region of Palestine, bitter coffee, known as qahwah sadah (Lit. plain coffee), {{was a symbol of}} hospitality. Pouring the drink was ceremonial; it would involve the host or his eldest son moving clockwise among guests—who were judged by age and status—pouring coffee into tiny cups from a brass pot. It was considered [...] "polite" [...] for guests to accept only <b>three</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> coffee and then end their last cup by saying daymen, meaning [...] "always", but intending to mean [...] "may you always have the means to serve coffee".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} a parody on the {{disaster}} film genre, {{which has been}} parodied in previous South Park episodes, like [...] "Pandemic", the twelfth season parody of the film Cloverfield. [...] "Pee" [...] included a particularly large number of references to 2012, a science fiction film {{about the end of}} the world as predicted by the Mayan calendar, which was released only days before [...] "Pee" [...] was originally broadcast. The episode parodies many common elements of such disaster films, including scientists struggling to figure out the source of the problem. The destruction of rides and park amenities by the tsunami of urine is a reference to the destruction of historical monuments in 2012, and other such disaster films by Roland Emmerich, the director of, White House Down, 2012, Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. [...] "Pee" [...] also includes several references to the 2012 phenomenon, the prediction that cataclysmic events would occur in the year 2012, which is said to be the end of the Mayan Long Count calendar. The scene in which Kyle is forced to drink <b>three</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> urine in order to prevent his body from enduring the effects of fluid pressure before swimming down to drain it all out, is a parody of a scene in the 1989 film The Abyss, where the protagonist inhales a liquid breathing medium before venturing into the ocean depths.|$|E

6000|$|Elbridge felt a consolatory {{quality in}} Putney's resentment, and Putney, already {{busy with the}} {{potentialities}} of the future, was buoyed up by the strong excitement of what had actually happened rather than finally cast down by what he had missed.

6000|$|The hut {{contained}} little furniture, {{but there}} was a pile of skins, the proceeds of the Indian’s hunting since his return from his last expedition.

Altogether he had a disreputable aspect, expressive of the discomfort, the irritation and the gloom following a heavy debauch. But Mr Verloc was not a debauched man. In his conduct he was respectable. His appearance {{might have been the}} effect of a feverish cold. He drank <b>three</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> tea, but abstained from food entirely.

6000|$|For instance, at {{this first}} house, {{we managed to}} get some forage for our horses, before our scowling host found out who we were, but not a bit could we get to eat.

60|$|The table she set had {{scarcely}} {{anything in}} common with that of their first married year. Not alone was every item of cheaper quality, but many items had disappeared. Meat, and the poorest, was very seldom on the table. Cow's milk had given place to condensed milk, and even the sparing use of the latter had ceased. A roll of butter, when they had it, lasted {{half a dozen times}} as long as formerly. Where Billy had been used to drinking <b>three</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> coffee for breakfast, he now drank one. Saxon boiled this coffee an atrocious length of time, and she paid twenty cents a pound for it.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Zapp was a fat landlady. When she {{sat down}} there was a {{straight}} line from her chin to her knees. She was usually sitting down. When she moved she groaned, and her apparel creaked. She groaned and creaked from bed to breakfast, and ate five griddle-cakes, two helpin's of scrapple, an egg, some rump steak, and <b>three</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> coffee, slowly and resentfully. She creaked and groaned from breakfast to her rocking-chair, and sat about wondering why Providence had inflicted upon her a weak digestion. Mr. Wrenn also wondered why, sympathetically, but Mrs. Zapp was too conscientiously dolorous to be much cheered by the sympathy of a nigger-lovin' Yankee, who couldn't appreciate the subtle sorrows of a Zapp of Zapp's Bog, allied to all the First Families of Virginia.|$|E
