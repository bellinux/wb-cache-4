5|$|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (often informally called Millionaire) is an American {{television}} {{game show}} {{based on the}} same-titled British program and developed for the United States by Michael Davies. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of $1,000,000 by answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty (although, for a time, most of <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> of random difficulty). The program has endured {{as one of the}} longest-running and most successful international variants in the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? franchise.|$|E
5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> usually {{limited to}} one or more {{specific}} cases, while the responsum to such a query gave a ruling, a concise reason for it, together with supporting citations from the Talmud, and often a refutation of any possible objection.|$|E

50|$|The first reel has a {{range of}} {{categories}} of questions on it, each given a star rating of up to three stars. One star means <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of easy difficulty, two stars mean <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of medium difficulty and three stars mean <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of hard difficulty.

25|$|Ultima VI {{introduced}} a more systematic use of copy {{protection in the}} form of in-game questions, preventing the player from progressing any further if <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> answered incorrectly. In Ultima VII, this practice was continued, although in both games the player had an unlimited number of tries to answer the questions correctly. Answers could be obtained by consulting the manual or cloth map, although the manual released with the Ultima Collection contained all copy protection answers for every game.|$|E
25|$|The Holy See's {{instruction}} {{to remove the}} name of St. Philomena even from local calendars followed the raising of questions by certain scholars, whose interest had been drawn to the phenomenon more especially {{in connection with the}} revelations of Sister Maria Luisa di Ges√π. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> raised in particular by Orazio Marucchi, whose conclusions won the support of , an archaeologist and ecclesiastical historian who {{is the author of the}} article on Philomena in the Catholic Encyclopedia, an article that has won the support of the historian William Carroll; but according to Mark Miravalle the conclusions have been rejected by others.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> by {{no means}} {{restricted}} to practical problems, but many of them, in case the interpretation of a halakic or haggadic passage in the Talmud {{was the subject of}} inquiry, were theoretical in nature. In their discussion of theoretical problems the responsa of the Spanish scholars are noteworthy for the untrammeled scientific spirit that permeates them far more than those of the French school. Even in responsa that are practical in bearing, a distinction may be drawn between the two schools. Although these response can still be found in significant response anthologies today, they are not as significant as the response written during the Geonic period.|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, {{questions}} of {{conflict of interest}} regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay. Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents [...] "for the price of one".|$|E
500|$|Mind of a Man {{garnered}} mixed reception from critics. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times {{argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> [...] "frivolous" [...] and previewed the series as being [...] "vacuous but often amusing." [...] The Washington Posts Marc Silver called the series [...] "low-minded" [...] {{and claimed that}} after watching an episode, his [...] "mind need to go take a shower." [...] Acting rather neutral, Hank Stuever, also from The Washington Post, argued that the series' title [...] "sound like the premise for an SNL sketch."

5000|$|There <b>are</b> 4 <b>questions</b> in each Final Individual Event. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> have to <b>be</b> {{solved by}} {{alternate}} contestants independently, and no discussions are allowed.

500|$|The format in the Play It! {{attraction}} {{was very}} {{similar to that of the}} television show that inspired it. When a show started, a [...] "Fastest Finger" [...] question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became Phone a Complete Stranger which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a Millionaire CD game, to a 3-night Disney Cruise.|$|E
500|$|The {{second round}} plays {{almost exactly the}} same as the first round; however, <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> asked to men who belong to a {{specific}} group (e.g., married men, African-American men, or men under the age of 25). Each correct prediction is worth $300. The last question of Round 2 is designated as the [...] "VIP" [...] question, which is focused on one specific group of men and asked to a special guest related to the question. When the VIP question is about a specific man, before the question is asked, the panel is allowed 30 seconds to [...] "interrogate" [...] the VIP about their background, personal preferences, etc., and then the question is played out as normal, with the VIP giving his answer verbally after the contestants give their prediction. Actor Ted Lange (most well known for his role on The Love Boat) appeared in some episodes as the show's bartender and was often the man who was previously asked the VIP question.|$|E
500|$|During {{the years}} {{immediately}} following the novel's publication, Harper Lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her, granting interviews, visiting schools, and attending events honoring the book. In 1961, when To Kill a Mockingbird was in its 41st week on the bestseller list, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, stunning Lee. It also won the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in the same year, and the Paperback of the Year award from Bestsellers magazine in 1962. Starting in 1964, Lee began to turn down interviews, complaining that <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> monotonous, and grew concerned that attention she received bordered {{on the kind of}} publicity celebrities sought. Since then, she declined talking with reporters about the book. She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction, writing in 1995: [...] "Introductions inhibit pleasure, they kill the joy of anticipation, they frustrate curiosity. The only good thing about Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come. Mockingbird still says what it has to say; it has managed to survive the years without preamble." ...|$|E

50|$|The final segment, {{which has}} {{remained}} unchanged, has {{the winner of}} the third segment answering a difficult riddle or trivia <b>question.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> answered correctly, <b>the</b> amount in the pot is deposited into the donation pot.

500|$|The euro fell {{against the}} US dollar {{for the two}} trading days {{preceding}} the vote on speculation that a win for the True Finns would hinder the prospects for the Portuguese bailout. Questions were raised whether {{the fall of the}} US dollar to a one-year low could be stemmed. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> partially answered on the last trading day before the election, when the dollar rose on concern for a shake-up for European confidence {{as a result of the}} election which caused bearish traders to cover their open positions. The strong showing by the True Finns and the Social Democrats caused EU leaders to worry that they may not be able to count on Finland's future support for any such bailout measure. Concerns for the euro grew in the run-up to the election and caused worry after the result. Eurozone stock markets were also upset and could be further upset as the bailout talks, expected to be concluded in mid-May, were affected. While there was no expectation that the bailout wound be derailed, [...] "caution" [...] was said to be the [...] "watchword." [...] The London Stock Exchange also considered the result a possible obstruction to the bailout.|$|E
500|$|On 11 September 2014, {{as part of}} the {{coverage}} of the Scottish independence referendum, Nick Robinson had a dispute with Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond. The previous day Robinson had reported that Lloyds Bank and RBS would be moving their registered offices from Scotland to London {{in the event of a}} [...] "Yes" [...] vote. In the exchange Robinson asked Salmond two questions: the first about the economic impact of RBS moving its headquarters; the second, more general, about why to trust a politician when CEO's of certain companies advised against independence. In his response, Salmond made points about how the BBC had obtained market-sensitive information. A report was shown on all BBC evening news programmes later that day as part of which Robinson stated Salmond had not answered his question but had instead chosen to lay accusations against the BBC. The BBC received complaints from viewers over the implication that Salmond had not answered a question put to him; there was a protest in Glasgow, in which between 1000 and 2000 protestors called for Robinson to be sacked. The BBC responded: [...] "The BBC considers that <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> valid and the overall report balanced and impartial, in line with our editorial guidelines.|$|E
500|$|The Austro-Hungarian Marinekommandant (Navy Commander), Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck, {{outlined}} in a memorandum of 8 September 1884 {{the requirements for}} a torpedo cruiser. Such a vessel should have a reinforced bow for ramming as well as torpedoes for attacks on larger warships. The cruisers would also be small and fast enough to undertake patrol and reconnaissance duties. The first two ships of Sterneck's program, the , were built in Britain so the Austro-Hungarian Navy could gain experience building small cruisers. The program was overseen by the naval engineer Siegfried Popper, who was tasked with designing a third cruiser in July 1885, to be built domestically. The Panther class {{provided the basis for}} the third ship, Tiger. A commission was convened on 16 September to discuss the parameters for the new cruiser; among <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> whether the ship would replicate the Panther-class ships or it would be an entirely new design. Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Alexander Eberan von Eberhorst, who headed the commission in charge of the cruiser program, instructed Popper that the commission had decided that the new ship should have a speed of not less than [...] and carry two [...] guns like the Panthers, but the ship should be some [...] larger.|$|E

500|$|When {{the novel}} was first published, NASA invited Weir {{to tour the}} Johnson Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. When Scott began {{preparing}} the film, Weir contacted NASA to collaborate on the film. When Scott and producer Mark Huffam had their first production meeting, they called NASA and spoke with its film and television liaison Bert Ulrich. NASA decided to assist the filmmakers with depicting the science and technology in The Martian since it saw potential in promoting space exploration. Key NASA staff members that joined the partnership were James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division, and Dave Lavery, the Program Executive for Solar System Exploration. Scott conversed with Green twice before filming started. Over {{a period of a}} month, NASA answered hundreds of questions‚Äîon a weekly basis‚Äîon everything from radioisotope systems to the look of potential [...] "habs"‚Äîthe residences for future Mars astronauts. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> answered by Green or passed on to the right expert, and then came back to Scott's team to make their way into the production. The space agency also sent hundreds of files of real images of Mars and images of control centers, down to what the computer screens look like, to the production team. Green arranged a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston for production designer Arthur Max, who met with individual specialists, taking hundreds of photos as he went for eight hours. The production designers created a futuristic, heavily modernized Mission Control as a studio set; Ars Technica described its depiction as [...] "the space agency that we all dream of" [...] and the opposite of the real Johnson Center's appearance as [...] "a run down college campus".|$|E

Therefore, suspense stories like ‚ÄúHow Galileo overcame superstitions‚Äù raise emotions improving memory and attendance thus easing concept change, according to results of neurological research (Erk et al. 2003). This memory improvement is confirmed by research on perception of movement (Gibson and Gibson 1994; Shapiro 2010).
