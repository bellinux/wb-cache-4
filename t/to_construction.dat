During his administration, the United States Congress approved $35,000 to pay off debts related <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> costs for the naval station, and planning began {{for the construction of a}} lighthouse on Aunu'u.

5|$|In 1938, Chamberlin became Assistant Chief of the Construction Branch in the G-4 Division of War Department General Staff. At this time, the United States was {{embarking on}} a {{military}} buildup {{in response to a}} worsening international situation, which culminated in the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939. A major component of this build up was a vast construction program of arsenals, depots, airbases and coastal defenses. Some $175 million was allocated <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> under the Expansion Program, as it became known.|$|E

5|$|While {{much of the}} {{construction}} in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what {{seems to have been}} a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits <b>to</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{the freeway}} was under {{construction}} in 1983, {{it was discovered that}} it ran through Native American burial grounds in Deptford.

40|$|Zoque {{exhibits}} {{various degrees}} of interclausal cohesion or types of embedding: juxtapostion, use of conjunctions, subordination with complementizers, and synthetic subordination by head marking. These various types of subordination are used for different clause types, such as complement clauses, adverbial clauses, and relative clauses, and they {{are for the most}} part native and precolonial in origin. Relative clauses may be formed by external or internal relativization. The former type corresponds <b>to</b> <b>constructions</b> with a nominal head and a clausal modifier, where the relativized element inside the clause is invisible or represented by a relative pronoun. The latter type corresponds <b>to</b> <b>constructions</b> where the relativized element is overtly present inside the clause...|$|R
40|$|As {{a land of}} marvels and fairies, L. Frank Baum’s Oz is a queer place. Within much of children’s literature, {{the word}} queer {{typically}} refers <b>to</b> <b>constructions</b> of odd and marvelous events and places rather than to characters who are resistant <b>to</b> <b>constructions</b> of sexual (hetero) normativity. The dividing line between asexual and sexual queerness, however, can be quite blurry, and this essay explores how the fantasies of Oz subvert normative constructions of gender and sexuality. After analyzing gender and sexual roles in Oz, the essay concludes that the utopianism of Oz is counterbalanced by a queer eroticism that undermines the foundations of normative genders...|$|R

5|$|With a small {{fleet of}} six U-boats at the {{beginning}} of World War I, two of which were not operational, the Austro-Hungarian Navy acted to bolster its fleet. They reluctantly ordered four U-20 boats in 1915 because construction could start immediately, even though the Havmanden-class design was largely obsolete {{by the beginning of the}} war. Political considerations caused the order to be split between Austrian and Hungarian firms, which contributed <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> problems and delays, keeping any of the boats from being operational until the middle of 1917.|$|E
5|$|An {{interchange}} between 36th Street and I-96 {{was built}} starting in 2005 and {{was completed in}} 2006. The project aimed to improve access to the Gerald R. Ford International Airport southeast of Grand Rapids. The reconstruction of the Wixom Road interchange near Novi as a SPUI was completed in late fall of 2008. Another interchange at Latson Road in Howell was approved for construction on July 19, 2012. This interchange was designed to bring improved access to the eastern Howell area, which prior <b>to</b> <b>construction</b> of the Latson Road exit was only accessible from westbound I-96. The project was completed on December 2, 2013. Also in 2013, the two interchanges near Nunica serving M-104 and B-31 were reconstructed, with two ramps removed from the former and two added to the latter; a new partial interchange was also built in preparation of M-231.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom in towns up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior <b>to</b> <b>construction,</b> most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E
