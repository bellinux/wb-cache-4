5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it onto from the sidewalk, away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>to</b> make room for the entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E

A Spanish Army {{artillery}} officer challenged him to a duel when Tapia refused to yield <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>to</b> him, a challenge which he accepted; as a result, Tapia suffered a non-lethal injury in the arm and subsequently exiled to Spain, where he remained with his father {{for a period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|The Public Market & Department Store Company {{was founded}} in 1911 by the Goodwins to manage their Pike Place Market properties. They began to design a series of {{expansions}} to the Market properties they owned, including the North Arcade, which they planned to build down the bluff along Pike Place. They planned to have all their building expansions set at all times a minimum of ten feet from <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> <b>to</b> allow extra space for vendors. At the time Frank Goodwin's designs, plans, and intended visual appearance of the Market were considered idiosyncratic.|$|E

60|$|Crowds were {{gathering}} along <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>to</b> view <b>the</b> emperor's {{entry into the}} city.

500|$|The two hotels, {{under one}} management, were renamed the Waldorf–Astoria. Situated on Fifth Avenue {{in what is}} now Midtown Manhattan, it was {{surrounded}} by streets on all sides. The Waldorf–Astoria had a frontage of [...] on Fifth Avenue, [...] on 33rd Street, [...] on 34th Street, and [...] on Astor Court, with 13 entrances opening directly from these thoroughfares. Below, extending to a depth [...] beneath the sidewalk, and occupying an additional area of [...] running toward Broadway, were the basements, which contained the engine room, laundries, kitchens, and even the Waldorf-Astoria Cigar Company.

The cost of the two buildings, exclusive of the furnishings but including the land, was about $15 million. The assessed value in 1897 was $12,125,000, making it the next most valuable parcel on Fifth Avenue, after the B. Altman and Company site. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, [...] "a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family".|$|E

50|$|Throughout the parade, snipers were in {{strategic}} locations, including {{the roofs of}} public buildings, while highly trained dogs enhanced security on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks.</b> <b>To</b> protect foreign representatives, including 25 heads of state or government, 650 men were deployed by the Federal Police. Rousseff's personal safety was ensured by 65 federal agents. At her request, the inner circle was formed by trained female agents, who formed a shield around her.|$|R

60|$|Only for a moment, however, did the man hesitate--just {{long enough}} to cast a glance {{up and down the}} deserted street, which was fairly well lighted. No one being in sight, he stepped from <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>to</b> the lawn, and keeping the grass under his feet, noiselessly made his way through the {{shrubbery}} to {{the south side of the}} residence. Here a conservatory formed a wing which jutted into the grounds.|$|E

60|$|Later on, Dickensen {{went out}} on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>to</b> smoke a cigar and cool off; and a little later Emily Travis {{happened}} along.

Little Dickensen deposited his cigar on an outside window ledge where he could find it again, and lifted his hat.|$|E

60|$|George, man of {{all work}} to Kirk Winfield, {{one of the}} {{youngest}} and least efficient of New York's artist colony, was English. He had been in America some little time, but not long enough to accustom his rather unreceptive mind to the fact that, whereas in his native land vehicles kept to the left, in the country of his adoption they kept to the right; and it was still his bone-headed practice, when stepping off <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> <b>to</b> keep a wary look-out in precisely the wrong direction.|$|E
50|$|While Evergreen {{is mostly}} {{composed}} of residential houses, it {{also features a}} neighborhood commercial area on the south boundary at Cold Spring Lane.

This allows <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>to</b> be unbroken by curb cuts. The houses, which face the street, are surrounded by luscious greenery. Most houses have good-sized yards, well-tended gardens and a variety of trees, shrubs, and bushes. <b>The</b> <b>sidewalks</b> in front of the houses promote communication between residents and allow for a close-knit community.|$|R
5000|$|Another major {{alteration}} to {{the bridge}} occurred in 1955. The District of Columbia was transitioning to buses from streetcars, {{and as part of}} this change the streetcar tracks over the bridge were torn out.

A 2 ft high guard rail was added between the roadway and <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> which necessitated narrowing <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>to</b> just 5 ft.

6000|$|Mr. George and Rollo, {{when they}} {{approached}} the abbey, saw a current of people moving towards the building. These people turned off from <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>to</b> a paved alley, which led along a sort of court. This court was bounded by a range of ordinary, but ancient-looking, houses on one side, and a very remarkable mass of richly-carved and ornamented Gothic architecture, which evidently pertained to the abbey, on the other. On {{the wall of the}} row of houses was a sign, on which were inscribed the words, [...] "TO THE POET'S CORNER." ...|$|E
60|$|I, too, {{longed for}} a Cause into which I might fling myself, in which I might lose myself... I halted on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>to</b> find myself staring from the {{opposite}} side of the street at a familiar house, my old landlady's, Mrs. Bolton's, and summoned up before me was the tired, smiling face of Hermann Krebs. Was it because when he had once spoken so crudely of the University I had seen the reflection of her spirit in his eyes? A light still burned in the extension roof--Krebs's light; another shone dimly through the ground glass of the front door. Obeying a sudden impulse, I crossed the street.|$|E
60|$|People {{were waiting}} on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>to</b> take the cars; a druggist's window threw its mellow lights into the street; from open cellar- ways came {{the sound of}} banjos and violins. At one of these cellar doors his guide lingered so long that Lemuel thought he should {{have to find the}} way beyond for himself. But the tramp {{suddenly}} commanded himself from the music, the light, and the smell of strong drink, which Lemuel caught a whiff of as he followed, and turning a corner led the way to the side of a lofty building in a dark street, where they met other like shapes tending toward it from different directions.|$|E
