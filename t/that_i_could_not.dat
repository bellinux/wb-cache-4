5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E
25|$|When {{you look}} at the inhumane {{treatment}} of Jews, not only in Germany but occupied countries as well, you start worrying that such a demand might also be put on us, but we must clearly refuse such this due to their protection under the Danish constitution. I stated <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> meet such a demand towards Danish citizens. If such a demand is made, we would best meet it by all wearing the Star of David.|$|E
25|$|If {{somebody}} kept a {{very accurate}} {{record of a}} human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from {{a very different kind}} of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, sometimes; but we <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> stay mad, {{and always}} {{made it up}} again {{as soon as we}} could. Jimmy used to come round first, and say, 'All serene, Polly,' so kind and jolly, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> help {{laughing}} and being friends right away." ...|$|R
60|$|I nodded my head. At <b>that</b> moment <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{have spoken}} for worlds.|$|R
60|$|Something told me Sally Langdon {{was finding}} herself; <b>that</b> {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> frighten her, and then--then I would be doomed.|$|R
25|$|Know, good reader, {{that this}} towne of Shrewsbury, {{the place of}} my birth and {{residence}} is greatly troubled with a sect of men and women, with whom I have had much intercourse of concernment, not by way of intimate familiarity approving their ways, but of vexation and trouble of minde, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> in thirteene yeares painfull ministry among them, reclaime them from their wandring fancies, and reduce them to obedience to Supreme majestie, in the persons of two most illustrious and royal kings.|$|E
25|$|I saw in {{his hand}} a long spear of gold, and at the point {{there seemed to be}} a little fire. He {{appeared}} to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> wish to be rid of it...|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> replied <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{liked it}} well enough, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{certainly}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> claim {{so much for}} it.|$|R
60|$|THE GENERAL. But for <b>that</b> pipe, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{have faced}} you without {{breaking}} down. It has soothed me and nerved me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. My brother's {{expenses}} {{have been}} higher, as well, and I {{was driven to}} the conclusion <b>that</b> since <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford both, I'd better let the mare go and keep the brother." ...|$|R
500|$|I did not weep, and it pained me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> weep. But I {{had no more}} tears. And, in {{the depths}} of my being, in the {{recesses}} of my weakened conscience, could I have searched for it, I might perhaps have found something like–free at last! ...|$|E
500|$|I have {{demonstrated}} on myself in an injury occasioned by a fall, that it [...] {{did for me}} what surgeons could not do. Dr. Cushing of this city pronounced my injury incurable and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> survive three days because of it, when {{on the third day}} I rose from my bed and to the utter confusion of all I commenced my usual avocations and notwithstanding displacements, etc., I regained the natural position and functions of the body.|$|E
500|$|At the University of Chicago, {{where she}} earned an M.A. in 1936, Brodie lost {{her faith in}} {{religion}} entirely. In 1975, she recalled, [...] "It was like taking a hot coat off in the summertime. The sense of liberation I had at the University of Chicago was exhilarating. I felt very quickly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{go back to the}} old life, and I never did." [...] She continued to write to Jensen until shortly before she married Bernard Brodie on her graduation day, August 28, 1936.|$|E
60|$|Appleby nodded. “I {{am sorry}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{entertain}} it,” he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{need not}} begin here, Bertie; we {{are outside the}} line of sight. From <b>that</b> hole <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{see the end of}} these rocks. We will start at the middle, and work in {{opposite}} directions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were not}} more struck by it than I {{should have been}} last year this time, Olly. There are a good many sides to <b>that</b> wedding. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> tell you all of them, even if I tried." ...|$|R
500|$|Although {{the novel}} is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the {{striking}} thing about the work is [...] "how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events." [...] Jackson Benson believes that Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general. For example, Benson says that Hemingway drew out his experiences with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Hemingway believed that the writer could describe one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface—an approach he called the iceberg theory, or the theory of omission.|$|E
500|$|Jackson Benson {{believes}} Hemingway used autobiographical {{details as}} framing devices {{about life in}} general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{made his}} debut on 29 August 2004 in a 3–1 defeat against Feirense {{and was sent}} off for two bookable offences. The club {{finished}} 15th in Liga de Honra in the 2004–05 season, with Mendes making 17 league appearances. He scored his first goal for the club in his final game, a 4–0 win against Naval on 22 May 2005. After his contract with Santa Clara expired, he joined English Championship club Plymouth Argyle on their pre-season tour of Sweden in July 2005. Having appeared in friendlies against Betsele and Umeå, he signed a permanent contract with the club. [...] "I am delighted to have got him," [...] said manager Bobby Williamson of his new signing. [...] "It's a great opportunity <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> miss," [...] Mendes {{said in an interview}} with Portuguese newspaper Record. [...] "It is valid for two seasons, with a few perks that are unheard of in Portugal. Essentially, the level of premiums for targets, as is normal in English football." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, she {{had read}} me, she alone had entered into the source of that prevarication, the complex {{feelings}} from which it sprang. But at <b>that</b> moment <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> forgive her for humiliating me. I hugged my grievance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{just to the}} miller's marriage,' {{answered}} the bear carelessly. 'Of course, I would much rather stay at home, but the miller was so anxious I should be there <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really <b>could</b> <b>not</b> refuse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|And Miss Haldin added, after {{a moment}} of silence--"I was so moved by what I heard so {{unexpectedly}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> simply <b>could</b> <b>not</b> speak to you before.... A man of the people! Oh, our poor people!" ...|$|R
500|$|Lody {{began an}} {{apprenticeship}} at {{a grocery store}} in Halle in 1891, before moving to Hamburg two years later to join {{the crew of the}} sailing ship Sirius as a cabin boy. He studied at the maritime academy in Geestemünde, qualifying as a helmsman, and immediately afterwards served with the Imperial German Navy for a year between 1900 and 1901. Subsequently joining the First Naval Reserve, he enlisted as an officer on German merchant ships. In 1904 he returned to Geestemünde, where he successfully obtained a captain's licence. He fell seriously ill with what he later said was a stomach abscess, [...] "caused from a very badly cured typhoid attack of fever from which I suffered in Italy on account of the bad water at Genoa." [...] An operation was required, which weakened his left arm and his eyesight. As Lody put it, [...] "Consequently, my career as a seaman was closed as soon as I discovered that, and my doctor told me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> go any further." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, The Islamic Society in Denmark {{stated that}} they regretted their visit to Lebanon and Egypt in 2006 to show the caricatures because the {{consequences}} had been much more serious than they expected. In August 2013, Ahmed Akkari expressed his regret {{for his role in}} the Imams' tour of the Middle East, stating [...] "I want to be clear today about the trip: It was totally wrong. At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." [...] Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." [...] A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said [...] "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad. We have not changed our position." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes said she tried {{to talk him out}} of quitting, explaining: [...] "I looked in his face and he was really sure. It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days before}} the HELP {{confirmation}} hearing, former Surgeon General Richard Carmona went public with claims that the Bush Administration censored his speeches and buried his scientific reports. When asked about this at the hearing, Holsinger said, [...] "If I were faced with a situation <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> in good conscience do, I think I have a clear response to <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> would resign." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cheyne {{glanced at}} Breckenridge, who was {{watching}} him anxiously. [...] "In <b>that</b> case <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> think of worrying you, and have no doubt I can find out. In the meanwhile I guess {{the best thing you}} can do is to go to sleep again." ...|$|R
60|$|I stopped, for Nicholas had vaulted on his horse, and {{in another}} second was flying at full speed over the plain. Perhaps I was hard on him, but after the miseries <b>I</b> {{witnessed}} <b>that</b> day <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help trying to send the truth home.|$|R
2500|$|... "My fever has {{departed}} but {{has left}} me a very severe inflammation in the seeing [...] eye[...] [...] [...] My eye is yet so dark <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> read..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1941, {{during the}} German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, HKP 562 was deployed to Vilnius (Vilna), Lithuania. Plagge soon witnessed the genocide being carried out against the Jews of the area. Plagge would later testify that [...] "I saw unbelievable things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> support...it was then that I began to work against the Nazis".|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{newspaper}} article, trees blocked the way after the flight was in progress. Whitehead was quoted as saying, [...] "I knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> clear them by rising higher, and also that I had no means of steering around them by using the machinery." [...] The article said Whitehead quickly thought of a solution to steer around the trees: ...|$|E
60|$|I was so jaded and worn, at the Taylor dinner, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{remember}} 3 {{sentences of}} the speech I had memorized, and therefore got up and said so and excused myself from speaking. I arrived here at 3 o'clock this morning. I think the next 3 days will finish me. The idea of sitting down to a job of literary criticism is simply ludicrous.|$|R
60|$|I glanced {{quickly at}} de Cartienne. He seemed profoundly uninterested {{and was trying}} to build a house of the cards he had thrown down. Either he must be a perfect actor, or my vague suspicions were very ill-founded at <b>that</b> moment. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> decide which.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{promise to}} obey, {{it shall be}} under the {{conviction}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can keep <b>that</b> promise. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> obey a youth like Sir Philip. Besides, he would never command me. He would expect me always to rule--to guide--and I have no taste whatever for the office." ...|$|R
