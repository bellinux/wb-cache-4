Kim Ujing (later King Sinmu) approached Jang for help in taking the throne from the usurper who had killed Ujing‘s father. Jang is purported to have replied, “The ancients had a saying, ‘To see {{what is right and}} not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> want of courage.’ Though I am without ability, I shall follow your orders.” Thereupon Jang dispatched a force of 5000 men under the command of his closest companion and adviser Jeong Yeon (who had since also returned from Tang) in support of Sinmu's claim. The success of Sinmu's power grab won Jang Bogo the post of Prime Minister.|$|E

It lacked ready-made software, the keyboard {{was not easy to}} use, it did not have sufficiently advanced graphics to be able to replicate arcade-style games and its built-in memory was inadequate. Even so, he suggested, [...] "the ZX81 is a unique British product, part toy, part puzzle, part learning tool and I think that, provided one accepts its limitations and recognises that any computer will only do what it is told <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> good value as an introduction to the hobby of home computing." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics show Madonna's {{interest}} in her Roman Catholic upbringing, as the song theme is about a girl who admits to her father that she is pregnant and refuses {{to have an abortion}} or give up the baby for adoption despite what her friends are telling her <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> constructed in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third and final chorus. At the beginning, she addresses her father directly, asking him to talk to her as an adult, [...] "You should know by now that I'm not a baby". The transition to the chorus employs a more dramatic voice with a higher range, ending nearly in cries as she sings the word [...] "Please". Leading to the chorus, Madonna switches to a pleading voice, singing the song's main hook in a high tone. During the bridge, the song features a Spanish-inspired rhythm, one of the earliest examples of the influence that Hispanic music had on Madonna's musical style.|$|E

[...] Contributors were drawn only from his early supporters, and contributions were limited to $1,000. Nixon {{was not to be}} informed of the names of contributors; however, the fundraising letter stated that Nixon [...] "will of course be very appreciative of your continuing interest". By October 30, 1951, some $16,000 had been raised, of which Nixon had spent approximately $12,000, principally from contributors in the Los Angeles area. The senator's Christmas card expense for 1950 and 1951 totaled $4,237.54. Despite the initial fundraising success, only $2,200 could be raised from November 1951 to July 1952, and an engraving bill was unpaid pending a hoped-for contribution of $500.|$|E
