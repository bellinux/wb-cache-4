25|$|For his part, Ya`qub {{traveled}} through Khuzistan, {{during which he}} gained the defection of a former general of the caliph's, Abi'l-Saj Devdad, and entered Iraq. The caliphal general Masrur al-Balkhi managed to slow down his progress by flooding the land outside Wasit, but the Saffarid army was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> and he entered Wasit on March 24. Leaving Wasit, he set for the town of Dayr al-`Aqul, which was about fifty miles from Baghdad. According to one source, Ya`qub did not actually expect the caliph to offer battle; instead he would give in to any demands that the Saffarid had. Al-Mu'tamid, however, sent al-Muwaffaq to stop him. The two armies met at Istarband, between Dayr al-`Aqul and Sib Bani Kuma.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} {{appointments}} Harrison was forced to reverse was that of James S. Clarkson as an assistant postmaster. Clarkson, who had expected a full cabinet position, began sabotaging the appointment from the outset, gaining the reputation for [...] "decapitating a fourth class postmaster every three minutes". Clarkson himself stated, [...] "I am simply on detail from the Republican Committee...I am most anxious <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> task and leave." [...] He resigned in September 1890.|$|E

Trainor told [...] MTV News, [...] "Here's me being sassy {{and other people}} dancing with me and having just {{a good time and}} trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> feeling of, Ugh he's cheating on me again". The video was commissioned by information technology corporation Hewlett-Packard. It features several [...] "influencers"—actors, dancers and set designers with large social media followings. The influencers featured in the video include set designer Bri Emery; actors Marcus Johns, Cody Johns, and Robby Ayala; YouTube star Liza Koshy; dancers Les Twins; Spanish stylist Sara Escudero; hair stylist Kristin Ess; Japanese nail artist Mei Kawajiri; American dancer Chachi Gonzales; and Pomeranian dog Barkley the Pom. Andelman suggested showcasing behind-the-scenes events occurring during a music video shoot, which was used as the video's theme. Trainor's team asked the ad agency 180LA to make the music video similar to [...] "All About That Bass" [...] and not stray too far from it.|$|E

500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? How am I going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> day?'" [...] He also added that inspiration {{for the season}} came from [...] "the noir films from the ‘40s" [...] and [...] "film like Chinatown." ...|$|E
500|$|Eno {{has also}} said the album is about [...] "paint {{a picture of the}} human trying to survive in an {{increasingly}} digital world" [...] and Byrne considered his job as lyricist to [...] "bring more humanity" [...] to Eno's instrumentals, which can be [...] "cold and academic." [...] Themes of humanity struggling with technology are apparent on several tracks and Byrne has characterized the [...] "overall vibe" [...] of the album as [...] "We're going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this.</b> Humanity will prevail." [...] The lyrical content includes [...] "a sinister inflection" [...] but [...] "many songs feel fairly uplifting and the overall tone is hopeful." [...] Byrne focused on mundane events and attempted to write in a style that was [...] "simple but not corny, basic but heartfelt." [...] His inspiration in writing lyrics for [...] "OneFineDay" [...] was the story of ValentinoAchakDeng as told in DaveEggers' —the two are thanked in the liner notes and Byrne had previously performed at a fundraiser for Eggers' 826Valencia. The story of the LostBoys of Sudan is emblematic of the spiritual themes of the album as they go through [...] "all kinds of unrelenting horrors, but [...] eternally hopeful and even cheerful, in a way that defies all logic." [...] The music on this album also expresses homesickness—a lyrical trend that is apparent in Byrne's work with TalkingHeads.|$|E
500|$|Cooder {{recorded}} most of Election Special at Drive-By Studios, {{the living}} room of engineer Martin Pradler's house in North Hollywood. Sessions also took place at Wireland Studios in Chatsworth, California. Pradler later mixed and mastered the album at both recording locations. The album was produced entirely by Cooder. He performed most of the album himself, playing bass, guitar, and mandolin. His son Joachim contributed on drums, and session musician Arnold McCuller sung harmony vocals on the song [...] "Take Your Hands off It". At Drive-By Studios, Cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed, single-take performances, which he felt helped him channel the songs' respective characters more efficiently. He later said of his approach to developing the songs, [...] "The way I think these songs can work is if you don't ponder over it too hard, because the tunes wanna have a spontaneous-combustion effect. What I want to do is get a certain attitude in the voice, and I can only do that once. By take two, I'm startin' to think about it. By take three, I'm startin' to map it out – it's gone. It's spoiled, y'see? So I need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> fast." [...] He first recorded the song [...] "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] in November 2011. On June 7, 2012, the album's release was announced for a date in August, intended to be a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention.|$|E

500|$|Three {{reviewers for}} Computer Gaming World had {{conflicting}} reactions. Ken St. Andre—designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG—approved {{of the game}} despite his dislike of the D system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, [...] "take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a [...] "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that [...] "patience (possibly of Job) [...] required <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> one". Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role-playing gamers [...] "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who [...] "love dungeons, dragons, and drama". In their March 1989 [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called [...] "The Lessers") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as [...] "the first offering that truly follows AD game rules", calling it a [...] "great fantasy role-playing game" [...] that [...] "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD game players". The reviewers advised readers to [...] "rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would [...] "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The Dragon reviewers criticized the [...] "notoriously slow" [...] technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, {{so much so that}} they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) graphics mode.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} was delivered following two separate legal challenges {{by both the}} government and the opposition that sought to determine the minister who was responsible for allowing elections to take place. The ruling gave the opposition the necessary notices required to begin the by-election process in the constituency, which would allow them to gain a majority in parliament and, theoretically, pass a motion of no confidence in the government. Opposition member and lawyer Taukelina Finikaso said the following after the ruling: [...] "We have certainly been working with our candidate and we are quietly confident we will be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> by-election." ...|$|E
30|$|The Chinese, Indians and French trailed on {{the lower}} end of the mean scores for the Navigating Ambiguity proficiency. The Chinese culture is high on “uncertainty avoidance”, (Hofstede, 1997) which is not {{surprising}} given the country’s history of authoritarian rule. Therefore, any areas of ambiguity need to be clearly laid out for them with specific steps and actions in how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> it. <b>This</b> may partially explain why the Chinese scored the lowest on the Navigating Ambiguity competency.|$|R

Darabont {{did not want to}} attempt conveying on screen the protagonist being involved in an extramarital affair. The characters in the film, portrayed by Thomas Jane and Laurie Holden respectively, instead share a more emotional relationship. Jane explained, [...] "We kind of form a little family, sort of surrogate family where my son and I'm a father and she becomes the mother to the son. We become a little unit as we're trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> nightmare together." [...] Holden compared the nightmare to what refugees experienced at the Louisiana Superdome during Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

In this survey paper we are trying to expose advanced techniques to mine data even though data is not synchronous at source pages. We are explaining view arranging algorithm in this survey which manage tuples in data base, by creating pairs and tables as result of query. This mining is done by analysing tag as well as data consequences. The survey result shows this technique to mine data is more efficient...|$|R
