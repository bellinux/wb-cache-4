Carp {{was shocked by}} the violent backlash, and, {{although}} he did not sign up to a common platform, joined the peaceful March of Mourning into the Assembly Palace. Carp thus witnessed the unresolved shooting incident, during which an Assembly usher was shot dead. It has been reported that Carp verbally assaulted PNL minister Dimitrie Sturdza, grabbing him by the collar and pointing to the dead body: [...] "You rascal, <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> deeds!" [...] When government briefly arrested two United Opposition agitators, the PNL man Nicolae Fleva and the junior Conservative Nicolae Filipescu, Carp denounced a cover-up attempt: [...] "If impertinence were enough to hide a murder, the government would be clean as snow; if numbers were enough to guarantee impunity, you'd go unpunished." ...|$|E
