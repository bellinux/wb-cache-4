5|$|The McDonnell XF-85 Goblin was an American {{prototype}} fighter aircraft conceived during World War II by McDonnell Aircraft.

The XF-85's intended role was to defend bombers from hostile interceptor aircraft, a need demonstrated during World War II. Two prototypes were constructed before the program was terminated.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} reorganized and redesignated on 10 December 1971 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 220th Military Police Brigade, {{allowing}} it to command {{a larger number of}} military police units. On 16 April 1980 the brigade's command element was again reorganized as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 220th Military Police Brigade. Prior to the Iraq War, the brigade remained on reserve status, prepared to deploy if needed, but it was never called upon for any contingency operations or conflicts, as other active duty military police commands, primarily the 16th Military Police Brigade, were called upon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> instead. By 1999, after 40 years of existence, the brigade had yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> to a foreign theater of operations or participate in any conflicts or contingencies.|$|E

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) conducted Amalgam Virgo exercises on May 6 and 7 across the Greater Toronto Area using CF-18 Hornet jets, CH-124 Sea Kings, and CH-146 Griffon helicopters at low altitudes.

5|$|After the transformation, the reorganized brigade {{retained}} the 3–17th Cavalry and 1- and 2–10th Aviation. 3–10th Aviation and C-10th Aviation were inactivated. Also reactivated {{as part of}} the reorganized unit were 6th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment and the 277th Aviation Support Battalion. During the transition elements of the 10th Aviation continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> as part of Task Forces part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, with units returning to Fort Drum for reorganization after their tours were complete.

5|$|During late 1969, Phase IV sensors began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> in-theater. These had {{a greater}} number of {{available}} communications channels, which allowed the seeding of a larger sensor field without fear of signal interference. By 1971–1972 a new sensor with a commandable microphone (COMMMIKE III) and another with a vehicle ignition detector (EDET III, which could detect the unshielded ignition systems of gasoline engines) were introduced. In 1972 U.S. dollars the ADSID cost $619.00, the ACOUSID $1,452.00, and the engine detector $2,997.00. During the life of the operation approximately 20,000 sensors were deployed in Laos.|$|E

An alternative measure was the acquisition of six AW101s from Denmark in 2007; designated Merlin HC3A, these {{were assigned to the}} RAF, allowing Merlins <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> in Afghanistan. The HC3A is used for training and not for frontline operations due to various configuration differences. In December 2007, a second Merlin squadron, No. 78 Squadron was formed at RAF Benson.|$|E

Thus strings, harpsichords and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed {{at the point}} of transition from the Renaissance era to the Baroque, L'Orfeo employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of polyphony. The work is not orchestrated as such; in the Renaissance tradition instrumentalists followed the composer's general instructions but were given considerable freedom to improvise.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1951, the 45th Infantry Division was {{activated}} as {{the first}} National Guard division <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> to the Far East theater since World War II. Nevertheless, it was not deployed to Korea until December 1951, when its advanced training was complete. Following its arrival, the division moved to the front line to replace the 1st Cavalry Division, who were then delegated to the Far East reserve, having suffered over 16,000 casualties in less than 18 months of fighting.|$|E
