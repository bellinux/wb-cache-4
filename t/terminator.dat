5|$|<b>Terminator</b> 2: Judgment Day (also {{referred}} to as <b>Terminator</b> 2 or T2) is a 1991 American science-fiction action film co-written, produced and directed by James Cameron. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Robert Patrick, with Edward Furlong also in its principal cast as John Connor. It is the sequel to the 1984 film The <b>Terminator,</b> and the second installment in the <b>Terminator</b> franchise. <b>Terminator</b> 2 follows Sarah Connor (Hamilton) and her ten-year-old son John (Furlong) as they are pursued by a new, more advanced <b>Terminator,</b> the liquid metal, shapeshifting T-1000 (Patrick), sent {{back in time to}} kill John Connor and prevent him from becoming the leader of the human resistance. A second, less advanced <b>Terminator</b> (Schwarzenegger) is also sent back in time to protect John.|$|E
5|$|After {{production}} finished on The <b>Terminator,</b> some post-production {{shots were}} needed. These included scenes showing the <b>Terminator</b> outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 Los Angeles, a cyborg assassin {{known as}} a <b>Terminator</b> arrives from 2029 and steals guns and clothes. Shortly afterward, Kyle Reese, a human soldier from 2029, arrives. He steals clothes and evades the police. The <b>Terminator</b> begins {{systematically}} killing women named Sarah Connor, whose addresses he finds in the telephone directory. He tracks the last Sarah Connor to a nightclub, but Kyle rescues her. The pair steal a car and escape with the <b>Terminator</b> pursuing them in a police car.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{transcriptional}} termination in prokaryotes, rho-dependent termination and intrinsic termination (also called Rho-independent termination). Rho-dependent <b>terminators</b> account for about half of the E. coli factor-dependent <b>terminators.</b> Other termination factors discovered in E. coli include Tau and nusA. Rho-dependent <b>terminators</b> were first discovered in bacteriophage genomes.|$|R
40|$|We present WebGeSTer DB, {{the largest}} {{database}} of intrinsic transcription <b>terminators</b> ([URL] The database comprises {{of a million}} <b>terminators</b> identified in 1060 bacterial genome sequences and 798 plasmids. Users can obtain both graphic and tabular results on putative <b>terminators</b> based on default or user-defined parameters. The results are arranged in different tiers to facilitate retrieval, as per the specific requirements. An interactive map has been incorporated to visualize the distribution of <b>terminators</b> across the whole genome. Analysis of the results, both at the whole-genome level and with respect to <b>terminators</b> downstream of specific genes, offers insight into the prevalence of canonical and non-canonical <b>terminators</b> across different phyla. The data in the database reinforce the paradigm that intrinsic termination is a conserved and efficient regulatory mechanism in bacteria. Our database is freely accessible...|$|R
5|$|In August 2010, it was {{reported}} that a new <b>Terminator</b> film was being developed. The new film would not be a direct sequel to Salvation, but rather an animated reboot of the original series. It would have been entitled <b>Terminator</b> 3000 and would be shot by Hannover House. However, Pacificor, the owner of the rights to the <b>Terminator</b> franchise, had not given any official license to Hannover House to develop a new film.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Terminator</b> kills Sarah's {{mother and}} impersonates her when Sarah, {{unaware of the}} Terminator's ability to mimic victims, {{attempts}} to contact her via telephone. When they realize he has reacquired them, they escape in a pickup truck. In the ensuing chase, Kyle is wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the <b>Terminator.</b> Enraged‚ Sarah knocks the <b>Terminator</b> off his motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The <b>Terminator</b> hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah, but Kyle slides a pipe bomb onto the tanker, causing an explosion that burns the flesh from the Terminator's endoskeleton. It pursues them to a factory, where Kyle activates machinery to confuse the <b>Terminator.</b> He jams his final pipe bomb into the Terminator's abdomen, blowing the <b>Terminator</b> apart, injuring Sarah, and killing Kyle. The Terminator's still functional torso reactivates and grabs Sarah. She breaks free and lures it into a hydraulic press, crushing it.|$|E

The <b>Terminator</b> premiered at number 35 on the top video cassette rentals and number 20 on top video cassette sales charts. In its second week, The <b>Terminator</b> reached number 4 on the top video cassette rentals and number 12 on top video cassette sales charts.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecent {{work has}} shown that the ability of moving contour <b>terminators</b> to {{determine}} the perceived motion of untextured contours is strongly constrained by whether contour <b>terminators</b> are classified as intrinsic (belonging to a moving contour) or extrinsic (belonging to a surface occluding a moving contour). It has also been demonstrated that stereopsis can play a decisive role in this classification. Specifically, Shimojo, Silverman and Nakayama (1989, Vision Research 29, 619 – 626) argued that the efficacy of stereopsis in classifying moving contour <b>terminators</b> as intrinsic or extrinsic stemmed from the relative depth relationships specified by binocular disparity. Here, evidence is presented which demonstrates that the visual system relies on the presence of unpaired contour <b>terminators</b> to classify stereoscopic contour <b>terminators</b> as extrinsic. The author shows that the tendency to perceive untextured contours translating in a single rectangular aperture in a direction parallel to the longer axis of the aperture (the barberpole illusion) was not abolished by stereoscopic depth differences when the contour <b>terminators</b> were interocularly paired. However, the illusion was abolished when the contours <b>terminators</b> along the longer axis of the aperture were interocularly unpaired. Moreover, contours translated within a square aperture revealed a systematic shift towards the direction of motion signaled by the binocularly paired contour <b>terminators</b> along the horizontal edges of the aperture. These results demonstrate that the classification of stereoscopic contour <b>terminators</b> along an extrinsic–intrinsic dimension results from the presence of local, unpaired contour <b>terminators</b> rather than the relative depth or disparity differences per se, or via the global integration of contour <b>terminators</b> across multiple apertures when multiple apertures are present...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Intrinsic <b>terminators,</b> which encode GC-rich RNA hairpins {{followed}} {{immediately by}} a 7 -to- 9 -nucleotide (nt) U-rich “U-tract, ” play principal roles of punctuating and regulating transcription in most bacteria. However, canonical intrinsic termi-nators with strong U-tracts are underrepresented in some bacterial lineages, notably mycobacteria, leading to proposals that their RNA polymerases stop at noncanonical intrinsic <b>terminators</b> encoding various RNA structures lacking U-tracts. We gener-ated recombinant forms of mycobacterial RNA polymerase and its major elongation factors NusA and NusG to characterize my-cobacterial intrinsic termination. Using {{in vitro transcription}} assays devoid of possible mycobacterial contaminants, we estab-lished that mycobacterial RNA polymerase terminates more efficiently than Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at canonical <b>terminators</b> with imperfect U-tracts but does not terminate at putative <b>terminators</b> lacking U-tracts even {{in the presence of}} my-cobacterial NusA and NusG. However, mycobacterial NusG exhibits a novel termination-stimulating activity that may allow in-trinsic <b>terminators</b> with suboptimal U-tracts to function efficiently. IMPORTANCE Bacteria rely on transcription termination to define and regulate units of gene expression. In most bacteria, precise termination and much regulation by attenuation are accomplished by intrinsic <b>terminators</b> that encode GC-rich hairpins and U-tracts necessary to disrupt stable transcription elongation complexes. Thus, the apparent dearth of canonical intrinsic termi-nators with recognizable U-tracts in mycobacteria is of significant interest both because noncanonical intrinsic <b>terminators</b> could reveal novel routes to destabilize transcription complexes and because accurate understanding of termination is crucia...|$|R
5|$|A third-person shooter {{video game}} {{of the same name}} was {{released}} on the same week of the release of the film. Christian Bale declined to lend his voice, so Gideon Emery voiced the character of John Connor. The game, however, features the voices of Common and Moon Bloodgood as Barnes and Blair Williams, respectively. Despite not appearing in the film, Rose McGowan voiced the character of Angie Salter, an ex-high school teacher. The game is set in 2016, after the events of <b>Terminator</b> 3: Rise of the Machines and before the events of <b>Terminator</b> Salvation. Another video game also titled <b>Terminator</b> Salvation was released in 2010 in the arcades. It's a light gun shooter developed by Play Mechanix and published by Raw Thrills.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 2007, it was {{announced}} that production rights to the <b>Terminator</b> series had passed from the feuding Vajna and Kassar to the Halcyon Company. The producers hoped to start a new trilogy based on the franchise. The purchase was financed with a loan by Pacificor, a hedge fund from Santa Monica. By July 19, the project was in legal limbo due to a lawsuit between MGM and Halcyon subsidiary T Asset. MGM had an exclusive window of 30 days to negotiate for distribution of the <b>Terminator</b> films. When negotiating for <b>Terminator</b> 4, Halcyon rejected their initial proposal, and MGM suspended negotiations. After the 30 days were over, MGM claimed that the period during which negotiations were suspended did not count and their exclusive period was still open. Halcyon asked a court for an injunction allowing them to approach other distributors. Later, the lawsuit was settled and MGM got a 30-day right of first refusal to finance and distribute the fifth <b>Terminator</b> film.|$|E
