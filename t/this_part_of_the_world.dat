The Cambrian Explosion of life took place over about 15million years in <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the trilobites, were abundant. An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550million years ago. As its {{shoreline}} moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.|$|E
25|$|Couscous was {{originally}} made from millet. Historians have different opinions {{as to when}} wheat began to replace the use of millet.

25|$|In early January, Yudenich {{secretly}} {{left its}} winter quarters and marched towards the major Ottoman fort at Erzurum. The winter is not normally {{a time for}} military activity in <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The bitter cold and terrible roads contributed greatly to the annihilation of Enver Pasha's 3rd Army in the previous year.

The Russians achieved total surprise and destroyed an Ottoman division that was in winter quarters at Battle of Koprukoy (January 10–18).|$|E
25|$|Eurasian haplogroups such as Haplogroup J and Haplogroup R1 {{have also}} been {{observed}} at very minimal frequencies. A thorough study by Cruciani et al. (2004) which analyzed populations from Morocco concludes that the North African pattern of Y-chromosomal variation (including both J1 and R1b haplogroups) is largely of Neolithic origin, {{which suggests that the}} Neolithic transition in <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was accompanied by demic diffusion of Berber-speaking pastoralists from the Algerian Desert into Eastern Morocco, although later papers have suggested that this date could have been as long as ten thousand years ago, with the transition from the Oranian to the Capsian culture in North Africa.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{this most}} of the {{vineyards}} in Argentina are planted on ungrafted rootstock. There are many theories about why phylloxera has not yet reach <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The centuries-old tradition of flood irrigation where water is allowed to deeply saturate the soil may be one reason, as is the high proportion of sand present in the soil. The relative isolation of Argentina is also cited as a potential benefit against phylloxera with the country's wine regions being bordered by mountains, deserts and oceans that create natural barriers against {{the spread of the}} louse. Despite the minimal risk of phylloxera, some producers are switching to grafted rootstock that provide better yield control.|$|E

Though large and powerful, the copper shark is not particularly aggressive towards humans unless in the presence of food. Copper Sharks have been known to harass and attack spear fishers in an attempt to steal catches. Copper sharks have bitten several swimmers in Australia and New Zealand, where the species is common.

2500|$|Sidestrand {{has been}} forever personified as [...] "Poppyland" [...] having been {{described}} as such by Clement Scott In 1883.

2500|$|Herodotus {{provides}} {{much information}} {{about the nature of}} the world and the status of science during his lifetime, often engaging in private speculation. For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the Nile was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from Phoenician sailors that, while circumnavigating Africa, they [...] "saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards". Owing to this brief mention, which is included almost as an afterthought, it has been argued that Africa was indeed circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been.
