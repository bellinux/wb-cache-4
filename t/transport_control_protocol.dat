50|$|The Media Plane {{controls}} the {{audio and video}} mixing and streaming.

The RTP and UDP normally carry information such the payload type which {{is the type of}} codec, frame rate, video size and many others.

50|$|Designing {{a network}} {{protocol}} to support streaming media raises many problems. Datagram protocols, {{such as the}} User Datagram Protocol (UDP), send the media stream {{as a series of}} small packets. This is simple and efficient; however, there is no mechanism within the protocol to guarantee delivery. It is up to the receiving application to detect loss or corruption and recover data using error correction techniques. If data is lost, the stream may suffer a dropout. The Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) and the Real-time <b>Transport</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Protocol</b> (RTCP) were specifically designed to stream media over networks. RTSP runs over a variety of transport protocols, while the latter two are built on top of UDP.|$|E

So the performance of network should be dominated by this property. Packet Round-trip Delay is an important measurement of network performance. In this paper, we present evidence that LRD exists in packet round-trip delays. This discovery has serious implications for understanding the impact on network performance of LRD network traffic, and design of <b>transport</b> <b>control</b> <b>protocols</b> for special applications, i. e., of teleconferencing. Statistical analyses show that the complementary probability distribution of packet round-trip delays decays more slowly than exponential rate; this fact probably justifies the studies on the prediction of the queue length distribution with LRD network traffic.

40|$|How to {{implement}} an impeccable space system-of-systems (SoS) internetworking architecture {{has been a}} significant issue in system engineering for years.

With the help of existing TCP modifications, this paper contributes an aggressive congestion control mechanism. The proposed mechanism is characterized with a fast start procedure, as well as the feedback information to analyze network traffic and with a link terminating processing mechanism, which can help to reveal the real reason of packet loss, and maintain the size of congestion window at a high level. Simulation results are shown in the end to verify the proposed scheme...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Advancements in technologies, {{semiconductor}} industry and communications resulted in construction of wireless sensors. Wireless sensors are self-managing and sensing devices having {{the capability to}} communicate with each other and sink node wirelessly. The sink node can then take decision according to the application they are being used for; upon the reception of messages from node. Generally, <b>transport</b> <b>control</b> <b>protocols</b> provides reliable data transfer with congestion control and recovery support. This support is very important in wireless networks where data is more likely to be lost than wired network. In wireless sensor networks (WSN), there are limited resources like energy, memory, and signal strength. Therefore in WSN, QoS is very important in order to reduce the impact of data loss and data reliability. This paper provides a comparative study on STCP and RMST transport layer protocol in order to study their effect on QoS. We used throughput, packet drop rate, delay and scaling in sensor nodes and source nodes is studied. Index Terms—QoS, STCP, RMST I...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the TCP {{congestion}} control mechanism from a global optimization {{point of view}} is not only important in its own right, but also crucial to the design of other <b>transport</b> layer traffic <b>control</b> <b>protocols</b> with provable properties. In this paper, we derive a global utility function and the corresponding optimal control law, known as TCP control law, which maximizes the global utility. The TCP control law captures the essential behaviors of TCP, including slow start, congestion avoidance, and the binary nature of congestion feedback in TCP. We find that the utility function of TCP is linear in the slow start phase and is proportional to the additive increase rate and approaches the well-known logarithm function as the data rate becomes large in the congestion avoidance phase. We also find that understanding the slow start phase with a fixed threshold is critical to the design of new <b>transport</b> layer <b>control</b> <b>protocols</b> to enable quality of service features.
