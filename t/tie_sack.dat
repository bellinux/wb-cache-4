50|$|By August 1802, Leclerc's {{forces had}} begun to suffer from mass defections of black and mulatto troops. In October, the former rebel leaders Alexander Petion, Henri Christophe, Jean-Jacques Dessalines all deserted the French forces as well. The French forces, now only 8,000 to 10,000 men and only just able to serve, were overwhelmed. After the recently-defected Christophe massacred several hundred Polish {{soldiers}} at Port-de-Paix, Leclerc ordered the arrest of all remaining black colonial troops in Cap-Haïtien, and executed 1000 of them by <b>tying</b> <b>sacks</b> of flour to their neck and pushing them {{off the side of}} ships. The French subsequently sent orders to arrest and imprison all the black troops in the colony still serving within the French forces. This included continually loyal officers such as Maurepas, who was drowned with his family in the harbor of Cap Haitien on Leclerc's orders in early November.|$|R
5000|$|By October 1802, Leclerc {{wrote to}} Bonaparte advocating {{for a war}} of extermination, declaring that [...] "We must destroy all the blacks of the mountains--men and women--and spare only {{children}} under 12 years of age. We must destroy half {{of those in the}} plains and must not leave a single colored person in the colony who has worn an epaulette." [...] In that letter to Bonaparte, Leclerc also lamented his assignment, declaring [...] "My soul is withered, and no joyful thought can ever make forget these hideous scenes." [...] In the meantime, more black and mulatto army officers had defected, including Jean Jacques Dessalines, Alexandre Pétion and Henri Christophe. After Christophe massacred several hundred Polish soldiers at Port-de-Paix following his defection, Leclerc ordered the arrest of all remaining black colonial troops in Le Cap, and executed 1000 of them by <b>tying</b> <b>sacks</b> of flour to their neck and pushing them off the side of ships.|$|R

40|$|In Greek mythology, {{the hero}} Odysseus {{receives}} {{a gift of}} the world’s wind in a carefully <b>tied</b> <b>sack.</b> Only one favorable tailwind was free to blow his ship safely home. But {{in the course of}} the night, the other winds are released with catastrophic consequences for Odysseus’ fleet, resulting in multiple wrecks. In the article we take the myth about Odysseus and the winds as a picture of students’ educational navigation after the Danish Study progress reform (2013). We show how the reform was initially characterized by an unambiguous belief that it is possible to tether and align the various motives and reasons for studying (winds), all while in practice the students translate the reform’s demand for quick completion in a number of unforeseeable ways. With the concept of “risk translation” we show how the students’ navigations is not just a question of fast completion, but also of protecting a number of often enjoyable, study activities, constituting  a good study life. The analysis in this article is built upon a country-wide questionnaire among approximately 4500 university students (2015), along with a series of focus group interviews with students at the University of Copenhagen (2013 - 2016) ...|$|R

It was covered with very broad strong bandages, thickly wound and roughly tied, {{sometimes}} by means of simple knots, the whole working the appearance of having been executed in great haste and with difficulty. Just over the head was a large lump. Presently, the bandages covering it were off, and there, on the face, lay a second roll of papyrus. I put down my hand to lift it, but it would not come away. It appeared to be fixed to the stout seamless shroud which was drawn over the whole body, and tied beneath the feet--as a farmer <b>ties</b> <b>sacks.</b> This shroud, which was also thickly waxed, was in one piece, being made to fit the form like a garment. I took a candle and examined the roll and then I saw why it was fast. The spices had congealed and glued it to the sack-like shroud. It was impossible to get it away without tearing the outer sheets of papyrus.[*] ...|$|R
