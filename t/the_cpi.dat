25|$|During {{this time}} the {{international}} communist movement went through a major internal crisis and upheaval with the Sino-Soviet Split. Developing from 1960 on, sharp polemics over revolutionary strategy were exchanged between the two countries.

25|$|Bains {{came from}} Mahilpur in Hoshiarpur {{district}} of Punjab state, India. His family were members or {{supporters of the}} Communist Party of India (CPI) and he joined its youth wing. <b>The</b> <b>CPI</b> that Bains knew as a teenager was a mass and militant party. Operating underground {{for part of the}} 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>CPI</b> won back its legality in time for the general elections of 1957, where it emerged as the largest opposition party in the country and held state government in Kerala. By this time, however, a young Bains had apparently quit <b>the</b> <b>CPI</b> in protest of its acceptance of Nikita Khrushchev’s criticisms of Joseph Stalin. Bains, according to the CPC (ML)'s official biography, immigrated to Canada from India two years later in 1959 at age nineteen. In Vancouver, he pursued post-graduate studies at the University of British Columbia from 1960 to 1965, in Bacteriology.|$|E

40|$|Using local projections, {{this paper}} investigates effects of {{commodity}} price shocks on inflation. We estimate impulse {{responses of the}} consumer price indexes (CPIs) to a commodity price shock, based on a monthly panel consisting of 120 countries. Our results from the local projections suggest that <b>the</b> <b>CPIs</b> are almost fully adjusted within a year {{in response to a}} commodity price shock and thus effects of commodity price shocks are transitory. We then explore the possibility that the responses of <b>the</b> <b>CPIs</b> may be dependent on the inflation regimes. Based on the smooth transition autoregressive models that use the past inflation rate as a transition variable, we find that commodity price shocks have more persistent effects on inflation in the low inflation regime than in the high inflation regime. Our analysis also shows that, in the high inflation regime, there are (i) stabilizing roles of the exchange rate on consumer prices; and (ii) large differences in price responses between developed and developing countries. However, these effects are not detected in the low inflation regime. Our findings suggest that business cycle factors may {{play an important role in}} understanding effects of commodity price shocks on <b>the</b> <b>CPIs...</b>|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>CPI</b> was bitterly divided over the manner in which {{political}} power in India should be captured.

40|$|In {{the debate}} over federal budget deficits, several {{politicians}} have proposed to change the formulas that determine benefit levels for Social Security and other government {{programs as well as}} income tax brackets.

Proponents of this proposal argue that <b>the</b> Chained <b>CPI</b> is a more accurate formula and any impact on beneficiaries of the government programs affected would be mitigated by increased tax revenue from the wealthy. However, this issue brief effectively refutes those arguments by showing that switching to <b>the</b> Chained <b>CPI</b> would result in cuts to already modest Social Security benefits, that it is likely that <b>the</b> Chained <b>CPI</b> is not an accurate measure of the inflation rate seen by seniors and that <b>the</b> Chained <b>CPI</b> would lead to income tax increases for working Americans...|$|R
