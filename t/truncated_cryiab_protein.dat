40|$|The {{persistence}} of <b>CryIAb</b> <b>protein</b> rhizosecreted in soil {{is important in}} the assessment of its environmental risk. Here we report that <b>CryIAb</b> <b>protein</b> from transgenic maize does not accumulate at high levels in soils. Levels of <b>CryIAb</b> <b>protein</b> rhizosecreted by three maize transgenic events (BT 11, MON 810 and 176) were studied in hydroponic cultures and found only in the MON 810 and BT 11 events but not in event 176 or control plants. Under field conditions, the cryIAb gene and a basal level of <b>CryIAb</b> <b>protein</b> was detected in soils from plots cultivated with transgenic and non-transgenic maize, possibly from Bacillus thuringiensis present in the soils...|$|R
40|$|Maize MON 810 {{is one of}} the European Union (EU) {{authorised}} {{genetically modified}} organisms (GMO) for placing on the food and feed market. The total number of MON 810 varieties registeredin the European Common Catalogues of varieties of agricultural plant species has almost tripled since 2005. One ofthe requirements described in EU legislation, namely the genetic stability of GM seed varieties, was thus assessed by analysing the intactness of the entire MON 810 integration and its genotypic stability in commercial varieties available on the market for at least the last two years. A combined strategy using qualitative analytical methods made possible to determine the presence/absence of the individual genetic elements and of the whole GM construct. The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns obtained from amplified whole constructs by long PCR were compared side by side. <b>CryIA(b)</b> <b>protein</b> expression levels were determined by ELISA. Twenty-four out of the 26 analysed varieties met the expected stability features. One variety gave negative results in all assays and one variety contained the necessary genetic elements for expressing <b>CryIA(b)</b> <b>protein,</b> although giving negative results for the long PCR product. To our knowledge, this study is the first post-marketing stability analysis performed on GM commerical seed varieties. JRC. I. 3 -Molecular Biology and Genomic...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{expression}} of the insect control protein genes of Bacillus thuringiensis in plants has been critical {{to the development of}} genetically improved plants with agronomically acceptable levels of insect resistance. The {{expression of}} the cryIA(b) gene was compared to partially modified (3 % nucleotide difference) and to fully modified (21 % nucleotide difference) cryIA(b) and cryIA(c) genes in tobacco and tomato. The modified genes increased the frequency of plants that produced the proteins at quantities sufficient to control insects and dramatically increased the levels of these proteins. Among the most highly expressing transformed plants for each gene, the plants with the partially modified cryIA(b) gene had a 10 -fold higher level of insect control protein and plants with the fully modified cryIA(b) had a 100 -fold higher level of <b>CryIA(b)</b> <b>protein</b> compared with the wild-type gene. Similar results were obtained with the fully modified cryIA(c) gene in plants. Specific sequences of the partially modified cryIA(b) gene were analyzed for their ability to affect cryIA(b) gene expression in tobacco. The DNA sequence of a single region was identified as important to the improvement of plant {{expression of the}} cryIA(b) gene. The increased levels of cryIA(b) mRNA were not directly proportional to the increased levels of <b>CryIA(b)</b> <b>protein</b> in plants transformed with the modified cryIA(b) genes, indicating that the nucleotide sequence of these genes had an effect in improving their translational efficiency in plants...|$|R
40|$|The toxicities to neonate Spodoptera exigua and Trichoplusia ni of {{lyophilized}} powders {{obtained from}} sporulated liquid cultures (referred to as sporulated cultures) and Escherichia coli-expressed P 1 [cryIA(a) cryIA(b) cryIA(c) ] protoxins from three-gene strains of NRD- 12 and HD- 1 of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki {{were determined by}} using diet incorporation bioassays. Although sporulated cultures from both strains were more toxic to T. ni than S. exigua, {{there were no differences}} in toxicity between NRD- 12 and HD- 1. Toxicities of the three individual P 1 protoxins against S. exigua varied by at least fivefold, with the <b>cryIA(b)</b> <b>protein</b> being the most toxic. These same protoxins varied in toxicity against T. ni by at least 16 -fold, with the cryIA(c) protein being the most toxic. However, when tested against either S. exigua or T. ni, there were no differences in toxicity between an NRD- 12 P 1 protoxin and the corresponding HD- 1 P 1 protoxin. Comparing the toxicities of individual protoxins with that of sporulated cultures demonstrates that no individual protoxin was as toxic to S. exigua as the sporulated cultures. However, this same comparison against T. ni shows that both the <b>cryIA(b)</b> and cryIA(c) <b>proteins</b> are at least as toxic as the sporulated cultures. Results from this study suggest that NRD- 12 is not more toxic to S. exigua than HD- 1, that different protein types have variable host activity, and that other B. thuringiensis components are not required for T. ni toxicity but that other components such as spores might be required for S. exigua toxicity...|$|R
40|$|To test our {{hypothesis}} that substitution of domain III of Bacillus thuringiensis delta-endotoxin (Cry) proteins might improve toxicity to pest insects, e. g., Spodoptera exigua, in vivo recombination {{was used to}} produce a number of cryIA(b) -cryIC hybrid genes. A rapid screening assay was subsequently exploited to select hybrid genes encoding soluble protoxins. Screening of 120 recombinants yielded two different hybrid genes encoding soluble proteins with domains I and II of CryIA(b) and domain III of CryIC. These proteins differed by only one amino acid residue. Both hybrid protoxins gave a protease-resistant toxin upon in vitro activation by trypsin. Bioassays showed {{that one of these}} <b>CryIA(b)</b> -CryIC hybrid <b>proteins</b> (H 04) was highly toxic to S. exigua compared with the parental <b>CryIA(b)</b> <b>protein</b> and significantly more toxic than CryIC. In semiquantitative binding studies with biotin-labelled toxins and intact brush border membrane vesicles of S. exigua, this domain III substitution appeared not to affect binding-site specificity. However, binding to a 200 -kDa <b>protein</b> by <b>CryIA(b)</b> in preparations of solubilized and blotted brush border membrane vesicle proteins was completely abolished by the domain III substitution. A reciprocal hybrid containing domains I and II of CryIC and domain III of CryIA(b) did bind to the 200 -kDa protein, confirming that domain III of CryIA(b) was essential for this reaction. These results show that domain III of CryIC protein {{plays an important role in}} the level of toxicity to S. exigua, that substitution of domain III may be a powerful tool to increase the repertoire of available active toxins for pest insects, and that domain III is involved in binding to gut epithelium membrane proteins of S. exigua...|$|R
40|$|A {{population}} of 42 transgenic sugarcane (Saccharum hybrid, cv. Ja 60 - 5) clones expressing a <b>truncated</b> <b>cryIA(b)</b> gene from Bacillus thuringiensis was evaluated in field trials under artificial borer (Diatraea saccharalis Fab.) infection. Five clones displaying the highest borer tolerance were selected and analysed with molecular tools (RAPD, AFLP and RAMP) to verify genomic changes. Results of field trials provided evidence {{both for the}} expression of the resistance trait and for the occurrence of limited but consistent morphological, physiological and phytopathological variation, as compared with control plants regenerated from dedifferentiated culture without transformation (C 1 -control) or with plants that were clonally propagated in the field (C 2 -control). The five elite transgenic clones, selected for consistent borer-resistance and good agronomic traits, were further evaluated in a large scale field trial. It was found that the majority of agronomic and industrial traits were those of the original cv. Ja 60 - 5, but that a small number of qualitative traits was different. DNA changes were verified in the five selected clones. A total of 51 polymorphic DNA bands (out of the 1237 analysed bands) was identified by extensive AFLP and RAMP analysis, thus showing rare but consistent genomic changes in the transgenic plants, as compared with C 1 - and C 2 -control plants. It is proposed that the increased variability verified in transgenic plants by field trials and DNA analysis is essentially correlated with cell growth in the dedifferentiated state during the transformation procedure. The results, which are consistent with those published in the case of other transgenic plant populations, are discussed in the context of selecting approaches to gene transfer that minimize somaclonal variation. This is important especially in cases, such as that of sugarcane, where success of backcrosses to restore the original genotype is made difficult by the complex ploidy state of the plant...|$|R
40|$|A laboratory-selected {{colony of}} Heliothis virescens {{displaying}} a 20 - to 70 -fold level {{of resistance to}} Bacillus thuringiensis proteins was evaluated to identify mechanism(s) of resistance. Brush-border membrane vesicles were isolated from larval midgut epithelium from the susceptible and resistant strains of H. virescens. Two B. thuringiensis <b>proteins,</b> <b>CryIA(b)</b> and CryIA(c), were iodinated and shown to specifically bind to brush-border membrane vesicles of both insect strains. Multiple changes in the receptor-binding parameters were seen in the resistant strain {{as compared with the}} susceptible strain. A 2 - to 4 -fold reduction in binding affinity was accompanied by a 4 - to 6 -fold increase in binding-site concentration for both proteins. Although these two B. thuringiensis proteins competed for the same high-affinity binding site, competition experiments revealed different receptor specificity toward these proteins in the resistant H. virescens line. The H. virescens strains were not sensitive to a coleopteran-active protein, CryIIIA, nor did these proteins compete with the CryIA proteins for binding. Complexity of the mechanism of resistance is consistent with the complex mode of action of B. thuringiensis proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{mechanism for}} resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins was studied {{in a field}} population of diamondback moths (Plutella xylostella) with a reduced susceptibility to the bioinsecticidal spray. The toxicity and binding characteristics of three crystal proteins [CryIA(b), CryIB, and CryIC] were compared between the field population and a laboratory strain. The field population proved resistant (greater than 200 -fold compared with the laboratory strain) to CryIA(b), one of the crystal proteins in the insecticidal formulation. Binding studies showed that the two strains differ in a membrane receptor that recognizes <b>CryIA(b).</b> This crystal <b>protein</b> did not bind to the brush-border membrane of the midgut epithelial cells of the field population, either because of strongly reduced binding affinity or because of the complete absence of the receptor molecule. Both strains proved fully susceptible to the CryIB and CryIC crystal proteins, which were not present in the B. thuringiensis formulation used in the field. Characteristics of CryIB and CryIC binding to brush-border membranes of midgut epithelial cells were virtually identical in the laboratory and the field population...|$|R
40|$|The {{expected}} {{increase in}} application of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in crop protection makes {{it necessary to}} anticipate the development of Bt-resistant insects. To safeguard the long-term use of Bt-based insecticides, we studied the mode of action of Bt crystal <b>proteins.</b> <b>CryIA(b),</b> CryIC and CryIE are all toxic to lepidoptera, but each protein has its own specificity profile. In order to identify regions in the proteins involved in insecticidal specificity, hybrids between the genes cryIA(b) cryIC and cryIE were generated. Plasmids were constructed carrying two truncated crystal protein genes. In vivo recombination between these genes resulted in hybrids encoding full-length 140 kDa protoxins. In this manner, sets of CryIA(b) -CryIE, CryIC-CryIE and CryIE-CryIC hybrid proteins were isolated. The analysis of the CryIC-CryIE hybrids showed that domain II is involved in receptor binding, but that domain II of CryIC is not sufficient for the high activity of this protein towards Spodoptera exigua and Mamestra brassicae. Biochemical evidence and insect toxicity assays indicate that all CryIA(b) -CryIE hybrids are malfolded and precipitate as insoluble aggregate...|$|R
40|$|Over 2, 600 {{transgenic}} rice plants in nine strains were regenerated from > 500 independently selected hygromycin-resistant calli after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The plants were transformed with fully modified (plant codon optimized) versions of two synthetic cryIA(b) and cryIA(c) coding sequences from Bacillus thuringiensis {{as well as}} the hph and gus genes, coding for hygromycin phosphotransferase and β-glucuronidase, respectively. These sequences were placed under control of the maize ubiquitin promoter, the CaMV 35 S promoter, and the Brassica Bp 10 gene promoter to achieve high and tissue-specific expression of the lepidopteran-specific δ-endotoxins. The integration, expression, and inheritance of these genes were demonstrated in R 0 and R 1 generations by Southern, Northern, and Western analyses and by other techniques. Accumulation of high levels (up to 3 % of soluble <b>proteins)</b> of <b>CryIA(b)</b> and CryIA(c) <b>proteins</b> was detected in R 0 plants. Bioassays with R 1 transgenic plants indicated that the transgenic plants were highly toxic to two major rice insect pests, striped stem borer (Chilo suppressalis) and yellow stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas), with mortalities of 97 – 100 % within 5 days after infestation, thus offering a potential for effective insect resistance in {{transgenic rice}} plants...|$|R
40|$|Full-length, truncated, {{and mature}} {{forms of the}} <b>CryIA(b)</b> insecticidal crystal <b>protein</b> gene of Bacillus thuringiensis were {{engineered}} into the p 10 locus of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV). A signal sequence of Heliothis virescens juvenile hormone esterase was introduced at the N-terminus of these constructs to induce secretion. All recombinants, except those containing the mature toxin, produced high levels of CryIA(b) ICPs in insect cells. Thirty percent of the intracellular protoxin was N-glycosylated, suggesting that the protoxin was translocated across the ER membrane. Secretion into the medium, however, was limited. The production of the mature toxin was poor {{as a result of}} its cytotoxicity to insect cells. In a bioassay against second instar Spodoptera exigua larvae, using a recombinant expressing the Androctonus australis scorpion toxin gene in the same p 10 locus as a positive control, the median survival time of AcNPV recombinants expressing the various B. thuringiensis CryIA(b) ICP constructs was not significant different from that of wild-type AcNPV. This suggests that production and/or secretion of B. thuringiensis (pro) toxins by AcNPV p 10 recombinant viruses does not increase insecticidal activity since (i) the protoxins produced are inactive and not likely to be activated in vivo; (ii) secretion of the B. thuringiensis protoxins is poor; and (iii) production of the mature toxins results in cytotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} the constituent domains of the CryIA(b) and CryIA(c) delta-endotoxins in binding to midgut epithelial cell membrane proteins of Spodoptera exigua and Manduca sexta on ligand blots. A collection of wild-type and CryIC-CryIA hybrid toxins was used for this purpose. As demonstrated elsewhere (R. A. de Maagd, M. S. G. Kwa, H. van der Klei, T. Yamamoto, B. Schipper, J. M. Vlak, W. J. Stiekema, and D. Bosch, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 62 : 1537 - 1543, 1996), CryIA(b) domain III recognized a 205 -kDa protein on S. exigua blots, while no specific binding by domain I or II could be detected. In contrast, on ligand blots of M. sexta <b>proteins</b> <b>CryIA(b)</b> domain II recognized a 210 -kDa <b>protein</b> and <b>CryIA(b)</b> domain III recognized a 250 -kDa protein. Domain III is responsible for the interaction of CryIA(c) with 120 -kDa major binding proteins of both S. exigua and M. sexta. In addition, in M. sexta CryIA(c) also reacts with a 210 -kDa binding protein through its domain I and/or domain II. These results show that besides domain II, domain III of delta-endotoxins {{plays a major role in}} binding to putative receptors on ligand blots. However, for S. exigua there was no clear correlation between binding of toxins on ligand blots and the in vivo toxicity of the toxins. These and previous results suggest that interactions of insect membrane proteins with both domain II and domain III can occur and that detection of these interactions depends on the type of binding assay used...|$|R
40|$|Susceptibility of European corn borer (ECB) populations {{from the}} United States and Italy to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) <b>proteins</b> <b>CryIA(b)</b> and CryIA(c) was determined. Variation in Bt {{susceptibility}} of ECB {{as measured by}} growth inhibition was {{very similar to the}} variation in mortality. Interpopulation variation in susceptibility to both proteins was observed. The magnitude of interpopulation differences was < 4 -fold and comparable to the variability observed among generations within a particular population. Additionally, Bt susceptibility was similar among ECB of different pheromone races, voltine ecotypes, and geographic locations. Two diagnostic concentrations were proposed for CryIA(b) : 32 ng AI/cm 2 and 84 ng AI/cm 2, corresponding to the estimated EC 99 and LC 99, respectively. Comparable estimates for CryIA(c) were 2 ng AI/cm 2 (EC 99) and 7 ng AI/cm 2 (LC 99). Results from validation experiments using field-collected ECB populations showed that, for CryLA(b), 84 ng AI/cm 2 is an appropriate diagnostic concentration to use in initial efforts to monitor Bt resistance in ECB. However, for CryIA(c), adjustments and further validation will be required. Genetic divergence among ECB populations was assessed by PCR-RFLP analysis and direct sequencing of both mitochondrial and nuclear (ITS- 1) DNA regions. None of the restriction fragment patterns (mitochondrial or nuclear ITS- 1) differentiated geographic populations, pheromone races, or voltine ecotypes of ECB. The lack of variation in the ITS- 1 was confirmed by direct sequencing. This genetic similarity of ECB populations despite the wide geographic range, physiological, and behavioral differences may be explained by gene flow and/or an expansion from a genetic bottleneck. The inability to identify polymorphic DNA markers precluded quantification of gene Bow among ECB populations, information necessary to predict the potential for spread of Bt resistance genes. Baseline susceptibility data support the assumption that ECB populations from across the geographic distribution of the species are susceptible to both CryIA(b) and CryIA(c) and provide a basis for monitoring changes in susceptibility resulting from selection with Bt. The diagnostic bioassay developed in this study is an essential tool for effectively monitoring Bt resistance status of ECB field populations as they become exposed to transgenic Bt corn. ...|$|R
