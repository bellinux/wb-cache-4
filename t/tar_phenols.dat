The model predicts the detailed mass and energy balances, minor compounds emissions (such as NOx, SOx, aromatics,etc.). It is based on a phenomenological approach for dryer, reactors (gasification and combustion) and scrubber modeling. Process units are modeled with Aspen Plus models completed with dedicated Fortran sub-models when more details are required. The gasifier is a Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB). It is decomposed in three sections, describing the three main mechanisms occurring in the reactor: wood pyrolysis, secondary reactions and char combustion. At the outlet of the gasifier, the complete composition of the syngas is predicted, which includes water, permanent gases, inorganics, particles and <b>tars</b> (<b>phenol,</b> benzene, toluene, styrene, indene, naphthalene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene). Simulation results were validated against measurements from a pilot plant and other literature data.

The complexity of tar composition allows a reliable determination of tar dew point. At the outlet of the cleaning system, syngas is burned in gas engines. Gaseous emissions (NOx, SOx, etc.) of the gas engines and the DFB combustor are also handled by the model as well as ashes and liquid waste.

Biomass chars are compared with calcined dolomite, olivine, used fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst, biomass ash and commercial nickel catalyst. The conversion of naphthalene and phenol over these catalysts was carried out in the atmosphere of CO 2 and steam. At 900 °C, the conversion of phenol was dominated by thermal cracking whereas naphthalene conversion was dominated by catalytic conversion. Biomass chars gave the highest naphthalene conversion among the low cost catalysts used for tar removal. Further, biomass char is produced continuously during the gasification process, while the other catalysts undergo deactivation.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if one passage of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium {{in the presence}} of farm disinfectants selected for mutants with decreased susceptibility to disinfectants and/or antibiotics. Methods: Eight Salmonella Typhimurium strains including field isolates and laboratory mutants were exposed to either a <b>tar</b> oil <b>phenol</b> (PFD) disinfectant, an oxidizing compound disinfectant (OXC), an aldehyde based disinfectant (ABD) or a dairy sterilizer disinfectant (based on quaternary ammonium biocide) in agar. The susceptibility of mutants obtained after disinfectant exposure to antibiotics and disinfectants was determined as was the accumulation of norfloxacin. The proteome of SL 1344 after exposure to PFD and OXC was analysed using two-dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: Strains with either acrB or tolC inactivated were more susceptible to most disinfectants than other strains. The majority (3 / 5) of mutants recovered after disinfectant exposure required statistically significantly longer exposure times to disinfectants than their parent strains to generate a 5 log kill. Small decreases in antibiotic susceptibility were observed but no mutants were multiply antibiotic-resistant (MAR). Notably exposure to ABD decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin in some strains. Mutants with increased disinfectant tolerance were able to survive and persist in chicks as well as in parent strains. Analysis of proteomes revealed significantly increased expression of the AcrAB-TolC efflux system after PFD exposure. Conclusions: Data presented demonstrate that efflux pumps are required for intrinsic resistance to some disinfectants and that exposure to disinfectants can induce expression of the AcrAB-TolC efflux system, but that single exposure was insufficient to select for MAR strains...|$|R

40|$|The future {{depletion}} of {{conventional fossil fuel}} reserves, the ever increasing need for energy self – reliance and the global concern around environmental change caused by their use, have made heat and power generation from alternative and sustainable sources a primary research focus worldwide. Biomass is such a source, constituting a clean and renewable fuel, while being the third fuel resource in the world after coal and oil in terms of abundance. Through thermochemical processes biomass can be employed for energy, chemicals and transport fuel production. Pyrolysis is the thermochemical process of biomass decomposition into various useful products {{in the absence of}} an oxidation medium. Torrefaction is a mild pyrolysis process, typically carried out in a temperature range between 230 oC and 300 oC. This pretreatment process offers benefits with respect to biomasses energy density, while reducing the oxygen and hydrogen to carbon ratios and its hygroscopic nature. In this work untreated and torrefied biomass species were pyrolysed under different final temperatures in a Pyroprobe 5200 reactor. In particular, raw and torrefied (at 250 oC and 265 oC) wood ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and raw and torrefied (at 300 oC) Torrcoal, which consists of mixed wood residues, were investigated. The feed was reduced to a particle size less than 75 μm and the experiments were performed with a sample size of 30 mg in the temperature range of 600 oC to 1000 oC at a heating rate of 600 oC/s, in order to achieve fast pyrolysis conditions. The main purpose of these experiments was to determine the effect of final pyrolysis temperature and torrefaction to the yield and nature of pyrolysis final products. In terms of individual gases, CO, CO 2, CH 4 and H 2 were identified using a micro GC. <b>Tar</b> compounds (<b>phenol</b> and PAHs) were identified and quantified using a HPLC system. The aforementioned experiments produced mass closure values between 65 % and 84 %, which can be considered as satisfactory due to the difficulties in measuring gravimetrically pyrolytic water, higher hydrocarbon gases and light tar compounds. Increasing pyrolysis temperatures had a negative effect on char yield, however above 800 oC it appeared to stabilize. Maximum values of the liquid yield were obtained at 600 oC and 700 oC before attaining a decreasing trend for the ash materials and stabilizing for Torrcoal materials at 900 oC. Gas yields increased until 900 oC for Torrcoal species and ash torrefied at 265, but for the rest species the increase continued until 1000 oC. CO was the major gas produced above 800 oC overtaking CO 2 at that temperature, while CH 4 and H 2 yields became significant above 700 oC and 800 oC respectively. Torrefaction and increased torrefaction severity led to an increase of the char yield of the pyrolysis process. Their effect on the liquid yield was the opposite. In terms of total gases production the differences were minimal and only noticeable above 800 oC. However, the quality of the pyrolysis gas was higher for the torrefied species. Regarding the <b>tar</b> compounds analysis, <b>phenol</b> yield decreased until 800 oC before reaching a plateau thereafter. PAH species yield increased steeply between 800 oC and 900 oC. Their production still increased above that temperature but at a slower rate. Naphthalene was the major PAH produced. Torrefaction seemed to favour phenol production while its effect on PAHs was not significant. Between the two biomass species studied, the higher phenol yield of Torrcoal pyrolysis along with its higher char and lower liquid yield are indicative of higher lignin content for this biomass.

Different <b>tar</b> model compounds (<b>phenol,</b> toluene, methyl naphthalene, indene, anisole and furfural) were individually steam reformed (after dissolving each one in methanol), as well as a mixture of all of them, at 700 °C under a steam/carbon (S/C) ratio of 3 and 60 min on stream. The highest conversions and H 2 potential were attained for anisole and furfural, while methyl naphthalene presented the lowest reactivity. Nevertheless, the higher reactivity of oxygenates compared to aromatic hydrocarbons promoted carbon deposition on the catalyst (in the 1. 5 – 2. 8 wt. % range). When the concentration of methanol is decreased in the feedstock and that of toluene or anisole is increased, the selectivity to CO is favoured in the gaseous products, thus increasing coke deposition on the catalyst and decreasing catalyst activity for the steam reforming reaction. Moreover, an increase in Ni loading in the catalyst from 5 to 20 % enhances carbon conversion and H 2 formation in the steam reforming of a mixture of all the model compounds studied, but these values decrease for a Ni content of 40 %. Coke formation also increased by increasing Ni loading, attaining its maximum value for 40 % Ni (6. 5 wt. %) ...|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{invention}} of coal gas early in the 19th century, {{it was discovered that}} numerous organic and inorganic chemicals could be obtained when purifying the gas. Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry – the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry – came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year [...] of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and dyes. Sulphur from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers. Subsequently the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies.

Several amino acid replacements in the HAMP domain of Tsr, particularly attractant-mimic signaling lesions at residue E 248, converted Tsr to an attractant sensor of phenol. These findings suggest that phenol may elicit chemotactic responses by diffusing into the cytoplasmic membrane and perturbing the structural stability or position of the TM bundle helices, in conjunction with structural input from the HAMP domain. We conclude that behavioral responses to phenol, and perhaps to temperature, cytoplasmic pH, and glycerol, as well, occur through a general sensing mechanism in chemoreceptors that detects changes in the structural stability or dynamic behavior of a receptor signaling element. The structurally sensitive target for phenol is probably the TM bundle, but other behaviors could target other receptor elements...|$|R
40|$|The {{fluidized}} bed gasification of untreated and pre-treated olive residue and pre-treated olive residue mixed with reed, pine pellets and Douglas fir wood chips is studied. Leaching {{is used as}} a pre-treatment process targeted on the elimination of alkali metals such as K and Na as well as chlorine to reduce/eliminate the ash-related problems during gasification. The leaching pre-treatment process could affect the producer gas composition toward the lower or higher yield of CO and H 2 of the producer gas depending on the moisture content of parent fuels. The lower total tar yield of the producer gas in the case of leached olive residue was observed compared to untreated olive residue. At the same time, there are present wider varieties of different tar components in the producer gas of the leached olive residue compared to the untreated one. The distinctions in tar composition and content between the leached and untreated olive residue are attributed to the alkali and alkali earth metal and chorine chemistry affected by leaching pre-treatment. The addition of woody fuels and reed at elevated proportions resulted in the lower LHV value compared to the leached olive residue. The tar content of the producer gas is seen to increase adding reed and woody fuels to the leached olive residue, i. e. the producer gas contained additional variety of <b>tar</b> components whereas <b>phenol</b> becomes one of the key components determining the total tar content, apart from benzene, toluene and naphthalene. This is seen to be due to the higher cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin as well as higher chlorine content of the reed and woody fuels compared to the leached olive residue. The olive residue is seen to be better fuel for gasification compared with woody fuels and reed. Even more, we believe that the leached olive residue is better compared to all other tested fuel/mixtures in this study. It is seen that the proportions of different fuels in the mixture play role in the composition of the producer gas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Effect of coal plasticity {{on the evolution of}} coke microstructure is complex and particularly limited in relation to role of coal mineral chemistry. This study reports an experimental investigation relating to coal phase transformations during controlled carbonization as a function of coal ash and mineral composition using a range of analytical tools including FTIR, GC/MS, XRD, SEM and Optical microscopy. The chemical nature and magnitude of various carbonization products were related to the microstructure and the mechanical strength their cokes. The study identified the significance of coal mineral chemistry on plasticity as well as coke microstructure and mechanical strength. A number of microstructure parameters were combined to develop a combination microstructural parameter, and related to coke tensile strength as well as plastic range of parent coals. Under the tested conditions, up to 5 wt. % of kaolinite addition in coal is found to improve the fluidity, which could be associated with the increase of CHAr/CHAl ratio as well as decrease in CH 3 /CH 2 ratio of the residual char. The proportion of C=O/C=C bonds affected the plastic range. The study further showed that elevated kaolinite level in coal suppresses the evolution of low molecular compounds in tar phase and decrease the fluidity. Kaolinite addition in coal showed a significant effect on altering <b>tar</b> composition particularly <b>phenol</b> and benzene content especially at lower temperatures. Increasing presence of kaolinite levels in coal increased coke tensile strength but did not show a similar level of improvement in case of conventional coke tumbling strength. The effect of kaolinite presence on coal pyrolysis behaviour was also influenced by particle size such that finer particle size promoted fluidity while coarse particles improve the release of hydroaromatic methylene compounds. Coarser kaolinite leads to improve coke microstructure as well as mechanical strength.

The main objective {{of this study was to}} examine the health risks of bathers with respect to recreational seawater and to examine the physical, chemical and biological hazards that are responsible for this outcome. Furthermore our objective was to estimate the general quality of the sea-water bathing areas in Greece during the ten year period (1997 - 2006) and to formulate a risk factor assessment by associating the different pollution markers (<b>tar,</b> garbage, <b>phenols,</b> oils, floating materials) and other parameters (jellyfish, sea condition, rain, seaweed, wind direction), with microbiological bacterial indicators concentrations of seawater sampling test results. Finally we applied a new risk assessment approach in recreational sea waters. Τhe examination of quality of sea-water bathing areas in Greece over a 10 -year period helped to identify risk factors for high bacteria indicator organism concentrations. Qualitative descriptive analysis was applied and the microbiological test results of 231, 205 water samples were associated with pollution markers and other parameters. Measurements of E. coli (99. 6 %) and Enterococci (100 %) were found to be in accordance with the mandatory value guidelines set by the new European Directive. An increasing trend for the yearly mean value of faecal Streptococci was noted. Using logistic regression analysis, phenolic smell (OR= 2. 10, CI= 2. 04 - 2. 16), rainfall the day before sampling (OR= 1. 67, CI= 1. 64 - 1. 74), high seas (OR= 1. 42, CI= 1. 39 - 1. 46) and rainfall on the day of sampling (OR= 1. 27, CI= 1. 20 - 1. 33) were positively independently associated with high levels of bacterial indicators (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal Streptococci and Escherichia coli). The highest risk, absolute risk value 42. 8 %, (RR= 3. 17, CI= 2. 97 - 3. 38) was measured when previous day-rainfall, phenolic smell and high seas were simultaneously recorded. Such parameters should be further investigated as predetermining factors for the assessment of beach bathing water quality, providing a timely indication of water risk assessment. During the summer of 2008 a cohort study was conducted including bathers from three different bathing sites in central Greece. Initial questioner and a 10 days later follow up were used. The questioner included information on demographics, bathing behavior, aesthetic issue of the beach, clinical signs and symptoms of diseases related to bathing. Moreover, a control group of non bathers with the same residence of the bathers was included in the study. In total, 4, 293 bathers were approached. Only 34 bathers in the beach (0. 79 %) refused to take part in the survey from the beginning and 270 bathers (6. 34 %) did not respond or refused to take part during the telephone contact in the follow up 10 days later (total response rate= 92. 45 %). In total 149 water samples and 152 sand samples were collected from the bathing sites on a regular daily basis for the quantitative analysis of bacterial indicators (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, Enterococci, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus). Univariate and backward logistic regressions analysis to asses the risk among the bathers compare to non bathers was used. We identify a statistical significant increased risk among swimmers in recreational sea water in comparison to non bathers for injuries, respiratory diseases, gastroenteritis, ear, eye and dermatological diseases. These results were observed despite the excellent bathing water quality. The significant increased risk among bathers in comparison to non bathers for professional medical help such visiting a doctor or a pharmacist or use of a medication is a indirect proof for higher morbidity among bathers. Furthermore as we found no relation for hospitalization or home care to the above described diseases we can certainly say that the diseases or symptoms related to swimming in recreational seawater are in the most cases of mild or medium severity and certainly no fatally. Other than the water quality factors may play a protagonist factor in health effects among bathers mainly in clean waters. Bathing itself is a reason for increased reported illness among bathers (with mechanism as example such the loss of protective cerumen as a result of heat, humidity in the ear). Bathers who were swimming in a high bather density beach had significant increased risk for developing respiratory disease, gastroenteritis and ear infections in relation to bathers who were swimming in beach with lower bather density. Overcrowding of bathers in the beaches is a parameter that explains many of the diseases we observed and certainly plays a protagonist role. Bather density is as a predominant factor for illness in excellent bathing water quality. An update of the risk assessment approach in recreational sea waters is needed. ...|$|R

The aim of this analysis is to assess the bioenergy production via fluidized bed gasification (FBG) and the ulterior treatment of the synthesis gas (syngas) produced in the FBG reactor to adequate it to end-use applications such as gas turbines and internal combustion engines. To achieve this objective, this thesis proposes a formulation model approach for evaluating the electricity generation costs (Chapter 2), the reactor performance (Chapter 3) and the syngas conditioning efficiency (Chapter 4). For this purpose, the Autonomous Community of Madrid (CAM) has been taken as study case. The analysis estimates that the cynara has the potential to provide 1708 GWh yr- 1, that is, around 42 % of national biomass-based electricity supply and exceeds 72 % of total renewable-based electricity supply in CAM. Therefore, the implementation of cynara projects could help reducing the total energy consumption of CAM by 0. 05 %, what would suppose to avoid up to 66 % of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels. The economic assessment performed in the present work evaluates the use of two thermochemical technologies for cynara conversion into electricity to be used for different applications or sold to the national grid. The technological solutions considered are: a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant and an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) power generator. The CCGT solution was studied for an installed capacity range of 5 - 30 MW, while the ICE solution was analysed for a range of 1 - 30 MW. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effects of variables such as biomass yield, discount rate, transport cost, operation and maintenance. For a cynara yield of 17 t/ha in an 8 MW plant as base case, the economic analysis estimates a production costs of 21. 60 c€/kWh and 24. 32 c€/kW for the CCGT and ICE solutions, respectively. Accordingly, CCGT plants are the best choice for a plant size above 8 MW, while ICE plants constitute the most suitable technology below 8 MW. With regards to the discount rate, the results show that for the same base case (8 MW), for a discount rate of 10 % the cost of electricity is estimated to be 16. 69 c€/kWh for CCGT plants and 19. 08 c€/kWh for ICE plants. On the contrary, the use of the lowest discount rate (1 %) yields a cost of electricity of 12. 70 and 15. 13 c€/kWh for CCGT and ICE solutions, respectively. Concerning to the total capital investment, it grows with the plant size, representing up to 93 and 92 % of the total CCGT and ICE plant cost, respectively. Such percentages correspond to 42. 17 M€ and 41. 46 M€ for a CCGT and ICE plant for a base case of 8 MW. Nevertheless, the ICE plants show a stronger economy of scale in energy production than the CCGT solution. In addition to this, the total operating costs for an 8 MW CCGT scenario is estimated to be 2. 94 M€ and around 3. 65 M€ for an ICE plant. In relation to the thermochemical conversion route of cynara, the gasification of biomass in a FB reactor has been modelled to analyse such process for Cynara cardunculus L. taking into consideration the particular biomass behavior. It is well known that the FB reactor thermal state and the biomass volatiles generation are crucial in its operation and performance. Hence, the bubble flow pattern controls the FB temperature profile driving devolatilization and tars cracking kinetics. This underlies in the fact that alkali compounds of biomass fuels, which are featured by a low melting point, can transform into vapours and ash fly that are prone to deposit on heat surfaces in boilers and/or react with the particles of the inert bed material inside the FB. Thus, the formation of agglomerates (the so-called bed agglomeration) would start and then, the defluidization of FB leading to the shut-down of the FBG reactor. Therefore, a modelling approach focused on the bubble phase, which can act as “bypassing” hot spots inside the FB region influencing on ash-related problems, can help to monitor the location of ash sintering and bed agglomeration risk regions and predict undesired FBG reactor performance. A new formulation for biomass FBG reactor modelling that considers the instantaneous devolatilization and temperature peaks due to volatiles combustion inside the FB region is proposed in the present work. A bubble phase and a FB energy balance are used to monitor the gradual release of biomass volatiles along the FB and to check the performance of the FBG reactor. The one-dimensional, steady-state proposed model uses a two-phase (bubble and emulsion) and two zone (bottom dense bed and upper freeboard) modelling approach to account for the complex nature of FBG reactor dynamics. Furthermore, no catalytic effects of ash composition from biomass are taken into consideration. For further validation and tuning up of the model proposed, a sensitivity analysis of cynara gasification in FB, under bubbling regime, was performed considering the specification design of the pilot-plant scale FBG reactor in the Thermal and Fluid Engineering Department facilities at Carlos III University of Madrid. The simulation campaign yields a syngas composition (on dry basis) of 4. 79 - 14. 84 % for CO, 19. 77 - 21. 35 % for CO 2, 6. 11 - 15. 00 % for H 2 and 2. 16 - 5. 73 % for CH 4. Besides, the lower heating value and tar content of the syngas fall in the range of 2. 25 - 6. 25 MJ/Nm 3 and 60 - 180 g/Nm 3, respectively. These results correspond to a syngas-biomass flows ratio in the range of 1. 309 - 2. 392 Nm 3 /kg, accounting for N 2 in the raw syngas produced. The analysis of the results in comparison with previous experiments stands out: 1) the good predictive capability of the model proposed and 2) the discrepancies between simulations and experimental works are attributable to the data heterogeneity found in the literature, that is, different biomass compositions, operating conditions, (catalytic) bed material used, sampling methods for syngas and tar compositions, etc. Hence, further experimental research would help improving the predictive capability of the proposed model. Finally, the conditioning of the syngas produced from the FBG reactor is needed in order to achieve end-use requirements in ICE and gas turbines (GT) plants, since the lack or inefficiency of syngas clean-up could lead to operational problems in downstream equipment and then, unscheduled shut-down and extra maintenance and repair costs. For example, particulate material can cause clogging and fouling, while tars can condensate producing blockage and attrition in filters, exit pipes, heat exchangers, etc. Furthermore, the syngas treatment to reduce its pollutants would influence the performance, investment and operational costs of the gas cleaning devices. Nowadays, gas cleaning systems are aimed to reduce particulate and tars material levels below the allowable concentrations (mg/Nm 3) for ICE and GT devices: 50 - 50 and 30 - 5, respectively. Thus, as a part of the present thesis, the modelling and analysis of a moving bed heat exchange filter (MBHEF) is proposed as hot gas clean-up equipment. The MBHEF stands out because its benefits: high temperature operation (700 - 800 ºC the exhaust gas temperature from the FB reactor), no-clogging and non-pressure increase during operation, which can lead to unscheduled shut-down if using other typical hot gas cleaning devices such as ceramic filters, bag filters. Additionally, the MBHEF would provide a high contact area between gas and solids without entrainment nor elutriation of solids. This compact size equipment would allow saving costs. Eventually, the MBHEF solution for hot gas cleaning would also avoid extra costs derived from the reactor design modification and the use of additives/catalysts in order to remove tars. It is presented a modelling approach for simulating tars and particulate removal in a MBHEF. The two-dimension, adiabatic, steady-state proposed model accounts for twophase (gas and solid) and neglects conduction and mass diffusion. Tars condensation is modelled through representative <b>tar</b> class lumps: <b>phenol</b> (class 2), naphthalene (class 4), and pyrene (class 5) according to the literature. The model also considers tar concentration influence on tar dew point, while the filtration model is taken from literature. Furthermore, an exergy study was conducted in order to optimise the equipment size and help the choice of the less expensive operating conditions. A sensitivity analysis was performed varying the particle size and superficial gas velocity as key operating parameters. To accomplish this, a syngas composition from experiments reported in the literature has been taken as study case. Thus, maps of temperature, tars abatement and particulate removal efficiencies are presented, which show the MBHEF performance for reducing impurities content. The simulation results indicate the feasibility of use a MBHEF as tars removal equipment benefiting its advantages against other gas-cleaning methods with acceptable pollutant removal efficiencies, ranging 88 - 94 %. As observed, the MBHEF yields efficiencies, at least, the same order of magnitude of the ones attainable with the use of catalytic crackers, venture scrubbers or sand filter at much lower temperatures and higher than the ones achieved by means of wash towers, wet electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters and fixed bed absorbers. In case of not reaching the reduction level for each end-use application, the MBHEF device can be used as effective secondary removal method for eliminating tars from the syngas, with the advantages stated above as opposed the rest of removal technologies. Results also point out that low gas velocities (0. 5 - 1 m/s) and high particle size (400 - 700 μm) for saving costs are the most suitable|$|R
