50|$|After {{departing from}} some of the most {{important}} nesting sites in the Western Hemisphere, typically Vero Beach, Florida and Melbourne Beach, Florida, sea turtles will be monitored using Platform <b>Terminal</b> <b>Transmitter</b> (PTT) that send signals via satellite to record their locations and the distances traveled. The data will then be uploaded to interactive maps on the Tour de Turtles website, TourdeTurtles.org. Because the turtles will be released at different times, depending on the species, the distance traveled by each turtle will not be counted until the last turtle is released. This will ensure that the first turtles released don’t get a head start in completing the marathon. Each participating sea turtle will have a spot on the “leader board,” which will provide an overview of all the turtles’ progress. The marathon may end in less than three months, but the program will continue to follow the turtles’ progress for up to two years. The first turtle to reach 2,620 km will win the marathon. Although there will be only one turtle marathon winner, another sea turtle has the chance to win the Causes Challenge.|$|E
50|$|Satellite {{telemetry}} involves {{following an}} object on the Earth’s surface {{through the use}} of orbiting satellites. Researchers at CCC use this technology to track the migratory patterns of sea turtles in the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean. Satellite telemetry allows researchers to obtain up-to-date location data every time the sea turtle rises to the surface for air. A Platform <b>Terminal</b> <b>Transmitter</b> (PTT) is attached to the back of a sea turtle. The PTT sends a signal full of information to an orbiting satellite each time the turtle surfaces. The satellite re-transmits the data to a receiving station on Earth. Researchers can then access this information through their computer. Satellite transmitters can be attached several different ways. For hard-shell turtles, such as Green turtles, Loggerhead or Hawksbills, the Marine Epoxy Method or the Fiberglass and Resin Method are used. Both methods are safe for the turtles, neither hurting their shells nor restricting their movements in the ocean. Transmitters are designed to safely fall off the turtles after {{about a year and a}} half. Leatherback turtles, which lack a hard shell, require a different method because of their size and the texture of their carapace. A harness that goes over the shell is used to secure a transmitter. The harness tends to last longer than the epoxy or fiberglass methods, allowing researchers to track leatherbacks for up to two years before the harness falls off harmlessly.|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{telemetry}} is {{a common}} tool for examining sea turtle movements, and many research programs have successfully tracked adults. Relatively short satellite track durations recorded for juvenile Kemp’s ridley sea turtles, Lepidochelys kempii, in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico raised questions regarding premature transmission loss.

A pilot study was conducted with eight 34 -month-old, captive-reared loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta; a larger trial the following year used twenty 34 -month-olds. Half of the turtles in each trial were outfitted with dummy PTT’s (8 × 4 × 2 cm), and all turtles were sent through a trawl equipped with a bottom-opening Super-Shooter TED. No apparent damage was sustained by any PTT, but four of five PTT-outfitted loggerheads encountering the TED carapace-first exhibited increased escape times when the PTT wedged between the TED deflector bars (10. 2 cm apart).

40|$|AbstractWe have {{characterized}} the morphological and functional {{properties of the}} readily releasable pool (RRP) and the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles in frog motor nerve terminals using fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, and electrophysiology. At rest, about 20 % of vesicles reside in the RRP, which is depleted in about 10 s by high-frequency nerve stimulation (30 Hz); the RRP refills in about 1 min, and surprisingly, refilling occurs almost entirely by recycling, not mobilization from the reserve pool. The reserve pool is depleted during 30 Hz stimulation with a time constant of about 40 s, and it refills slowly (half-time about 8 min) as nascent vesicles bud from randomly distributed cisternae and surface membrane infoldings and enter vesicle clusters spaced at regular intervals along the <b>terminal.</b> <b>Transmitter</b> output during low-frequency stimulation (2 – 5 Hz) is maintained entirely by RRP recycling; few if any vesicles are mobilized from the reserve pool...|$|E

Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed and trialed several collar and platform <b>terminal</b> <b>transmitter</b> (PTT) combinations on both free-living and captive fruit bats (Family Pteropodidae: Genus Pteropus). We examined transmitter weight, size, profile and comfort as key determinants of maximized transmitter activity. We then tested {{the importance of}} bat-related variables (species size/weight, roosting habitat and behavior) and environmental variables (day-length, rainfall pattern) in determining optimal collar/PTT configuration.

40|$|Effects of {{deployment}} of miniaturized transmitters and loggers {{have been well}} studied in penguins, but much less so in flying seabirds. We {{examined the effects of}} satellite tag (platform <b>terminal</b> <b>transmitter,</b> PTT) deployment in Black-browed (Thalassarche melanophris) and Gray-headed (T. chrysostoma) albatrosses at South Georgia and reviewed the recent literature for other albatrosses and petrels. In our study, although a few individuals may have slightly extended their foraging trips, overall {{there was no significant difference}} in trip duration, meal mass, breeding success, or rate of return in the next season between birds with PTTs and controls. By comparison, most other studies of albatrosses and petrels recorded extended trip durations and, in some cases, high rates of nest desertion following PTT attachment. That occurred particularly where transmitter loads exceeded 3 % of adult mass. Extended trip durations may result from reduced flight efficiency, as well as the effect of capture and temporary restraint, but affected birds seem nonetheless to commute to representative foraging areas. To minimize device effects, we suggest that transmitter loads be reduced to a minimum, use of harnesses be avoided (particularly for breeding season deployments when tape attachment to feathers is an effective alternative), and careful attention be given to limiting handling times during incubation when some species are particularly sensitive to disturbance...|$|E

40|$|Geolocation (Global Location Sensing or GLS logging) using archival light-recording tags offers {{considerable}} {{potential for}} tracking animal movements, yet few studies of flying seabirds have exploited this technology. Our study evaluated its effectiveness for determining foraging ranges of black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys fitted simultaneously with GLS loggers and satellite-transmitters (Platform <b>Terminal</b> <b>Transmitters,</b> PTTs). After some preliminary validation, {{the position of}} an albatross could be determined by geolocation with a mean error +/- SD of 186 +/- 114 km (SDs of 1. 66 degrees and 1. 82 degrees of latitude and longitude, respectively). Errors from identical static loggers were lower (mean +/- SD of 85 +/- 47 km, with overall SDs of 0. 61 degrees and 0. 99 degrees of latitude and longitude, respectively) and less variable, with the difference attributable to variation in sensor orientation, intermittent shading by plumage, {{and the difficulty of}} correcting for extensive, potentially non-linear movements of flying birds. Iterative smoothing reduced both the mean error and the inflation of kernel ranges derived from GLS data, but over-smoothing contracted the extremes of the range. This reduced the overlap with radial cores apparent in the control data, and should be avoided for multinuclear GLS fix distributions. The accuracy of GLS tags is more than adequate for tracking migration and breeding-season foraging ranges of pelagic species, and for identifying broad-scale habitat preferences, overlap and potential conflict with commercial fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Data-recording tags {{applied to}} marine animals store data for later {{retrieval}} and can return valuable information on animal behavior and ecology, including habitat preference, physiology, and movement patterns, {{as well as}} environmental data. If properly instrumented, calibrated, and archived, data from these tags can add to the oceanographic datastream for parts of the ocean where data are sparse or lacking. Such data, from northern elephant seals instrumented with time–temperature–depth recorders (TTDR) and ARGOS platform <b>terminal</b> <b>transmitters,</b> is examined in this study. Northern elephant seals range widely over the northeastern Pacific on long foraging trips. The seals dive continuously on these trips to depths of 400 – 600 m.

40|$|Species {{distribution}} models (SDM) {{based on}} tracking data from different devices are used increasingly {{to explain and}} predict seabird distributions. However, different tracking methods provide different data resolutions, ranging from 100 km. To better understand {{the implications of this}} variation, we modeled the potential distribution of black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris from South Georgia that were simultaneously equipped with a Platform <b>Terminal</b> <b>Transmitter</b> (PTT) (high resolution) and a Global Location Sensor (GLS) logger (coarse resolution), and measured the overlap of the respective potential distribution for a total of nine different SDM algorithms. We found slightly better model fits for the PTT than for GLS data (AUC values 0. 958 ± 0. 048 vs. 0. 95 ± 0. 05) across all algorithms. The overlaps of the predicted distributions were higher between device types for the same algorithm, than among algorithms for either device type. Uncertainty arising from coarse-resolution location data is therefore lower than that associated with the modeling technique. Consequently, the choice of an appropriate algorithm appears to be more important than device type when applying SDMs to seabird tracking data. Despite their low accuracy, GLS data appear to be effective for analyzing the habitat preferences and distribution patterns of pelagic species...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitory {{transmission}} plays a {{major role}} in information processing in the brain since it integrates excitatory signals and defines the gain between neural input and output. γ-Amino butyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult mammalian brain. By activating GABAA and GABAB receptors this neurotransmitter inhibits neuronal firing and stabilizes the membrane potential near the resting value. In particular GABAA receptors are permeable to chloride ions and are responsible for phasic and tonic hyperpolarizing responses. GABA-mediated currents are the result of rapid, sequential events including transmitter release from the presynaptic <b>terminal,</b> <b>transmitter</b> diffusion within and outside the cleft and post-synaptic receptors gating. The kinetics of each of these processes is crucial in determining the shape of post-synaptic currents. Therefore the modulation of any of these events leads to the heterogeneity of GABAergic responses and to changes in the potency of inhibition. In this thesis I have studied the sources of such variability at presynaptic/cleft and postsynaptic level. At presynaptic/cleft level I have focused on the influence of the agonist concentration profile in the synaptic cleft on GABA-mediated synaptic currents. Fast-off competitive antagonists and computer simulations allowed estimating the range of variability of the peak concentration and the speed of GABA clearance form the synaptic cleft. At postsynaptic level particular attention has been attributed to the impact of GABAA receptors clustering on both phasic and tonic GABAA-mediated inhibition. With ultrafast applications of GABA and computer simulations it was possible to describe the modulation of GABAA receptor gating induced by clustering...|$|E

40|$|International audienceKnowledge of the {{foraging}} {{areas of}} top marine predators and the factors influencing them {{is central to}} understanding how their populations respond to environmental variability. While {{there is a large}} body of literature documenting the association of air-breathing marine vertebrates with areas of high marine productivity, there is relatively little information for species restricted to near-shore or continental-shelf areas. Differences in foraging range and diving behaviour of the little penguin Eudyptula minor were examined from 3 breeding colonies (Rabbit Island, Kanowna Island and Phillip Island) in central northern Bass Strait, southeast Australia, during the chick-guard stage using electronic tags (platform <b>terminal</b> <b>transmitters,</b> PTTs, and time-depth recorders, TDRs). Although there were large overall differences between individuals, the mean maximum foraging range (16. 9 to 19. 8 km) and mean total distance travelled (41. 8 to 48. 0 km) were similar between the 3 colonies, despite different bathymetric environments. Individuals from all 3 colonies selected foraging habitats within a narrow sea surface temperature (SST) range (16. 0 to 16. 4 °C). While there were significant differences in mean dive depths (5. 4 to 10. 9 m) and mean durations (13. 2 to 28. 6 s) between the different colonies, the mean diving effort (vertical distance travelled: 936. 3 to 964. 3 m h– 1) was similar.

40|$|Protection of {{the marine}} {{environment}} lags far behind that of terrestrial domains. To help ameliorate this circumstance, top predators are being tracked to identify important ocean habitats, biodiversity hotspots and high risk areas and to assess effects of anthropogenic developments, pollution and environmental perturbations. We used GPS, Global Location Sensors (GLSs) and satellite platform <b>terminal</b> <b>transmitters</b> (PTTs) to track foraging and migrating thick-billed and common murres and northern gannets along with vessel surveys to identify potential Marine Protected Areas, to assess risk and to evaluate {{the consequences of the}} recent Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. Multi-year persistent sites of forage fishes generated multi-species predator aggregations. Species- and colony-specific winter inshore and offshore distributions of murres are associated with risks of climate change (ice), by-catch in fishing gear, hunting and oil extraction. Some thick-billed murres wintered in oceanic areas beyond the continental slope, and an area of high biological diversity was identified west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that, owing to its location beyond national jurisdictions, presents unique challenges for protection. Migration research indicated a substantial proportion of the North American gannet population wintering in the Gulf of Mexico near the Deepwater Horizon pollution area. Northern gannets incurred the highest incidence of oiling/recoveries and were the third-most oiled avian species; distributions and exit dates suggest that sub-adult birds suffered much, likely most, of this mortality. Environmental risk is being assessed by tracking combined with stable isotope and blood assays to probe trophic interactions, habitat relationships and to identify and protect biologically significant marine areas...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Apical {{pelagic species}} forage in {{predictable}} habitats, and their movements should signal biologically and ecologically significant {{areas of the}} marine ecosystem. Several countries are now engaged in identifying these areas based on animal tracking, but this is often limited to a few individuals from one breeding population, which may result in biased portrayals of the key marine habitats. To help identify such foraging areas, we compiled tracking data of a marine top predator from the main breeding colonies in the Central Macaronesia. Location: North-east Atlantic Ocean. Methods: Over seven years, we tracked the foraging movements of Cory’s shearwaters (Calonectris borealis) from several populations during the chick-rearing period using global positioning system and platform <b>terminal</b> <b>transmitter</b> devices. Results: We obtained foraging trips from 174 shearwaters breeding on six important colonies representative of the range occupied in the Macaronesian Archipelagos of Madeira, Salvages and Canaries. Our results show that birds orient and move rapidly towards the closest neritic waters over the African continental shelf. Birds from different colonies show substantial spatial segregation in their foraging grounds but consistently overlap in some specific foraging areas along the Canary Current characterized by high productivity. By weighting the use of foraging grounds according {{to the size of}} each study population, we inferred the overall exploitation of such areas. Main: conclusions Our meta-population approach provides a more comprehensive picture of space use from both perspectives: the studied species and the Canary Current system. Foraging grounds consistently used by several populations may not be adequately identified by tracking a single population, and therefore, multiple population tracking studies are needed to properly delineate key conservation areas and inform conservation planning in the marine ecosystem. Finally, we highlight the long-term stability and sustainability of identified foraging areas and propose that countries with geographical jurisdictions over the Canary Current area should work towards multilateral agreements to set management plans for this key marine ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} how seabirds {{might be used}} to study marine environmental variables, which necessitates knowing location and the value of the variable to be studied. Five systems can potentially be used for determination of location: VHF (Very High Frequency) telemetry, PTT (Platform <b>Terminal</b> <b>Transmitter)</b> telemetry, GLS (Global Location Service) geolocation methods, dead reckoning and GPS (Global Positioning System), each with its own advantages with respect to accuracy, potential number of fixes and size. Temperature and light were used to illustrate potential difficulties in recording environmental variables. Systems currently used on seabirds for measurement of temperature respond slowly to environmental changes; thus, they may not measure sea surface temperature adequately when contact periods with water bodies are too short. Light can be easily measured for light extinction studies, but sensor orientation plays a large role in determining recorded values. Both problems can be corrected. The foraging behaviour of seabirds was also examined in order to identify those features which would be useful for determination of marine environmental variables at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Area coverage by birds is highly dependent on breeding phase and tends to be concentrated in areas where prey acquisition is particularly enhanced. The identification of these sites may be of particular interest to marine biologists. Plungers and divers are potentially most useful for assessment of variables deeper within the water column, with some divers spending up to 90 % of their time sub-surface. Few seabirds exploit the water column deeper than 20 m, although some divers regularly exceed 50 m (primarily penguins and auks), while 2 species dive in excess of 300 m. The wide-ranging behaviour of seabirds coupled, in many instances, with their substantial body size makes them potentially excellent carriers of sophisticated environmental measuring technology; however, the ethical question of how much the well-being of birds can, and should, be compromised by such an approach needs to be carefully considered...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The vagal cardiac {{accelerator}} (VCA) system takes part in {{the nervous}} control of the heart rate. In the present study we tried to adduce evidence that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VLP) contributes to vagally induced cardioacceleration. Methods: The effect of VIP on heart rate and arterial blood pressure was investigated after unmasking the inherent VCA activity by blocking the sympathetic accelerator and vagal decelerator influences on heart rate in conscious dogs. Results: Following intravenous administration of VIP (10 mu g i. v.) the heart rare increased by 43. 6 +/- 6. 7 (28. 1 +/- 4. 7 %), from 165. 6 +/- 8. 5 to 209. 1 +/- 7. 0 beats/min (P < 0. 001) and the mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 47. 5 +/- 3. 2 (37. 9 +/- 3. 0 %), from 126. 6 +/- 2. 6 to 79. 1 +/- 4. 9 mmHg CP < 0. 001) (n = 11). After VCA activity was reflexly enhanced by alpha(1) -adrenoceptor stimulation with methoxamine, VIP increased heart rate by 36. 9 +/- 7. 3 (21. 5 +/- 4. 6 %), from 179. 8 +/- 5. 2 to 216. 7 +/- 15. 8 beats/min (P < 0. 001) and decreased mean arterial pressure by 79. 1 +/- 6. 4 (46. 7 +/- 3. 5 %), from 168. 2 +/- 4. 1 to 89. 1 +/- 5. 0 mmHg (P < 0. 001). Hence, the VIP-induced tachycardia, expressed in relative values, shows a significant attenuation after the administration of methoxamine (P < 0. 05). The increase in heart rate induced by VIP appeared to be inversely related to the prevailing VCA activity, both before (r = - 0. 744, P = 0. 009) and after methoxamine (r = - 0. 689, P = 0. 019). The VIP-induced tachycardia is certainly not reflexly induced by the fall in arterial pressure, because intracoronary administration of VIP (0. 5 mu g i. c.) caused an appreciable increase in the heart rate by 63. 7 +/- 13. 0 (46. 4 +/- 10. 4 %), from 143. 0 +/- 8. 1 to 208. 7 +/- 12. 0 beats/min (P < 0. 005), whereas the mean arterial pressure only slightly changed (- 7. 7 +/- 2. 0 mmHg) (P < 0. 05) (n = 6). In addition, VIP (10 mu g i. v.) also caused a tachycardia in vagotomized dogs with blocked P adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. The administration of the VIP antagonists [D-p-Cl-Phe(6),Leu(17) ]-VIP (50 - 150 mu g i. c.) and [Lys(1),Pro(2, 5),Leu(17) ]-VTP (20 mu g i. c.) {{did not result in}} alterations in VCA activity nor did the VIP antagonists block the VCA reflex response to a rise in arterial pressure. However, none of the VIP antagonists reduced the VIP-induced tachycardia either. Conclusion: Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide is likely to play a {{part in the}} vagal cardiac accelerator system. However, conclusive evidence for its role as the <b>terminal</b> <b>transmitter</b> in the VCA pathway will {{have to wait for the}} availability of a specific cardiac VIP receptor antagonist...|$|E

However, such data are necessary to clarify the nature of movements and home range sizes of animals. In order to measure the high-accuracy {{location data}}, we developed new GPS-Argos Platform <b>Terminal</b> <b>Transmitters</b> (PTTs) which transmit both the conventional location and GPS location simultaneously. Two experiments, one in an artificial rearing pond {{and the other in}} the open sea, were performed. First, two hawksbill turtles were tracked with the PTTs in a 5 ha breeding pond in Thailand. Their home ranges using both data were calculated and found to be 2. 96 ha and 0. 93 ha by the GPS data, and 156, 740 ha and 184, 478 ha by a conventional data. Secondly, a female green turtle attached with the GPS-Argos was released from the coast of Pangnga Province, Thailand. There was a relationship between depth and speed of travel based on the GPS data. The data from the PTT showed that the turtle moved south along the coastline at the depth of less than 20 m for 5 days, and then stayed at a depth of less than 10 m for 4 days. However, we could not find any clear relationship using conventional data. Only a meandering movement at a variety of depths was observed. The results of the two experiments indicated the PTTs have an enormous potential for enhancing our understanding of fine-scale movement patterns and home ranges of marine turtles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractShort-term {{synaptic}} enhancement {{is caused}} {{by an increase in}} the probability with which synaptic <b>terminals</b> release <b>transmitter</b> in response to presynaptic action potentials. Since exocytosed vesicles are drawn from a readily releasable pool of packaged transmitter, enhancement must result either from an increase {{in the size of the}} pool or an elevation in the fraction of releasable vesicles that undergoes exocytosis with each action potential. We show here that at least one major component of enhancement, augmentation, is not caused by an increase in the size of the readily releasable pool but is instead associated with an increase in the efficiency with which action potentials induce the exocytosis of readily releasable vesicles...|$|R
40|$|Radar and {{satellite}} global positioning system-platform <b>transmitter</b> <b>terminal</b> (GPSPTT) <b>transmitters</b> provide complementary {{information on the}} movements and behaviors of individual birds. The GPS-PTT tag provides a snapshot of altitude and location of a specific individual of an identified species at predefined intervals. The history of the individual is known because each transmitter has a unique identification code. The radar cannot identify individuals or even species but it provides continuous position reports (altitude and location) of birds within its detection range. By integrating data from the two sources, the behavior and movements of identified individuals (not possible with radar) can be continuously monitored (not possible with satellite tags). In this study the radar detected 40 % of the locations of vultures carrying GPS-PTT tags that were within 5 km of the radar. Most (75 %) of the locations that were not detected were calculated to be above or below the radar’s antenna beam. Speed and direction values recorded by the GPS-PTT tags and the radar were poorly correlated because the vultures were soaring and circling, which produced rapid changes in both azimuth and ground speed of the targets. Nevertheless, our findings show that combining these two techniques can allow monitoring of species that are of conservation concern where it is otherwise difficult to follow identified individual birds...|$|R

There was congestion on all channels in larger metropolitan statistical areas and moving businesses to Business Radio Service channels would provide some relief.

50|$|GPS {{tracking}} {{devices are}} often {{linked to an}} Argos Platform <b>Transmitter</b> <b>Terminal</b> (PTT) enabling them to transmit data via the Argos System, a scientific satellite system {{which has been in}} use since 1978. Users can then download their data directly from Argos via telnet and process the raw data to extract their transmitted information. Data can also be transmitted via GSM networks, using SMS messages or internet protocols in a GPRS session.|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 + influx through {{voltage-gated}} Ca 2 + {{channels and}} the resulting elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration, [Ca 2 +]i, triggers transmitter release in nerve terminals. However, it is controversial whether {{in addition to the}} opening of Ca 2 + channels, membrane potential directly affects transmitter release. Here, we assayed the influence of membrane potential on transmitter release at the calyx of Held nerve <b>terminals.</b> <b>Transmitter</b> release was evoked by presynaptic Ca 2 + uncaging, or by presynaptic Ca 2 + uncaging paired with presynaptic voltage-clamp depolarizations to + 80 mV, under pharmacological block of voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels. Such a change in membrane potential did not alter the Ca 2 + dependence of transmitter release rates or synaptic delays. We also found, by varying the amount of Ca 2 + influx during Ca 2 + tail-currents, that the time course of phasic transmitter release is not invariant to changes in release probability. Rather, the time difference between peak Ca 2 + current and peak transmitter release became progressively shorter with increasing Ca 2 + current amplitude. When this time difference was plotted {{as a function of the}} estimated local [Ca 2 +]i at the sites of vesicle fusion, a slope of ≈ 100 μs per 10 μM [Ca 2 +]i was found, in reasonable agreement with a model of cooperative Ca 2 + binding and vesicle fusion. Thus, the amplitude and time course of the [Ca 2 +]i signal at the sites of vesicle fusion controls the timing and the amount of transmitter release, both under conditions of brief periods of Ca 2 + influx, as well as during step-like elevations of [Ca 2 +]i produced by Ca 2 + uncaging...|$|R
