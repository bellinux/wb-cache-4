25|$|This current {{makes the}} railgun behave as an electromagnet, {{creating}} {{a magnetic field}} inside the loop formed by {{the length of the}} rails up to the position of <b>the</b> <b>armature.</b> In accordance with the right-hand rule, the magnetic field circulates around each conductor. Since the current is in the opposite direction along each rail, the net magnetic field between the rails (B) is directed at right angles to the plane formed by the central axes of the rails and <b>the</b> <b>armature.</b> In combination with the current (I) in <b>the</b> <b>armature,</b> this produces a Lorentz force which accelerates the projectile along the rails, away from the power supply. There are also Lorentz forces acting on the rails and attempting to push them apart, but since the rails are mounted firmly, they cannot move.|$|E

2500|$|In this method, {{power is}} {{transmitted}} between two rotating <b>armatures,</b> one in <b>the</b> transmitter {{and one in}} the receiver, which rotate synchronously, coupled together by a magnetic field generated by permanent magnets on <b>the</b> <b>armatures.</b> [...] <b>The</b> transmitter <b>armature</b> is turned either by or as the rotor of an electric motor, and its magnetic field exerts torque on <b>the</b> receiver <b>armature,</b> turning it. [...] The magnetic field acts like a mechanical coupling between <b>the</b> <b>armatures.</b> [...] <b>The</b> receiver <b>armature</b> produces power to drive the load, either by turning a separate electric generator or by using <b>the</b> receiver <b>armature</b> itself as <b>the</b> rotor in a generator.|$|R

40|$|A {{capacitor}} {{is made of}} two armatures and a dielectric between <b>the</b> two <b>armatures.</b> In this paper, we {{are going}} to study the plane capacitor, which is made of two equal metal armatures, plane and parallel, having the S surface, situated at a distance d much shorter than <b>the</b> <b>armatures</b> dimensions, between which there is a liniar, homogenous and isotropic dielectric having a constant electrical permittivity. The purpose of studying the plane capacitor, through MEF, presented in this paper,is to establish the stress to which the dielectrics may be subject to, in daily practice, and the influence that their superposition in an electric field has, on each of them. The study of the plane capacitor, finalised with observations on the raise of the dependence of the electric field intensity in air {{on the size of the}} air layer and having as parameter the type of dielectric material introduced between <b>the</b> <b>armatures,</b> is an example of confirmation or invalidation of the possibility and utility of using layers of dielectrics between <b>the</b> <b>armatures</b> of <b>the</b> capacitors...|$|R
25|$|Resistance is {{connected}} in parallel with the motor field. This has the effect of increasing <b>the</b> <b>armature</b> current, producing a corresponding increase in motor torque and speed.|$|E
25|$|The {{design is}} not {{mechanically}} stable; a slight imbalance makes <b>the</b> <b>armature</b> stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring force {{is required to}} hold <b>the</b> <b>armature</b> in the 'balance' position. Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other. Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during World War II for use in military sound powered telephones. Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, {{in the range of}} 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals.|$|E
25|$|A {{balanced}} armature is a {{sound transducer}} design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move {{in the field of}} the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on <b>the</b> <b>armature,</b> hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is electric current through the coil, it magnetizes <b>the</b> <b>armature</b> {{one way or the other}}, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound.|$|E

50|$|The {{direction}} of travel was read by comparing the indications on two independent galvanometers, one for each <b>armature.</b> <b>The</b> galvanometers had to be calibrated with the correct headings, since the voltage was proportional to the sine of the angle.

25|$|The printed {{armature}} (originally {{formed on}} {{a printed circuit}} board) in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid disc. The printed armature has a unique construction in the brushed motor world in {{that it does not}} have a separate ring commutator. The brushes run directly on <b>the</b> <b>armature</b> surface making the whole design very compact.|$|E
25|$|A commutated {{electrically}} excited series or parallel wound motor {{is referred}} to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and <b>the</b> <b>armature</b> coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} {{torque density}} of conventional electric machines {{is determined by}} the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of <b>the</b> <b>armature</b> winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt PMs, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or PM damage.|$|E

50|$|A {{reciprocating}} {{electric motor}} uses an alternating magnetic field {{to move its}} armature back and forth, rather than circularly as in a conventional electric motor.

25|$|A railgun is {{a device}} that uses {{electromagnetic}} force to launch high velocity projectiles, {{by means of a}} sliding armature that is accelerated along a pair of conductive rails. It is typically constructed as a weapon and the projectile normally does not contain explosives, relying on the projectile's high speed to inflict damage. The railgun uses a pair of parallel conductors, or rails, along which a sliding armature is accelerated by the electromagnetic effects of a current that flows down one rail, into <b>the</b> <b>armature</b> and then back along the other rail. It is based on principles {{similar to those of the}} homopolar motor.|$|E

The section of land, advertised for approximately A$7million, had initially been leased from the NSW Government for A$1, on the condition that any profit made from property built on the site was invested in the amusement park. There are concerns that the money will be used to allow Multiplex to recoup the financial outlay made when redeveloping the park, instead of going towards the ongoing operation and maintenance of Luna Park's facilities.|$|E
25|$|When the City & South London Railway (C) was {{authorised}} in 1884, it {{was intended}} to be a cable-hauled line, but during the construction phase, the promotors decided to use electric traction, {{despite the fact that the}} technology was in its infancy. Two prototype locomotives were built by Mather & Platt in 1889, to a design by Dr Edward Hopkinson, with Beyer-Peacock supplying many of the mechanical parts. No. 1 used motors mounted directly on the drive axles, while No. 2 had motors driven through gears. Trials were conducted in December 1889 with No. 1 and two passenger cars. No. 2 was also used for testing, but it is not clear whether it pulled any cars. A production run of 14 locomotives was then built, numbered 1 to 14, duplicating the original numbers 1 and 2. Each had four wheels, with Edison-Hopkinson motors fitted to the axles, which were permanently wired in series. A 26-step rheostat was used to control the speed, and a switch which altered the connections to <b>the</b> <b>armature</b> was used to reverse the direction of travel.|$|E

25|$|An {{advantage}} of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor {{can be used to}} agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to <b>the</b> <b>armature.</b>|$|E
25|$|Philo T. Farnsworth {{was born}} August 19, 1906, {{the eldest of}} five {{children}} of Lewis Edwin Farnsworth and Serena Amanda Bastian, a Mormon couple then living in a small log cabin built by Lewis's father {{in a place called}} Indian Creek near Beaver, Utah. In 1918, the family moved to a relative's 240-acre ranch near Rigby, Idaho, where Lewis supplemented his farming income by hauling freight with his horse-drawn wagon. Philo was excited to find his new home was wired for electricity, with a Delco generator providing power for lighting and farm machinery. He was a quick student in mechanical and electrical technology, repairing the troublesome generator, and upon finding a burned out electric motor among some items discarded by the previous tenants, proceeding to rewind <b>the</b> <b>armature</b> and convert his mother's hand-powered washing machine into an electric-powered one. Philo developed an early interest in electronics after his first telephone conversation with an out-of-state relative and the discovery of a large cache of technology magazines in the attic of the family’s new home, and won a $25 first prize in a pulp-magazine contest for inventing a magnetized car lock. Farnsworth was Mormon.|$|E
