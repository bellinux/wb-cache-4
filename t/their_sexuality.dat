5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on {{opposition}} to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into {{institutions of higher}} learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of <b>their</b> <b>sexuality.</b>|$|E
5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of <b>their</b> <b>sexuality.</b> Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before <b>their</b> <b>sexuality,</b> but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

This research analyzes the lived reality Latinas experience when developing sexual identities. Specifically, this research explores the ways that young Latinas learn about sexuality, how they negotiate <b>their</b> <b>sexualities</b> within the home, and how they navigate their sexual behavior among sexual partners...|$|R

50|$|A {{story is}} told of {{heterosexual}} college men who were shown gay pornography. Their physical response was measured. Men who were considered homophobes were more aroused, but claimed they had no reaction. This then goes back to Gwen Araujo, who was killed by two men who were insecure about <b>their</b> <b>sexualities</b> because they had sexual relations with her. All of this supports the theory that {{people are more likely}} to get angry at sex, gender, and sexuality differences because they are insecure about <b>their</b> own <b>sexuality</b> or gender identity.|$|R
5|$|Opinions on the sex {{industry}} are diverse. Feminists critical of the {{sex industry}} generally {{see it as the}} exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of {{the sex industry}} argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of <b>their</b> <b>sexuality.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to writer Devin Grayson, {{the amount}} of {{creative}} freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change <b>their</b> <b>sexuality</b> {{are less likely to}} be shown as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, fans are often disgruntled, particularly when sexuality is involved, and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable.|$|E

5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged <b>their</b> <b>sexuality</b> in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the United Kingdom does not ask citizens to define <b>their</b> <b>sexuality.</b> However, {{a survey by the}} UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2010 found that 1.5% of Britons identified themselves as gay or bisexual, and the ONS suggests that this is in line with other surveys showing the number between 0.3% and 3%. Estimates of lesbians are sometimes not differentiated in studies of same-sex households, such as those performed by the U.S. census, and estimates of total gay, lesbian, or bisexual population by the UK government. However, polls in Australia have recorded a range of self-identified lesbian or bisexual women from 1.3% to 2.2% of the total population.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt <b>their</b> <b>sexuality</b> more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC Lattès, for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel The First Thing We Look At by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E
50|$|The actors' real-life sexual {{orientation}} {{have been the}} subject of speculation from the public. In a 2015 Queer As Folk reunion, actors Gale Harold and Scott Lowell said they refused to discuss <b>their</b> own <b>sexuality</b> in the press, at least during the show's first season, in an effort to lessen distractions, which was corroborated by Lipman, who went on to say that during the show's first season, even he didn't know about <b>their</b> real-life <b>sexuality.</b>|$|R

40|$|The American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD, 2011) {{assert that}} {{individuals}} with intellectual disabilities, irrespective of gender, have an equal right to learn about and experience <b>their</b> own <b>sexuality.</b> A review of the extant literature indicated that the voices of women with intellectual disabilities {{on the topic of}} familial culture, as it relates to sexuality, are rarely included (McCarthy, 1993; Shakespeare, 2000; Siebers, 2012). The purpose of this qualitative {{study was to examine the}} role of familial culture and lived experiences of women with intellectual disabilities, ages 21 - 35, in understanding <b>their</b> own <b>sexuality.</b> Eight women participated in individual and three repeated focus group interviews. The questions that guided this study included: (1) What is the role of familial culture in addressing sexuality for young women with intellectual disabilities and (2) How do young women with intellectual disabilities describe <b>their</b> understanding of <b>sexuality?</b> The findings of this study suggested that familial culture played a significant role in the women 2 ̆ 7 s decisions regarding accessing <b>their</b> own <b>sexuality.</b> In addition, data collected indicated that women 2 ̆ 7 s lived experiences highly influenced in <b>their</b> understanding of <b>sexuality</b> and as a women with intellectual disabilities. Data from a thematic analysis were used to develop a person-centered theoretical model for understanding sexuality. In addition, these data were used to create a research-based theatrical script, known as an Ethnodrama (Saldana, 2005) to bring forward the voices of these women affirming <b>their</b> understanding of <b>sexuality...</b>|$|R

50|$|The themes {{established}} in La nave de los locos are ones which Rossi revisits in other works. Her latest novels include Solitario de amor (Solitaire of Love) (1989), La última noche de Dostoievski (Dostoyevsky's Last Night) (1992) and El amor es una droga dura (Love {{is a hard}} drug) (1999). All of these novels are formally less experimental than Nave. They deal with male protagonists who, like Equis, gradually explore <b>their</b> <b>sexualities,</b> discovering {{that they have to}} renounce traditional gender roles both in sexual behaviour and in the real world to find fulfilment. However, there is little political commentary in these novels.|$|R
