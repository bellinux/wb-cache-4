40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is an {{implementation}} of a reverse-charge mechanism on selected goods, more specifically <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrap,</b> which are listed in Annex no. 5 of the Act no. 235 / 2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax. The reverse charge mechanism, as {{is evident from the}} title, is the transfer of VAT obligations of provider to the recipient of taxable transactions. The reverse charge mechanism is not only in the Czech Republic, but also throughout the European Union, introduced as a measure against VAT frauds.

The estimation of tax evasion in the period from 1. 4. 2010 to 31. 3. 2011, the period just before the implementation of the reverse-charge mechanism, is in the amount of CZK 1, 561, 278, 000...|$|R

We demonstrate that, the higher the wage/per capita GDP/population of an importing country, the more recyclable wastes it imports. This result suggests that the demand for final goods and, accordingly, the demand for materials including recycled material, have strong effects on the import volume of recyclable waste. Moreover, this implies that the imports of a developing country from developed countries increase with expanding industrial activity and economic growth.

50|$|Section and Chapter titles {{describe}} {{broad categories}} of goods, while headings and subheadings describe products in more detail. Generally, HS sections and chapters {{are arranged in}} order of a product’s degree of manufacture or {{in terms of its}} technological complexity. Natural commodities, such as live animals and vegetables, for example, are described the early sections of the HS, whereas more evolved goods such as machinery and precision instruments are described in later sections. Chapters within the individual sections are also usually organized in order of complexity or degree of manufacture. For example, within Section X (Pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material; Recovered (<b>waste</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrap)</b> paper or paperboard; Paper and paperboard and articles thereof), Chapter 47 provides for pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic materials, whereas Chapter 49 covers printed books, newspapers, and other printed matter.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find an alternative to minimize environmental contamination by leather waste using it as ruminant feed. The wet blue leather wastes (WB) without chrome extraction were compared with the leather wastes in which the chrome was extracted (CE). Both materials had 99. 7 % of dry matter (DM), but the crude protein level was higher (90. 4 %) in CE than in WB (74. 3 %). In situ effective ruminal degradability of DM was 59. 7 % and it was 63. 1 % for CP in CE. The WB did not suffer degradation in the rumen. In vitro abomasal digestibility of CE was 100 %. The percentage of degradation per hour was higher for CE (8. 2 %) than for WB (0. 08 %). The mineral content was higher in wet blue leather wastes (10. 4 %) than in CE (0. 4 %) reflecting the chrome level and demonstrating that the removal process of this mineral is efficient. The use in animal feed is presented as a viable alternative for the disposal of <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrap</b> generated by the leather tanning industry and treated by the extraction method, thus minimizing environmental contamination and providing a source of protein for animal feed...|$|R
