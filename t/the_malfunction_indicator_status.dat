40|$|DISCUSSION: The {{on-board}} diagnostics II (OBD II) regulation requires all vehicle manufacturers to monitor virtually every emission-control component and {{system that can}} cause increases in emissions. When an emission-related <b>malfunction</b> is detected, <b>the</b> OBD II system alerts the vehicle owner by illuminating <b>the</b> <b>malfunction</b> <b>indicator</b> light (MIL) on the vehicle instrument panel. By alerting <b>the</b> owner of <b>malfunctions</b> as they occur, repairs can be sought promptly, which results in fewer emissions from the vehicle. Manufacturers began phase-in of the OBD II requirements in 1994, with full implementation required on all 1996 and newer model year vehicles. The Air Resources Board (ARB) last adopted modifications to the curren...|$|R
50|$|The 1987 Alianza Lima air {{disaster}} {{took place}} on 8 December 1987, when a Peruvian Navy Fokker F27-400M chartered by Peruvian football club Alianza Lima plunged into the Pacific Ocean six miles short of its destination, off the Ventanilla District {{of the city of}} Callao. On board the flight were a total of 44 players, managers, staff, team supporters, and crewmembers, of whom only the pilot survived the accident. The team was returning from a Peruvian league match in Pucallpa. Uncomfortable with <b>the</b> <b>malfunctioning</b> <b>indicator</b> on his control panel, the pilot requested a flyby of the control tower at Lima's Jorge Chávez International Airport so that spotters on the ground could confirm that the aircraft's landing gear was down and locked. Upon receiving visual confirmation of safe configuration for landing, the aircraft went around for another attempt at a landing, during which the aircraft flew too low, hitting the Pacific Ocean.|$|R

40|$|California Air Resources Board {{emissions}} {{regulations for}} 2013 require that heavy duty diesel on-board diagnostic (OBD-II) systems light <b>the</b> <b>malfunction</b> <b>indicator</b> lamp if tailpipe nonmethane hydrocarbon levels are ever greater than 2. 0 times the legal limit, {{or if the}} catalyst in the catalyzed diesel particulate filter (CDPF) is no longer active with respect to NMHC. This study focused on the serial diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) to CDPF aftertreatment system found on Cummins ISB products and detecting when the CDPF is no longer catalytically active. Investigation into catalyst aging showed no statistically significant trends as a filter aged from degreened to effectively end of useful life. Light-off temperature shift {{was chosen as the}} method to be used to detect catalyst activity. An aged CDPF has a light-off temperature more than 50 °C higher than a degreened CDPF, but also loses its ability to light- off easily at low flowrates, despite crossing what would otherwise be considered its light-off temperature. Using light-off temperature shift as a diagnostic method on this system requires CDPF light-off independent of DOC light-off. Ultimately, the proposed diagnostic strategy 2 ̆ 7 s solution space is exceedingly small: ISB engine power levels below 43 hp. Testing at highway speed and load, idle, and in the OBD solution space never produced independent CDPF light-off; spatially nonuniform DOC bed temperature distributions always caused the DOC to light-off before the CDPF. Cool- down times to drop the DOC below its light-off temperature to attempt independent CDPF light-off are too long to allow this to remain a viable detection strategy. ...|$|R
