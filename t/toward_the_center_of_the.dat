5|$|Border {{disputes}} with rival troops occur occasionally {{and it is}} the dominant female's responsibility to defend the troop's home range. Agonistic encounters include staring, lunging approaches and occasional physical aggression, and conclude with troop members retreating <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home range.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth {{by the force of}} gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|As Commerce Street, NY141 {{continues}} {{to head to}} the northeast, passing by a line of businesses in an otherwise residential area between the hamlets of Hawthorne and Thornwood. The route eventually enters the latter's central business district, where the Saw Mill Parkway and the Harlem Line turn northwestward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearby village of Pleasantville. NY141 continues on a northern track however, veering off of Commerce Street onto Franklin Avenue, then becoming known as Broadway again as it heads through mostly residential areas on its way into the eastern portion of Pleasantville. It retains the Broadway name to a junction with Bedford Road, from where the route continues as Bedford Road for two blocks before ending at an intersection with NY117. Westbound NY117 enters from the west on Manville Road, while NY117 east turns north to follow Bedford Road.|$|E
50|$|With {{respect to}} <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> mass both {{velocities}} are reversed by the collision: {{in the case}} of particles of different mass, a heavy particle moves slowly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> mass, and bounces back with the same low speed, and a light particle moves fast <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> mass, and bounces back with the same high speed.|$|R

5|$|When the core's mass {{exceeds the}} Chandrasekhar limit of about , {{degeneracy}} pressure {{can no longer}} support it, and catastrophic collapse ensues. The outer part of the core reaches velocities of up to 70,000km/s (23% {{of the speed of}} light) as it collapses <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star. The rapidly shrinking core heats up, producing high-energy gamma rays that decompose iron nuclei into helium nuclei and free neutrons via photodisintegration. As the core's density increases, it becomes energetically favorable for electrons and protons to merge via inverse beta decay, producing neutrons and elementary particles called neutrinos. Because neutrinos rarely interact with normal matter, they can escape from the core, carrying away energy and further accelerating the collapse, which proceeds over a timescale of milliseconds. As the core detaches from the outer layers of the star, some of these neutrinos are absorbed by the star's outer layers, beginning the supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|East Market Street crosses over a {{railroad}} as it leaves Celina. At Grand Lake Road, SR 703 turns south {{to continue as}} East Market Street, and SR 29 continues eastward to a divided highway. SR 703 then travels along the northern banks of the lake, with farmland north of the road. The road intersects multiple driveways and places, including the Wright State University Lake Campus and the Grand Lake St. Marys Lighthouse. Near Mercer–Auglaize County Line Road, the highway enters Auglaize County as Celina Road. The route intersects SR 364 at Koenig Road, which becomes concurrent with SR 703. The concurrency crosses {{a railroad}}, and SR 364 continues southward at East Bank Road. SR 703 enters St. Marys as Jackson Street, and travels <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. The route turns southwards at North Wayne Street, then eastward at West Spring Street. At Main Street and Spring Street, SR 703 and SR 116 reach their termini at SR 29 and SR 66. SR 66 continues as South Main Street after this intersection, and SR 29 continues as East Spring Street.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lure out and destroy {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet with sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers and thirty-one torpedo boats {{commanded}} by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, at that time consisting of twenty-eight dreadnoughts and nine battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. At the time of the battle, the ship's commander was Captain Henry Wise Parker, and she was the flagship of Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee. She was stationed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British line. The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene.|$|E
