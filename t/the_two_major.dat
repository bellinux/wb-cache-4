5|$|A {{modicum of}} peace was {{eventually}} established, {{leading to the}} National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> leagues and {{between them and the}} National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The Boston Americans of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion. In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Double {{majors and}} double degrees== Double degrees {{should not be}} {{confused}} with double major, or with the occasional practice of awarding a further qualification with a worked-for (especially research) degree, nor with the awarding of a single degree by multiple institutions. Double majors or dual <b>majors</b> consist of <b>two</b> <b>majors</b> attached to a single degree, as opposed to two separate degrees each with its own field of study. In some schools, students will earn a double <b>major</b> when <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>majors</b> lead to <b>the</b> same degree name (such as: B.A., B.S., B.F.A.) and they will earn a double degree when <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>majors</b> lead to differently-named degrees (such as: B.A. and B.M., B.S. and B.F.A.). In general, the number of hours and required courses are more in a dual-degree program than a double major.|$|R

5|$|With Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area, the Norwegian airline market was {{deregulated}} from 1 April 1994.

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} from <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> {{species can}} be divided into two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'tasim's reign {{was also}} marked by {{continuous}} warfare.

Al-Mu'tasim himself led a major campaign in 838 against the Byzantine Empire, with his armies defeating Emperor Theophilos and sacking the city of Amorium. The Amorium campaign was widely celebrated, and became a cornerstone of caliphal propaganda, cementing al-Mu'tasim's reputation as a warrior-caliph.|$|E

5|$|Alliance members {{gathered}} that December in Ocala, Florida, and formulated a platform, {{later called}} the Ocala Demands, {{that called for}} looser money, government control of the railroads, a graduated income tax, and the direct election of senators. Weaver endorsed the message in the Tribune and corresponded with the group's leader, LeonidasL. Polk. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for a break from <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> parties, and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Paleozoic, the crinoids and blastoids were the {{predominant}} echinoderms, and some limestones {{from this period}} are made almost entirely from fragments from these groups. In <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> extinction events {{that occurred during the}} late Devonian and late Permian, the blastoids were wiped out and only a few species of crinoids survived. Many starfish species also became extinct in these events, but afterwards the surviving few species diversified rapidly within about sixty million years during the Early Jurassic {{and the beginning of the}} Middle Jurassic. A 2012 study found that speciation in starfish can occur rapidly. During the last 6,000 years, divergence in the larval development of Cryptasterina hystera and Cryptasterina pentagona has taken place, the former adopting internal fertilization and brooding and the latter remaining a broadcast spawner.|$|E
5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E
