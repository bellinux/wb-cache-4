5|$|According to Shia scholar Mohammad Jafar Tabasi, <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> of Shia Imams {{buried in}} al-Baqi had been revered and since {{hundreds}} of years ago and none of the Sunni scholars ulamas regarded the shrines as innovation. Weeks before the second demolition, at the request of Ibn Bulayhid, a group of fifteen scholars from Medina unanimously issued a fatwa (an Islamic legal ruling) condemning the making of mausoleums around <b>the</b> <b>graves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Few visible {{signs of}} the company remain. The former extent of the Bolckow, Vaughan {{property}} at the Eston Sheet and Galvanizing Works beside the River Tees Dockyard is still marked by boundary stones on Smiths Dock Road, Middlesbrough. <b>The</b> <b>graves</b> {{of the founding fathers}} of the company and of Middlesbrough, Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan, in St Cuthbert's Churchyard, Marton, were neglected for the whole of the 20th century, and fell into disrepair. The neglect was recognised and <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> refurbished in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The artefacts, {{body and}} grave would have interacted {{to create a}} complex {{sequences}} of practices and performances in the funeral. We can imagine the digging of <b>the</b> <b>grave,</b> perhaps <b>the</b> lining of <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> with timber shorings, and perhaps a temporary shelter over <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> in <b>the</b> hours or days until the body is ready for burial. We then have the lowering of a bed into <b>the</b> <b>grave,</b> followed by <b>the</b> clothed body together {{with a set of}} discrete deposits. Each would have required persons approaching <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> and passing them down to those in <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> itself with <b>the</b> body. Finally, after the funeral had approached completion, <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> would have been back-filled and the mound raised.|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} the town cross was placed on <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> but it was carried off and vandalised. The Belfast Naturalists' Field Club erected the large granite slab over <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> in 1900 to protect <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> as it had become {{customary}} for those leaving Ireland to take soil from <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> with them.|$|R

5|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> {{are marked}} by plain {{triangular}} stones set at one end. These are not carved or inscribed with names as in Christian cemeteries, but are similar to markers found in pagan cemeteries. Some graves are interrupted by stakeholes cut into them, possibly indicating the presence of wooden poles that might have served as markers or supported wooden structures within <b>the</b> <b>graves.</b> This is unusual {{in the north of}} England, though comparable examples have been found in Kent in the south-east.|$|E

5|$|A further {{survey of}} <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> was {{undertaken}} in 1986. A camera crew filmed the procedure, shown in Novas television documentary, Buried in Ice in 1988.

5|$|A {{memorial}} {{was erected}} at St Mary's Church and Grange Road cemetery in Gillingham, Kent.

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1919, the Commission {{had spent}} £7,500, and this figure rose to £250,000 in 1920 as {{construction}} of cemeteries and memorials increased. By 1921, the Commission had established 1,000cemeteries which were ready for headstone erections, and burials. Between 1920 and 1923, the Commission was shipping 4,000headstones a week to France. In many cases, the Commission closed small cemeteries and concentrated <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> into larger ones. By 1927, when the majority of construction had been completed, over 500cemeteries had been built, with 400,000headstones, a thousand Crosses of Sacrifice, and 400 Stones of Remembrance.|$|E

5|$|Doubt {{was cast}} on this by Robert Dickson in 1878, when {{he pointed out}} that, while {{relatively}} high-status goods were found in some of <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, {{there was a lack}} of weapons. He also talked of the apparent presence of female skeletons. Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long-Cist cemetery, including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with osteoarthritis, who apparently died of tuberculosis. In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a supine, east-west orientation.|$|E
5|$|Following the massacres, many Serbs from Glina and its {{surroundings}} fled to Serbia or were deported to Ustaše-controlled concentration camps. The NDH collapsed in May 1945, {{and the following}} year the Nuremberg trials judged that the persecution experienced by Serbs in the country was a crime of genocide. Local Serbs returned to Glina after the war, partly out {{of a desire to}} remain near <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> of their deceased family members, and lived peacefully alongside their Croat neighbours until the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s.|$|E
