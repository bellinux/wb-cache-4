5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} {{the love of}} Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict. The conflict that ensues ends up being three-sided, among the Pandawas, Kurawas and the ogre-kingdom, whose evil ogre-king Barandjana plans to kidnap Titisari. The confusion that follows results in the outwitting and humiliation of the Kurawas. Siti Sendari, the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of Abhimanju, {{takes advantage of the}} situation and schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together, while also mending her relationships with her husband. Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and heroine of the lakon, in reality they are mere spectators, not <b>the</b> <b>movers,</b> in the play. Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character. Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others, which is common in South Asian theatre. Another lakon called Serat Lampahan Pregiwa Pregiwati also relates a tale about the love of Irawan and Titisari.|$|E

However, newspapers including The Plain Dealer (Cleveland), New Orleans Times Picayune, Chicago Daily News, Atlanta Journal, Saint Paul Dispatch, the Philadelphia Record and Public Ledger, the Boston American and New York's Daily News, Daily Mirror, and Evening Post all lambasted the studies.

500|$|As {{early as}} Plato, {{philosophers}} considered the heavens {{to be moved}} by immaterial agents. [...] Plato believed the cause to be a world-soul, created according to mathematical principles, which governed the daily motion of the heavens (the motion of the Same) and the opposed motions of the planets along the zodiac (the motion of the Different). [...] Aristotle proposed the existence of divine unmoved movers which act as final causes; the celestial spheres mimic <b>the</b> <b>movers,</b> as best they could, by moving with uniform circular motion. [...] In his Metaphysics, Aristotle maintained that an individual unmoved mover {{would be required to}} insure each individual motion in the heavens. While stipulating that the number of spheres, and thus gods, is subject to revision by astronomers, he estimated the total as 47 or 55, depending on whether one followed the model of Eudoxus or Callippus. [...] In On the Heavens, Aristotle presented an alternate view of eternal circular motion as moving itself, in the manner of Plato's world-soul, which lent support to three principles of celestial motion: an internal soul, an external unmoved mover, and the celestial material (aether).|$|E

Neville Phillips thought she was a [...] "complete revelation", adding [...] "although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she had a way of playing comedy that put me in mind of the great Beatrice Lillie... a subtle, sophisticated actress". Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: [...] "She was such a great comedienne... everyone wanted her but <b>the</b> <b>movers</b> and shakers of entertainment didn't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady". Guy Pearce, writing in the Daily Express, noted that [...] "she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing 'the fattie'." [...] The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been [...] "unimaginatively cast as the 'fat person'" [...] in ITMA, while in Sykes, her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes [...] "hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change". Gray considers that [...] "although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight".|$|E

Soon after, the CSI team investigates, and Harper and Santoro wonder why Michael was there.

They are unaware that the killer is listening to them from a nearby vent. Michael leaves the investigation, and as he goes to his car, the killer is seen dressed in a police uniform, as he is starting at him. Later at the station, Harper tells him that they {{got a call from}} someone claiming to be their guy. She plays a recording and Gemini addresses Michael as his friend. Harper tells Michael that they traced the call to his home phone. Later, Michael meets with Bird and the two find out that the killer was going to eject and then murder Agent Santoro.

2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1970s, American disco was {{imported}} to South Africa, and disco beats were added to soul music, which helped bring a halt to popular mbaqanga bands such as the Mahotella Queens. In 1976, South African children rebelled en masse against apartheid and governmental authority, and a vibrant, youthful counterculture was created, with music {{as an integral part of}} its focus. Styles from before the 1970s fusion of disco and soul were not widely regarded, and were perceived as being sanctioned by the white oppressors. Few South African bands gained a lasting success during this period, however, with the exception of <b>the</b> <b>Movers,</b> who used marabi elements in their soul. <b>The</b> <b>Movers</b> were followed by the Soul Brothers, and the instrumental band The Cannibals, who soon began working with singer Jacob [...] "Mpharanyana" [...] Radebe. The coloured (not black) band The Flames also gained a following, and soon contributed two members (Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar) to American band The Beach Boys. Harari arose in their place, eventually moving to an almost entirely rock and roll sound. One of Harari's members, Sipho 'Hotstix' Mabuse became a superstar in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{many people}} began leaving the city for the cooler suburbs in the heat of summertime, and as a result October 1 became a second Moving Day, as people {{returning}} to the city would take their belongings out of storage and move into their newly rented homes.

Eventually, the October date began to supplant the traditional May date, so that by 1922 the Van Owners Association reported only a [...] "moderate flurry" [...] of activity on the Spring day. <b>The</b> <b>movers</b> also attempted to get legislation passed to spread out the Fall rush to three dates: the firsts of September, October and November.

40|$|Linear {{motor driven}} {{elevators}} are desirable in high-rise buildings because of two main reasons: First, {{there are no}} theoretical limits to their length and second, more than one elevator cage can be driven by the same stator; multi-car elevators.

A magnetic shunt is positioned at a fixed distance ahead of <b>the</b> <b>mover,</b> and <b>the</b> deformation it creates on the magnetic field produced by exciting one of the coils of the stator is measured through the voltages induced on the neighboring stator coils to calculate the position of the shunt, and thus <b>the</b> <b>mover.</b> A novel method on optimizing the dimensions of the magnetic shunt to give long measurement range and small position error, and a real-time measurement algorithm are also proposed.

But, as I have the honour to move the first resolution which this handsome gift, and the vigorous action that must be taken upon it, necessitate, I think I shall only give expression to what is uppermost in the general mind here, if I venture to remark that, many as the parts are in which Mr. Kean has distinguished himself on these boards, he has never appeared in {{one in which the}} large spirit of an artist, the feeling of a man, and the grace of a gentleman, have been more admirably blended than in this day's faithful adherence to the calling of which he is a prosperous ornament, and in this day's manly advocacy of its cause.|$|E

They knew they could make no advancement directly {{in the teeth of}} these strong and noble sentiments. Accordingly, they commenced by an insidious debauching of the public mind. They invented an ingenious sophism which, if conceded, was followed by perfectly logical steps, through all the incidents, to the complete destruction of the Union. The sophism itself is that any State of the Union may consistently with the national Constitution, and therefore lawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the Union without the consent of the Union or of any other State.
