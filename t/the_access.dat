5|$|After {{integration}} into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and cleave it, thereby preventing it from {{being used as a}} translation template. Differently from siRNA, a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of destructive cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) regions of mRNAs where they typically bind with imperfect complementarity, thus blocking <b>the</b> <b>access</b> of ribosomes for translation.|$|E

30|$|In {{the paper}} [42, 43], <b>the</b> {{previous}} <b>access</b> router will cache incoming Interests once the mobile host is moving. When attaching to <b>the</b> new <b>access</b> router, <b>the</b> mobile host will issue an Interest containing locators of both its pervious and new <b>access</b> router to <b>the</b> previous <b>access</b> router. Then, <b>the</b> previous router sends related cached Interests to the mobile host {{based on the}} locator of <b>the</b> new <b>access</b> router. Finally, <b>the</b> mobile host returns the corresponding Datas by the new and previous <b>access</b> router. <b>The</b> work [44] focuses on the fast handover of both mobile consumers and producers. Before handovers, <b>the</b> previous <b>access</b> router sends a control packet to <b>the</b> next <b>access</b> router, carrying <b>the</b> identification of <b>the</b> next <b>access</b> router and <b>the</b> content name. This control packet will be terminated at <b>the</b> next <b>access</b> router or <b>the</b> on-path router located at the intersection between the control packet path and content delivery path. Then, for the consumer, the related PIT should be modified to guide Datas back to <b>the</b> next <b>access</b> router, while for the producer, the corresponding FIB is revised to direct Interests to <b>the</b> next <b>access</b> router.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} low-overhead logging scheme for the {{distributed}} shared memory {{system based on}} the lazy release consistent memory model. In the proposed scheme, stable logging is performed when a lock grant causes an actual dependency relation between the processes, which significantly reduces the logging frequency. Also, instead of making a stable log of <b>the</b> <b>accessed</b> data items, a process logs stably only some <b>access</b> information, and <b>the</b> <b>accessed</b> data items are saved in the volatile log. For the recovery from a failure, the correct version of <b>the</b> <b>accessed</b> data items can be effectively traced by using <b>the</b> logged <b>access</b> information. As a result, the amount of logged information is also reduced.
