40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{personalized}} webpage recommendation. The method {{is capable of}} inferring a user’s personal reading <b>interest</b> <b>distribution</b> according to implicit user feedbacks coming from the user’s past online reading activities. With the inferred user reading <b>interest</b> <b>distribution,</b> we can recommend webpages in a search result set to a user in a personalized way. Our method is featured by its novel approach to observe the facial expressions and gaze positions of a user during the user’s online reading activities as two types of implicit user feedbacks for estimating the user’s reading <b>interest</b> <b>distribution.</b> To capture these implicit user feedbacks, we use an ordinary web camera and a customized web browser in the setup. The setup allows us to measure {{the distribution of the}} reading time a user spends in his or her reading activities over materials of different contents. With all the captured information, our method then estimates a user’s reading <b>interest</b> <b>distribution</b> by finding correlations between the implicit feedbacks of a user with the contents of the read materials. Given the estimated user reading <b>interest</b> <b>distribution,</b> our algorithm can further predict the user’s potential reading interest in any new webpage. Consequently, our algorithm can produce a personalized webpage recommendation for all the result webpages in an online search session. We compared the performance of our method with that of several mainstream commercial search engines as well as a recent personalized webpage ranking algorithm. The comparison results clearly show the superiority of our new method for personalized webpage recommendation...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} massive data on users' online behavior presents exciting opportunities for business analytics. In particular, {{if we could}} model the <b>distributions</b> of <b>interests</b> of visitors to webpages (or websites), we could apply the result to applications including site optimization, advertisement targeting, content creation, internal offer merchandizing, sponsorship, and general customer analytics. We first present a two-stage generative model for estimating audience <b>interest</b> <b>distributions</b> (AID) for websites, {{based in part on}} estimating individual (anonymized) user <b>interest</b> <b>distributions</b> from their observed visitation patterns to labeled websites. The model yields the following interpretation: the AID is the expected <b>interest</b> <b>distribution</b> of a visitor to the website. Estimating AID is important for several reasons: (i) contextual categorization of websites is expensive and/or error prone at large scale, (ii) even under favorable assumptions, contextual categorization provides only a narrow view of user interests, and (iii) certain sorts of sites (image, video, social) do not lend themselves to easy/accurate contextual categorization. The paper then demonstrates and evaluates the model on a massive set of (anonymized) data from a large online advertising company. We show two main findings. (1) In a predictive modeling-style evaluation, for sites where user interests are (partially) known, the model predicts them well. (2) For pages where con- textual categorization does not estimate user interests well (specifically, image pages), the model does estimate them well. We also provide qualitative results demonstrating how the model can reveal interests that are not apparent from contextual categorization. ...|$|R
