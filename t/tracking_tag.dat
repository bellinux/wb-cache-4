50|$|The {{defining}} feature behind Revver was the RevTag, a <b>tracking</b> <b>tag</b> {{attached to}} uploaded videos. The RevTag displayed an advertisement {{at the end}} of each video. When clicked, the advertiser was charged and the advertising fee split between the video creator and Revver. RevTags were trackable across the web; because the RevTag was part of the video file itself, the technology worked regardless of where the video file is hosted or displayed. Users were further encouraged to share by Revver's affiliate program. An Affiliate was a user who helped to promote videos, through email, sneakernet, peer-to-peer sharing, or posting on their own website or on social networking sites. Revver affiliates earned 20% of ad revenue for sharing videos. The remaining revenue for each video is divided equally between the video creator and Revver.|$|E
50|$|When {{entanglement}} {{prevention efforts}} fail, disentanglement efforts occasionally succeed, {{despite the fact}} that such efforts are more frequently impossible or unsuccessful. Nevertheless, they do in fact make a significant difference because saving a few whales in a population of only 400 has a large positive effect against mortality rates. During the period 2004-2008 there were at least four documented cases of entanglements for which the intervention of disentanglement teams averted a likely death of a right whale. For the first time in 2009 and again in 2011, scientists successfully used chemical sedation of an entangled whale to reduce stress on the animal and to reduce the time spent working with it. After disentangling the whale, scientists attached a satellite <b>tracking</b> <b>tag,</b> administered a dose of antibiotics to treat entanglement wounds and then another drug to reverse the sedation. Despite concerns that the trauma might impair reproduction, researchers confirmed in January 2013 that three disentangled whales had given birth.|$|E

5000|$|On 5 March, Judge Robert Castaneda {{ruled that}} Tappin must remain in custody after {{prosecutors}} asked {{that he be}} detained {{for the duration of}} the proceedings because he [...] "posed a flight risk". Assistant US attorney Greg McDonald told the court that [...] "the risk is not that he'll punch somebody in the face, but through the use of a computer and the knowledge he has, he might pose a danger to the community." [...] On 8 March, Karen Todner (Tappin's solicitor in the UK) urged the British government to intervene over the bail refusal. Eventually, on 25 April 2012, Tappin was bailed on condition that he wore an electronic <b>tracking</b> <b>tag</b> at all times. Additionally, his ability to travel was restricted to within two Texas counties as well as the border city of El Paso for court appearances.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging provides the unique capability to produce artificial, high-contrast features called "tags" that are invaluable for tracking tissue motion. Each tag corresponds to an initially planar surface {{embedded in the}} tissue that deforms with tissue motion. By <b>tracking</b> <b>tag</b> surface deformation, quantitative analysis of tissue motion can be performed. In this paper, we present a method for tag surface tracking that applies specifically to tag surfaces embedded in {{the wall of the}} left ventricle. The method addresses two key issues: first, the full spatial extent of tag surfaces in 3 -D space must be inferred from 2 -D images, and second, within the images, noise leads to uncertainty in tag positions. We address these issues by framing tag surface tracking as an estimation problem given the observed image data. The estimates are obtained using a stochastic model of tag deformation and a recursive algorithm that simultaneously filters over time and smoothly interpolates betwee [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study proposes and validates {{a method}} of {{measuring}} 3 D strain in myocardium using a 3 D Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) tissue-tagging sequence and a 3 D optical flow method (OFM). Methods: Initially, a 3 D tag MR sequence was developed and {{the parameters of the}} sequence and 3 D OFM were optimized using phantom images with simulated deformation. This method then was validated in-vivo and utilized to quantify normal sheep left ventricular functions. Results: Optimizing imaging and OFM parameters in the phantom study produced sub-pixel root-mean square error (RMS) between the estimated and known displacements in the x (RMSx = 0. 62 pixels (0. 43 mm)), y (RMSy = 0. 64 pixels (0. 45 mm)) and z (RMSz = 0. 68 pixels (1 mm)) direction, respectively. In-vivo validation demonstrated excellent correlation between the displacement measured by manually <b>tracking</b> <b>tag</b> intersections and that generated by 3 D OFM (R ≥ 0. 98). Technique performance was maintained even with 20 % Gaussian noise added to the phantom images. Furthermore, 3 D tracking of 3 D cardiac motions resulted in a 51 % decrease in in-plane tracking error as compared to 2 D tracking. The in-vivo function studies showed that maximum wall thickening was greatest in the lateral wall, and increased from both apex and base towards the mid-ventricular region. Regional deformation patterns are in agreement with previous studies on LV function...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic taint {{tracking}} is {{an information}} flow analysis {{that can be}} applied to many areas of testing. Phosphor is the first portable, accurate and performant dynamic taint tracking system for Java. While previous systems for performing general-purpose taint tracking in the JVM required specialized research JVMs, Phosphor works with standard off-the-shelf JVMs (such as Oracle's HotSpot and OpenJDK's IcedTea). Phosphor also differs from previous portable JVM taint tracking systems that were not general purpose (e. g. <b>tracked</b> only <b>tags</b> on Strings and no other type), in that it <b>tracks</b> <b>tags</b> on all variables. We have also made several enhancements to Phosphor, allowing it to <b>track</b> taint <b>tags</b> through control flow (in addition to data flow), as well as allowing it to track an arbitrary number of relationships between taint tags (rather than be limited to only 32 tags).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to monitor movements of bull trout that were provided passage above Albeni Falls Dam, Pend Oreille River. Electrofishing and angling were used to collect bull trout below the dam. Tissue samples were collected from each bull trout and sent to the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Abernathy Fish Technology Center Conservation Genetics Lab, Washington. The DNA extracted from tissue samples were compared to a catalog of bull trout population DNA from the Priest River drainage, Lake Pend Oreille tributaries, and the Clark Fork drainage to determine the most probable tributary of origin. A combined acoustic radio or radio tag was implanted in each fish prior to being transported and released above the dam. Bull trout relocated above the dam were able to volitionally migrate into their natal tributary, drop back downstream, or migrate upstream to the next dam. A combination of stationary radio receiving stations and tracking via aircraft, boat, and vehicle were used to monitor the movement of tagged fish to determine if the spawning tributary it selected matched the tributary assigned from the genetic analysis. Seven bull trout were captured during electrofishing surveys in 2008. Of these seven, four were tagged and relocated above the dam. Two were tagged and left below the dam as part of a study monitoring movements below the dam. One was immature and too small at the time of capture to implant a <b>tracking</b> <b>tag.</b> All four fish released above the dam passed by stationary receivers stations leading into Lake Pend Oreille and no fish dropped back below the dam. One of the radio tags was recovered in the tributary corresponding with the results of the genetic test. Another fish was located in the vicinity of its assigned tributary, which was impassable due to low water discharge at its mouth. Two fish have not been located since entering the lake. Of these fish, one was immature and not expected to enter its natal tributary in the fall of 2008. The other fish was large enough to be mature, but at the time of capture its sex was unable to be determined, indicating {{it may not have been}} mature at the time of capture.

The RFID technologies are getting considerable attentions not only academic research {{but also the}} applications of enterprise. One of most important issues of applications is the indoor position location. Many researchers have used varied technologies to perform the tracking of indoor position location. In this paper, we will purpose a new method using RFID tags to perform indoor position location tracking, too. This method uses Received Signal Strength (RSS) to collect signal strength from reference tags beforehand. Next, signal strength is used to set up Power Level areas of ranges by reference tags. And then, using signal strength from reference tags to match signal strength by <b>track</b> <b>tags.</b> Finally, when <b>track</b> <b>tags</b> is set up into indoor environments, it will find out the position of neighboring reference tags, and using arithmetic mean to calculate the location values.

40|$|Myocardial tagging using {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-known noninvasive method for studying regional heart dynamics. While it offers great potential for quantita-tive analysis {{of a variety of}} kinematic and kinetic parame-ters, its clinical use has so far been limited, mainly due to mediocre performance of existing <b>tag</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithms un-der poor imaging conditions. In this paper we propose a new approach to <b>tracking</b> of MRI <b>tag</b> intersections.
