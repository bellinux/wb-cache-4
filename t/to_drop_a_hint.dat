6000|$|... "I believe before {{many days}} have passed, aye, perhaps by to-morrow, I {{may be able}} <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to the lad that you are here in search of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Finally Blacky decided <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to Dusky the Black Duck. So {{the next}} morning he stopped for a call. [...] "Good morning," [...] said he, as Dusky swam in just in front of him. [...] "I hope you are feeling as fine as you look." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{ought to}} have {{told her he was}} engaged. He {{ought to have}} {{explained}} things to her. Perhaps even now he might be able <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> her <b>a</b> <b>hint.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She’s all right," [...] {{said the}} captain. He {{lowered his voice}} confidentially. [...] "It’s Peter’s sister, that’s the trouble. He’s afraid to let her know. All {{we can do is}} <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> little <b>hint</b> here and <b>a</b> little <b>hint</b> there, so as to prepare her for the news when it’s broken to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was on {{the point}} of telling you, earlier in our conversation, that I have made an {{appointment}} for you to see him at eleven o'clock to-night at the Embassy. You will go to him at that hour. Remember, you know nothing, you are waiting for instructions. Let speech remain with him alone. Be particularly careful not <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> him <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of your knowledge of what is coming. You will find him absolutely satisfied with the situation, absolutely content. Take care not to disturb him. He is a missioner of peace. So are you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the Professor's own idea," [...] Quest remarked grimly. [...] "I merely ventured <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> that Craig {{might not}} be quite so immaculate as he seemed, and I never saw a man so horrified in my life. He assured me that Craig was seldom out of his sight, that he hadn't {{a friend in the}} world nor a single vicious taste." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've come," [...] he said, [...] "from Emily de Reuss. No, don't {{interrupt}} me. I've a sort {{of message}} for you which isn't to be delivered as a message at all. I'm <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to you that she {{would like you to}} go and see her, that your refusal to do so would be a little ungracious, because she came and saw you when you were ill. I'm to let you think that she's feeling a little hurt at your behaviour, and finally to work you up into going. Do you see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no young man," [...] Mr. Bullsom said, [...] "whom I {{like so much}} {{or think}} so much of as Mr. Brooks. If I'd a son like that I'd be a proud man. And as we're here all alone, just the family, as it were, I'll go on to say this," [...] Mr. Bullsom continued, his right thumb finding {{its way to the}} armhole of his waistcoat. [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> at the first {{opportunity}} I get, quite casually, that whichever of you girls gets married first gets a cheque from me for one hundred thousand pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Duchesne, whose {{resolute}} {{lips were}} sealed upon {{the secrets of}} half Tuolumne County, interrupted him scornfully. [...] "I cannot answer for the woman--you must talk to her yourself. As for me, generally I keep my professional visits to myself; but--" [...] he laid his hand on Rand's arm--"if I find out you're putting on any airs to that poor creature, if, on my next visit, her lips or her pulse tell me you haven't been acting on the square <b>to</b> her, I'll <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>to</b> drunken old Nixon where his daughter is hidden. I reckon she could stand his brutality better than yours. Good-night!" ...|$|R

60|$|Lance turned red, for his father's {{tone was}} sarcastic, {{and he thought}} of Gerald; {{but he could not}} <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> against his brother.|$|R
60|$|Thus two agonizing days went by; agonizing {{they were}} to everybody. Madame la Marquise {{became more and more}} agitated, more and more hysterical as time went on, and the {{servants}} could not help but notice this, even though she made light of the whole affair, and desperate efforts to control herself. The heads of her household, the major-domo, the confidential maid, the chef de cuisine, did venture <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> or two as to the possibility of an accident or of foul play, and the desirability of consulting the police; but Madame would not hear a word of it; she became very angry at the suggestion, and declared that she was perfectly well aware of M. le Marquis's whereabouts, that he was well and would return home almost immediately.|$|E
50|$|The altar screen's templon {{was placed}} below these frescoes. The iconostasis {{is likely to}} {{originally}} include 2 icons only, which illustrate the Saviour and Our Lady. The altar was hidden behind a curtain fastened to the templon - the painter used the special art device <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> on that by painting the edges of a curtain.|$|E

60|$|Frank, indeed, {{afterwards}} {{learned that}} the officer <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>to</b> the men to make {{as little as possible}} of Julian's capture, and of the vigorous resistance he had made when first seized.|$|R
6000|$|... "Number one--police-station, please.--Hullo there! The {{inspector}} about?--That you, Inspector?--Sir Henry Cranston speaking. Could {{you just}} step round?--Good! Tell {{them to show}} you straight into the library. You might just <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>to</b> Mills about the lights, eh? Thank you." ...|$|R
6000|$|But I do {{not think}} he would have bolted from Sandgate until he had really got some more {{definite}} answer to the question, [...] "What better dreams?" [...] until he had surprised or forced some clearer illumination from the passive invalid, if Mrs. Bunting one morning had not very tactfully <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Make your {{arrangements}} accordingly, my good brother--I {{am quite}} fresh, and {{have brought a}} good stock of sermons; not knowing how much might remain {{to be done in}} the army. Corny," [...] in a half-whisper, [...] "you can let our new friends know that I will sup with them; and, harkee--just <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>to</b> them, that I am none of your puritans." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{though the}} matter for panegyric were as {{fruitful}} as {{the topics of}} satire, yet {{would it not be}} hard to find out a sufficient reason why the latter will be always better received than the first; for this being bestowed only upon one or a few persons at a time, is sure to raise envy, and consequently ill words, from the rest who have no share in the blessing. But satire, being levelled at all, is never resented for an offence by any, since every individual person makes bold to understand it of others, and very wisely removes his particular part of the burden upon the shoulders of the World, which are broad enough and able to bear it. To this purpose I have sometimes reflected upon the difference between Athens and England with respect to the point before us. In the Attic {56b} commonwealth it was the privilege and birthright of every citizen and poet to rail aloud and in public, or to expose upon the stage by name any person they pleased, though of the greatest figure, whether a Creon, an Hyperbolus, an Alcibiades, or a Demosthenes. But, on the other side, the least reflecting word let fall against the people in general was immediately caught up and revenged upon the authors, however considerable for their quality or their merits; whereas in England it is just the reverse of all this. Here you may securely display your utmost rhetoric against mankind {{in the face of the}} world; tell them that all are gone astray; that there is none that doeth good, no, not one; that we live in the very dregs of time; that knavery and atheism are epidemic as the pox; that honesty is fled with Astraea; with any other common-places equally new and eloquent, which are furnished by the splendida bills {56c}; and when you have done, the whole audience, far from being offended, shall return you thanks as a deliverer of precious and useful truths. Nay, further, it is but to venture your lungs, and you may preach in Covent Garden against foppery and fornication, and something else; against pride, and dissimulation, and bribery at Whitehall. You may expose rapine and injustice in the Inns-of-Court chapel, and in a City pulpit be as fierce as you please against avarice, hypocrisy, and extortion. It is but a ball bandied to and fro, and every man carries a racket about him to strike it from himself among the rest of the company. But, on the other side, whoever should mistake the nature of things so far as <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> but <b>a</b> single <b>hint</b> in public how such a one starved half the fleet, and half poisoned the rest; how such a one, from a true principle of love and honour, pays no debts but for wenches and play; how such a one runs out of his estate; how Paris, bribed by Juno and Venus, loath to offend either party, slept out the whole cause on the bench; or how such an orator makes long speeches in the Senate, with much thought, little sense, and to no purpose;--whoever, I say, should venture to be thus particular, must expect to be imprisoned for scandalum magnatum, to have challenges sent him, to be sued for defamation, and to be brought before the bar of the House.|$|R
25|$|The {{field of}} {{suspects}} has been further narrowed.

I tell you this, my friend. A Company like the Bekwando Company {{is very much like}} <b>a</b> woman's reputation, <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> or two, start just a bit of talk, and I tell you the flames'll soon do the work." ...|$|R
6000|$|Monsieur Thuran {{had heard}} <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of {{something}} which {{might result from}} this unexpected visit of Lord Tennington's yacht, {{and he wanted to}} be counted in on it.

50|$|Daniel Handler's {{introduction}} in Lemony Snicket's Unauthorized Autobiography continually {{introduces a}} new story about a page into the previous one, thus creating a confusing and inconsequential (but not incorrect or self-contradictory) storyline that is never finished, always dealing with the questions he is asked but never answering them. He <b>drops</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> {{in one of the}} layers that this is simply a technique to distract the reader from the fact that he never answers these questions.|$|R
6000|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 1737, it must have become common {{knowledge}} among Swift's friends in London, that he was preparing for publication his [...] "History of the Four Last Years of Queen Anne's Reign." [...] Possibly King may have <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of it; possibly Swift may have written to others for information and assistance. Be that as it may, on April 7th, 1737, the Earl of Oxford (son of Swift's old friend) wrote to Swift as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{said the}} sergeant. [...] "I have got that bundle of colored {{handkerchiefs}} you were selling; and I'll find {{the other man}} before you're a day older. It's a pity, seeing how you've behaved so well and haven't resisted us, that you won't <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of where those ropes and stakes are hid.

60|$|The {{next time}} he {{encountered}} her she had {{turned away from him}} angrily and contemptuously. And yet again, she came to him to beg his pardon, and she <b>dropped</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of <b>a</b> man somewhere, sometime,--she said not how,--who had left her with no desire to live. Her speech was frank, but incoherent, and all he gleaned from it was that the event, whatever it was, had happened years before. Also, he gleaned that she had loved the man.|$|R

60|$|In the Lords, I {{admire the}} Duke. The {{readiness}} {{with which he}} has adopted {{the air of a}} debater, shows the man of genius. There is a gruff, husky sort of a downright Montaignish naïveté about him, which is quaint, unusual, and tells. You plainly perceive that he is determined to be a civilian; and he is as offended if you <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> that he occasionally wears an uniform, as a servant on a holiday if you mention the word livery.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have it!" [...] he cried. [...] "Only {{yesterday}} Matai Shang let <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of his destination, {{telling me}} {{of a race}} of people unlike ourselves who dwell far to the north. They, he said, had always been known to the Holy Therns and were devout and faithful followers of the ancient cult.
