50|$|The term thirlage is a {{metathesis}} of Scots thrillage ‘thralldom’, {{derived from}} <b>thril</b> ‘thrall’, {{which was a}} body servant, retainer, or vassal to a noble or chief. The term is interchangeable with Scots carl (or English churl) and indicates subservience to the feudal superior and feudal laws; the situation being not that {{far removed from the}} conditions of slavery.|$|E
40|$|Thousands {{of large}} intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been {{identified}} in the mammalian genome, many of which have important roles in regulating a variety of biological processes. Here, we used a custom microarray to identify lincRNAs associated with activation of the innate immune response. A panel of 159 lincRNAs was found to be differentially expressed following innate activation of THP 1 macrophages. Among them, linc 1992 was shown to be expressed in many human tissues and was required for induction of TNFalpha expression. Linc 1992 bound specifically to heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL) and formed a functional linc 1992 -hnRNPL complex that regulated transcription of the TNFalpha gene by binding to its promoter. Transcriptome analysis revealed that linc 1992 was required for expression of many immune-response genes, including other cytokines and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators of TNFalpha expression, and that knockdown of linc 1992 caused dysregulation of these genes during innate activation of THP 1 macrophages. Therefore, we named linc 1992 <b>THRIL</b> (TNFalpha and hnRNPL related immunoregulatory LincRNA). Finally, <b>THRIL</b> expression was correlated with the severity of symptoms in patients with Kawasaki disease, an acute inflammatory disease of childhood. Collectively, our data provide evidence that lincRNAs and their binding proteins can regulate TNFalpha expression and may play important roles in the innate immune response and inflammatory diseases in humans...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesA {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), the most abundant noncoding RNA (ncRNA) species of the pervasively transcribed mammalain genome, have functional roles in the gene regulation of an array of cellular processes. These observations have since discredited the long standing central dogma formulated by Franscis Crick in 1958, which states that genetic output is entirely conducted by protein. Recent studies collectively indicate that lncRNAs play important functional roles in the transcriptional regulation of a wide array of cellular processes. In the last year alone, a handful of studies have identified lncRNAs linc-Cox 2, Lethe, PACER and <b>THRIL</b> as central players in host cell innate immune response against microbial infection. These discoveries and the vast numbers of uncharacterized lncRNAs identified by high-throughput nextgeneration transcriptome sequencing technologies, set a precedence for further investigation and characterization of lncRNAs in infection biology. Importantly, lncRNAs may serve as important diagnostic markers of infection as well as therapeutic targets. These aspect of lncRNAs field although extensively being explored in cancer research, have been neglected in infection biology, particularly in microbial infection. In this study, next-generation technologies were used to identify subtle vairations in transcriptional activity, with particular emphasis to lncRNA differential expression, and uncover their physiological relevance during Listeria monotocytogenes infection. To this end, an RNA-Seq dataset of Listeria-infected HeLa cells was subjected to several variations of data analysis lncRNA discovery pipelines. Potential lncRNA functioning was hypothesized using the Rinn & Chang "guilt by association" approach in which lncRNA functioning was hypothesized based on the known functions of tightly co-expressed protein coding mRNAs. "Guilty" lncRNAs were then knocked down in the HeLa cells using transcription activator-like nucleases (TALENs) to validate their candidacy as infection-regulating lncRNAs. Preliminary investigations conducted in this study have revealed potential Listeria infectionregulating lncRNA candidates. Furthermore, we explored the use of the physiologically relevant cellular model of iPSC-MDMs to validate identified lncRNA candidates. This work provides a framework for lncRNA discovery from RNA-Seq data by iterative and intergrative analysis...|$|E
