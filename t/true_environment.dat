50|$|Because {{the agent}} does not {{directly}} observe the environment's state, the agent must make decisions under uncertainty of the <b>true</b> <b>environment</b> state. However, by interacting with the environment and receiving observations, the agent may update its belief in the true state by updating the probability distribution of the current state. A consequence of this property is that the optimal behavior may often include information gathering actions that are taken purely because they improve the agent's estimate of the current state, thereby allowing it to make better decisions in the future.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{command-line}} processors (like DR-DOS , Multiuser DOS / (Terminal Message Process), JP Software 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT, Take Command and Windows CMD.EXE) {{support a}} type of pseudo-environment variables named system information variables (Novell / Caldera terminology) or internal variables (JP Software terminology), {{which can be used}} to retrieve various possibly dynamic, but read-only information about the running system in batch jobs. The returned values represent the status of the system in the moment these variables are queried; that is, reading them multiple times in a row may return different values even within the same command; querying them has no direct effect on the system. Since they are not stored in the environment, they are not listed by SET and do not exist for external programs to retrieve. If a <b>true</b> <b>environment</b> variable of the same name is defined, it takes precedence over the corresponding variable until the environment variable is deleted again. They are not case-sensitive.While almost all such variables are prefixed with an underscore ("") by 4DOS etc. by convention (f.e. [...] ), they are not under DR-DOS [...] (f.e. [...] ).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{extending the}} AIXI agent by using multiple (or even a compact class of) priors. This has {{the benefit of}} weakening the conditions on the <b>true</b> <b>environment</b> {{that we need to}} prove asymptotic optimality. Furthermore, it decreases the arbitrariness of picking the prior or reference machine. We connect this to removing symmetry between accepting and rejecting bets in the rationality axiomatization of AIXI and replacing it with optimism. Optimism is often used to encourage exploration in the more restrictive Markov Decision Process setting and it alleviates the problem that AIXI (with geometric discounting) stops exploring prematurely...|$|E

40|$|The {{main problem}} of atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) -based nanomanipulation {{is the lack of}} real-time visual feedback. Although this problem has been partially solved by virtual reality technology, the faulty display caused by random drift and modeling errors in the virtual reality interface are still limiting the efficiency of the AFM-based nanomanipulation. Random drift aroused from an uncontrolled manipulation environment generates a position error between the manipulation coordinate and the <b>true</b> <b>environment.</b> Modeling errors due to the uncertainties of the nanoenvironment often result in displaying a wrong position of the object. Since there is no feedback to check the validity of the display, the faulty display cannot be detected in real time and leads to a failed manipulation. In this paper, a real-time fault detection and correction (RFDC) method is proposed to solve these problems by using the AFM tip as an end effector as well as a force sensor during manipulation. Based on the interaction force measured from the AFM tip, the validity of the visual feedback is monitored in real time by the developed Kalman filter. Once the faulty display is detected, it can be corrected online through a quick local scan without interrupting manipulation. In this way, the visual feedback keeps consistent with the <b>true</b> <b>environment</b> changes during manipulation, which makes it possible for several operations to finish without an image scan in between. The theoretical study and the implementation of the RFDC method are elaborated. Experiments of manipulating nanomaterials including nanoparticles and nanorods have been carried out to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. © 2008 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

We define {{an optimal}} Bayesian knowledge-seeking agent, KL-KSA, {{designed}} for countable hypothesis classes of stochastic environ-ments and whose {{goal is to}} gather as much information about the un-known world as possible.

Among other properties, we show that KL-KSA learns the <b>true</b> <b>environment</b> {{in the sense that it}} learns to predict the consequences of actions it does not take. We show that it does not consider noise to be information and avoids taking actions leading to inescapable traps.

This componentwise {{sampling}} from {{a mixture}} distribution {{is known as}} hierarchical sampling and corresponds here to a generalized Thompson sampling procedure, where first a random belief is sampled and then the associated policy {{with respect to this}} belief is executed. If we assume now that each of the custom-built policies is optimal in their respective environments, we effectively select an action according to the probability that it is the optimal action, because we first sample the environment θ according to its posterior probability of being the <b>true</b> <b>environment</b> and then we perform the policy that is optimal in that environment. The question is how this problem formulation can be reconciled with a decision-theoretic problem statement that involves utilities. This is the topic of Section “Decision-making with limited resources”.|$|E
