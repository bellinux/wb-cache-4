5|$|The {{birth of}} <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution {{can be traced}} to the {{acceptance}} of James Smithson's legacy, willed to the United States in 1826.

In 1838, Smithson's legacy, which totaled more than $500,000, was delivered to the United States Mint and entered the Treasury. After eight years, in 1846, <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution was established.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as his work on the Scott Building, Alexander was asked to take up the {{challenge}} of completing <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Institution Building, the progress of which had bogged down under architect James Renwick, Jr. In August 1853, Alexander accepted, and by 1855, <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> Building was complete. During construction, Alexander slightly altered Renwick's original design by placing the Smithsonian's main lecture hall on the second floor. The change allowed for superior acoustics and a wider space than could be found on the first floor. To support the large lecture hall and the central core of the building, Alexander arranged for the installation of fireproof masonry-encased iron structural columns. These would prove their value on January 24, 1865, when a fire broke out on the roof above the lecture hall. The resulting blaze destroyed the hall and damaged {{much of the rest of}} the structure. Thanks to the fireproof columns, however, <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> building did not collapse.|$|E
