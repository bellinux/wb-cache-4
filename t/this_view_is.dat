5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> reinforced by the rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure {{in comparison to the}} immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|Eastern Orthodox theologians are {{generally}} {{critical of the}} theory that Gregory was influenced by neoplatonism. For example, Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos argues in Life After Death that Gregory opposed all philosophical (as opposed to theological) endeavour as tainted with worldliness. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> supported by Against Euthonius, where Gregory denounces Euthonius for placing {{the results of his}} systematic Aristotelean philosophy above the traditional teachings of the Church.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{often referred to as}} the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E

5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> debated {{over some}} {{seven or eight}} centuries by the {{followers}} of Prabhākara school within Mīmāṃsā, who argued that words do not directly designate meaning; any meaning that arises is because it is connected with other words (anvitābhidhāna, anvita = connected; abhidhāna = denotation). <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> influenced by the holistic arguments of Bhartṛhari's [...] theory.|$|R
5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we cannot speak about God, and {{proposed}} that <b>this</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{no different from the}} skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that the fictional model of the book's town, Winesburg, is based on Sherwood Anderson's boyhood memories of Clyde, Ohio, where Anderson lived {{between the ages of}} eight and nineteen (1884–1896), and not the actual town of Winesburg, Ohio located in the same state. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> supported by the similarities between the names and qualities of several Winesburg characters and Clyde's townspeople, in addition to mentions of specific geographic details of Clyde and the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriform origins {{are unclear}} and debated. American {{paleontologist}} Philip Gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved {{from one of}} several genera of European adapids based on similarities between the front lower teeth of adapids and the toothcomb of extant lemuriforms; however, <b>this</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> not strongly supported {{due to a lack}} of clear transitional fossils. Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.|$|E

5|$|Mari's revenge: According to Alfonso Archi and Maria Biga, the {{destruction}} happened approximately {{three or four}} years after the battle of Terqa. Archi and Biga say {{the destruction}} was caused by Mari in retaliation for its humiliating defeat at Terqa. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> supported by Mario Liverani. Archi says the Mariote king Isqi-Mari destroyed Ebla before ascending the throne of his city.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historian}}s opine that Hitler {{would have}} assumed Stefanie was of Jewish origin. American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred {{that she was}} Jewish, but saw no problems with this at the time. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> supported by German historian Anton Joachimsthaler, who stated in a BBC interview that Hitler must have assumed she was Jewish because of her Jewish surname. British singer-songwriter, author, journalist and paranormal researcher Paul Roland wrote in his book Nazi Women that it didn't make the slightest difference to Hitler whether she was Jewish or not.|$|E
5|$|The {{supposedly}} higher {{status of}} cavalry in the 4th century is also open to doubt. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{largely based on}} underestimating the importance of cavalry in the 2nd century. Cavalry always had higher status than infantry in the Principate: {{in the time of}} Domitian (r. 81–96), auxiliary cavalry was paid 20–40% more than auxiliary infantry.|$|E
50|$|An {{influential}} exponent of <b>this</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> liberal theologian Rudolf Bultmann. Oscar Cullmann was {{influential in}} popularizing it.|$|R
50|$|Beloff favoured mind-body dualism. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> {{criticized by}} Margaret Boden a Professor of {{cognitive}} science in a detailed review.|$|R

5|$|The {{traditional}} view of equites cohortales (the cavalry arm of cohortes equitatae), as expounded by G.L. Cheesman, {{was that}} they were just a mounted infantry with poor-quality horses. They would use their mounts simply to reach the battlefield and then would dismount to fight. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> today discredited. Although it is clear that equites cohortales did not match equites alares (ala cavalrymen) in quality (hence their lower pay), the evidence is that they fought as cavalry {{in the same way as}} the alares and often alongside them. Their armour and weapons were the same as for the alares.|$|E
5|$|Tungusic, Korean and Japonic {{languages}} but <b>this</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{now seen}} as obsolete. These languages have been grouped under the now discredited Altaic language family and {{contrasted with the}} Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area. Mongolian literature is well attested in written form from the 13th century but has earlier Mongolic precursors {{in the literature of}} the Khitan and other Xianbei peoples.|$|E
5|$|Candide {{contains}} thirty episodic chapters, {{which may}} be grouped into two main schemes: one consists of two divisions, separated by the protagonist's hiatus in El Dorado; the other consists of three parts, each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme, {{the first half of}} Candide constitutes the rising action and the last part the resolution. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure and picaresque novels, which tend to employ such a dramatic structure. By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may be grouped into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I–X are set in Europe, XI–XX are set in the Americas, and XXI–XXX are set in Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.|$|E

5|$|Cleansing asanas {{are those}} that when practiced for {{short periods of time}} help the body prevent or correct {{internal}} imbalances and tone inner organs; while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended periods of time. In both, a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi (blood vessels) through the Pranayama stage of yoga. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> shared by other yoga texts, such as in verse 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana (lotus position) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
5|$|Robert's {{treatment}} {{was used by}} William the Conqueror {{as one of the}} justifications for his invasion of England, the other being that Edward had named William his heir. Ian Walker, author of the most recent scholarly biography of Harold Godwinson, suggests that it was Robert, while in exile after the return of Godwin, who testified that King Edward had nominated Duke William to be Edward's heir. However, <b>this</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> contradicted by David Douglas, a historian and biographer of William the Conqueror, who believes that Robert merely relayed Edward's decision, probably while Robert {{was on his way to}} Rome to receive his pallium. Several medieval chroniclers, including the author of the Life of Saint Edward, felt that the blame for Edward and Godwin's conflict in 1051–1052 lay squarely with Robert; modern historians tend to see Robert as an ambitious man, with little political skill.|$|E

5|$|Since the country's {{reconstitution}} and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's {{administration has}} pulled down many monuments and plaques making {{reference to the}} dead of the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, {{as well as those}} memorialising Rhodesian servicemen killed during the Bush War. Many Zimbabweans see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that {{had more to do with}} the white community than the black majority. Southern Rhodesia's dead of the two World Wars today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the Polish–Prussian {{alliance}} was subject to a comprehensive study {{as early as the}} 1890s, when Polish historian Szymon Askenazy published his work on the subject (Przymierze polsko-pruskie, 1900) focusing on the diplomatic and international aspects. Askenazy argued that the alliance fell more due to inept Polish diplomacy than to the Prussian realpolitik agenda; <b>this</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> not supported by majority of historians, and noted by Jerzy Łojek (who admits that himself, at the same time declaring himself, in his Geneza i obalenie Konstytucji 3 maja (1986) as sharing Askenazy's minority viewpoint). The question of to what degree the alliance was realistic, and to what degree it represented a Prussian diplomatic feint which mislead Commonwealth politicians is still debated by modern historians. Similarly, as Piotr Wandycz has noted, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this alliance have been debated by the historians for over a century.|$|E
5|$|The king's {{disintegrating}} {{authority over}} his army was also {{manifested in the}} invasion of Frankish Burgundy which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale. The Lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following Mummolus' victory at Embrun. These attacks had lasting political consequences, souring the previously cordial Lombard-Frankish relations and {{opening the door to}} an alliance between the Empire and the Franks against the Lombards, a coalition agreed to by Guntram in about 571. Alboin is generally thought not to have been behind this invasion, but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by Gian Piero Bognetti is that Alboin may actually {{have been involved in the}} offensive on Guntram as part of an alliance with the Frankish king of Austrasia, Sigebert I. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> met with scepticism by scholars such as Chris Wickham.|$|E
