5|$|In 1836 the Royal Commission on Public Records {{was formed}} {{to look into the}} loss of the {{parliamentary}} records, and make recommendations on the preservation of future archives. Their published recommendations in 1837 led to <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Record</b> Act (1838), which set up <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Record</b> Office, initially based in Chancery Lane.|$|E
5|$|As Master of the Rolls he {{selected}} cases he {{felt to be}} particularly important to hear and, rather than having an American system (where judges had a rota for taking cases), assigned cases to those judges who had expertise in that particular area of law. In 1963 he chaired a committee investigating {{ways to reduce the}} archive of legal documents kept by <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Record</b> Office; by that point the files for civil cases of the High Court alone occupied four miles of shelving. The final report was presented to the Lord Chancellor on 16 May 1966, with the conclusion being that 'if our proposals are implemented <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Record</b> Office alone will be relieved of two hundred tons of records (occupying 15,000 feet of shelving)'. The Lord Chancellor took Denning's report to heart, and had the changes he recommended implemented immediately.|$|E
5|$|Following his assassination, many {{associates}} of Elagabalus {{were killed or}} deposed, including his lover Hierocles. His religious edicts were reversed and the stone of Elagabal {{was sent back to}} Emesa. Women were again barred from attending meetings of the Senate. The practice of damnatio memoriae—erasing from <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>record</b> a disgraced personage formerly of note—was systematically applied in his case.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} pamphlet A Tryal of Witches, {{taken from}} a contemporary report of the proceedings, erroneously dates the trial as March 1664, both {{on the front page}} and introduction.

5|$|As a Senator, Gravel became {{nationally known}} for his {{forceful}} but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam and for putting the Pentagon Papers into <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>record</b> in 1971 at some risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then {{played a crucial role}} in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a primary election in 1980.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) began {{research}} into {{the identity of the}} thirteen transports sunk as part of the Newport blockade of 1778, including Lord Sandwich.
