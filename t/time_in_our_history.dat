500|$|Kiku Day, {{writing in}} the Guardian said, [...] "We were a liberal and {{tolerant}} people until the 1990s, when we suddenly awoke to find {{that for the first}} <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>history</b> we had a significant minority group living among us. Confronted with the terrifying novelty of being a multicultural country, Denmark took a step not merely to the right but to the far right." [...] Professor Anders Linde-Laursen wrote that while the controversy [...] "should be understood as an expression of a growing Islamophobic tendency in Danish society," [...] this is just latest manifestation of a long-standing, and particularly deep conflict between traditionalists and agents of modernity in Denmark, and should not be seen as a major departure for Danish society.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-sponsored the Cooper–Church Amendments, {{aimed at}} curbing further {{escalation}} of the Vietnam War. Congressional approval {{of one of these}} amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand. Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended. When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, Cambodia's new leader, Lon Nol, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule. Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region. Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58–37. The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect. The amendment was nevertheless hailed by The Washington Post as [...] "the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>history</b> that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war." [...] The fight over the Cooper–Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper's health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength. In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2014, two Hanukkah {{celebrations}} {{were held}} at the White House. The White House commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne school in Israel and invited two of its students to join U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as they welcomed over 500 guests to the celebration.

Helpless beyond measure in all the duties of practical statesmanship, its members or their dependants have given proof of remarkable energy in the single department of peculation; and there, not content with the slow methods of the old-fashioned defaulter, who helped himself only to what there was, they have contrived to steal what there was going to be, and have peculated in advance by a kind of official post-obit. So thoroughly has the credit of the most solvent nation in the world been shaken, that an administration which still talks of paying a hundred millions for Cuba is unable to raise a loan of five millions for the current expenses of government.

On the other hand, the conquerors have to count on time and tact to weaken and finally obliterate the old feelings of nationality; the middle-aged of to-day will grow old and acquiescent in the changed state of things; the young generations will grow up never having known anything different.

5000|$|In Jerusalem, Benedict XVI paid a {{courtesy}} {{visit to the}} presidential residence, a gesture that was absent in Jordan and in the PA. In the newly designed presidential garden, both the host and the papal guest planted an olive tree. In his remarkable farewell speech, Pope Benedict raised the planting of the olive tree in Jerusalem {{to the rank of}} a symbolic act, saying:"Mr President, you and I planted an olive tree at your residence on the day that I arrived in Israel. The olive tree, as you know, is an image used by Saint Paul to describe the very close relations between Christians and Jews. Paul describes in his Letter to the Romans how the Church of the Gentiles is like a wild olive shoot, grafted onto the cultivated olive tree that is the People of the Covenant (cf. 11:17-24).

6000|$|... "Bare is back," [...] {{says the}} Norse proverb, [...] "without brother behind it"; and this is, by analogy, true of an {{elective}} magistracy. The hereditary ruler in any critical emergency may reckon on the inexhaustible resources of prestige, of sentiment, of superstition, of dependent interest, {{while the new}} man must slowly and painfully create all these out of the unwilling material around him, by superiority of character, by patient singleness of purpose, by sagacious presentiment of popular tendencies and instinctive sympathy with the national character. Mr. Lincoln's task was one of peculiar and exceptional difficulty. Long habit had accustomed the American people {{to the notion of}} a party in power, and of a President as its creature and organ, while the more vital fact, that the executive for the time being represents the abstract idea of government as a permanent principle superior to all party and all private interest, had gradually become unfamiliar. They had so long seen the public policy more or less directed by views of party, and often even of personal advantage, as to be ready to suspect the motives of a chief magistrate compelled, for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>history,</b> to feel himself the head and hand of a great nation, and to act upon the fundamental maxim, laid down by all publicists, that the first duty of a government is to defend and maintain its own existence. Accordingly, a powerful weapon seemed to be put {{into the hands of the}} opposition by the necessity under which the administration found itself of applying this old truth to new relations. Nor were the opposition his only nor his most dangerous opponents.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child," [...] said Mrs. Crowfield, [...] "our friend's {{picture is}} the truth painted with all its shadows and none of its lights. All the dangers he speaks of are real and great, but he omits the {{counterbalancing}} good. Let me speak now. There never has been a <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>history</b> when so many honest and just men held power in our land as now,--never a government before in which the public councils recognized with more respect the just and the right. There never was an instance of a powerful government showing more tenderness in the protection of a weak and defenseless race than ours has shown {{in the care of}} the freedmen hitherto. There never was a case in which the people of a country were more willing to give money and time and disinterested labor to raise and educate those who have thus been thrown on their care. Considering that we have had a great, harassing, and expensive war on our hands, I think the amount done by government and individuals for the freedmen unequaled in the history of nations; and I do not know why it should be predicted from this past fact that, in the future, both government and people are about to throw them to the lions, as Mr. Theophilus supposes. Let us wait, at least, and see. So long as government maintains a freedmen's bureau, administered by men of such high moral character, we must think, at all events, that there are strong indications in the right direction. Just think of the immense advance of public opinion within four years, and of the grand successive steps of this advance,--Emancipation in the District of Columbia, the Repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law, the General Emancipation Act, the Amendment of the Constitution. All these do not look as if the black were about to be ground to powder beneath the heel of the white. If the negroes are oppressed in the South, they can emigrate; no laws hold them; active, industrious laborers will soon find openings in any part of the Union." ...|$|E

This magnetic push-pull principle is used in this project to propel an automobile. This concept of mine aims at designing and fabricating a prototype model of a vehicle which runs on an alternative form of propulsion technique i. e., magnetic power. The vehicle was built, assembling of mechanical and electrical components, which perform the desired function of energy conversion from electrical to magnetic power and thus to mechanical energy of rotation. For this purpose various components were designed and were chosen accordingly to meet the requirements of the prototype vehicle and which could give satisfactory results regarding its performance parameters such as power, speed, overall efficiency, etc., which can make this concept a very feasible one. The performance of the prototype was done by various tests conducted.
