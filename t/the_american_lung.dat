In <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Lung</b> Association's 2011 report, 11 counties received failing grades for air quality, with Fairfax County having the worst in the state, due to automobile pollution.

40|$|Consuming {{forest and}} {{farmland}} {{at a rate}} of over 500 acres per week, the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan region has been characterized as the most rapidly spreading human settlement in history (Lacayo 1999, 45). While such growth has been credited with economic development and a high rate of single-family home ownership, rapid decentralization has also come at a substantial cost to the natural and human environments. Between the years of 1974 and 1988, the Atlanta region lost an alarming 20 percent of its forest canopy and experienced an increase in mean annual temperature of approximately two degrees Celsius (Cardelino and Chameides 1990, 13975). Coupled with increasing rates of per capita vehicle travel, the emergence of an intense regional heat island has exacerbated air quality in a region ranked behind only Southern California and Houston, Texas, for annual violations of the national ozone standard (USEPA 2001). 1 Once ranked among the country’s most livable cities, Atlanta is now classified {{as one of the top}} five heat stress cities nationally (Davies 2000, 13) and boasts one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in <b>the</b> country (<b>American</b> <b>Lung</b> Association 2001) ...|$|R
40|$|Paragonimiasis is an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} lung fluke of the genus Paragonimus. Within the United States, paragonimiasis has been commonly diagnosed in Southeast Asian immigrants infected with the Asian lung fluke Paragonimus westermani. Infections from <b>the</b> North <b>American</b> <b>lung</b> fluke, Paragonimus kellicotti, have been rare, although more infections have been seen in people in the Midwestern United States. A 29 -year-old male {{with a history of}} pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma presented with hemoptysis. A CT scan showed a mass in the left upper lung lobe. A biopsy showed eosinophils and parasite eggs, some with a recognizable operculum. Further investigation revealed that he takes canoe trips on rivers within Missouri and would eat crayfish caught from these rivers. A blood sample was confirmed positive for Paragonimiasis serologically at the Center for Disease Control. Paragonimus kellicotti is found in rivers within the Mississippi basin. Infection occurs by consuming uncooked or undercooked crawfish. Microscopic identification of parasite eggs has been the gold standard. Serologic tests have been developed to aid in the diagnosis. Patients typically present with fever and hemoptysis. Common CT findings include pleural effusion, a mass, and lymphadenopathy. Awareness of P. kellicotti is important to guide appropriate diagnostic testing and ensuring proper treatment...|$|R

This report provides medical information regarding damage to the lungs, heart, and nervous system of Americans caused by the burning of coal as fuel. It details how the air pollution caused by the plume of coal smokestack emissions is a cause of asthma, strokes, reduced intelligence, artery blockages, heart attacks, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, mercury poisoning, arterial occlusion, and lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|In a 2013 {{ranking of}} 277 {{metropolitan}} {{areas in the}} United States, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Lung</b> Association (ALA) ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas. The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only {{the worst of the}} region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh itself is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey. The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia, though both are outside the jurisdictional powers of local leadership.|$|E
