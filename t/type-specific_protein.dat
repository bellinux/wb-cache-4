40|$|Moloney leukemia virus (MoLV) induces lymphomas in BALB/c mice which either involve an {{immature}} thymic T-cell subpopulation or a splenic mature T-cell subpopulation. To investigate {{further the}} possible virological and immunological differences in these lymphomas, several lymphoma cell lines were derived. Although {{the majority of}} these cell lines expressed only the parental MoLV, one lymphoma cell line (5 F 4) was found which expressed only a defective virus. 5 F 4 virions lacked detectable reverse transcriptase activity and by immunoprecipitation lacked a serologically detectable reverse transcriptase. The lack of reverse transcriptase {{did not appear to be}} due to a deletion in the viral genome. Intracellularly 5 F 4 cells synthesized normal gag gene precursors but had little, if any, detectable Pr 180 gag-pol or an altered precursor. These results suggest that the defect of the 5 F 4 virus is associated with the inability to translate the appropriate precursor for reverse transcriptase. The possible origin of the detective 5 F 4 virus was also examined by competition radioimmunoassays. These results demonstrate that the <b>type-specific</b> <b>proteins,</b> gp 71 and p 12, are serologically identical to those of the endogenous ecotropic virus and distinct from the MoLV proteins.

40|$|In {{association}} with their mechanisms of self/non-self recognition (known as mating type systems), ciliates synthesize and constitutively secrete cell <b>type-specific</b> <b>proteins</b> into their extracellular medium. These proteins, designated as pheromones, have been isolated from species of Euplotes and {{shown to be}} members of families of structurally homologous molecules, all rich in intra-chain disulfide bonds and organized exclusively in helical conformation. Due to their similar architectures, they can interact with their membrane receptors in competition with one another and bind effectively to their cells of origin in autocrine fashion, or to other co-specific cells in paracrine fashion. In the former case, they promote the vegetative cell growth; in the latter, they induce cells to temporarily arrest their growth stage and shift to a mating (sexual) stage.

M-proteins extracted from whole cells of group A streptococci by treatment with hot HCl were neutralized, fractionated with ammonium sulfate, dialyzed, lyophilized, and then subjected to treatment with hot 60 % trichloroacetic acid. This was shown to produce an M-protein preparation, free of group A carbohydrate activity and extraneous antigens, in yields up to 10 -fold higher than previous methods in about one-fifth the time. These M-protein preparations were shown to: (i) have similar amino acid compositions to their respective <b>type-specific</b> <b>proteins</b> purified by diethylaminoethyl and O-(carboxymethyl) cellulose chromatography, (ii) react with their respective type-specific antisera in Ouchterlony diffusion, (iii) produce antisera in rabbits capable of promoting streptococcal long-chain formation in vitro, and (iv) give only one major band on polyacrylamide gel disk electrophoresis.

It seems probable that in some instances the chemical procedures used to isolate the type-specific substances tended to degrade the proteins, and thus render them less antigenic. The early experiments (1) with the <b>type-specific</b> <b>protein</b> M showed that although the sera produced by the injection of whole streptococci gave specific precipitin reactions with this partially purified extract, the injection of the protein solution itself failed to stimulate type-specific antibody production in rabbits or guinea pigs, as shown by the following negative tests: precipitin reaction, agglutination, passive protection in mice, passive and active anaphylaxis in guinea pigs...|$|E

Although the data did not reflect major chemical distinctiveness in the types examined, some interesting results evolved. Four important factors were observed to be shared by all M protein types examined: (i) glutamic acid was the most prevalent amino acid, (ii) amino acid molar ratios were similar, (iii) each had l-alanine as a single N-terminus, and (iv) purified peaks from the column chromatograms still showed heterogeneity while giving type-specific reactivity for multiple bands.

In cells growing suspended with their secreted pheromone, it was found that any interruption of this autocrine signaling loop was immediately followed by an effective enhancement of the basal intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) level. To establish a cause-effect relationship between these pheromone-induced variations in the cytoplasmic cAMP level and cell growth, cells ready to pass from a resting stage to a new growth cycle were conditioned either to incorporate a cAMP analog resistant to phosphodiesterase degradation, or to utilize cAMP released (following cell irradiation) from incorporated “caged” cAMP. Cells responded at every induced increase in their basal cAMP level by markedly decreasing their commitment to start a new growth cycle. It was deduced that the autocrine signaling of E. raikovi pheromones involves cAMP as inhibitor of its mitogenic activity...|$|E

40|$|Signaling {{through the}} AKT and ERK {{pathways}} controls cell proliferation. However, the integrated regulation of this multistep process, involving signal processing, cell growth and cell cycle progression, is poorly understood. Here, we study different hematopoietic cell types, in which AKT and ERK signaling is triggered by erythropoietin (Epo). Although these cell types share the molecular network topology for pro-proliferative Epo signaling, they exhibit distinct proliferative responses. Iterating quantitative experiments and mathematical modeling, we identify two molecular sources for cell type-specific proliferation. First, cell <b>type-specific</b> <b>protein</b> abundance patterns cause differential signal flow along the AKT and ERK pathways. Second, downstream regulators of both pathways have differential effects on proliferation, suggesting that protein synthesis is rate-limiting for faster cycling cells while slower cell cycles are controlled at the G 1 -S progression.

40|$|Many {{proteins}} and signaling pathways {{are present in}} most cell types and tissues and yet perform specialized functions. To elucidate mechanisms by which these ubiquitous pathways are modulated, we overlaid information about cross-cell line protein abundance and variability, and evolutionary conservation onto functional pathway components and topological layers in the pathway hierarchy. We found that the input (receptors) and the output (transcription factors) layers evolve more rapidly than proteins in the intermediary transmission layer. In contrast, protein expression variability decreases from the input to the output layer. We observed that the differences in protein variability between the input and transmission layer {{can be attributed to}} both the network position and the tendency of variable proteins to physically interact with constitutively expressed proteins. Differences in protein expression variability and conservation are also accompanied by the tendency of conserved and constitutively expressed proteins to acquire somatic mutations, while germline mutations tend to occur in cell <b>type-specific</b> <b>proteins.</b> Thus, conserved core proteins in the transmission layer could perform a fundamental role in most cell types and are therefore less tolerant to germline mutations. In summary, we propose that the core signal transmission machinery is largely modulated by a variable input layer through physical protein interactions. We hypothesize that the bow-tie organization of cellular signaling on the level of protein abundance variability contributes t...|$|R

The LAMP family is characterized by a conserved domain of 150 to 200 amino acids with two disulfide bonds. Results The crystal structure of the conserved domain of human DC-LAMP was solved. It is the first high-resolution structure of a heavily glycosylated lysosomal membrane protein. The structure represents a novel β-prism fold formed by two β-sheets bent by β-bulges and connected by a disulfide bond. Flexible loops and a hydrophobic pocket represent possible sites of molecular interaction. Computational models of the glycosylated luminal regions of LAMP- 1 and LAMP- 2 indicate that the proteins adopt a compact conformation in close proximity to the lysosomal membrane. The models correspond to the thickness of the lysosomal glycoprotein coat of only 5 to 12 nm, according to electron microscopy.

In this respect, the SATB 2 protein shows a selective pattern of expression and, within cells of epithelial lineages, SATB 2 expression is restricted to glandular cells lining the lower gastrointestinal tract. The expression of SATB 2 protein is primarily preserved in cancer cells of colorectal origin, indicating that SATB 2 could function as a clinically useful diagnostic marker to distinguish colorectal cancer (CRC) from other types of cancer. The aim {{of this study was to}} further explore and validate the specific expression pattern of SATB 2 as a clinical biomarker and to compare SATB 2 with the well-known cytokeratin 20 (CK 20). Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the extent of SATB 2 expression in tissue microarrays with tumors from 9 independent cohorts of patients with primary and metastatic CRCs (n= 1882). Our results show that SATB 2 is a sensitive and highly specific marker for CRC with distinct positivity in 85 % of all CRCs, and that SATB 2 and/or CK 20 was positive in 97 % of CRCs. In conclusion, the specific expression of SATB 2 in a large majority of CRCs suggests that SATB 2 can be used as an important complementary tool for the differential diagnosis of carcinoma of unknown primary origin...|$|E

This method of typing group A streptococci has now received extensive field trials in America and has been found effective in identifying most strains freshly isolated from acute streptococcal infections. Sometimes, however, strains are encountered which cannot be identified by this method. The work to be reported here resulted from an investigation of such cultures. It was noticed that, while no M substance could be detected in extracts from cultures grown at 37 ° C. for 18 hours, some of these strains, when grown at room temperature for the same period, yielded extracts in which the M antigen could be readily identified. This suggested the possibility that these strains, when grown in broth, elaborated a substance which destroyed the serological reactivity of the M antigen at 37 ° C. but failed to do so in 18 hours at room temperature.

Plasma levels of FSH, LH, progesterone, and estradiol- 17 D were detected by RIA. Prenatal hamster ovaries contained numerous mitotic oocytes and a few somatic cells. Only a fraction of somatic cells ex-pressed barely detectable TGF 32 activity. Plasma FSH levels were quite detectable on postnatal Day I and increased gradually to reach a peak on Day 25, whereas LH did not increase until Day 12 and reached a plateau by postnatal Day 20.

Antibody to the <b>type-specific</b> <b>protein,</b> M, found in matt variants, appears responsible for the M precipitin reaction, for type-specific protection, and for part of the type-specific agglutination of matt variants. Antibody to the T substance, which is the recently recognized part of the antigenic complex found to be present in both matt and glossy variants, seems to be solely responsible for type-specific agglutination of the glossy form and to play the chief rSle in type-specific agglutination of the matt form. This T antibody is apparently not involved in protection. Whether the M and T substances occur as separate chemical entities or in conjugation is not as yet determined. In members of the serological types so far studied, viz. types 1, 3, 6, and 14, the M antigen found in the matt variant and the T antigen found in both matt and glossy variants have always been characteristic of a single type. For example, type 1 matt strains always contained M and T substances characteristic of type 1, and type 1 glossy variants contained type 1 T antigen alone. None of these strains had an M substance characteristic of one type and a T substance characteristic of some other type. Such an anomaly has, however, been observed in the widely used strain, C 203.

A summary of the evidence for the protein nature of this substance follows: (a) It is precipiated by the usual protein precipitants such as, dilute alcohol, dilute acetic acid, and picric acid. (b) It contains 14 per cent protein nitrogen after considerable purification. (c) It is progressively destroyed by removal of the NH 2 group by treatment with nitrous acid. (d) It is completely and readily digested by trypsin and by pepsin. 2. "Purified" extracts react in relatively high dilution with homologous antibacterial sera, but do not precipitate most heterologous antibacterial sera or sera potent in non-type-specific antibodies for the group reactive nucleoprotein P or for the species-specific probable carbohydrate C. Attempts to immunize rabbits with the <b>type-specific</b> <b>protein</b> have been unsuccessful, with simple salt solution extracts of streptococci {{as well as with}} purified solutions.

The occurrence of another non-type-specific protein (Y) is suggested by occasional cross-reactions of purified M with certain antibacterial sera. Since it has not been separated from extracts containing the type-specific M, little is known of it either chemically or serologically.

As a consequence, the adult mnb brain exhibits a specific and marked size reduction of the optic lobes and central brain hemispheres.

Here we characterize a novel cell <b>type-specific</b> MAR-binding <b>protein,</b> SATB 2, which binds to the MARs of the endogenous immunoglobulin μ locus in pre-B cells and enhances gene expression. We found that SATB 2 differs from the closely related thymocyte-specific protein SATB 1 by modifications of two lysines with the small ubiquitive related modifier (SUMO), which are augmented specifically by the SUMO E 3 ligase PIAS 1. Mutations of the SUMO conjugation sites of SATB 2 enhance its activation potential and association with endogenous MARs in vivo, whereas N-terminal fusions with SUMO 1 or SUMO 3 decrease SATB 2 -mediated gene activation. Sumoylation is also involved in targeting SATB 2 to the nuclear periphery, raising the possibility that this reversible modification of a MAR-binding protein {{may contribute to the}} modulation of subnuclear DNA localization...|$|R
40|$|In {{preceding}} studies (1, 2) most virulent {{strains of}} Group A streptococci {{were found to}} form long chains when grown {{in the presence of}} homologous antiserum. This reaction appeared to depend upon the union of M protein and anti-M antibody at the cell surface with consequent inhibition of a metabolically active chain-splitting mechanism 0). In these initial studies, however, certain exceptional strains of virulent organisms were noted which failed to form long chains in some antisera. Furthermore, some convalescent human sera from patients infected with known serological types of Group A streptococci showed discrepancies between the bactericidal and the long chain tests for anti-M antibody. The present study indicates that the above discrepancies can be explained most often by quantitative relationships between M protein and anti-M antibody in the system. A minute excess of either antibody or antigen can be detected by chain lengthening or shortening, respectively. The use of this system for detecting subprecipitable amounts of <b>type-specific</b> M <b>protein</b> or anti-...|$|R
40|$|After {{disintegration}} by sonic vibrations {{the contents}} of the hemolytic streptococcus can be separated by differential centrifugation into three fractions: an insoluble residue, cytoplasmic particles, and a solution of proteins of smaller unit size. The residue (R) presumably comprises the cell walls of the bacteria and contains the <b>type-specific</b> M <b>protein.</b> The cytoplasmic particles (CP) contain some lipoid, the group-specific carbohydrate, and nucleoprotein of the ribose type. The supernate fraction (S) contains two components, presumably protein, at least one of which is part of a dissociable nucleoprotein of the desoxyribose type. Both CP and S precipitate and fix complement with antistreptococcal sera. Both give rise to antibodies on injection into rabbits. Both are of broad reactivity. CP and S can be shown to be serologically distinct by several means, including cross-absorption tests. On continued disintegration of the organism an inverse relation is noted between the yield of R and that of CP, whereas the yield of S is constant. A theory as to the structure of the streptococcal cell is offered in terms of the data presented...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} paper of this series, {{attention}} {{was directed to}} a bacteriolytic factor in phage lysates of Group C streptococci which lyses Groups A and C hemolytic streptococci and their isolated cell walls (1), an observation also reported by Maxted (2). Furthermore, {{it was found that}} lysis is accompanied by the release into solution of cell wall components with the specific serologic reactivity of <b>type-specific</b> M <b>protein</b> and group-specific C substance. These preliminary studies suggested that this phage-associated lysin might be a particularly useful agent for isolation and purification of M protein and C carbohydrate. M protein is ordinarily extracted from streptococcal cells by boiling at pH 2, and considerable purification of this type of material has been achieved (3). However, this extraction procedure has limitations, since the antigen is not quantitatively removed from the cell and, in addition, the drastic conditions required may result in some degradation. The cell wall-dissolving enzymes from Streptomyces albus have been usefully employed for the isolation of the C carbohydrate (4), but unfortunately this material contains a highly activ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>type-specific</b> M <b>protein</b> on {{the surface}} of group A streptococci renders the organisms {{resistant}} to the phagocytic defenses of the nonimmune host. In the immune host, antibodies which are opsonic for streptococci in vitro and protective against streptococcal challenge infections in vivo are directed toward the M protein antigen located {{on the surface}} of virulent organisms. Efforts to immunize humans against streptococcal infections have been frustrated by toxic reactions to almost any streptococcal product introduced into the human host (1). ~'Purifled" M protein vaccines have apparently contained tenaciously associated nontype-specific antigens which have accounted, at least in part, for the toxic effects of various M protein preparations (2, 3). Since conventional methods have failed to separate the nontype-specific antigens from the type-specific M antigen, various new methods for the extraction and purification of M protein have been tried by a number of different investigators (4 - 10). Fox and Wittner (4) used a treatment with caustic soda or hydroxylamine to extract a molecular species of M protein that was larger and apparently more immunogenic than the conventional HC 1 extracte...|$|R
40|$|Immunoassays {{based on}} the highly {{immunogenic}} transmembrane protein of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) (protein 21 c) are capable of detecting antibodies in all individuals infected with HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2. However, because of antigenic mimicry with other cellular and viral proteins, such assays also have {{a large proportion of}} false-positive reactions. We have recently identified an immunodominant epitope, designated GD 21 -I located within amino acids 361 to 404 of the transmembrane protein, that appears to eliminate such false positivity. This recombinant GD 21 -I protein was used in conjunction with additional recombinant HTLV <b>type-specific</b> <b>proteins</b> and a whole virus lysate to develop a modified Western blot (immunoblot) assay (HTLV WB 2. 4). The sensitivity and specificity of this assay were evaluated with 352 specimens whose infection status was determined by PCR assay for {{the presence or absence of}} HTLV- 1 / 2 proviral sequences. All HTLV- 1 -positive (n = 102) and HTLV- 2 -positive (n = 107) specimens reacted with GD 21 - 1 in the HTLV WB 2. 4 assay, yielding a test sensitivity of 100 %. Furthermore, all specimens derived from individuals infected with different viral subtypes of HTLV- 1 (Cosmopolitan, Japanese, and Melanesian) and HTLV- 2 (IIa 0, a 3, a 4, IIb 1, b 4, and b 5) reacted with GD 21 -I in the HTLV WB 2. 4 assay. More importantly, HTLV WB 2. 4 analysis of 81 PCR-negative specimens, all of which reacted to recombinant protein 21 e in the presence or absence of p 24 and p 19 reactivity in the standard WB assay, showed that only two specimens retained reactivity to GD 21 -I, yielding an improved test specificity for the transmembrane protein of 97. 5 %. None of 41 specimens with gag reactivity only or 21 HTLV-negative specimens demonstrated reactivity to GD 21 -I. In an analysis of additional specimens (n = 169) from different geographic areas for which PCR results were not available, a substantial increase in the specificity of GD 21 -I detection was demonstrated, with no effect on the sensitivity of GD 21 -I detection among specimens from seropositive donors. Thus, the highly sensitive, GD 21 -I-based HTLV WB 2. 4 assay eliminates the majority of false-positive transmembrane results, thereby increasing the specificity for serologic confirmation of HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 infections...|$|R
40|$|Two-photon imaging of {{the nervous}} system is now used {{extensively}} for visualizing brain dynamics and signal activities. To date, scientists have focused on the analysis either of gray matter forebrain struc-tures, such as the cortex and cerebellum, or they have investigated muscle innervation of peripheral nerves. The spinal cord is an ideal structure to use for imaging central nervous system white matter. The dorsal columns formed bymyelinated sensory axons are located directly at the surface of the spinal cord underneath the pia mater. This protocol describes a method for imaging neuronal fibers and neighboring glial cells in transgenic mice using cell <b>type-specific</b> fluorescent <b>protein</b> expression and two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (2 pLSM). Depending on how the mice are prepared, single imaging can be performed, or the spinal cord can be imaged repetitively over multiple days, with time for the mouse to recover between imaging sessions.
