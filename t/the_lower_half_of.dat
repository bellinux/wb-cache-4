5|$|The New York Times {{printed a}} display {{advertisement}} {{on its first}} page on January 6, 2009, breaking tradition at the paper. The advertisement, for CBS, was in color and ran the entire width of the page. The newspaper promised it would place first-page advertisements on only <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the page.|$|E
5|$|The painted {{surface is}} divided into {{quarters}} horizontally and sevenths vertically; this grid is used to organise the elaborate grouping of characters, and was a common device at the time.

He shifted around <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the North Island {{for the next}} several years, serving in a number of churches. He was also a chaplain in the Territorial Force. He retired from the priesthood in 1981 and died eight years later at the age of 73.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was a British success, {{and resulted in}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Continental Army to Harlem Heights, ceding control of New York City on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the island. However, General Washington established strong positions on Harlem Heights which he proved determined to defend in a fierce skirmish between the two armies the following day. General Howe, unwilling to risk a costly frontal attack, did not attempt to advance further up the island for another two months.|$|E
5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and {{the island}} of Cyprus. Here, a {{transition}} in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E

Claims have also been made that <b>the</b> buried <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body haunts the nearby churchyard.|$|R
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt {{mark the end}} of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also the source of the red-orange color of much <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Navajo Formation.|$|E
5|$|For Nordic skiing, Great Glen Trails {{offers a}} large, groomed trail system that also {{includes}} <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Auto Road. Several warming huts are scattered around the trail system, including scenic Great Angel Cabin, with views of the Great Gulf and surrounding peaks. Great Glen also permits biking on the trails during the summer, {{and is the only}} mountain bike facility in the notch. Another cross-country trail system exists in the town of Jackson, extending as far as the summit of Wildcat Mountain.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} professional tournament in the 1970s, the English entrants were either First Division or Second Division sides. (The First Division sides had generally finished in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table, while the Second Division sides were generally mid-table or better.) With {{the exception of}} Bari and Como in 1973, all Italian teams playing in the 1970s tournament had just competed in the previous Serie A season. The Italian clubs were often mid-table or higher finishers who had sometimes also qualified for the European competitions.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally kimonos {{were worn}} with hiyoku or {{floating}} linings. Hiyoku {{can be a}} second kimono worn beneath the first and give the traditional layered look to the kimono.

5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E
5|$|The Wagga Wagga City Flag was {{designed}} by Mr H Ellis Tomlinson, MA, FHS and adopted in 1965. Currently, Wagga Wagga City Council holds the copyright to Tomlinson's design. The flag is officially square. The upper quarter of it contains eight stalks of wheat positioned so as to form two capital letters W on a vert (green) field. The lower quarter of {{the upper half of}} the flag contains a wavy blue line on gold (yellow) representing the river winding through the wheat fields. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the flag contains the head of a ram positioned centrally on a vert (green) field.|$|E
5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (<b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as {{it was supposed to}} convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E
5000|$|The Flag of Split is the vexillologic {{symbol of}} the city of Split.

5|$|Unlike {{in other}} winter disciplines, Australia {{started in the}} upper half of the field in the moguls; Nicholas Cleaver and Adrian Costa placed 11th and 14th out of 47 {{competitors}} in 1992. Since then, the results deteriorated into <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the rankings, until 2006, when Canadian-born Dale Begg-Smith won gold and four Australians qualified for the 35-man competition. Manuela Berchtold, the only female Australian representative in 2006, came 14th out of 30 competitors. In 2010, Begg-Smith won silver, while two other moguls racers, one male and one female, were outside the top half and did not pass the first round.|$|E
5|$|Watchmen sits fourteenth in {{all time}} March {{openings}} as of April 2017, {{as well as}} the fourteenth largest opening for an R-rated film in North American history.

Past NY365, NY8 becomes signed as an east–west highway as it heads east to Higgins Bay, where it intersects the {{northern}} terminus of NY10. The route continues northeast to Speculator, where it meets NY30. NY30 turns east onto NY8, forming an overlap southeast to Wells, where NY8 separates from NY30 and heads to the northeast into Warren County.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the canal}} began in 1822, with James Hollinsworth as the {{engineer}} and John Easton as the senior surveyor. The Bristol and Taunton scheme had incorporated a high-level crossing of the River Parrett, but the shortened canal would now join the Parrett at Huntworth, where a basin was to be constructed. This change of route resulted in the Reverend Robert Gray obtaining an injunction, and work on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the canal stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 Act. By this time, the estimated cost had risen to £60,000. Below Durston, the canal was cut into the clay subsoil, the clay forming a naturally waterproof channel; but from Durston to Taunton the canal bed had to be puddled with clay to make it watertight, as the underlying ground was shale.|$|E
5|$|Frank Richards succeeded Watson as club {{secretary}} in 1911, {{and when the}} First World War broke out {{he took over the}} managerial reins as well. Under Richards Birmingham won the Second Division title in 1921 and signed players such as Joe Bradford, Johnny Crosbie and Dan Tremelling who did much to keep the club in the top flight through the 1920s. He also forgot to enter them in the 1922 FA Cup. Billy Beer and Bill Harvey kept them in the First Division, albeit in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table, before former Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton took charge in 1928. He led them to their first FA Cup final in 1931 and a top-half league finish the following year, but left when Chelsea made him an offer Birmingham were unable to match. Former Birmingham defender George Liddell kept them in the top tier until they were relegated in the last season completed before the Second World War, resigning in September 1939 when league football was suspended. His tenure of just over six years made him the club's longest-serving team manager.|$|E
5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with black hair held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist. Her usual fighting outfit, in which she has appeared {{in most of the}} games, is a type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless upper garment, baggy pants (slit at the sides), arm guards, and a mask that conceals <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> her face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages wrapped around her shins, ankles and instep. Ibuki's alternative, everyday costume is a blue-and-white Japanese schoolgirl uniform, or casual clothes—in the same color scheme—with a chain of miniature kunai knives and a fake tanuki tail, introduced in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords on her back.|$|E
