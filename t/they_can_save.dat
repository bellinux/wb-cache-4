5|$|Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is {{fearful that}} she will be cut from the hospital's staff, so she tries to get her name on the {{surgical}} board. Stevens and Hunt operate on Randy, and it is revealed that he is terminal. Lexie wants to donate her liver to Thatcher, but she is not a viable candidate, so she asks Meredith to do it, who subsequently agrees. Randy and his wife are dismayed with the outcome of the surgery, and Stevens proposes a plan to Hunt on how <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> him. Hunt agrees, but when the surgery suffers complications, the patient is pronounced dead, and Hunt condemns Stevens. Meredith undergoes the surgery, and it is a success for both her and Thatcher. Yang confronts Webber, and tells him that if a cardiothoracic surgeon is not hired, she should be cut from the program. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens sees the bear, and ultimately agrees that she and Karev need to relocate, out of the forest.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 24, 1911. The film had mixed reviews from critics. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer was thorough {{in the analysis of}} the film who did not like the production for its poor rehashed story and maudlin melodrama. The characters behavior was not logical and the series of events relied on deus ex machina elements, such as the Salvation Army suddenly decides to march down to the water's edge, then stop and remain in the background so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> his soul at the opportune moment. The reviewer did state that the acting was good. The Billboard review agreed that the story was implausible, but agreed that the skill of the actors made it more plausible than it otherwise would have been. The Morning Telegraph and Walton of The Moving Picture News would praise the film for its pathos and heart. The film is presumed lost because the film is not known to be held in any archive or by any collector.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Lucy and Tom are hungry, {{and begin}} to search for food. Tom gets trapped in a jar of honey, and a change of plans ensues: the Littles must rescue Henry before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> Tom. At first Grandpa resists, but {{consents}} since Henry has already met them.|$|E

25|$|When {{the drain}} {{discharge}} takes place entirely by gravity, {{both types of}} subsurface systems have much in common, except that the checked systems have control gates that can be opened and closed according to need. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> much irrigation water. A checked drainage system also reduces the discharge through the main drainage system, thereby reducing construction costs.|$|E

Later, he said: The Zionist regime is dying, and The criminals imagine that by holding {{celebrations}} (...) <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> the Zionist regime from death. Ahmadinejad {{also stated that}} They should know that regional nations hate this fake and criminal regime and if the smallest and briefest chance is given to regional nations they will destroy (it).|$|E
500|$|Jazeta {{has a life}} meter, which {{increases}} by one unit every time the player collects a medallion or finds a monk throughout the spheres; it decreases whenever he gets hit, and the game ends when it runs out. However, provided players have collected the [...] "Book of Revival", they can continue and restart the game wherever they have last obtained a password, even after the console has been shut off; passwords also allow players to resume play at a later time.

2500|$|One line of Protestant {{thinking}} {{views the}} pursuit of wealth as not only acceptable but as a religious calling or duty. [...] This perspective is generally ascribed to Calvinist and Puritan theologies, which view hard work and frugal lifestyles as spiritual acts in themselves. [...] John Wesley was a strong proponent of wealth creation. [...] However, to avoid wealth becoming an obstacle to faith, Wesley exhorted his audiences to [...] "earn all <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> <b>save</b> all they can and give away all they can." [...] Included among those who view wealth as an outcome of faith are modern-day preachers and authors who propound prosperity theology, teaching that God promises wealth and abundance to those who will believe in him and follow his laws.|$|E
2500|$|As for the spell, Regina told Mary Margaret {{that the}} spell did work, and as {{suspected}} by David, Arthur lied to them, believing {{that he did}} not want to contact Merlin. Regina believes the only other person who was chosen by Merlin was the Author, meaning Henry, who is brought in to help them, adding that Emma is still inside the darkness and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> her. Henry then places the mushroom in the cauldron and an image of Merlin appears, informing them that things are worse than he feared. Regina sourly notes they've gotten Merlin's [...] "voicemail". Merlin says the only way the Dark One can be defeated is by the Nimue, but before he can go any further, Merlin says the Dark One has found him already, and the message is cut short, leading the others to believe that Emma has done something to Merlin.|$|E
2500|$|This often {{involves}} programming different effects and signal processing {{for use on}} specific songs, to make the songs sound somewhat similar to the studio versions. To manage a show {{with a lot of}} effects changes, the mixing engineers for the show often choose to use a digital mixing console so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> and automatically recall these many settings in between each song. [...] This time is also used by the system technicians to get familiar with the specific combination of gear {{that is going to be}} used on the tour and how it acoustically responds during the show. [...] These technicians remain busy during the show, making sure the SR system is operating properly and that the system is tuned correctly, as the acoustic response of a room or venue will respond differently throughout the day depending on the temperature, humidity, and number of people in the room or space.|$|E

But what do they care for the commonweal, as long as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>save,</b> as they fancy, each man his own dirty soul for himself? However, thou art sworn now with a vengeance; go on with thy tale: and first, who art thou, and whence?" ...|$|E
60|$|The terror {{occasioned by}} {{threatening}} to take from him his forts can only be estimated by considering, that, agreeably to the religion and prejudices of Hindoos, the forts are the places in which their women are lodged, in which, according to their notions, their honor is deposited, and in which is lodged all the wealth that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> against an evil day to purchase off the vengeance of an enemy. These forts Mr. Hastings says he intended to take, because the Rajah could hold them for no other than rebellious and suspected purposes. Now I will show your Lordships {{that the man who}} has the horrible audacity to make this declaration did himself assign to the Rajah these very forts. He put him in possession of them, and, when there was a dispute about the Nabob's rights to them on the one side and the Company's on the other, did confirm them to this man. The paper shall be produced, that you may have before your eyes the gross contradictions into which his rapacity and acts of arbitrary power have betrayed him. Thank God, my Lords, men that are greatly guilty are never wise. I repeat it, men that are greatly guilty are never wise. In their defence of one crime they are sure to meet the ghost of some former defence, which, like the spectre in Virgil, drives them back. The prisoner at your bar, like the hero of the poet, when he attempts to make his escape by one evasion, is stopped by the appearance of some former contradictory averment. If he attempts to escape by one door, there his criminal allegations of one kind stop him; if he attempts to escape at another, the facts and allegations intended for some other wicked purpose stare him full in the face.|$|E

50|$|Consumers {{respond to}} higher drug prices by doing what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to <b>save</b> drug costs. The most {{commonly}} recommended {{course of action}} for consumers who seek to lower their drug costs {{is for them to}} tell their own doctor and pharmacist that they need to save money and then ask for advice. Doctors and pharmacists are professionals who know their fields and are the most likely source of information about options for reducing cost.|$|R
50|$|Units do {{not fight}} to the end. Critical damage causes humans and apemen to collapse, and {{vehicles}} and buildings to eject their occupants and catch fire. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> be <b>saved</b> if <b>they</b> are healed or repaired before they bleed out or explode, respectively. Units give lower priority to incapacitated targets, and the player's units will not attack them unless ordered to. Vehicles without drivers belong to no one, so hijacking is easy and even desirable.|$|R
