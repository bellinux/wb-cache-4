5|$|Since the {{fighting}} was very close, many of the Confederates were killed before <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to retreat. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry drove the rebels {{to the end of}} the field, only to be partially driven back by a second group of Confederate cavalrymen. After the regiment was reinforced by the rest of Capehart's brigade, the Confederates were driven from the area, and numerous battle flags were captured.|$|E
5|$|As {{the convoy}} of landing craft and other vessels ferried the Commandos across the English Channel; however, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{encounter}} with a German tanker escorted {{by a number of}} armed trawlers which proceeded to fire upon them. In the confusion that followed a number of the landing craft were damaged and forced to turn back, while others were reported as missing and believed sunk. As a result {{the decision was made to}} abandon the attack.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{qualified}} for the playoffs just twice between 1976 and 1984, {{a period in which}} the team used eight different head coaches, including former player Jerry Sloan. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to win the first pick of the 1979 NBA Draft, which would have allowed them to select future Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. However, they lost a coin flip to the Los Angeles Lakers, and went on to choose David Greenwood with the second pick. Although Greenwood averaged 12.6 points over six seasons with the Bulls, he never became an NBA All-Star.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{at their}} own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden Ore ran 11yards for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal put the Hokies into scoring position. After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was forced to use its timeouts to stop the clock and the first half from ending before <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to score. On a 3rd-and-7 from the Boston College 13-yard line, Glennon finally connected with wide receiver Josh Hyman, who crossed {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game, 1616.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert, {{producers}} Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, production designer Ken Adam {{and director}} of photography Freddie Young then went to Japan, spending three weeks searching for locations. SPECTRE's shore fortress headquarters was changed to an extinct volcano after the team learned that the Japanese do not build castles by the sea. The group was due {{to return to the}} UK on a BOAC Boeing 707 flight (BOAC Flight 911) on 5 March 1966, but cancelled after being told <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to watch a ninja demonstration. That flight crashed 25 minutes after takeoff, killing all on board. In Tokyo, the crew also found Hunt, who decided to go on holiday after having his request to direct declined. Hunt was invited to direct the second unit for You Only Live Twice and accepted the job.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra {{continued}} {{to perform at}} Caesars Palace in the late 1970s, and was performing there in January 1977 when his mother Dolly {{died in a plane}} crash on the way to see him. He cancelled two weeks of shows and spent time recovering from the shock in Barbados. In March, he performed in front of Princess Margaret at the Royal Albert Hall in London, raising money for the NSPCC. On March 14, he recorded with Nelson Riddle for the last time, recording the songs Linda, Sweet Loraine, and Barbara. The two men had a major falling out, and later patched up their differences in January 1985 at a dinner organized for Ronald Reagan, when Sinatra asked Riddle to make another album with him. Riddle was ill at the time, and died that October, before <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to record.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham and Rawnsley {{were soon}} ordered to staff positions. It was a {{compulsory}} order for fighter pilots {{even when the}} men considered themselves fit for operational duties. Before they departed Middle Wallop and 604, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to test the new 4-inch (10 cm) AI Mk. VIII radar which had a range {{of two or three}} miles (3–5 kilometres). The new radar was a radical improvement. All the information was displayed on a single tube. The ground echo was reduced but could still be seen on screen when flying low, but it did not interfere with the overall picture. Cunningham was to take over as director of all training units from Rory Chisholm who left 604 to become a staff officer at group headquarters. Rawnsley was due to take an instructors job at 62 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Usworth. Cunningham managed to persuade the CAS to deploy him to headquarters at No. 81 Group RAF, the training organisation for RAF Fighter Command. Rawnsley was also promoted to squadron leader and was awarded the DFC and Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). The pair remained grounded for six months until January 1943.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after the}} start of the second half of extra time Cardiff made their final substitution, {{replacing}} McNaughton with Darcy Blake. Two minutes later Kuyt made a run from deep in the Liverpool half, his initial shot was blocked, but the ball rebounded towards him. As the ball came back to him he shot again and the ball went past Heaton and into the Cardiff goal to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. Cardiff were struggling after the goal with a number of their players suffering from cramp. Nevertheless, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> in the 111th minute, when a Gunnarsson long throw was only half-cleared by Liverpool, but they were unable to convert the chance. Towards the end of the half Cardiff began to exert more pressure on Liverpool. Turner, who had been moved into the striker position won a corner for Cardiff, which was punched away by Reina for a throw-in. Cardiff won another from the throw, which found Kiss, whose shot was cleared off the line of the Liverpool goal by Kuyt for another corner. The subsequent corner was headed on by Gunnarsson to Turner, who beat Kuyt to the ball and put his shot past Reina into the Liverpool goal to level the score at 2–2. Turner was shown a yellow card for removing his shirt during the celebration of the goal. Liverpool won a corner with a minute remaining but they were unable to score and the referee brought extra time to an end with the scores level, resulting in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before this}} plan was announced, the next Bahá'ís to visit were Louis George Gregory and his wife, who could speak French, in January 1937. While there <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to meet Oswald Garrison Villard. Gregory {{indicated}} {{a community of}} at least 5 active members who had French translations of Some Answered Questions, and that the community was refused permission to hold public meetings.

25|$|Running unopposed in the June primary, Bilbray overcame {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from Democrat Nick Leibham in the November 2008 general election. With {{help from the}} DCCC and $1 million in donations, Leibham ran a string of TV attack ads against Bilbray. Democrats thought <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> at winning the district due to the hostile environment plaguing Republicans in general, and shifting demographics locally. Bilbray won, 50% to 46%, with 4% of the vote going to Libertarian candidate Wayne Dunlap.|$|E
25|$|The Abbasids {{wasted no}} time in {{continuing}} from Khorosan into Mesopotamia. In August 749, Umayyad commander Yazid ibn Umar al-Fazari attempted to meet the forces of al-Ta'i before they could reach Kufa. Not to be outdone, the Abbasids launched a nighttime raid on al-Fazari's forces before <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to prepare. During the raid, al-Ta'i himself was finally killed in battle. Despite the loss, al-Fazari was routed and fled with his forces to Wasit. The Siege of Wasit took place from that August until July 750. Although a respected military commander had been lost, {{a large portion of the}} Umayyad forces were essentially trapped inside Wasit and could be left in their virtual prison while more offensive military actions were made.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet strategy, on {{the other}} hand, was exactly the opposite. In order to prevent the Kwantung Army from {{withdrawing}} to relative safety, the Red Army leadership under Marshal A.M. Vasilevsky planned a lightning assault {{in the form of}} a pincer movement, designed to stun and envelop the Japanese before <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to escape. In charge of operations opposite the First Area Army in Eastern Manchuria was Marshal K.A. Meretskov's First Far Eastern Front, whose objectives were to seize Jilin and cut off Manchuria from Korea. These orders would take Meretskov's forces through the vital centers of Mutanchiang and Harbin. Leading the drive to Mutanchiang would be A.P. Beloborodov's 1st Red Banner Army and N.I. Krylov's Fifth Army, fully half of their parent Front's combat strength.|$|E
50|$|The G2-M DNA damage {{checkpoint}} is {{an important}} cell cycle checkpoint in eukaryotic organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. This checkpoint ensures that cells don't initiate mitosis before <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to repair damaged DNA after replication. Cells that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> defective G2-M checkpoint enter mitosis before repairing their DNA, leading to death after cell division.|$|R

25|$|Wong Kar-wai {{was born}} on 17 July 1958 in Shanghai, the {{youngest}} of three siblings. His father was a sailor {{and his mother was}} a housewife. By the time Wong was five years old, the seeds of the Cultural Revolution were beginning to take effect in China and his parents decided to relocate to British-ruled Hong Kong. The two older children were meant to join them later, but the borders closed before <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> and Wong did not see his brother or sister again for ten years. In Hong Kong, the family settled in the Tsim Sha Tsui district, and his father got work managing a night club. Being an only child in a new city, and speaking only Mandarin, Wong has said he felt isolated during his childhood; he struggled to learn Cantonese and English, only becoming fluent in these new languages when he was a teenager.|$|E
25|$|The {{passenger}} pigeon was hunted in Northern Michigan {{as a source}} of food, but by the 1870s, a combination of increased population and economic scarcity led to over-hunting and eventual extinction. The massive flocks of {{passenger pigeon}}s stopped darkening the skies of Northern Michigan, especially after the last large scale nestings and subsequent slaughters of millions of birds in 1874 and 1878. By this time, large nestings only took place in the north, around the Great Lakes. The last large nesting was in Petoskey, Michigan, in 1878 (following one in Pennsylvania a few days earlier), where 50,000 birds were killed each day for nearly five months. The surviving adults attempted a second nesting at new sites, but were killed by professional hunters before <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to raise any young. Scattered nestings were reported into the 1880s, but the birds were now weary, and commonly abandoned their nests if persecuted.|$|E
25|$|In 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant signed Butler's legislation. The Ku Klux Klan Act and the Enforcement Act of 1870 {{were used}} by the federal {{government}} to enforce the civil rights provisions for individuals under the constitution. The Klan refused to voluntarily dissolve after the 1871 Klan Act, so President Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus and stationed Federal troops in nine South Carolina counties. The Klansmen were apprehended and prosecuted in federal court. Judges Hugh Lennox Bond and George S. Bryan presided over the trial of KKK members in Columbia, South Carolina during December 1871. The defendants were given from three months to five years of incarceration with fines. More blacks served on juries in Federal court than on local or state juries, so <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to participate in the process. Hundreds of Klan members were fined or imprisoned during the crackdown.|$|E
50|$|Negative {{luminescence}} is most readily {{observed in}} semiconductors. Incoming infrared radiation is {{absorbed in the}} material by {{the creation of an}} electron-hole pair. An electric field is used to remove the electrons and holes from the region before <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to recombine and re-emit thermal radiation. This effect occurs most efficiently in regions of low charge carrier density.|$|R
50|$|Notice {{though that}} this is not the {{solution}} in a conventional game-theoretical analysis. Twenty game-theoretically rational players would each send in a telegram and therefore receive nothing. This is because sending the telegram is the dominant strategy; if an individual player sends <b>a</b> telegram <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of receiving money, but if they send no telegram they cannot get anything.|$|R
50|$|Because brain {{injuries}} can be life-threatening, even people with apparently slight injuries, with no noticeable signs or complaints, require close observation; <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for severe symptoms later on.
