5|$|Although {{tellurium}} {{is found}} with gold {{more often than}} in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural <b>tellurite</b> and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.|$|E

5|$|Tellurium has {{no known}} {{biological}} function, although fungi can incorporate {{it in place}} of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro-cysteine and telluro-methionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds. Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, take up <b>tellurite</b> and reduce it to elemental tellurium, which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells. In yeast, this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway. Tellurium accumulation seems to account for {{a major part of}} the toxicity effects. Many organisms also metabolize tellurium partly to form dimethyl telluride, although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species. Dimethyl telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium is a silvery-white shiny solid. It has a {{density of}} 6.24 g/cm3, is brittle, {{and is the}} softest of the {{commonly}} recognised metalloids, being marginally harder than sulfur. Large pieces of tellurium are stable in air. The finely powdered form is oxidized by air {{in the presence of}} moisture. Tellurium reacts with boiling water, or when freshly precipitated even at 50°C, to give the dioxide and hydrogen: Te + 2 H2O → TeO2 + 2 H2. It reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the sulfoxide TeSO3 or tellurous acid H2TeO3, the basic nitrate (Te2O4H)+(NO3)−, or the oxide sulfate Te2O3(SO4). It dissolves in boiling alkalis, to give the <b>tellurite</b> and telluride: 3 Te + 6 KOH = K2TeO3 + 2 K2Te + 3 H2O, a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids can {{be obtained}} by chemical reduction of either their oxides or their sulfides. Simpler or more complex extraction methods may be employed depending on the starting form and economic factors. Boron is routinely obtained by reducing the trioxide with magnesium: B2O3 + 3 Mg → 2 B + 3MgO; after secondary processing the resulting brown powder has a purity of up to 97%. Boron of higher purity (> 99%) is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds, such as BCl3 or BBr3, either in a hydrogen atmosphere (2 BX3 + 3 H2 → 2 B + 6 HX) or to the point of thermal decomposition. Silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen: SiO2 + C → Si + CO2; GeO2 + 2 H2 → Ge + 2 H2O. Arsenic is isolated from its pyrite (FeAsS) or arsenical pyrite (FeAs2) by heating; alternatively, it {{can be obtained}} from its oxide by reduction with carbon: 2 As2O3 + 3 C → 2 As + 3 CO2. Antimony is derived from its sulfide by reduction with iron: Sb2S3 → 2 Sb + 3 FeS. Tellurium is prepared from its oxide by dissolving it in aqueous NaOH, yielding <b>tellurite,</b> then by electrolytic reduction: TeO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2TeO3 + H2O; Na2TeO3 + H2O → Te + 2 NaOH + O2. Another option is reduction of the oxide by roasting with carbon: TeO2 + C → Te + CO2.|$|E

40|$|Organically {{templated}} vanadium selenites and <b>tellurites</b> are microporous functional {{materials that}} exhibit technologically advantageous properties. Understanding the formation principles governing {{the synthesis of}} these compounds is useful for achieving some sort of synthetic control. An exploration of the hydrothermal synthesis of the VOSO 4 / SeO 2 / 2 -methylpiperazine system resulted {{in the formation of}} three distinct organically templated vanadium selenites: [2 -mpipH 2][(VO) 3 (SeO 3) 2 (HSeO 3) 4] (1), [2 -mpipH 2][(VO) (SeO 3) (HSeO 3) ] (2) and [2 -mpipH 2][VO(SeO 3) 2] (3). The relative stability of each compound is dictated by the initial pH and reactant concentration of the solutions from which these compounds were synthesized. Partial resolution of racemic 2 -methylpiperazine is observed in [2 -mpipH 2][(VO) 3 (SeO 3) 2 (HSeO 3) 4].

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focus on}} the synthesis, phase studies and physicochemical properties of novel thorium and uranium compounds with the Group VI (S, Se, Te, Cr, Mo, W) of the Periodic Table. All the studied compounds are listed in Table 2. 2 from the page 15. I subdivided all the newly synthesized compounds into several chapters according to their structural and topological differences. First, for thorium molybdates and tungstates, almost all of these compounds are based on corner-sharing of ThOx (x = 6, 8 and 9) and MoO 4 or WOx (x = 4, 5, 6) polyhedra. Interestingly, all these compounds {{can be seen as}} derived from a pure thorium molybdate compound (ThMo 2 O 8) which was isolated from high-temperature solid-state synthesis method. Therefore, the polymorphs of this most basic ThMo 2 O 8 compound is firstly introduced (see Chapter 3. 1 from page 18). The thermodynamic, electronic and vibrational properties of all investigated ThMo 2 O 8 polymorphs were studied using ab initio calculations. Then, two subfamilies of thorium molybdates, that is, rubidium thorium molybdate and cesium thorium molybdate and their thermal and vibrational behaviors were discussed in details in Chapter 4. 1 from page 37 and Chapter 4. 2 from page 50, respectively. Moreover, some new insights about the complexity of thorium tungstates were also discussed (Chapter 4. 3 from page 59). Some novel thorium molybdate and chromate compounds synthesized from aqueous condition are discussed in Chapter 5 from page 71. In the Chapter 8. 2. 4, the stereochemistry for thorium and uranium compounds are introduced, especially thorium selinites and uranyl <b>tellurites</b> (see Chapter 6. 1 from page 82), thorium <b>tellurites</b> (Chapter 6. 2 from page 93), and uranyl <b>tellurites</b> (Chapter 6. 3 from page 99 for sodium uranyl tellurium and Chapter 6. 4 from page 110 for potassium uranyl tellurium, respectively). In the actinide tellurium systems, additional MoO 3 /WO 3 were also used as the flux for the high-temperature synthesis method to decrease the crystal growth temperature. This also gives an opportunity to allow Te 4 + anion to interact with anion of Mo 6 + or W 6 +, leading to a more complex mixed oxo-anion system, which is reported in Chapter 7 from page 122. Last, some attractive features of structural chemistry of actinides, such as cation-cation interaction of uranyl groups(Chapter 8. 1 from page 136), and the first thorium compounds containing alkaline-earth or rare earth metals (Chapter 8. 2 from page 145) are discussed in Chapter 8...|$|R

Th 2 Te 3 O 11 is the first instance of a mixed-valent oxo-tellurium compound, and at the same time, Te exhibits three different coordination environments (TeIVO 3, TeIVO 4, and TeVIO 6) within a single structure.
