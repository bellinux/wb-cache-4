5|$|The fight {{started with}} the three battalions of the Spanish first line {{advancing}} upon the Dutch camp, each one {{trying to be the}} first to laid its bridge over the moat. Haultpenne's Wallons, headed by Sergeant-Major Camille Sacchino, moved up to Deurne, crossing the Schijn river at the small village of Immerseel. Vald√©s' Germans advanced frontally to Borgerhout across the Borsbeek road, and Figueroa's Spaniards took the Voetweg road to assault the Dutch camp from the south. While <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> musketeers from the Spanish and German units exchanged fire with the Dutch troops covered by the rampart, Sacchino's Walloons drove the defenders of Deurne behind the Groot Schijn stream and took its bridge. De la Noue sent reinforcements there to content the assault, but they arrived too late to prevent the Walloons from laying their bridge over the moat and began to climb the rampart, starting a close combat with the Dutch troops. In the meantime, the Spanish and German troops, supported by two or three artillery pieces, breached the rampart, crossed the moat and also started to come inside Borgerhout, where De la Noue and Norreys' men reorganized and stood on the barricaded streets.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E
25|$|Idiot mittens are two mittens {{connected}} by a length of yarn, string or lace, threaded through <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> a coat. This arrangement is typically provided for small children to prevent the mittens becoming discarded and lost; when removed, the mittens simply dangle from the string just beyond the cuff of the sleeve.|$|E

It is worn by doctors at meetings of Convocation or Congregation by those presenting candidates for degrees.|$|E
25|$|From 1829, to 1839, Metropolitan Police {{officers}} wore blue swallow tail coats {{with high}} collars to counter garroting. This was worn with white trousers in summer, and a cane-reinforced top hat, {{which could be}} used as a step to climb or see over walls. <b>The</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> the dark blue coats originally had a pattern of white bars, roughly 6mm wide by 50mm high, set roughly 6mm apart. This immediately distinguished them from naval or maritime personnel. In the early years of the Metropolitan Police, equipment was little more than a rattle to call for assistance, and a wooden truncheon. As the years progressed, the rattle was replaced with the whistle, swords were removed from service, and flintlock pistols were removed in favour of revolvers.|$|E
25|$|The dinner dress uniforms of the United States Navy are {{the most}} formal and have the most variations. For officers, there are Dinner Dress Blue and Dinner Dress White, Dinner Dress Blue Jacket and Dinner Dress White Jacket, and Formal Dress. Although {{trousers}} are authorized, women frequently wear the appropriate color skirt. Dinner Dress Blue and White are identical to their Service Dress versions, but worn with miniature medals and badges with no ribbons. Dinner Dress Blue is additionally worn with a dress shirt and black bow tie. These variants are commonly worn by many junior officers and enlisted personnel as substitutes for the more formal Dinner Dress Jacket variant which is only prescribable for Lieutenant Commander and above and optional for Lieutenant and below. The Dinner Dress Blue/White Jacket uniforms feature a short jacket with three buttons on either side, worn open with a black bow tie and cummerbund (women substitute a neck tab for the bow tie). Male officers show rank stripes on <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> the jacket for the blue version and on shoulder boards for the white version, while women officers only wear sleeve stripes. This uniform is equivalent to black tie in usage.|$|E

500|$|Bertin is {{presented}} as strong, energetic and warm-hearted. His hair is grey verging on white, his fingers spread across his knees. Bertin's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as [...] "crab-like claws... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> his coat." [...] The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket, black trousers and brown satin waistcoat, with a starched white shirt and cravat revealing his open neck. He wears a gold watch {{and a pair of}} glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum, his [...] "nearly ferocious presence" [...] is accentuated by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, stubby fingers rest on his thighs, barely protruding from <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> his jacket, while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow starched white collar.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent {{releases}} (including the singles [...] "How Does It Feel?

They anonymously produced 20,000 copies of a flexi-disc with a live recording of [...] "Sheep Farming...", copies of which were randomly inserted into <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> other records by sympathetic workers at the Rough Trade Records distribution warehouse to spread their views to those who might not otherwise hear them.|$|E

He held an elegant riding crop whether mounted or walking. His moustache drooped gracefully beyond {{the corners of his}} mouth and then turned upward at the ends. His hair was the talk of the Army: [...] "long ringlets flowed loosely over his shoulders, trimmed and highly perfumed, his beard likewise was curling and giving up the scent of Araby." ...|$|E

500|$|Whereas most Hollywood {{productions}} {{of the day}} took {{little more than a}} month to shoot, Wings took approximately nine months to complete in total. Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, [...] "a trip home or a trip to the hospital". According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which Selznick replied, [...] "Just keep your mouth shut. You've got 'em where it hurts." [...] The cast and crew {{had a lot of time}} on their hands between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, [...] "San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook". He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months and by the time they left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he wasn't impressed, considering the drama in it to be [...] "sudsy", although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the costumes which were made for the film by Paramount designer Travis Banton, and slit the necklines and cut off <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> his clothing, much to the chagrin of Banton.|$|E
500|$|Alexander Wang {{designed}} a [...] "bondage body suit" [...] worn by Beyonc√© during the show, {{as well as}} multiple pieces by Nicola Formichetti for Diesel. One of these included the previously mentioned denim outfit, which was [...] "made from the company's patented Jogg Jean material, accented with hand-applied hardware and studwork, Swarovski crystal elements and black leather accessories", worn {{for the performance of}} [...] "Run the World (Girls)". Formichetti commented on the outfit, saying [...] "Every classic cops and robbers story blurs the lines between the good and bad, we wanted Beyonc√©'s to be both. Her look is one part police officer and two parts jailbait." [...] Another piece designed by Diesel was an outfit consisting of jean-shorts and a leather jacket embroiled with the word [...] "Texas". Biker gangs that developed in the United States after World War II served as an inspiration for the outfit; Beyonc√©'s was meant as a tribute to her hometown and a reminder of her roots. It took 4‚Äì5 hours to add the word Texas to the leather jacket. The bondage bodysuit was described as [...] "a riff off of an urban bomber hoodie jacket that was cropped to expose a bondage bodysuit underneath that has graphic cutouts. When worn up, the oversized hood covers the face, adding an incognito element reminiscent of the On The Run theme." [...] It also contained snakeskin seamed into <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> the outfit. One of the more controversial pieces worn by Beyonc√© during the On the Run Tour was a black, thong leotard that [...] "put her bare rear end on display in a kind of cage-like cutout". Erica Schwiegershausen of The Cut blog wrote that the number was a [...] "somewhat disorienting look". During the performance of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", Beyonc√© revisited a leotard from the song's music video in a black and gold lace bodysuit designed by Michael Costello who wanted [...] "Beyonc√© to feel beautiful, strong, super sexy and ventilated" [...] with the outfit. Lebanese designer Elie Saab created a bridal-themed, white long-sleeve lace-embellished jumpsuit for Beyonc√© for the performances of [...] "Resentment" [...] and [...] "Love On Top" [...] which was part of his Pre-Fall 2014 collection.|$|E

An account by John Aubrey, written in the early 1670s (but possibly based on observations made {{a decade or two}} earlier), describes Shakespeare as wearing [...] "a Tawny satten doublet I thinke pinked and over that a black gowne like an Under-gratuates at Oxford, scilicet <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> the gowne doe not cover the armes, but hang loose behind".|$|E
