5|$|<b>The</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> {{starts to}} speak, {{not at the}} lectern, but walking around it on cat's paws, he is simply enchanting. In the Middle Ages, this man would have been sent into exile. He is not only eloquent, he also keeps his {{listeners}} spellbound by his sparking personality, reflected in his small, dark eyes.|$|E
5|$|The music video, like {{previous}} X Factor winners singles, is very simple, with Jackson {{singing the}} song {{in front of a}} large projection, with swooping shots of various landscapes behind him. It also features several clips from his time in The X Factor, from his first audition to <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> was announced the winner and performed his single to close the series. Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, Dannii Minogue, Louis Walsh, Dermot O'Leary and runner-up Rhydian Roberts all feature within the clips.|$|E
5|$|In the Market Square {{stands the}} Gothic St. Mary's Basilica (Kościół Mariacki). It was rebuilt in the 14th-century and {{features}} the famous wooden altar (Altarpiece of Veit Stoss), the largest Gothic altarpiece in the world, carved by Veit Stoss. From the church's main tower a trumpet call (hejnał mariacki), is sounded every hour. The melody, {{which used to}} announce the opening and closing of city gates, ends unexpectedly in midstream. According to legend, the tune was played during the 13th-century Tatar invasion by a guard warning citizens against the attack. He was shot by an archer of the invading Tatar forces whilst playing, the bugle call breaking off at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> died. The story was recounted in a book published in the late-1920s called The Trumpeter of Krakow, by Eric P. Kelly, which won a Newbery Award.|$|E

5|$|Jacob is {{approached}} by a distressed Michael Newman, the man who treated his wound in a medevac helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Paul’s burning car. Newman tells a story of having been a chemist with the Army’s chemical warfare division in Saigon. He designed “the Ladder”, a drug that massively increased aggression, taking people straight to their most primal urges. To test its effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob’s unit – causing them to turn on {{each other in a}} homicidal frenzy. The revelation causes Jacob to fully remember <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> was attacked in Vietnam, where it is revealed that a fellow American soldier bayoneted him.|$|E
5|$|More {{sympathetic}} authors {{point out}} complex situations that Rommel had to face. Brian Hanley, from USNI's Editorial Board of Directors, comments that Rommel was beaten <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> arrived in Africa, considering the Allied troops outnumbered the Afrika Korps and they worked under {{a much more}} straightforward chain of command, while orders sent from Berlin to North Africa were rarely kept confidential. Hanley sees Rommel turning German and Italian military authorities against each other as turning liabilities into advantages and that he repeatedly created operational miracles that made a strategic investment in the Africa theatre attractive in 1942. Also, according to Hanley, if Rommel stood still, his enemy's strength would accumulate while his own, depending on an uncertain supply line, would diminish, thus he needed the British stocks of supply {{to deal with his}} logistical problems.|$|E
5|$|The Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty 2007 {{comic book}} {{adaptation}} by Alex Garner retells Raiden's {{role in the}} series, with few changes made to the story. His relationship with Solidus is explored when he remembers his past; when about to be killed by Solidus, Raiden is saved by Snake. The game's novelization by Raymond Benson provides minor modifications to Raiden's history, except for <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> receives Olga's sword, resulting in a change to his battle psyche. When Raiden kills Solidus he cuts the rope on Federal Hall National Memorial's flagpole, causing an American flag to fall over his enemy's body. This scene was deleted from the original game due to the September 11 attacks.|$|E

For his portrayal of Nidge he has won the Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Television award at the 2012 IFTA Awards, and the Best Actor for Television award at the 2013 IFTA Awards. On {{playing the role of}} Nidge he said [...] "One of the joys of playing the part is he’s a different man in all four series, he’s always changing and he’s incredibly difficult to pinpoint, people are drawn to him because of his humour, <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>he</b> has with his children and <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>he</b> has with his own conscience." ...|$|R

25|$|Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac— {{the founder}} of Detroit— is shown in this {{sculpture}} depicting <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> arrived at that spot in 1701.

25|$|As a {{proof that}} Otto had the full {{confidence}} {{and support of}} the King of England, we find that <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> obtained his liberty, he wrote to communicate the same to Henry III, who was his cousin, and as Henry's answer dated 6 March 1229 has fortunately been preserved by Thomas Rymer, it becomes a valuable part of these annals, as it puts our conjecture beyond a doubt.|$|E
25|$|In an October 2009 speech, Wales recollected {{attempting}} {{to write a}} Nupedia article on Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert C. Merton, but being too intimidated to submit his first draft to the prestigious finance professors who were to peer review it, {{even though he had}} published a paper on Option Pricing Theory and was comfortable with the subject matter. Wales characterized this as <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> realized that the Nupedia model was not going to work.|$|E

25|$|One night, Pu Tong Seal {{was very}} tired from his all-day journey on foot, {{and began to}} fall asleep in the jungle. <b>The</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> dozed off, a tiger {{attacked}} him. He {{seemed to have a}} sixth sense, even when resting. The warlord never took chances, day or night, but was always alert for the unexpected ambush whether by human or animal. He bent the tiger's body so hard that the spinal cord broke, and the tiger died on the spot.|$|E

25|$|Pope Paul VI {{opted for}} a {{significantly}} shorter ceremony. As with all other modern coronations, the ceremony itself was only symbolic, as the person involved became Pope and Bishop of Rome <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> accepted his canonical election in the papal conclave. The two subsequent popes (John Paul I and John Paul II) abandoned the monarchial coronation, opting instead for a coronation-less investiture. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI took {{a step further and}} removed the tiara from his papal coat of arms, replacing it with a mitre.|$|E
