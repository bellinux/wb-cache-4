Otis {{suggests}} that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> supplies at a nearby high school—where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a trailer—although the place is likely overrun with walkers. Otis and Shane decide to get the supplies, while Maggie retrieves Lori from the group and brings her to the Greene home. Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic; Rick believes there is no cure, while Hershel has faith that there could be one.|$|E
5|$|With {{the news}} of the {{alarming}} Russian operations against the left wing of the army, Murat reassumed command of the cavalry reserve, ordering Nansouty to retake command of the 1st heavy cavalry division and follow the concentration of the army towards Eylau. Joining his men in Warsaw, Nansouty diligently led them towards his assigned destination, but did not arrive until 13 February 1807, five days after the Battle of Eylau and too late to take part in any action. On 14 February, Nansouty learned of the death of his comrade and former commander during the Revolutionary Wars, General d'Hautpoul, who had been fatally wounded during the heroic cavalry charges at Eylau. After the battle, the Emperor decided that the army was to take winter quarters. To ensure the safety of his outposts, he sent Murat with a powerful column, including Nansouty's men, with the mission of pushing back any enemy <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>find.</b> A short skirmish involving the 1st heavy cavalry division occurred at Wolfsdorf on 10 March, before it was decided that all the heavy cavalry would be sent to the lower Vistula, where they were to rest and be reinforced.|$|E

25|$|White {{believed}} in capitalistic America and used communist propaganda as leverage {{to promote his}} own cause in securing civil liberties. He advised white America to reconsider its position of unfair treatment because <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> the black population choosing radical alternative methods of protest. Ultimately, White and other NAACP leaders decided to continue involvement with the Scottsboro boys since it {{was only one of}} many efforts they had.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{many people}} have asked me how I run the Naval Reactors Program, so that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the {{tendency}} of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.|$|E
25|$|No {{physical}} remains {{have been}} found for over a thousand victims of the attacks at the Trade Center, but the family still hopes that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> yet some remnant of Philip. Her minnu, which they believe she was wearing {{at the time of}} the attacks, could have survived in the freshly collapsed buildings. They have sent pictures of it to the city property clerk's office in the event it can be matched to several hundred other unmatched personal items recovered from the ruins.|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she answered, [...] "but I did {{not dare}} to face the publicity. I felt that I should {{never be able to}} look any one in the face again. I had given my name to the guide Johnson as Clara Hurd. I hoped that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> never <b>find</b> me." ...|$|R
500|$|Rodríguez de Montalvo's {{description}} of Calafia, her people and her country {{was based upon}} many centuries of stories of Amazons, groups of woman warriors who fought like men. As well, {{the story of an}} island paradise filled with gold and pearls was a recurring theme that Rodríguez de Montalvo was familiar with. In seeking new land, Spanish explorers were often led onward after hearing about a land of gold, or a land ruled by women. California historian Lynn Townsend White, Jr wrote that they considered the as-yet undiscovered California [...] "a land of Orient with fantastic attributes". The novel about Esplandián and Calafia's domain had a strong influence on the searching Conquistadors, who believed <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> a nation of women and riches somewhere {{at the edge of the}} known world.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, Donna and Ringo's {{relationship}} {{goes through}} a rocky patch and during schoolies week, Donna sleeps with Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith). Andrew later turns up in Erinsborough much to Donna's shock. Robbie said that Donna begins to [...] "freak out" [...] {{because she did not}} expect to see Andrew again and now he could tell everyone what happened between them. Robbie added [...] "Ringo and Donna were definitely going through a rocky patch for a while, but things were starting to look up. If she comes clean, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> a way to work through it. But it doesn't look good." [...] Sam Clark said that Ringo and Donna's love for each other is very strong, but he was not sure if it was strong enough to survive a betrayal. Robbie and Clark also said that the couple were heading in different directions career-wise and it would be challenging for them. Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then puts pressure on her to give in to their attraction. Robbie said that Donna is [...] "flattered" [...] by Andrew's interest in her and when Ringo puts his career before her, Andrew tells Donna what she wants to hear. On Andrew and Donna's compatibility, Robbie said [...] "Andrew's more into the fashion scene than Ringo. He's suave and well-dressed, and he's an aspiring businessman. He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty". Robbie commented on the ex-couple's future and said [...] "I think at the moment it's quite in the balance. It's right up to the network at the moment as to whether they'll get back together or not." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{after the}} war, Hitchens scolded those within the US who had {{opposed the war}} by observing that [...] "the peace {{movement}} {{in this country in}} my opinion acted in a very narrow, isolationist, and almost chauvinistic way. It said that a war was more or less alright with it as long as it could be guaranteed in advance that American casualties could be kept low... I thought that was a dishonourably narrow way of approaching the question. ... When large numbers of Iraqis were turned into soap...and many others, as we've since found out, were bulldozed and buried alive and in other ways done away with and people don't {{even want to think about}} the body count ...because they’re afraid of what <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> out." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{was agreed}} to, {{and the whole}} party {{proceeded}} on their way with increased speed, Chimbolo and Harold hoping <b>they</b> <b>might</b> yet <b>find</b> that Marunga had escaped, and Disco earnestly desiring that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> only fall in with the Ajawa and have a brush with them, in which case he assured the negroes he would show them a way of bewitching their guns that would beat their chief's bewitchment all to sticks and stivers! ...|$|R
60|$|No {{one thought}} of walking, for {{it seemed as}} if every moment was {{precious}} then, and that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not <b>find</b> him if they were two or three minutes late.

60|$|During {{all this}} time he had not stopped once to rest; but now, since he was so near his destination, at such an early hour in the morning, {{he sat down in}} the snow, and began to arrange with the discontented Crippy as to how <b>they</b> <b>might</b> best <b>find</b> uncle Robert, for Dan had not the {{slightest}} idea of where his relative lived.|$|R

50|$|Defenders of {{the company}} point out that prior to Miramax most of the films {{purchased}} by the company would have had little to no chance of achieving U.S. distribution other than by very small distributors with minimal marketing expertise and funds.

60|$|Still Oliver and Tregarthen {{persisted in}} their {{resolution}} to leave, until Hitchin began to plead {{in a tone}} that showed he was anxious to have their presence in the house as protectors.
