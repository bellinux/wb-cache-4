5|$|Each team {{selected}} {{a squad of}} up to 15players, and any changes to that squad due to illness or injury had to be requested in writing {{and approved by the}} ICC's Event <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee.</b> Three such replacements were made to the squads, with South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies making a change. England entered the tournament with the top-ranked players in both the ICC's batting and bowling rankings, Claire Taylor and Isa Guha respectively, but Australia were commonly lidted in the press as favourites to win the tournament. Taylor finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, accumulating 324 runs, and her England team-mate Laura Marsh was the most prolific wicket-taker, claiming 16 wickets.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{proposes a}} methodology {{to devise a}} taxonomy that can enable researchers to identify specialised <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> according to their research interests. The paper elaborates on two general issues to devise such as taxonomy. First the structure of R&D output measured by patent portfolios of organisations chairing <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> is analysed {{in conjunction with the}} thematic focus of those <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees.</b> Second, the structure of the output of <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> is analysed as the standards portfolio using data from the bibliographic database PERINORM. The developed taxonomy then links ICS classes on second level to the <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> that are specialised in these fields. The paper focuses on <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> at ETSI, CEN and CENELEC covering 351 ICS classes and 483 <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees.</b> Still, the method proposed can be used with any kind of SDO as long as data is available on the output of <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> in this body.

5|$|In 1904, after {{allowing}} the navies {{of other countries}} to pioneer submarine developments, the Austro-Hungarian Navy ordered the Austrian Naval <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> (MTK) to produce a submarine design. The January 1905 design developed by the MTK and other designs submitted by the public {{as part of a}} design competition were all rejected by the Navy as impracticable. They instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland for a competitive evaluation. The two Germaniawerft submarines comprised the U-3 class. The Navy authorized two boats, U-3 and U-4, from the Germaniawerft in 1906.|$|E

5|$|With Portal's {{appointment}} came {{consideration of}} splitting Anderson's committee, which functioned as both an advisory and an interdepartmental body. In August 1946, a new standing committee was created, the Atomic Energy Official Committee, which assumed the interdepartmental function. In March 1947, Roger Makins became its chairman. Anderson's committee declined in influence, and was disbanded when he departed {{at the end}} of 1947. During the war, Christopher Hinton had been seconded from ICI to the Ministry of Supply and had become Deputy Director General of Filling Factories. He was due to return to ICI {{at the end of}} the year, but agreed to oversee the design, construction and operation of the new facilities at a salary far below that offered by ICI. He established his headquarters in a former Royal Ordnance Factory at Risley in Lancashire on 4 February 1946. Portal also created a position of Deputy Controller (Technical Policy), to which he appointed Michael Perrin. This created ill-feeling, as Perrin had been junior to Hinton at ICI. Portal also created a <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> to replace the old Tube Alloys <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee.</b> To give the Ministry of Supply's control over atomic energy a legal form, a bill was introduced into the House of Commons on 1 May 1946 that became law as the Atomic Energy Act 1946 on 6 November 1946.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the championship, {{the captains}} of the United States team (Tom Florie) and Yugoslavia (Milutin Ivković) both {{received}} bronze medals. Yet a FIFA <b>technical</b> <b>committee</b> report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth, a practice since continued by FIFA. In 2010, the son of Kosta Hadži, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Hadži himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{was then}} given a {{significant}} opportunity {{that became the}} focus of the remainder of his paid academic career: to help establish one of the world's largest optical telescopes, at Siding Spring. In the early 1960s, the Australian and British governments proposed a partnership to build a joint optical telescope facility, and Gascoigne was among the experts involved. Former Mount Stromlo director and now head of the Greenwich observatory, Richard Woolley, was prominent in supporting the project from the British end. In 1967, the two governments formally agreed to collaborate on the construction of a large telescope, {{to be known as the}} Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Given the existing infrastructure of the ANU's Siding Spring Observatory, the site was readily agreed as the location for the AAT. Gascoigne was one of the four members of the <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> established to guide the telescope's development. He provided leadership on the design and optics of the new telescope, and was made the chief commissioning astronomer in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Howe cabled Anderson {{expressing the}} Canadian government's {{agreement}} in principle, but requesting {{a more detailed}} appraisal {{of the cost of}} the proposed laboratory. Sir John Anderson replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated running cost was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed that it would be run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and funded through the NRC, with research directed by a <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> chaired by Halban.|$|E

5|$|On {{a meeting}} on 10 October, O. T. Blindheim, a {{geological}} consulting company, and Selmer presented three alternatives: continued injection of cement, recommended by Blindheim; freezing, recommended by Selmer {{because it was the}} cheapest, but would take more time; and use of a water-tight shield. A <b>technical</b> <b>committee</b> was established, and on 16 December they recommended the use of cement injection combined with a ring of drainage holes around the tunnel before blasting. The method was to be continually tested, and if it was insufficient, freezing could be used. As the tunnel advanced, the hole was to be continuously secured using carbon fibre-reinforced carbon gunite, self-boring bolts, steel ribs and full pouring. Work was taken up after {{a meeting on}} 27 March 1995, and on 16 August the final blast was made. Representatives from Selmer stated that the method they had chosen had resulted in international interest for the tunnel, and they had demonstrated it to several international delegations.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} dismissal, Wenger {{travelled}} to the United Arab Emirates {{to attend a}} series of conferences held by FIFA. Wenger {{was a member of}} the football governing body's <b>technical</b> <b>committee,</b> responsible for analysing the 1994 World Cup, and made a presentation to coaches of emerging football nations. His speech was closely followed by Japanese delegates, whose country had invested millions into the restructuring of its football league system. Representatives of Toyota, the majority owner of Nagoya Grampus Eight soon met with Wenger and offered him the chance to become the club's manager. Wenger deliberated, even though the idea of working abroad appealed to him; negotiations between the two parties lasted for two months. In that time, he sought the advice of his closest friends and family, and flew to Japan to watch Nagoya Grampus' striker Gary Lineker make his final appearance before his professional retirement. In December 1994, Wenger agreed to become manager of Nagoya Grampus, on a two-year contract worth ¥75m annually.|$|E
5|$|The Navy was {{reasonably}} {{pleased with}} the first ship, Bayan, and decided to order another cruiser {{after the start of}} the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904. Russian shipyards were still unavailable, so the Navy decided to simply order a repeat with minor modifications based on war experience. This was an attempt to minimize the work load on the Naval <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> (Morskoi tekhnicheskii komitet), but they proved to require more attention than planned and a contract was not signed until 20 April 1905. The contract specified that all drawings would be turned over to allow for the construction of two identical ships in St. Petersburg, using newly available slipways. These changes generally added weight and the armor was reduced in thickness to compensate, although the change from Harvey armor to more resistant Krupp armor meant that there was little actual loss in protection.|$|E

5|$|The first {{occasion}} was on 8 September 1943, on {{the afternoon}} after Stimson discovered {{that he was the}} chairman. The first meeting established a Technical Subcommittee chaired by Major General Wilhelm D. Styer. Because the Americans did not want Akers on the Technical Subcommittee due to his ICI background, Llewellin nominated Chadwick, whom he also wanted to be Head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project. The other members were Richard C. Tolman, who was Groves's scientific adviser, and C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the Canadian National Research Council. It was agreed that the <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> could act without consulting the Combined Policy Committee whenever its decision was unanimous. The Technical Subcommittee held its first meeting on 10 September, but negotiations dragged on. The Combined Policy Committee ratified the proposals in December 1943, by which time several British scientists had already commenced working on the Manhattan Project in the United States.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the squads {{picked for}} the 2007 Cricket World Cup. This was the ninth Cricket World Cup tournament and was held between 14 March and 28 April 2007. The sixteen teams were asked to {{announce}} their final squads by 13 February 2007. Changes were allowed after this deadline at the discretion of the ICCs <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> in necessary cases, such as due to player injury. In order to aid the teams to select the final fifteen, teams were given the option to announce a thirty-man squad by mid-January, with the understanding that the final squad would be picked from within these thirty players. However this was not strictly adhered to—several of England's final fifteen came from outside the initial thirty, for example.|$|E
5|$|This {{problem has}} been the object of growing concern. For example, {{researchers}} at the University of Hohenheim are studying how bees can be poisoned by exposure to seed disinfectants. In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an expert group, the Scientific and <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. Researchers at the Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have pondered the intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even has published standards for testing chemicals for bee intoxication.|$|E
