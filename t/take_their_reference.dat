50|$|The {{problem for}} historians {{is that the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was {{commissioned}} in the reign of Alfred the Great some four hundred years after the supposed events. There {{is some evidence that}} the Anglo-Saxons were using runes at this time. However their culture was largely of an oral tradition and they did not really start writing down legal and historical events until they were evangelised; this would have been the late 7th century for the South Saxons. The early Christian chroniclers would have <b>taken</b> most of <b>their</b> <b>references</b> for the early period from oral sources such as poetry. The medieval historians then produced embroidered versions of the chronicles to suit their own purposes.|$|R

Objective: To investigate the seasonal {{distribution of}} suicide in alcohol dependence {{and to make}} a comparison with unnatural death in alcoholism and suicide in other diagnostic groups. Method: Multiaxial ratings of all patients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry in Lund enabled the selection of patients with alcohol dependence (n= 1312) during 1949 - 1969. When followed up to 1997 a total of 102 (99 men) alcoholic patients had <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> own life. <b>Reference</b> groups were patients with severe depression and autopsy cases with other diagnoses. Results: The alcoholic patients showed a peak during the second quarter of the year (34 %, P < 0. 05). Other diagnostic groups of suicide and unnatural death in alcoholism did not show any overrepresentation in the spring. Conclusion: Male alcoholics showed a spring peak of suicide as opposed to other diagnostic groups...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the role}} of friends in {{practices}} of care within intimate relationships, either towards each other, or in supporting caring practices towards other persons (children, parents or other kin) ? And to what extent are these caring practices gendered? I explore how friendship either disrupts, or reproduces, the ethics of care that cross-cuts gender relations throughout society. I focus on the experience of Portuguese men and women and <b>take</b> as <b>reference</b> <b>their</b> personal community, understood as the active and meaningful personal ties they consider to be central in their lives. Drawing on qualitative data from 30 in-depth interviews, I explore their experiences of care in three dimensions: caring for others; caring for oneself; and being cared for. Results show that, while {{it is not possible to}} assert a complete centring of personal lives on friendship, friends stand out as important sources of care in these three different situations, providing both emotional and practical support. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This study {{investigated}} whether providing university students with extra feedback regarding <b>their</b> <b>referencing</b> improves <b>their</b> <b>referencing</b> confidence and reduces their propensity to plagiarise. The study {{also sought to}} increase our understanding of what factors underlie student plagiarism. Design/methodology/approach - Undergraduate and post-graduate accounting students were surveyed regarding their experience when completing a formative essay designed to give feedback on <b>their</b> <b>referencing</b> ability. All students in one undergraduate and one postgraduate accounting course {{were invited to participate}} in a post-assessment, electronically administered survey consisting of sixteen question. Findings - The results indicate that a considerable number of the students perceived the formative assessment to be of benefit with respect to improving <b>their</b> <b>referencing</b> confidence. A significant proportion of the students indicated that their understanding of what constitutes plagiarism and their confidence in avoiding plagiarism improved {{as a result of the}} assessment and its associated feedback. Research limitations/implications - This study supports the provision of assessment designed to assist students with improving their ability to both recognise and avoid plagiarism in their written work. However, this research has not investigated whether these types of exercises lead to an actual reduction in the incidence of plagiarism in tertiary student cohorts. This is an area for future research. <br /...|$|R
