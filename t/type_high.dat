Questionnaire items measured the Big Five dimensions of personality, psychosomatic health, sources of occupational stress, general demographic variables, and music related variables. A three-stage hierarchical clustering method assigned musicians to nine clusters {{based upon the}} Big Five dimensions of personality, forming a typology. Exploratory factor analysis of two item sets yielded latent variables for typal explication. The first analysis produced five group factors and one general factor for measuring occupational stress.

25|$|Relations and {{functions}} are defined in TST (and in NF and NFU) as sets of ordered pairs {{in the usual}} way. The usual definition of the ordered pair, first proposed by Kuratowski in 1921, has a serious drawback for NF and related theories: the resulting ordered pair necessarily has a <b>type</b> two <b>higher</b> than the <b>type</b> of its arguments (its left and right projections).

5000|$|One {{particularly}} interesting approach for generating the high voltage fields needed to accelerate ions in a neutron tube {{is to use}} a pyroelectric crystal. In April 2005 researchers at UCLA demonstrated the use of a thermally cycled pyroelectric crystal to generate high electric fields in a neutron generator application. In February 2006 researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute demonstrated the use of two oppositely poled crystals for this application. Using these low-tech power supplies it is possible to generate a sufficiently high electric field gradient across an accelerating gap to accelerate deuterium ions into a deuterated target to produce the D + D fusion reaction. These devices are similar in their operating principle to conventional sealed-tube neutron generators which typically use Cockcroft-Walton <b>type</b> <b>high</b> voltage power supplies. The novelty of this approach is in the simplicity of the high voltage source. Unfortunately, the relatively low accelerating current that pyroelectric crystals can generate, together with the modest pulsing frequencies that can be achieved (a few cycles per minute) limits their near-term application in comparison with today's commercial products (see below).
