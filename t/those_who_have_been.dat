5|$|Of {{the total}} number of the Robinsons who hid in the ruins of the city only a portion's names and {{locations}} are known. The recognized individuals are mostly the ones who either survived the war themselves or who came into contact with other survivors at some point. As such, the list of the known hideaways is not representative; the majority of the Robinsons died while in hiding, and hence their identities, were never recorded. The table below lists some of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mentioned in the memoirs or other written works on the subject.|$|E

5|$|Who's Your City? was {{intended}} to be a self-help book, based on scholarly research and an academic theory, that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside. Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and even <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> critical of Florida's work, like Tim Harford. New research included a psychological aspect to his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text.|$|E

50|$|Another AGA {{study was}} used in {{assessing}} the cultural adaption of Filipinos <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the U.S. Navy. Three groups of Filipinos were compared to similarly composed groups of Americans: <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were newly recruited to the U.S. Navy, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the Navy between 1 and 10 years, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the Navy from 11 to 25 years. The results indicated that cultural adaptation occurred most in domains such as “Work” and “Service.” Cultural adaptation occurred least in domains such as “Family,” “Friends,” “Society,” “Interpersonal Relations,” and “Religion.” These domains are most influenced by tradition and early socialization. This study also revealed that cultural adaption is also a function {{of time spent in}} the host environment. The change from the first group (new recruits) to the second group (<b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the Navy 1-10 years) is faster than the change from the second group to the third group (<b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the Navy 11-25 years).|$|R
5|$|York City Football Club is a {{professional}} association football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England. This chronological list comprises all those who have held the position of manager of the first team of York City. Each manager's entry includes his dates of tenure and the club's overall competitive record (in terms of matches won, drawn and lost), honours won and significant achievements while under his care. Caretaker managers are included, where known, as well as <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in permanent charge.|$|E
5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> exposed to heparin {{in the last few}} months may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
5|$|The Gateway Protection Programme {{initially}} had a {{quota of}} 500 refugees per year, which was later increased to 750, {{but the actual}} number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. Liberian, Congolese, Sudanese, Burmese, Ethiopian, Mauritanian, Iraqi, Bhutanese, Eritrean, Palestinian and Somali refugees are amongst <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> resettled under the programme. Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.|$|E

5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at high risk for TB. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of Belarus {{is divided into}} discrete regions, called oblasts. The oblasts are further divided into districts which are in turn subdivided into cities. The Constitution also allows for special regions to be created, which are {{to be controlled by}} legislation. Citizens of Belarus are also promised protection and sponsorship, regardless of whether they are inside Belarusian borders or in a foreign country. With some exceptions, those who do not have a nationality and foreigners are, under the Constitution, granted the same status and rights as citizens of Belarus. Belarus also has the power to grant asylum to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> subject to persecution due to their ethnic background, political ideology or religious affiliation.|$|E
