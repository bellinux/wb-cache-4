After the protesters had been dispersed, the remainder of the pier was completely dismantled, away from the glare of publicity.|$|E
5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about {{the success of their}} {{performance}} that night. As Crozier <b>took</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who appeared to have been the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy {{that he is}} dating Squeaky Fromme {{and says}} {{that she is a}} handful. Fromme {{is a member of the}} Manson Family, and was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} for attempting to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975. Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she <b>took</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E
5|$|General George S. Patton {{himself had}} a gunfight {{when he was}} a young second {{lieutenant}} chasing Pancho Villa all over northern Mexico in 1916. Patton and 10 enlisted men had been sent to San Miguelito Ranch to look for Villa, who had recently raided the city of Columbus, New Mexico. Patton positioned his men by the south gate and was making his way up to the north gate when a trio of Villa's men came into the ranch on horseback. Patton drew his obsolete single-action Colt Peacemaker revolver and shot two of the men. The first man had been fatally wounded in the exchange and tried to draw his pistol before Patton killed him with a single shot. After his troops <b>took</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> remaining outlaw, Patton tied the three dead men to the hood of his touring car and drove the bodies back to his commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} that the King would be succeeded by his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of William of Orange, Stadtholder of the Netherlands, but when in 1688, James produced a male heir, James Francis Edward Stuart, {{it was clear that}} his policies would outlive him. An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40,000 men on 5 November. In Edinburgh there were rumours of Orange plots and on 10 December the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, the Earl of Perth, quit the capital for Drummond Castle, planning an abortive escape to Ireland (he was later captured as he embarked for France). As rioters approached Holyrood Abbey they were fired on by soldiers, resulting in some deaths. The city guard was called out, but the Abbey was stormed by a large mob. The Catholic furnishings placed there when it was restored as a chapel for James were torn down and the tombs of the Stuart kings desecrated. A crowd of students burnt the Pope in effigy and <b>took</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> heads of executed Covenanters that were hanging above the city gates. The crisis was resolved when James fled from England on 23 December, leading to an almost bloodless revolution. Although there had been no significant Scottish involvement in the coup, most members of the Scottish Privy Council went to London to offer their services to William. On 7 January 1689, they asked William to take over the responsibilities of government.|$|E

5|$|On August 14, 2016, the London Lions {{announced}} that Owumi would be returning for the 2016–17 season. In {{his first game}} of the season on September 24, he scored 18 points and grabbed nine rebounds to help beat the Surrey Scorchers. In a BBL Cup win over the Plymouth Raiders on October 10, he made nine-three pointers in a season-high 32-point effort. He combined with Rashad Hassan for a total of 60 points. Owumi scored 23 points off 8-of-13 shooting, with 19 in the first half, on October 26 vs. Leeds Force to help the Lions achieve a 6–0 start to the season. In a rematch with the Scorchers on November 2, Owumi notched 27 points, converting on all 11 free throw attempts. London coasted to a 30-point win. Owumi had another notable performance on December 21, when he recorded a double-double of 14 points and 12 rebounds along with five steals in a loss to the Leicester Riders. On New Year's Day 2017, he recorded ten points and 11 assists to overcome a poor shooting night vs. Surrey. Owumi had a triple-double of 15 points, ten rebounds, and ten assists as the Lions <b>took</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Raiders on March 10. He entered the BBL Play-off with hopes of making a run. However, London was ousted in the semifinals by the Riders, despite a 21-point haul from Owumi. He finished the season averaging 13.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.0 steals per game.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rolls}} were {{presented}} to the king they were archived in the royal collections. In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys, a navy administrator and avid book collector. Pepys did not disclose {{the details of how}} the rolls were given to him, but it is believed that the gift came out of a meeting with King Charles where Pepys <b>took</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> king's account of how he escaped from the Battle of Worcester (1651). The plan was that Pepys would edit and publish the already famous story, but he never did so. It is also known that Pepys was planning to write a history of the navy and that he was gathering material for this task, but this project also was never finished. It is considered likely that King Charles was aware of Pepys' plans and presented him with two of the rolls either as a gift or as payment for the intended publication of the escape story. The second roll could not be located at that time, and it was not until 1690 that it was discovered by Henry Thynne, keeper of the royal library 1677–89 and a close friend of Pepys. Thynne arranged for Pepys to make copies of some of the illustrations, but by 1690 Charles was dead and James II was in exile. Pepys had resigned from his position as Secretary of the Admiralty that same year and refused to recognize the reign of William III and Mary II, which meant that acquisition of the final roll for his collection was out of the question. The creation of the codex from the first and third rolls is therefore assumed to have been completed shortly after that time. After Pepys' death in 1703 his library passed on to his nephew John Jackson. After the death of Jackson in 1724 the library, along with the codex, was then passed on to Pepys' old college at Magdalene, Cambridge, where it remains to this day.|$|E

25|$|The 1967 Tasmanian State Premiership Final (colloquially {{known as}} the Goalpost Final) was an Australian rules {{football}} match played between the Wynyard Cats and the North Hobart Robins on Saturday 30 September 1967 at West Park Oval, Burnie, to decide {{the winner of the}} 1967 Tasmanian State Premiership. One of the most controversial games in Australian rules football history, the match was declared no result and the premiership was withheld after fans invaded the field and eventually <b>took</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> goal posts, preventing North Hobart full-forward David Collins from taking a kick after the siren which would likely have won or tied the game for the Robins.|$|E

On 7 May 1945, the day before V-E Day, celebrating unionist students in Trinity College Dublin raised the flags of the victorious Allies over the college; when onlookers in College Green began jeering, some <b>took</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> flag of neutral Ireland, set fire to it and tossed it away, provoking a small riot. In response, nationalist students from University College Dublin, including future Taoiseach Charles Haughey, burned the British flag in Grafton Street. The Provost of Trinity College apologised for the incident, which was not reported in Irish newspapers owing to wartime censorship.|$|E
25|$|On 30 July 1808 Meleager, {{under the}} command of Captain Frederick Warren, had been sailing from Port Royal, Jamaica, when in the evening the master, believing that land in sight was Portland Point, set a course that would take her well clear of land. Still, less than half an hour later lookouts spotted broken water ahead; {{although}} the helmsman attempted to turn Meleager, she struck. Efforts to get her off or to stem in the inflow of water were unsuccessful. During the night the crew <b>took</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> masts and made rafts; once daylight arrived the task became to get everyone safely on shore. A line was strung to the shore of Bare Bush Key and all but three crewmen made it safely ashore. For the next few days the crew worked to salvage a large amount of stores and the guns.|$|E
25|$|Neil Lake needed three metal plates {{inserted}} {{in his face}} after being attacked by a Hells Angel at a petrol station in Cardiff in October 2007. Lake <b>took</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> registration of his attacker's Harley-Davidson motorcycle which led police to Sean Timmins, the vice-president of the Wolverhampton chapter. Timmins denied inflicting grievous bodily harm on Lake and claimed that a fellow club member had been riding around with the same number plates as him; he told a judge he knew {{the identity of the}} actual attacker but explained that it would be against club rules for him to name him. Timmins was cleared of the charge in September 2008 after providing an alibi who said that he was working in his hometown {{on the day of the}} attack.
