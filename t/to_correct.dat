5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. <b>To</b> <b>correct</b> his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> August's actions.
