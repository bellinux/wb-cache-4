5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks {{into a pair of}} flattened spatulate appendages (the uropods) that function as a <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick of the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the <b>tail</b> <b>fan.</b> A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E
5|$|Each somite, or body segment {{can bear}} {{a pair of}} appendages: on the {{segments}} of the head, these include two pairs of antennae, the mandibles and maxillae; the thoracic segments bear legs, which may be specialised as pereiopods (walking legs) and maxillipeds (feeding legs). The abdomen bears pleopods, and ends in a telson, which bears the anus, and is often flanked by uropods to form a <b>tail</b> <b>fan.</b> The number and variety of appendages in different crustaceans may be {{partly responsible for the}} group's success.|$|E
5|$|The {{blunt and}} short claws of Deinocheirus {{are similar to}} those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt claws of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E

25|$|A close relative, the confuciusornithid Changchengornis hengdaoziensis, also {{lived in}} the Yixian Formation. Changchengornis also possessed the paired, long tail feathers, as did several more {{advanced}} enantiornith birds. True, mobile <b>tail</b> <b>fans</b> only appeared in ornithuromorph birds, and possibly in the enantiornithine Shanweiniao.|$|R
25|$|The abdomen {{is divided}} into two parts: the pleosome which bears {{swimming}} legs; and the urosome, which comprises a telson and three pairs of uropods which do not form a <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> as they do in animals such as true shrimp.|$|E
25|$|The muscular abdomen has six {{segments}} {{and has a}} thinner shell {{than the}} carapace. Each segment has a separate overlapping shell, which can be transparent. The first five segments each have a pair of appendages on the underside, which are shaped like paddles and is used for swimming forward. The appendices are called pleopods or swimmerets, {{and can be used}} for more purposes than just swimming. Some shrimp species use them for brooding eggs, others have gills on them for breathing, and the males in some species use the first pair or two for insemination. The sixth segment terminates in the telson flanked by two pairs of appendages called the uropods. The uropods allow the shrimp to swim backward, and function like rudders, steering the shrimp when it swims forward. Together, the telson and uropods form a splayed <b>tail</b> <b>fan.</b> If a shrimp is alarmed, it can flex its <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> in a rapid movement. This results in a backward dart called the caridoid escape reaction (lobstering).|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} five {{segments of}} the crayfish house the massive flexor and extensor muscles. Six abdominal ganglia run down {{the entire length of}} the abdomen and communicate with one another through projections. The first five abdominal segments each have their own ganglion, that contains three roots with outward projections. The first has mixed sensory and motor nerves innervating swimmerets while the second has sensory and motor neurons that innervate the extensor muscles, while the third root contains only motor neuron projections that extend into the flexor muscles. The last segment contains the fusion of two ganglia. The ganglia here also receive sensory input from the sensitive hairs on the <b>tail</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is February to August in India and courtship involves ritual feeding, bowing and <b>tail</b> <b>fanning.</b> Nest excavation may begin {{a month before}} the laying of eggs. The nest is a deep tunnel in a mud bank within which four very spherical and white eggs are laid.|$|R
50|$|Like other corvids, black-billed magpies {{indulge in}} anting (applying ants onto their plumage) and sun-bathing (back facing the sun, head down, wings drooped and spread wide, <b>tail</b> <b>fanned,</b> back {{feathers}} fluffed up). They also belong to {{that group of}} birds that scratch their head with their foot over the wing.|$|R
50|$|Baltimore orioles are {{basically}} solitary outside their mating season. The species {{is generally considered}} monogamous, although evidence suggests that extra-pair copulation is reasonably common. In the spring, males establish a territory then display to females by singing and chattering while hopping from perch to perch in front of them. Males also give a bow display, bowing with wings lowered and <b>tail</b> <b>fanned.</b> Depending on their receptiveness, the females may ignore these displays or sing and give calls or a wing-quiver display in response. The wing-quiver display involves leaning forward, often with <b>tail</b> partly <b>fanned,</b> and fluttering or quivering slightly lowered wings.|$|R
25|$|Given {{the close}} {{affinity}} of Zhenyuanlong with Microraptor, Changyuraptor and Sinornithosaurus, {{it is noteworthy}} that the specimen does not preserve any feathers on the hind limbs. Some of its closest relatives are known for long, voluminous vaned feathers attaching to the ankles and lower legs, and Zhenyuanlongs lack of similar feathers may indicate another unique anatomical feature of this animal among its relatives. However, the specimen's hind limbs belong to a piece of slab that preserves no other feathers on the body, while the other pieces all preserve feathers. Therefore, the lack of leg-feathers on Zhenyuanlong may be an artifact of preservation or preparation and, like the presence of a <b>tail</b> <b>fan,</b> cannot be ruled out with certainty.|$|E
25|$|The medial giants {{innervate}} {{the entire}} ventral nerve chord. Their cell bodies and dendrites {{begin in the}} brain and collect sensory information presented by visual and tactile stimuli. These fibers terminate in the last abdominal segment. The response is triggered by abrupt tactile stimuli to the head or alarming visual stimuli. This results in the firing of all motor giant (MoG) neurons and the flexion of all the phasic fast flexor (FF) muscles in the abdomen, which rapidly curls the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> and last three segments underneath the crayfish. This produces a thrust that directs water towards the offending stimulus while propelling the crayfish directly backward. This behavior is then followed by the extension of the tail, which prepares it for swimming or the execution of another tail-flip. The extension and swimming phases will be discussed in the next escape variant.|$|E
25|$|When living, Oviraptor {{was one of}} {{the most}} bird-like of the {{theropod}} dinosaurs. Its rib cage, in particular, displayed several features that are typical of birds, including a set of processes on each rib that would have kept the rib cage rigid. A relative of Oviraptor called Nomingia was found with a pygostyle, which is a set of fused vertebrae that would later help support the tail feathers of birds. Skin impressions from more primitive oviraptorosaurs, like Caudipteryx and Protarchaeopteryx, clearly show an extensive covering of feathers on the body, feathered wings and feathered tail fans. A <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> is also indicated by the presence of a pygostyle in Nomingia, suggesting that this feature was widespread among oviraptorosaurs. Additionally, the nesting position of the brooding Citipati specimens implies the use of feathered wings to cover the eggs. Given the close anatomical similarity between these species and Oviraptor, it is highly likely that Oviraptor had feathers as well.|$|E
50|$|At dusk {{during the}} {{breeding}} season, the males display at a lek (arena), standing erect with chest puffed and <b>tail</b> <b>fanned</b> out. They may {{jump into the}} air, and will produce a variety of rattles, clicks, buzzes and whistles while displaying. Three to four eggs are laid in a well-hidden nest on the ground.|$|R
50|$|These adaptations {{are rare}} among Mesozoic birds, {{many of which}} are known to have had long, pointed wings and very few, if any, long tail feathers. The rectrical bulb and plough-shaped {{pygostyle}} allowing for <b>tail</b> <b>fanning</b> is also a unique characteristic of ornithurine birds, of which Yixianornis is among the earliest known. In a 2006 study, Julia Clarke, Zhou Zhonghe and Zhang Fucheng found that the ability to <b>fan</b> the <b>tail,</b> along with the broad wings, show that it probably preferred environments with dense vegetation, where high maneuverability in flight would be necessary.|$|R

25|$|Like other decapod crustaceans, the {{crayfish}} {{possesses a}} hard, segmented exoskeleton that reflects muscular and neural segmentation. The anterior {{portion of the}} crayfish is the cephalothorax region. The region rostral to the cephalic grove, which separates the head and thorax region, {{is characterized by the}} presence of eyes, antennae and claws while the region caudal contains four pairs of walking legs. This is the crayfish's primary mode of locomotion. The abdominal section of the crayfish is divided into seven segments. These segments are flexibly interconnected, forming the tail. Normally, the tail is held in an extended position to aid in maneuvering and balancing. The first five segments are similar and the two terminal segments are modified into a <b>tail</b> <b>fan,</b> a region with high surface area that acts as the blade of a paddle in the escape response. This region contains the telson. The abdominal segments contain swimmerets, which aid in swimming.|$|E
25|$|The LGI {{receives}} its {{sensory input}} from the hair-like projections found {{on the edge of}} the <b>tail</b> <b>fan.</b> The sensory information is sent from bipolar receptors connected to the hair that are directionally sensitive. The path of the signal varies from here depending on the strength of the input. In the beta pathway, the signal can then pass a chemical synapse, the information is sent to a sensory interneuron (SI) of either type A (which fires phasically in response to input) or type C, (which fire tonically). From there, the signal is sent across an electrical synapse to the LGI. The LGI can also receive the sensory input directly through an electrical synapse by way of the alpha pathway. This bypasses the SIs. The LGI can pass the signal to the MoG's by two paths one of which passes the signal to the Motor Giant through direct electrical synapses. The MoG then passes the signal to the FF muscles. It can also use a second route across a fast electrical synapse to a premotor interneuron called the segmental giant (SG), two of which are located in each segment. The SGs then relays the signal to fast flexor motor neurons. The end result is a powerful and rapid flexion.|$|E
500|$|There {{is a clear}} {{demarcation}} {{between the}} thorax and the six or seven-segmented abdomen. In most taxa, each abdominal segment except the last carries a pair of biramous pleopods used for swimming, burrowing, gas exchange, creating a current or brooding eggs. The first and second abdominal pleopods may be modified in the male to form gonopods (accessory copulatory appendages). The appendages of the last segment are typically flattened into uropods, which together with the terminal telson, make up the [...] "tail fan". It is the sudden flexion of this <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> that provides the thrust for the rapid escape response of these crustaceans and the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> is also used in steering. [...] In Leptostraca, the appendages on the telson instead form caudal rami (spine-like protrusions).|$|E
50|$|The hobby is {{a solitary}} and {{aggressive}} falcon using rapid flickering wing beats, with <b>tail</b> <b>fanned</b> when hovering. It glides on flat or slightly drooped wings with carpals flexed and outerwings swept back. Its flight is often characterised as low and fast, zig-zagging over or between vegetation and open ground. When engaged in territorial defence, hobbys {{have been observed}} soaring and circling to ward off other birds of prey e.g. little eagle (Hieraaetus morphnoides). Hobbys have also been observed attacking other perched raptors with steep stoops at vegetation and shallow stoops from behind for airborne raptors.|$|R

40|$|The sexual {{behaviour}} of the Italian Newt Triturus italicus {{is characterized by}} an extended phase of static display. <b>Tail</b> <b>fanning</b> is the predominant movement during this stage. Shortly before creeping, a flicking tail movement is inserted in the display. Occasionally the male retreats {{in front of the}} female before turning to the spermatophore transfer phase. This behaviour is comparable to the retreat display of the T. vulgaris-helveticus-montandoni group. The long phase of static display resembles the behaviour of another species, T. boscai. In T. italicus, behaviours like retreat and tail touch by the female appear to be less stereotyped than in the T. vulgaris-helveticus-montandoni group...|$|R
2500|$|When the LGI-mediated {{inhibition}} subsides, the reextension process begins. This {{process is}} {{mediated by the}} MRO and <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> hair receptors, which were inhibited during the flexion portion of the escape behavior. The MRO {{is responsible for the}} initiation of extension and the inhibition of flexion through a reflex like mechanism. The muscle fibers of the MRO are located on the dorsal side of the abdomen, each spanning the joint of two segments. They are innervated by proprioreceptors that detect the stretch in extensor muscles when the flexors are contracted. They then fire phasically or tonically. It then excites the motor neurons in the fast extensor muscles while directly exciting an inhibitory neuron that prevents contractions in the FF muscles. The hair cells detect the resulting movement caused by the tail flip [...] when activated, they would fire and excite the fast extensor motor neurons.|$|E
2500|$|The lateral giant (LG)-mediated escape {{mechanism}} {{is the most}} extensively analyzed form of the tail flip. [...] The LG is not actually one neuron, but rather a group of closely associated neurons arranged end to end and connected by electrical synapses (also called [...] septate synapses). As a result, the LGI functions as one giant, continuous [...] neuron, such as the MG. The LGI's large diameter and the efficiency and speed of electrical synapses, make the LGI-mediated escape especially rapid and effective. The LGI only innervates the first three rostral segments of the tail and [...] is activated within 10 ms from when a mechanical stimulus is presented to the abdomen. When flexion occurs, only the first three segments flex and the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> is not directed under the body and forward but rather straight down. The unflexed segments increase {{the length of the}} paddle. The result is the rear end of the animal is directed upward and forward causing the animal to tumble or somersault forward. The tail is then rapidly extended, and this is usually followed by directed swimming.|$|E
2500|$|Behavioral neurobiologists in {{the field}} of neuroethology have {{researched}} this behavior extensively for over fifty years in the crayfish species Procambarus clarkii. Based on studies of P. clarkii it was discovered that the tail- flip mechanism is characterized by a decisive, all-or-nothing quality that inhibits [...] all unnecessary behaviors while generating a fixed action pattern for escape swimming. The type of escape response depends on the region of the crayfish that is stimulated but all forms require abdominal contractions. When a strong, unpleasant tactile stimulus is presented, such as a burst of water or the prod of a probe, a stereotyped behavior occurs in which the muscular tail and wide <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> region of the telson are used like a paddle to propel the crustacean away from harm using a powerful abdominal flexions. [...] The entire process occurs in {{a fraction of a second}} as movements are generated within two hundredths of a second (20 milliseconds) from the original trigger stimulus and the period of latency after a flexion is a hundredth of a second (10 milliseconds). Finally, the caridoid escape reflex requires that neurons be able to complete the arduous task of synchronizing the flexion of several abdominal segments. [...] The speed, coordination, and decisiveness of the process seem to be the main attributes to its success.|$|E
