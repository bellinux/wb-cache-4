40|$|We {{have used}} {{coarse-grained}} simulation methods {{to investigate the}} effect of stretching-induced structure orientation on the proton conductivity of Nafion-like polymer electrolyte membranes.

This change has a strong effect on the proton conductivity, which is enhanced along <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> direction, while <b>the</b> conductivity perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>stretched</b> polymer backbone is reduced.

In a benchmark, the mechanical, optical and thermal properties as well the raw material prices of conventionally available biaxial oriented films made of PP, PE and PA were compared to monoaxial oriented films made of PC.

40|$|Background and Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the behavior of cells from epithelial rest of Malassez (ERM) against stretching force. Material and Methods. ERM-cultured cells were stretched for 1 hour, at the cycle of 18 % elongation for 1 second followed by 1 -second relaxation. The cells without addition of stretching force were used as controls. The cells were observed by immunohistochmical staining using actin 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours. Furthermore, expressions of HSP 70 -, VEGF-, and OPN-mRNAs of cells were also evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR. Results. Actin filaments were randomly orientated in the cytoplasm in the control group, whereas in <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> group, actin filaments were orientated comparatively parallel to <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> direction. Expression of HSP 70 -mRNA in <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> group was significantly higher than that of control group at 12, 24, 36 hours (P <. 05).
