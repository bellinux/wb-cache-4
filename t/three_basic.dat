The resulting efficient agent-oriented realization is explained, and we give a theoretical embedding of our planning component based on BDI. 1 Introduction One of the recent fields of Artificial Intelligence is Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP, cf. e. g. [Wooldridge/Jennings, 1994], [Shoham, 1993]). AOP is proposed especially for the programming of autonomous components ("agents") in open heterogeneous systems. The agents (players) in Artificial Soccer [Kitano et al., 1997] must plan and execute actions individually and efficiently resulting in a successful cooperative team behavior.

5|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have argued}} that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non-configurational language, meaning that word order in Nahuatl is basically free. Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> sentence constituents. It is prolifically a pro-drop language: it allows sentences with omission of all noun phrases or independent pronouns, not just of noun phrases or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject. In most varieties independent pronouns are used only for emphasis. It allows certain kinds of syntactically discontinuous expressions.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of single-crystal X-ray crystallography has <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> steps. The first—and often most difficult—step is {{to obtain an}} adequate crystal of the material under study. The crystal should be sufficiently large (typically larger than 0.1 mm in all dimensions), pure in composition and regular in structure, with no significant internal imperfections such as cracks or twinning.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> {{strategies}} for biological pest control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of a pest is {{introduced in the}} hope of achieving control; inductive (augmentation), in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment.|$|E

5|$|Anabolism is {{the set of}} {{constructive}} metabolic processes {{where the}} energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Ceres, the {{asteroid}} belt's only dwarf planet, is about 950km in diameter, whereas 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea have mean diameters {{of less than}} 600km. The remaining bodies range down {{to the size of}} a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within {{the asteroid}} belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).|$|E

5|$|During World War Two, Destroyers served <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> functions: first, {{to act as}} {{screening}} {{ships to}} defend their fleets from enemy fleets, second, to attack the screening ships of enemy fleets, and third, to defend their fleet from submarines. How the destroyers were actually used varied upon the country. Germany abandoned the third function almost entirely, which showed in German destroyers' lack of strong anti-submarine armament, preferring to rely upon a massive fleet of trawlers which had been requisitioned and re-fitted as minelayers. The role of the destroyer began to vary much more heavily as WW2 progressed; where the British destroyers were built for escorting fleets, defending them from enemy planes, and sinking submarines, the Germans had destroyers were built to escort fleets, or act as torpedo boats.|$|E
5|$|Handshake packets {{consist of}} only a single PID byte, and are {{generally}} sent in response to data packets. Error detection is provided by transmitting four bits, which represent the packet type twice, in a single PID byte using complemented form. The <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> types are ACK, indicating that data was successfully received; NAK, indicating that the data cannot be received and should be retried; and STALL, indicating that the device has an error condition and cannot transfer data until some corrective action (such as device initialization) occurs.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce {{appears in}} many medieval writings, {{especially}} as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned {{it in her}} writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses. In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> modern lettuces– head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine (or cos) lettuce. Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are {{role-playing}} {{video games}} with adventure elements. The basic {{mechanics of the}} games are largely {{the same as their}} predecessors'. As with all Pokémon games for hand-held consoles, gameplay is viewed from a third-person overhead perspective, and consists of <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures his party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with one Pokémon and can capture more using Poké Balls. The player can also use the Pokémon to battle or deceive others, often forming alliances or trends via the Team Rocket networks.|$|E
5|$|The last {{relic of}} the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, the Fairfield Plant, {{continues}} to be operated by U. S. Steel {{as one of its}} five integrated steel mills in the USA. It is the largest steel-making plant in Alabama, employing 2,000 workers as of September 2006, down from a peak of 45,000 during World War II. With a single blast furnace and <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> oxygen process furnaces, amongst other various mills and production facilities, the plant produces 2.4 million tons of raw steel per annum and 640,000 tons of seamless tubular and sheet products, mainly for purchase by the booming oil industry.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{there are}} <b>three</b> <b>basic</b> formats of USB connectors: the default or {{standard}} format intended for desktop or portable equipment (for example, on USB flash drives), the mini intended for mobile equipment (now deprecated except the Mini-B, {{which is used}} on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for low-profile mobile equipment (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E

It attempts to be invariant to affine transformations and illumination changes.|$|R
