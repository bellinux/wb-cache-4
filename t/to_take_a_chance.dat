The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required.

5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> on the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower {{to help pay for}} condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction.|$|E

25|$|Denny and Whittier {{went looking}} for bankers to provide bridge financing, and one of these put them in touch with Whitney Collins, a {{vice-president}} at Menasco Motors Company and budding entrepreneur. Collins and Denny estimated it would take somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000 to bring the RP-3 up to the performance demanded by the original $11,000 contract, but Collins was willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that this would lead to future business.

Though Smith insisted on casting Lee in the lead role, Miramax head Harvey Weinstein refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> on Lee, citing the general inability of his films to gross more than $30million at the box office. The role of Fletch remained uncast, with Smith considering a list of actors including Affleck, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, and Jimmy Fallon. Though Smith considered compromising and casting Zach Braff in the role, he eventually left the project in October 2005.|$|E
25|$|Because {{morphology}} differences cannot dictate caste {{differences in}} S. septentrionalis, due to morphological similarity, castes {{are determined by}} adult disputes as opposed to manipulation at the larval stage. In colonies with already-established queens, workers will display aggressive behavior in order to inhibit female ovary development. Females with limited ovary development exhibit stringed, filamentous ovaries {{that do not have}} a mature oocyte and cannot contain sperm. When workers are not preventing female development, they are raised in an orphanage-like manner where they are able to develop full ovaries with multiple oocytes that can maintain sperm. These are ultimately the females that are able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to become a queen.|$|E

25|$|On {{the advice}} of wrestler Yukon Eric, Sammartino {{contacted}} Toronto promoter Frank Tunney hoping {{to take advantage of}} Toronto's large Italian population. Despite McMahon trying to blackball him there as well, Tunney decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> Sammartino made his Toronto debut in March 1962 and very quickly, with the help of self-promotion in local newspapers and radio programs, became an attraction. His ability to speak Italian also ingratiated himself with that immigrant population. With Canadian legend Whipper Billy Watson, Sammartino won his first professional wrestling championship in September 1962, the local version of the International Tag Team Championship. Soon, he was in demand by other promoters in different Canadian territories.|$|E

They named a strong line-up while giving Josh Walker his first Boro start as he lined up in the centre of midfield. The game saw Middlesbrough {{dominate}} in chances, but poor finishing meant they only won 2–1, with both of the home side's goals coming from Afonso Alves – his first goals for over two months – and both assisted by Stewart Downing. Middlesbrough's failures in front of goal meant they got a late scare as Barrow pulled a goal back after more bad defending at a set piece, but they failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to level the game late on. A sour moment of the game saw Jérémie Aliadière injured and ruled out for two months.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of young and newly founded firms depends {{largely to the}} human capital of the firm owner. The entrepreneur is therefore {{one of the main}} success factors for the firm. Yet entrepreneurs differ considerably in their background and characteristics. Particularly, founders' individual entrepreneurial experience is a property that might be crucial for firm development, though {{it is part of the}} firm's human capital, too. Business failures, namely bankruptcies, may trigger the transition from being a novice entrepreneur to becoming an entrepreneur who is entrepreneurially experienced. About 3 percent of novice entrepreneurs who file for bankruptcy reestablish afterwards. On average, slightly more than 15 months will elapse until such 'fallen' entrepreneurs venture out anew.

25|$|Due to {{receiving}} a red {{card in the}} previous game, Ljungberg was ineligible to play the next Seattle Sounders game.

When the game went to penalty kicks, he chose to sit it out due to his loss of vision after an on-set migraine. Unfortunately for Ljungberg, the initial five kicks ended in a draw. Kinnear, not fully understanding Ljungberg's condition, sent him out as the sixth kicker.

50|$|Birmingham {{were drawn}} away against Millwall for their opening match in the 2010-11 FA Cup.

They might have expected more competition from a team just outside the play-off positions in the Championship, but two goals from Matt Derbyshire, a precise free kick from David Murphy, and a powerful header from Cameron Jerome shortly after coming on a late substitute gave them a 4-0 lead. Had Millwall's finishing been better - Steve Morison failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> early <b>chance</b> when through on goalkeeper Maik Taylor, James Henry had an attempt disallowed for offside, and Taylor saved Morison's weak penalty - they might well have achieved more than Danny Schofield's consolation.|$|R
