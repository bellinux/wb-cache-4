500|$|In 2014 Smith {{offered her}} {{opinion on the}} sexualization of women in music. [...] "Pop music has always been about the {{mainstream}} and what appeals to the public. I don't feel it's my place to judge." [...] As at points earlier in her life and career, she declined to embrace politicized feminism: [...] "I have {{a son and a}} daughter, people always <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> feminism and women's rights, but I have a son too—I believe in human rights." ...|$|E
500|$|Friends {{encouraged}} Crittenden to run {{for president}} in the 1848 election. A Nashville newspaper declared its support for him as early as 1846. A Democratic senator from Rhode Island opined that Crittenden could win support from a sizable number of Democrats in addition to the support of his own party. George B. Kinkead desired to have the Kentucky General Assembly nominate Crittenden for president in 1847. None of these overtures swayed Crittenden. [...] "For Heaven's sake don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the Presidency," [...] he said, rebuffing one early offer. Clay hoped Crittenden would again support him, but Crittenden concluded that Clay was no longer a viable candidate and threw his support behind Kentuckian Zachary Taylor. This decision caused a rift between the two friends, and they were not reconciled until years later when Clay lay on his deathbed.|$|E
500|$|Shahid Kapoor {{was born}} in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem. His parents {{divorced}} when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi {{with his mother and}} maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: [...] "He would walk me to school every single day. He would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me." [...] His father, who was then a struggling actor in Mumbai, would visit Kapoor only once a year on his birthday. When Kapoor was 10, his mother, who was working as a dancer, moved to Mumbai to work as an actress.|$|E

500|$|Early {{versions}} {{opened with}} the line [...] "Don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> {{the rights of the}} IRA, UDA." [...] U2's bassist, Adam Clayton, recalls that better judgment led to the removal of such a politically charged line, and that the song's [...] "viewpoint became very humane and non-sectarian...which, is the only responsible position." [...] The chosen opening line, [...] "I can't believe the news today" [...] crystallises the prevailing response, especially among young people, to the violence in Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s. In successive stanzas, the lyrics paraphrase religious text from Matthew [...] ("mother's children; brothers, sisters torn apart") and bring a twist to 1 Corinthians [...] ("we eat and drink while tomorrow they die", instead of [...] "let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die"). [...] The song finishes with a call for the Irish to stop fighting each other, and [...] "claim the victory Jesus won...on [...] Sunday bloody Sunday." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Hawke {{entered the}} horror genre {{for the first}} time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's Sinister, which grossed US$87million at the {{worldwide}} box office—the film {{was the first in}} a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with [...] "Paranormal Activity." [...] And he kept trying to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> how I should love this whole genre. And I told him: I've never had a script with a really great character and a real filmmaker attached to it that I'd be interested in. So, he brought me into it.|$|E
500|$|After publication, Juster sent {{a copy of}} {{the book}} to the Ford Foundation, with an {{explanation}} of how the projected book on cities had transformed into The Phantom Tollbooth. He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers, and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years [...] "and they'll <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> a whole different book, normally. But now they've got a lot more of the words right. A lot more of the fun kind of crazy references". He learned too that readers were capable of more than he had intended, {{as in the case of}} the letter sent by the Mathemagician to King Azaz. Composed entirely of numbers, some readers assumed it was a code and set about breaking it, only to appeal to Juster for help when they were not successful. The numbers were not intended to have any meaning, and were meant to convey that the Mathemagician's letter could not have been understood by Azaz or his advisers.|$|E

500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nazis firmly {{fought the}} austrofascist regime of {{chancellor}} Engelbert Dollfuss, and orchestrated his assassination. They continued this battle against his successor, Kurt Schuschnigg. Austrofacism was strongly supported by Benito Mussolini, leader of Fascist Italy. Mussolini's {{support for an}} independent Austria {{can be seen in}} a discussion he had with Prince Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, an important Austrian nationalist and Heimwehr leader. He said that [...] "an Anschluss with Germany must never be permitted... Austria is necessary to the maintenance of Europe... the day that Austria falls and is swallowed up by Germany will mark the beginning of European chaos." [...] The austrofascist party, Fatherland Front, would echo the sentiments of Mussolini, and continue to struggle for an independent Austria. Nazis in both Germany and Austria intended that the German Reich would quickly annex Austria, the homeland of its leader, Adolf Hitler. They attempted to bribe many low-ranking Heimwehr leaders, and also attempted to bring Starhemberg into their fold, in effect merging the Heimwehr with the Nazi Freikorps. Gregor Strasser, a prominent Nazi figure, was charged with this effort. When Starhemberg, a fervent believer in an independent Austria, rejected his merger proposal, Strasser said [...] "Don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Austria. There is no Austria... there was once a living corpse which called itself Austria... that this Austria collapsed in 1918 was a blessing... particularly for the German people, who were thereby given the chance to create a Greater Germany." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{design of}} Edison's fluoroscope {{is still in}} use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, Clarence Dally. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation. He later died of injuries related to the exposure.

2500|$|The album's opener, [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", {{an ardent}} protest song, {{stems from a}} guitar riff and lyric written by the Edge in 1982. Following an {{argument}} with his girlfriend, and a period of doubt in his own song-writing abilities, the Edge – [...] "feeling depressed... channeled [...] fear and frustration and self-loathing into a piece of music." [...] Early versions of the song opened with the line, [...] "Don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> {{the rights of the}} IRA, UDA". After Bono had reworked the lyrics, the band recorded the song. [...] The opening drum pattern soon developed into the song's hook. A local violinist, Steve Wickham, approached the Edge one morning at a bus stop and asked if U2 had any need for a violin on their next album. [...] In the studio for only half a day, Wickham's electric violin became the final instrumental contribution to the song.|$|E
2500|$|An {{unlikely}} romance was scripted into Mel's narrative {{when she}} began dating her boss Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). The pairing {{has been described as}} one of [...] "the most unbelievable soap couples", but Outwaite defended it in 1999, saying [...] "I know I've fancied some not particularly attractive men in my time, but I don't think Ian is actually ugly. He has a vulnerable side and that's what is attractive. When he is being all hot-headed and gets above himself then I personally don't like Ian. But when he is being vulnerable I can see the attraction. People <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it all the time. I have taxi drivers telling me I could do much better than Ian. The other day someone shouted that I should go back with [...] Steve Owen. It's incredible, they'd rather [...] went out with [...] a murderer than with [...] a hard-working father raising three children." [...] Their relationship was the focus of the storyline that aired to mark the Millennium celebrations, when Ian emotionally blackmailed Mel into marrying him by claiming that his daughter was dying of cancer; storylines {{in the latter part of}} 1999 focused on the build-up to a joint Millennium wedding on New Year's Eve 1999 with Barry (Shaun Williamson) and Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed). The wedding went as planned; however, Mel and Ian's marriage ended hours later as the clock struck midnight to signify the beginning of the New Year after Mel discovered Ian's lie. The Millennium Eve episodes drew in 20.89 million viewers – the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in EastEnders precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An EastEnders spokeswoman commented: [...] "This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of EastEnders that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square." [...] The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical “haunt for New Year's Eve revelers”.|$|E
