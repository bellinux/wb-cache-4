However, McCullough and Williams {{found no evidence}} of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players striking out (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was.

25|$|Ma (2000) {{summarised}} {{the research}} of others who found, based on nationwide data, <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> higher scores on standardised mathematics tests had taken more mathematics courses in high school. This led some states to require three years of mathematics instead of two. But because this requirement was often met by taking another lower level mathematics course, the additional courses had a “diluted” effect in raising achievement levels.|$|E
25|$|Academic {{motivation}} orientation {{may also}} be tied with one's ability to detect and process errors. Fisher, Nanayakkara, and Marshall conducted neuroscience research on children's motivation orientation, neurological indicators of error monitoring (the process of detecting an error), and academic achievement. Their research suggests <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> high intrinsic motivation attribute performance to personal control and that their error-monitoring system is more strongly engaged by performance errors. They also found that motivation orientation and academic achievement {{were related to the}} strength in which their error-monitoring system was engaged.|$|E
25|$|Technology is {{essential}} to the field of educational psychology, not only for the psychologist themselves as far as testing, organization, and resources, but also for students. Educational Psychologists whom reside in the K- 12 setting focus the majority of their time with Special Education students. It has been found <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> disabilities learning through technology such as IPad applications and videos are more engaged and motivated to learn in the classroom setting. Liu et al. explain that learning-based technology allows for students to be more focused, and learning is more efficient with learning technologies. The authors explain that learning technology also allows for students with social- emotional disabilities to participate in distance learning.|$|E

This means <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> little residual hearing can see the manual symbols on the hands; those who are proficient lipreaders can follow oral conversation clues; those who have a usable residue of hearing can follow auditory clues.

2500|$|In 2003, {{according}} to one estimate, 1.4 million students took the SAT and 1.4 million also took the ACT test, paying about $50 per test. Generally counselors suggest that students should plan on taking the SAT or ACT test twice, so that a low score can possibly be improved. One advisor suggested <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> weak SAT or ACT scores could consider applying to colleges where these measures were optional. One suggested retaking the tests if there are [...] "subpar test scores" [...] in September and October (if applying early admission) or November and December (if applying regular admission.) Generally over half of eleventh graders retaking the SAT or ACT tests during the twelfth grade saw improvements in their scores. Colleges vary {{in terms of how}} much emphasis they place on these scores.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{tradition}} <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> Latin and/or Ancient Greek receive a black graduation cap instead of the standard white one when they graduate. This is a homage to older times when gymnasiums were known as [...] "Latin schools" [...] due to the prominent role of Latin at the time. The original graduation cap of this age was black, and thus it has become tradition for graduates with Latin and/or Ancient Greek to choose a black (albeit modern) version of the graduation cap (though a black cap in the original style is also an option). Other traditions regarding the black cap exist as well, {{but there are no}} official restrictions: Any graduating student may select a black graduation cap if he/she so wishes, but it is generally frowned upon, and there is even debate about the different traditions and about who {{should have the right to}} wear the black cap.|$|E

2500|$|On November 8, 2012, {{university}} officials {{announced that they}} had misreported admissions data on their student body for over a decade. Specifically, it overstated {{the number of students}} who had graduated from high school in the top ten percent of their classes by twenty percentage points. Officials made the assumption <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> top standardized test scores and high grade point averages were in the top tenth of their class when secondary schools did not provide class rank (roughly two-thirds of American high schools do not rank their students). Consequently, U.S. News & World Report removed the school from its rankings. It had been ranked in a three-way tie for the 51st position among national universities but following revelation of the misreporting U.S. News altered the GW entry to read [...] "George Washington University has changed from being a ranked school in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges to an unranked school, based on a data reporting error." [...] The accurate data would have lowered the school's rank. The university was reinstated on the 2014 U.S. News & World Report rankings, coming in as 52nd in National Universities.|$|E
2500|$|Contextual {{factors that}} {{individual}} teachers can affect often make the least difference on cheating behavior. A {{study found that}} increasing the distance between students taking an exam has little effect on academic misconduct, and that threatening students before an exam with expulsion if they cheat actually promotes cheating behavior. [...] Indeed, increased exam proctoring and other methods of detecting cheating in the classroom are largely ineffective. According to one survey of American college students, while 50% had cheated {{at least once in}} the previous six months, and 7% had cheated more than five times in that period, only 2.5% of the cheaters had been caught. As teachers invent more elaborate methods of deterring cheating, students invent even more elaborate methods of cheating (sometimes even treating it as a game), leading to what some teachers call a costly and unwinnable arms race. [...] Increased punishment for academic misconduct also has little correlation with cheating behavior. It has been found <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> markedly different perceptions of what the severity of the punishment for cheating were all equally likely to cheat, probably indicating that they thought that increased penalties were immaterial since their cheating would never be discovered. However, if a professor makes clear that he disapproves of cheating, either in the syllabus, in the first class, or {{at the beginning of a}} test, academic dishonesty can drop by 12%. [...] Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach.|$|E
