5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E
5|$|Wilson Popenoe and {{his wife}} in 1931, at a site in Honduras dating back to 600 AD, found the lower {{mandible}} of a young Mayan woman, with three missing incisors replaced by pieces of shell, shaped to resemble teeth. Bone growth around two of <b>the</b> <b>implants,</b> {{and the formation of}} calculus, indicates that they were functional as well as esthetic. The fragment is currently part of the Osteological Collection of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
30|$|Equal {{number of}} {{comparator}} implants (size 3.5  mm[*]×[*] 8  mm) were {{inserted in the}} other tibia/femur head of the animals after doing the osteotomy according to the manufacturer’s protocol as follows. After mobilizing the mucoperiosteal flap, the 3 -mm center punch was used to register a guide for the twist drill. The twist drill was used to establish the axial alignment of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> and {{to assist in the}} guidance of the depth drill. The depth drills were sequentially used to create osteotomy to the subcrestal axial depth of 0.5  mm. The conical reamer was used to develop the conical shape of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> body and to check the osteotomy depth. A counter-clockwise rotation was used to compress the bone in soft bone. The tap or thread cutter was used for dense bone to create the threads in the osteotomy. The thread cutter’s diameter corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> diameter. To engage <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> into <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> placement tool, <b>the</b> square faces on <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> fixture mount were aligned with those on <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> placement tool, then pushed together. Using the handle (finger wheel), <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> was pulled out of inner vial and the plastic collar was discarded. <b>The</b> <b>implant</b> placement assembly was transferred to the osteotomy and <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> was secured into the osteotomy site. <b>The</b> <b>implant</b> placement was started with the handle and finally placed using the hand-ratchet. If excessive force was experienced, the osteotomy was rinsed out and the depth was checked by retapping. To disengage fixture mount from <b>implant,</b> <b>the</b> open-ended spanner was used to break the retention force of the fixture mount retention screw. The knurled top of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> placement tool was turned by hand to fully disengage the fixture mount with <b>the</b> <b>implant.</b> Pushing down on the knurled top of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> placement tool disengaged the fixture mount.|$|R
30|$|Radiographs {{were taken}} after <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> installation, 6  months after the installation, {{and after the}} {{functional}} loading. To calculate the marginal bone loss, distance from the top level of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> platform to <b>the</b> marginal bone contact level on the uppermost part of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> was measured. In addition, mesial and distal parts of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> were measured each time. The marginal bone resorption levels were measured right after <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> installation, 6  months after the installation, and after the functional loading.|$|R
30|$|According to the {{previous}} literature, the obtaining osseointegration is integral to the intraosseous stability of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> body during <b>the</b> healing period [24]; moreover, the importance of postoperative assessment of the intraosseous stability of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> has also been reported [10]. Intraosseous stability of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> body is evaluated immediately after <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> insertion and during the healing period after surgery.|$|R
5|$|The {{prosthetic}} phase begins {{once the}} implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance {{that it will}} integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of <b>the</b> <b>implants.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dropped {{into the}} swamp where Keyes and his squad disappeared, the Master Chief discovers that the Captain has been {{captured}} and {{both human and}} Covenant soldiers have been turned into zombie-like creatures by bulbous aliens. One soldier, Private Wallace Jenkins, is left still semi-conscious and painfully aware of his predicament, unable to control his movement or actions as his former friends and he attack McKay's troops. Jenkins intends on ending his life, but is instead captured by McKay for study. The Chief is approached by Halo's resident A.I., 343 Guilty Spark, who informs the Chief that the creatures he has encountered are called the Flood, a virulent parasite that infects hosts and converts them into either forms for combat, or for reproduction. To activate Halo's defenses, Guilty Spark needs the Master Chief's help. In Halo's Control Room, Guilty Spark gives the Master Chief the key to activate Halo, but is stopped by a furious Cortana. Cortana explains that Halo is a weapon, but it doesn't kill the Flood- it kills their food, meaning humans, Covenant, and any other sentient life. Realizing {{that they have to}} stop Guilty Spark from activating Halo, Cortana and the Master Chief decide to destroy Halo by detonating the crash-landed Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors. In order to do this, they need Captain Keyes' neural implants. Cortana discovers the Captain is still alive, held prisoner once again aboard the Truth and Reconciliation, {{now in the hands of}} the Flood who are trying to escape Halo. The Chief fights Covenant and Flood to the Captain, but finds out he is too late—the Captain has been assimilated into the parasite. The Chief retrieves <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> and leaves the Truth for the Autumn.|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, Gynning {{declared}} {{to the media}} that she would remove and sell her breast implants, as she wished to downsize her breasts. In early February 2007, she underwent surgery to remove <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> and Elisabeth Ohlson Wallin took photos of them. <b>The</b> <b>implants</b> were placed in a plexiglass box and sold on the auction site eBay; revenues from the sale were given to a charity that works with victims {{of the war in}} Rwanda.|$|E
30|$|After the {{completion}} of the design of <b>the</b> <b>implant,</b> fabrication was performed by JMmedi (Seoul, Republic of Korea).

40|$|A new entity called "implant periapical lesion" has {{recently}} been described. This lesion could be the result of, for example, bone overheating, implant overloading, presence of a preexisting infection or residual root fragments and foreign bodies in the bone, contamination of <b>the</b> <b>implant,</b> or implant placement in an infected maxillary sinus. This case report describes a titanium implant that {{was placed in the}} maxillary premolar region. A fenestration involving the middle portion of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> was present. After 7 months, the apical portion of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> showed radiolucency. This lesion rapidly increased in size and a vestibular fistula appeared. A systemic course of antibiotics was not successful, and <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> was then removed. The histologic examination showed the presence of necrotic bone inside the antirotational hole of <b>the</b> <b>implant.</b> <b>The</b> etiology of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> failure in this instance could possibly be related to bone overheating associated with an excessive tightening of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> and compression of the bone chips inside the apical hole, producing subsequent necrosis...|$|R
25|$|Deep or {{superficial}} wound infection has {{an approximate}} incidence of 2%. It {{is a serious}} problem as superficial infection may lead to deep infection. This may cause infection of the healing bone and contamination of <b>the</b> <b>implants.</b> It is difficult to eliminate infection in the presence of metal foreign bodies such as implants. Bacteria inside <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> are inaccessible to the body's defence system and to antibiotics. The management is to attempt to suppress the infection with drainage and antibiotics until the bone is healed. Then the implant should be removed, following which the infection may clear up.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} a plaster-cast model, directly on {{the skin of the}} patient’s thorax, can be used in the design of <b>the</b> <b>implants.</b> The evolution of medical imaging and CAD (computer-aided design) now allows customised 3D implants to be designed directly from the ribcage, therefore being much more precise, easier to place sub-pectorally and perfectly adapted to the shape of each patient. <b>The</b> <b>implants</b> are made of medical silicon rubber which is age-resistant and unbreakable (different to the silicon gel used in breast implants). They will last for life (apart from the case of adverse reactions) and are not visible externally.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the stress characteristics within <b>the</b> dental <b>implant</b> influenced by different implant wall thicknesses {{as a result of}} varying diameters of 3. 5 and 5. 5 mm. A two-dimensional finite element model of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> and mandibular bone consisting of triangular and quadrilateral plane strain elements is analysed to compute the von Mises stresses in <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> subjected to varied masticatory forces and abutment screw preloads.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} of improved eye movement, such as using integrating prosthetic material, pegging <b>the</b> <b>implant,</b> covering <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> (e.g. with scleral tissue), or suturing the eye muscles directly to <b>the</b> prosthetic <b>implant.</b>|$|R
25|$|Common {{reactions}} {{can range}} from redness, swelling or itching at the injection site(s).

25|$|Ab interno {{implants}}, {{such as the}} Xen Gel Stent, are transscleral implants by an ab interno {{procedure to}} channel aqueous humor into the non-dissected Tenon's space, creating a subconjunctival drainage area similar to a bleb. <b>The</b> <b>implants</b> are transscleral and different from more other ab interno implants that do not create a transscleral drainage, such as iStent, CyPass, or Hydrus.|$|E
5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around <b>the</b> <b>implant.</b> Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> placed.

50|$|Implant-induced {{coagulation}} {{is similar}} to the coagulation process done within the body to prevent blood loss from damaged blood vessels. However, the coagulation process is triggered from proteins that become attached to <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> surface and lose their shapes. When this occurs, the protein changes conformation and different activation sites become exposed, which may trigger an immune system response where the body attempts to attack <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> to remove <b>the</b> foreign material. The trigger of the immune system response can be accompanied by inflammation. The immune system response may lead to chronic inflammation where <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> is rejected and has to be removed from the body. The immune system may encapsulate <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> as an attempt to remove the foreign material from the site of the tissue by encapsulating <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> in fibrinogen and platelets. The encapsulation of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> can lead to further complications, since the thick layers of fibrous encapsulation may prevent <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> from performing <b>the</b> desired functions. Bacteria may attack the fibrous encapsulation and become embedded into the fibers. Since the layers of fibers are thick, antibiotics {{may not be able to}} reach the bacteria and the bacteria may grow and infect the surrounding tissue. In order to remove <b>the</b> bacteria, <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> would have to be removed. Lastly, the immune system may accept the presence of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> and repair and remodel the surrounding tissue. Similar responses occur when the body initiates an allergic foreign body response. In the case of an allergic foreign body response, <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> would have to be removed.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{following}} the initial successes of <b>the</b> Synthodont <b>implant,</b> Driskell et al. introduced <b>the</b> Titanodont <b>implant.</b> <b>The</b> Titanodont <b>implant</b> {{was composed of}} surgical grade titanium (grade 5, Ti-6Al-4V). <b>The</b> Titanodont <b>implant</b> was unique for three main reasons. First, <b>the</b> Titanodont <b>implant</b> allowed for complete interchangeability with abutments of varying diameters and angles. This interchangeability allowed for a more natural biological width. Second, <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> was grit blasted and acid etched, which provided both a larger surface area and more preferable substrate for cells involved in osseointegration. Third, and perhaps most importantly, <b>the</b> Titanodont <b>implant</b> had a locking taper abutment connection, which allowed 360° of abutment positioning, along with a bacterial seal. Unlike screw-form <b>implants,</b> <b>the</b> locking taper connection design prevents the infiltration of bacteria into <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> crypt and surrounding tissues.|$|R
25|$|Subpectoral (dual plane)The breast implant is emplaced {{beneath the}} pectoralis major muscle, after the surgeon {{releases}} the inferior muscular attachments, {{with or without}} partial dissection of the subglandular plane. Resultantly, the upper pole of the implant is partially beneath the pectoralis major muscle, while the lower pole of the implant is in the subglandular plane. This implantation technique achieves maximal coverage of the upper pole of the implant, whilst allowing {{the expansion of the}} implant's lower pole; however, “animation deformity”, the movement of <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> in the subpectoral plane can be excessive for some patients.|$|E
25|$|Soon after {{deciding}} {{to focus on}} modelling, Beauchamp began a fitness regime {{in order to stay}} in shape. When this caused her breasts to sag, she made the decision to undergo breast augmentation surgery, increasing her cup size from a 32C to a 34D. After a year, finding the saline implants unsatisfactory, she underwent surgery a second time, getting slightly bigger silicone implants and increasing her cup size to 32DD. In 2009, Beauchamp went for an additional breast surgery, this time increasing the silicone implants to 800cc and her cup size 32FF. She dismisses criticism about <b>the</b> <b>implants,</b> deeming it hypocritical to applaud people for improving their intellects while condemning them for improving their bodies.|$|E
25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around <b>the</b> <b>implants.</b> In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of <b>the</b> <b>implants</b> placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E
30|$|The {{external}} morphology of <b>the</b> dental <b>implant</b> is {{a factor}} {{which leads to the}} mechanical engagement of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> with <b>the</b> bone. Three-thread-design dental implants consist of three different thread designs. The first design is the micro-thread, or supra-fine thread, which is on the coronal third of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> fixture and is attached to the cortical bone. These small, fine threads are designed for force distribution, an increase in the bone-implant contact area and a decrease in the force concentration at the abutment-implant connection area. The second design is the reverse buttress thread, which is on the middle third of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> fixture. This design increases the retention between <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> and spongy bone and produces resistance to compressive force. The third design, the condensed thread, is located at the apical third of <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> fixture. <b>The</b> thinness {{at the beginning of this}} thread and an increase in thickness along <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> fixture are designed for the soft spongy bone condensability [2].|$|R
