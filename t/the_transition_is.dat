5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>is</b> more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state {{at room temperature}} upon application of pressure. Whereas <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>is</b> continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E

25|$|Calculations in the 1970s {{suggested}} that it may actually be weakly first-order due {{to the effect of}} long-range fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. In the 1980s it was shown theoretically {{with the help of a}} disorder field theory, in which the vortex lines of the superconductor play a major role, that <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>is</b> of second order within the type II regime and of first order (i.e., latent heat) within the type I regime, and that the two regions are separated by a tricritical point. The results were strongly supported by Monte Carlo computer simulations.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} the superconducting phase {{transition}} was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>is</b> second-order, meaning there is no latent heat. However, {{in the presence of}} an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated that, as a consequence, when the magnetic field is increased beyond the critical field, the resulting phase transition leads to a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting material.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{languages}} {{written in a}} Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in a Latin alphabet, such as Azerbaijani, Uzbek, Serbian and Romanian (in the Republic of Moldova until 1989, in Romania throughout the 19th century). After {{the disintegration of the}} Soviet Union in 1991, some of the former republics officially shifted from Cyrillic to Latin. <b>The</b> <b>transition</b> <b>is</b> complete in most of Moldova (except the breakaway region of Transnistria, where Moldovan Cyrillic is official), Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan, but Uzbekistan still uses both systems. The Russian government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all federal subjects of Russia, to promote closer ties across the federation. This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages; for others, such as Chechen and Ingush speakers, the law had political ramifications. For example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script which is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to use the Chechen Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism.|$|E

Pueblo I people doubled their capacity for food storage from one year to two and built interconnected, year-round residences called pueblos. Many household activities that had previously been reserved for subterranean pithouses were moved to these above-ground dwellings. This altered the function of pithouses from all-purpose spaces to ones used primarily for community ceremonies, although they continued to house large extended families, particularly during winter months.

500|$|In {{recent years}} it has been {{demonstrated}} that nanocrystalline BaFCl:Sm as prepared by a co-precipitation {{can serve as a}} very efficient x-ray storage phosphor. The co-precipitation leads to nanocrystallites of the order of 100-200nm in size and their sensitivity as x-ray storage phosphors is increased an astounding ∼500,000 times because of the specific arrangements and density of defect centres in comparison with microcrystalline samples prepared by sintering at high temperature. The mechanism is based on the reduction of Sm to Sm by trapping electrons that are created upon exposure to ionizing radiation in the BaFCl host. The [...] D- F f-f luminescence lines can be very efficiently excited via the parity allowed 4f →4f 5d transition at around 417nm.
