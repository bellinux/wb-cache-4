40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the allelophatic effect of three {{different}} species of touch-me-not growing in Slovenia. We prepared watter extracts from the roots and leaves of himalayan balsam (I. glandulifera), small balsam (I. parviflora) and touch-me-not plant (I. noli-tangere) that were tested on corn seeds (Zea mays) and radish seeds (Raphanus sativus). The main interest {{was to determine the}} differences in inhibitory effect between all three species, the diferences between root and leaf extracts and if higher concentrates have higher inhibitory effect on <b>tested</b> <b>species.</b> We observed seed germination and measured root and shoot length. In the end of the experiment we harvested both <b>tested</b> plant <b>species</b> and separately weighed roots and shoots. We passed biochemical analysis to determine if the extracts of Impatiens caused an oxidative stress in <b>tested</b> <b>species.</b> To determine the oxidative stress we measured total protein concentration, enzyme activity of guaiacol peroxidase (G-POD) and concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). All of the extracts had inhibitory effects on growth and development of <b>tested</b> plants <b>species.</b> A significant inhibitory effect was observed with I. glandulifera and I. parviflora extracts. The root extracts had higher inhibitory effect compared to leaf exctracts. Extracts increased G-POD enzyme activity in <b>tested</b> <b>species</b> which is a marker of oxidative stress. Higher concentration of extracts had higher inhibitory effect mostly on morphological features compared to oxidative stress parameters...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{bacterial}} strain SSZ 01 isolated from a eutrophic lake in Saudi Arabia dominated by cyanobacterial blooms, showed an antialgal activity against cyanobacteria species. Based on {{the analysis of}} the 16 S rDNA gene sequence, the isolated strain (SSZ 01) most likely belonged to the genus Bacillus with a 99 % similarity to Bacillus flexus strain EMGA 5. The thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of the ethyl acetate extract of this bacterium revealed that this strain can produce harmine and norharmane compared to different β-carboline analog standards. Harmine and norharmane were also detected in considerable amounts in bacterial growth medium, indicating a potential excretion of these compounds into the aquatic environment. The crude extract of Bacillus flexus as well as pure materials of harmine and norharmane inhibited the growth of <b>tested</b> <b>species</b> of cyanobacteria. However, the bacterial crude extract has a higher toxicity against <b>tested</b> <b>species</b> of cyanobacteria than harmine and norharmane. In addition, harmine was more toxic to cyanobacteria than norharmane. On the other hand, neither pure compounds of harmine and norharmane nor crude bacterial extract showed any antialgal activity against <b>tested</b> <b>species</b> of green algae. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that B. flexus SSZ 01 or its crude extract containing harmine and norharmane could be a candidate for the selective control of cyanobacterial blooms without affecting other algal species...|$|R

50|$|A 1996 {{study of}} the {{predictive}} power of the SEM/AVS approach employed laboratory toxicity testing of spiked sediments. Toxic heavy metals, alone and in combination, were added to clean sediments with varying concentrations of AVS.

Ninety-two different trials were conducted, using several <b>test</b> <b>species</b> exposed to cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} kinds of {{toxicity}} tests widely accepted in the scientific literature and regulatory agencies.

50|$|In {{a typical}} early life stage {{toxicity}} test, a flow-through dilutor system administers different concentrations of a toxicant to different test chambers.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out under {{laboratory}} conditions in Department of Grass Science and Greenland Shaping in 2002 - 2004. Studies included six experiment series on Petri dishes set by means of complete randomization method in four replications.

Fifteen seeds of two species were arranged alternately in 1 - centimeter distance on a Petri dish.

50|$|In sediments where SEM/AVS {{was less}} than or equal to 1, only 1.1% of trials showed greater {{toxicity}} than in controls. Where the ratio was greater than 1, 73.5% of trials showed greater toxicity than controls. These results held for both fresh and salt water, for different metal types and <b>test</b> <b>species,</b> and across a range of SEM and AVS concentrations. A study that deployed spiked sediments in a pond found a similar threshold at SEM/AVS = 1 for effects to local benthic fauna. Spike studies that measured heavy metals concentrations in the pore water - that is, before extracting with HCl - found that, when AVS was greater than SEM, pore water heavy metal concentrations were undetectable or nearly so. These results strongly support the basic theoretical framework of the SEM-AVS approach.|$|E
