40|$|Summary. Selective {{amplification}} of {{the line}} and continuum source by microlensing in a lensed quasar can lead to changes of continuum spectral slopes and line shapes in <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quasar components. Comparing <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> different components of the lensed quasar and <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> an image observed in different epochs one can infer the presence of millilensing, microlensing and intrinsic variability. Especially, microlensing can be used for investigation of the unresolved broad line (BLR) and continuum emitting region structure in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Therefore the spectroscopic monitoring of selected lensed quasars with 3 D spectroscopy open new possibility for investigation of the BLR structure in AGN.
