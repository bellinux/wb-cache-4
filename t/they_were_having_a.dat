500|$|Not {{long after}} his arrival in New York, Burnet had the {{assembly}} pass a law banning the Albany-Montreal trade. [...] This action earned him opposition from merchant interests that traded directly with New France, including the Huguenot Stephen DeLancey and other Albany merchants.

[...] The law was fairly easily circumvented: the merchants routed the trade goods through nearby Mohawks who then carried goods to and from Montreal. [...] A law stiffening enforcement of the trade ban was passed in 1722.
