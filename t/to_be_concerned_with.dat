5|$|The discourses {{contained}} {{with this}} gospel seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> {{issues of the}} church–synagogue debate {{at the time of}} composition. It is notable that in John, the community appears to define itself primarily in contrast to Judaism, rather than as part of a wider Christian community. Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism, it gradually separated from Judaism because of mutual opposition between the two religions.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E

5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E
5|$|Another command change {{occurred}} on June 22. In addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> Confederate forces in his rear {{under the command}} of Joseph E. Johnston. He stationed one division {{in the vicinity of the}} Big Black River Bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as Mechanicsburg, both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at Canton, from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele replaced him at the XV Corps. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson. Sherman would eventually pursue Johnston and (re)capture Jackson on July 17.|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} ultrafast {{nonlinear}} optics is broad and multidisciplinary, and encompasses areas <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> both the generation and measurement of ultrashort pulses of light, {{as well as}} those <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the applications of such pulses. Ultrashort pulses are extreme events – both in terms of their durations, and also the high peak powers which their short durations can facilitate. These extreme properties make them powerful experiment tools. On one hand, their ultrashort durations facilitate the probing and manipulation of matter on incredibly short timescales. On the other, their ultrashort durations can facilitate high peak powers which can drive highly nonlinear light-matter interaction processes. Ultrafast Nonlinear Optics covers a complete range of topics, both applied and fundamental in nature, within the area of ultrafast nonlinear optics. Chapters 1 <b>to</b> 4 <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the generation and measurement of ultrashort pulses. Chapters 5 <b>to</b> 7 <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> fundamental applications of ultrashort pulses in metrology and quantum control. Chapters 8 and 9 <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> ultrafast nonlinear optics in optical fibres. Chapters 10 <b>to</b> 13 <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the applications of ultrashort pulses in areas such as particle acceleration, microscopy, and micromachining. The chapters are aimed at graduate-student level and <b>are</b> intended <b>to</b> provide the student with an accessible, self-contained and comprehensive gateway into each subject...|$|R

25|$|The German cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{hastened to}} Samoa after Admiral von Spee {{learned of the}} occupation. He arrived off Apia on 14 September 1914, {{three days after the}} {{departure}} of the last of the Allied cruisers and transports. The approach of the German ships was observed and the New Zealanders promptly manned their defences while many civilians, fearing exchanges of gunfire, made for the hills. By this stage artillery has been set up on the beach but there was no exchange of gunfire. One historian, Ian McGibbon, wrote that this was likely due to von Spee's fears of damage to German property should he open fire. Instead, von Spee steamed off and landed a small party further down the coast and learned from a German resident there the apparent strength of the occupation. Patrols dispatched to the area later interned the German resident. According to the historian J. A. C. Gray, von Spee considered a landing by the forces under his control would only be of temporary advantage in an Allied-dominated sea and so the German ships then made for Tahiti, a French possession. Here, not having <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the welfare of the local population and their property, von Spee would direct the bombardment of Papeete. He then rejoined the rest of his fleet and headed for South America.|$|E
