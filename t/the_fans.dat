5000|$|The processor's {{heatsink}} is permanently attached, and <b>the</b> removable <b>fan</b> module {{is powered}} via spring-like metal prongs that connect to {{a trio of}} conductors {{on the surface of}} the chip. The clip that releases <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> is visible in the first photo, at the top left corner of the CPU. The central plastic [...] "column" [...] that leads from the center of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> houses <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> wiring and leads down the side of the heatsink at this corner. The small plastic points at each top left of this column are the locking mechanism for <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> and are released by squeezing them. The opposite corner of the CPU has a latch that locks <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> around underneath <b>the</b> heatsink, by swinging into place upon assembly. The processor monitors <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> and will throttle back on clock speed to prevent overheating and damage if <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> is not operating.

40|$|Abstract. The {{running state}} of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> has {{significant}} influence on the safety and economy of the power plant unit, so {{it is necessary to}} monitor <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> performance and running state in real time. According to the basic theory of <b>the</b> <b>fan,</b> there is a stable, good nonlinear mapping relation between the inlet pressure difference and flow, which can be utilized to monitor the flow of <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> differential pressure- flow curve model is established by the optimized BP neural network and the modified Support Vector Machine (SVM). The fitting error shows that the improved SVM model is better. Finally, <b>the</b> on-line <b>fan</b> monitoring system software is established by using Visual Basic (VB) language and Matlab programming based on <b>the</b> improved SVM <b>fan</b> differential pressure- flow curve model, which can accurately monitor <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> operation...|$|R

5|$|As a {{response}} to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. Smith released a letter to <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership, and explaining that the reason he rallied them to voice their support before the show was officially cancelled, was that once that happens, there is no going back. He praised Netflix for their support while making the show, and thanked <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> for putting up a great fight to keep it alive. On June 10, 2017, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, explicitly commented the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe.|$|E

50|$|As {{bypass ratio}} increases, the mean radius ratio of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> and {{low-pressure}} turbine (LPT) increases. Consequently, if <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> is to rotate at its optimum blade speed the LPT blading will spin slowly, so additional LPT stages will be required, to extract sufficient energy to drive <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b> Introducing a (planetary) reduction gearbox, with a suitable gear ratio, between the LP shaft and <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> enables both <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> and LP turbine {{to operate at}} their optimum speeds. Typical of this configuration are the long-established Honeywell TFE731, the Honeywell ALF 502/507, and the recent Pratt & Whitney PW1000G.|$|R
50|$|Pulse-width {{modulation}} (PWM) is {{a common}} method of controlling computer fans. A PWM-capable fan is usually connected to a 4-pin connector (pinout: Ground, +12 V, sense, control). The sense pin is used to relay the rotation speed of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> and <b>the</b> control pin is an open-drain or open-collector output, which requires a pull-up to 5 V or 3.3 V in <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b> Unlike linear voltage regulation, where <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> voltage is proportional to <b>the</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> is driven with a constant supply voltage; the speed control is performed by <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> based on <b>the</b> control signal.|$|R

50|$|The {{shape of}} {{alluvial}} fans is mostly influenced tectonically. An alluvial fan can be completely changed due to orogenic thrusting. An alluvial fan {{could have been}} deposited and formed outside of a mountain range, however, thrusting of the mountain belt could cause <b>the</b> alluvial <b>fan</b> to become broken up by the new mountain forming. Thus, <b>the</b> alluvial <b>fan</b> would be split with <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> {{on either side of}} the new mountain range development and could change the steepness of <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b> Tectonic uplift could also influence the shape of alluvial fans. If there was major tectonic uplift prior to the deposition of <b>the</b> alluvial <b>fan,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> would take on a wedge shape with thickest part of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> near <b>the</b> mountain and would continue to thin out the further from the mountain range. If an alluvial fan is lens shaped that is thin on the ends of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> and thicker in the middle, this indicates that tectonic uplift occurred during <b>the</b> alluvial <b>fan</b> deposition. Finally, if an alluvial fan is wedge shaped and <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> is thin on the edges and thick in the middle, this indicates that there was little to no tectonic influence on <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{thickness}} of alluvial fans forming due to basin margins are influenced tectonically. If <b>the</b> alluvial <b>fan</b> gets thicker and the grains become more coarse heading up <b>the</b> <b>fan,</b> {{this indicates that}} the basin margin is tectonically active and the building of <b>the</b> alluvial <b>fan</b> being more active than the deposition rate. However, if <b>the</b> alluvial <b>fan</b> gets thinner and the grains become more fine heading up <b>the</b> <b>fan,</b> this indicate that the basin margin has no tectonic activity or the tectonic activity {{is less than the}} deposition rate or the building of <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fan</b> vote allowed two {{drivers to}} {{transfer}} the main event. Originally scheduled for one driver voted by <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> vote, <b>the</b> rules called for a second in 2016 because of a quirk in the eligibility. There were 16 drivers eligible for the All-Star Race, so the rules were designed so the three Showdown winners and <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> vote winner would make it 20. With Jeff Gordon, eligible by the November 2015 Martinsville win, retired, the runner-up in <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> vote was chosen to advance. If special circumstances warranted the withdrawal of another eligible driver, the third (and subsequent) placed drivers in <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> vote would have also advanced.|$|R
