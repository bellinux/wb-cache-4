5|$|After {{a costly}} legal battle over {{a real estate}} deal with William S. King and the {{financial}} downturn of the Panic of 1893, Menage's real estate empire collapsed and he fled the country to avoid prosecution on charges of embezzlement. The charges against Menage were eventually dropped after several key witnesses had died or become hesitant to <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> him. He spent the later portion of his life working in real estate in the New York City area and never worked in Minnesota again.|$|E

5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the amount}} of money Cox fraudulently {{obtained}} rangefrom $5 million, to more than $15 million, to more than $25 million. He is believed to have fraudulently mortgaged more than 100 properties. Cox is serving a 26-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), a low-security facility in Coleman, Florida. He was ordered to pay $5.97 million in restitution, and <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> his co-conspirators.

Mosakowski informed a judge in 2005 that he planned to bring charges against up to 13 accomplices.|$|E

Massino testified twice for the government, helping win a murder conviction against his acting boss Vincent Basciano in 2011, and was resentenced to time served in 2013, though he will be on supervised release {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In his post-war memoirs, Kesselring {{claimed he}} envisioned making a {{start on the}} {{rehabilitation}} of Germany {{following the end of}} the war. Instead, he was arrested. On 15 May 1945, Kesselring was taken to Mondorf-les-Bains where his baton and decorations were taken from him and he was incarcerated. He was held in a number of American POW camps before being transferred to British custody in 1946. He testified at the Nuremberg trial of Hermann Göring, but his offers to <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> Soviet, American, and British commanders were declined.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of these}} rights {{regulate}} pre-trial procedure: {{access to a}} non-excessive bail, the right to indictment by a grand jury, {{the right to a}}n information (charging document), the right to a speedy trial, and the right to be tried in a specific venue. Several of these rights are trial rights: the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses at trial, the right to confront witnesses at trial, the right to a public trial, the right to a trial by an impartial petit jury selected from a specific geography, and the right not to be compelled to <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> oneself. Others, such as the assistance of counsel and due process rights, have application throughout the proceeding.|$|E

50|$|In police circles, {{this term}} is often applied to an officer who breaks the blue {{wall of silence}} by informing against fellow {{officers}}. Examples include Frank Serpico of the NYPD, who in 1971 famously <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> his corrupt fellow officers, and Ted Briseno, who <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> fellow LAPD officers after the Rodney King incident over 20 years later.|$|R
5|$|Shoup {{was unable}} to {{directly}} influence the Johnson administration, which expanded U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He became increasingly wary of what he felt was undue influence by the CIA and big businesses on foreign policy. In 1964 during {{the debate over the}} Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Senator Wayne Morse wanted to call Shoup to <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> the measure, but was blocked by Senator J. William Fulbright. On 14 May 1966, Shoup began publicly attacking the policy in a speech delivered to community college students at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, California, for their World Affairs Day.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, {{followed}} a regular technique: {{he focused on}} one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted. Hare was chosen and, on 1 December, he was offered immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence and provided the full details {{of the murder of}} Docherty and any other; because he could not be brought to <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> his wife, she was also exempt from prosecution. Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution. On 4 December formal charges were lain against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{that life is}} a right {{and that the government}} will protect the lives of its citizens against other citizens who wish to harm them or their property. The Constitution also allows for the death penalty to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted due process of law and do not have to <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.|$|E

After being called into assist, Mulder and Scully soon discover that a new brand of cigarette has a dangerous secret.|$|E
5|$|Hsin {{wins the}} lottery, but selects the tile {{representing}} his heart. Chao {{comes in and}} tries to persuade one of the game's organisers to let Hsin live but to no avail, causing Chao to knock over {{the table with the}} vases, which reveals the lottery to be fixed. Chao then storms in the room where the surgery on Hsin is about to be carried out and fires at the Hard Faced Man, after which the agents come in and arrest them all, including Chao for covering the existence of the game. They interrogate the Hard Faced Man, but because no one who participated will <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> him, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted. Hsin is brought to the hospital and his daughter is placed on an organ donor list. Chao mysteriously disappears, awakening in a crematorium oven before he is burned alive.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Number 18 {{was one of}} the girls in the storage truck, but that she escaped and ended up at The Pearl. Traumatized, she does not understand what Jason wants. She knows that every girl who has talked about the storage truck incident has been killed and is therefore reluctant to testify. One night Number 18 is injured in a party at the brothel and can barely walk when Jason visits. When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to come home, but Jason believes he is in Bangkok by divine providence. Number 18 comes to understand that Jason is not like the other men who frequent The Pearl, and agrees to trust him and <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> the brothel ring if he can rescue her.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan T. Leete had captained the {{schooner}} Reaper, {{owned by}} James Frisbie, and crewed {{by a man}} of East Asian origin, John Canoe, commonly known as Jackalow, short for John Low or John Lord. After Jonathan gave up command of the Reaper, he and Jackalow worked on Jonathan's father's farm on Sachem's Head in Guilford, Connecticut, where Jackalow was regarded as family. At some point, while in New York, Jackalow had stolen $100 from Jonathan and fled to New Haven. He was returned to New York by the police, but Jonathan refused to <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> him and rehired him. Jonathan and his brother Elijah J. Leete subsequently bought the 30-ton sloop Spray, {{funded in part by}} a mortgage their father took out on his farm. Jonathan (the captain), Elijah, and Jackalow sailed the Spray together for two or three years. By March 1860, Jackalow had sailed with Jonathan for four years.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Lori Fortier were {{considered}} accomplices for their foreknowledge {{of the planning}} of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Fortier agreed to <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> McVeigh and Nichols {{in exchange for a}} reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to twelveyears in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack. On January 20, 2006, after serving ten {{and a half years of}} his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November 1718, Bonnet {{was brought}} to trial before Sir Nicholas Trott, sitting in his {{capacity}} as Vice-Admiralty judge. Trott had already sat in judgment on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to hang. Bonnet was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to <b>testify</b> <b>against</b> Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character witness in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.|$|E
50|$|Anna Zippel behaved {{with great}} dignity during the trial, {{defending}} herself with fearlessness and confidence. Fifty witnesses <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> her. She stated {{that she and}} her husband had made their wealth with hard work and companionship, and {{that she and her}} friend Anna Månsdotter had great skill in making medicine. She said she was proud of the way she treated her children and her servants, and that people had come with these allegations because of jealousy. She said it did not matter how many people <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> her - she was still innocent - and even if all the priests and bishops in the kingdom <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> her, it would not change that fact.|$|R
