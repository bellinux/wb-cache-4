Mickalene Thomas describes the show as follows, “The Whitney Houston Biennial serves as an important platform with which to explore the richness and diversity of contemporary female artists. Through its witty and intelligent programming, the event is a worthy counterweight to the multitude of festivals, biennials and fairs that populate the art calendar. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>fresh,</b> necessary and trans-formative discourse — of which I am happy to support.” ...|$|E
50|$|Nearby Old Shamlaji temple {{is said to}} {{have been}} the {{original}} temple. The temple dedicated to Somnarayan, is, except the adytum, open on all sides, with a flat ceiling, surmounted by a pyramidal roof, supported on plain square stone pillars with carved capitals. Part of the shrine walls seem to have been formed of a series of upright stone slabs with sculptured figures in low relief. Many of these still remain. The most curious thing about the building is that, at the front and rear and both sides, in the centre of the facade the roof ends in a triangular pediment composed of boldly sculptured figures. Inside the building near the shrine, and, on the left hand as one faces it, is a remarkable human head in high relief standing out from the base of the span of an arch. The features are more human-looking than those generally seen in Hindu temples, and the arrangement of the hair is curious. There is a corresponding face on the other side but it is much worn or broken, while <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> and clear in its lines. In the shrine, part of the original altar or image seat still remains. It has been roughly heightened by bricks loosely piled on it, and on the raised superstructure stands a slab with a representation said to be of Somnarayan. This slab probably originally formed part of the outer wall of the shrine.|$|E
5000|$|The Department of Water and Sanitation {{is one of}} the {{departments}} of the South African government. The people’s access to sanitation keeps on improving, to the point that in 1994 only 51% of the population had access to it, whereas in 2012 the percentage was up to an 83.4%. But the issue still lies, with rivers being polluted from agricultural run-offs and such. 0.4% of urban areas still {{do not have access to}} drinking water, as do 18.6% of rural areas. South Africa is democratic, non- racial, non- racist, and they have a united society based on justice, equality, and the human rights of all. But it has not always been so- in 1652 Jan van Riebeeck and 90 men of his landed on South Africa and decided to build a fort and start growing a vegetable garden.In May 2009, following the election of Jacob Zuma, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry was divided, with the forestry responsibility being transferred to the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. 95% of South African population has access to clean and clear drinking water. The number of houses that now have clean water has gone up from 11.3 million to 11.6 million. The Department of Water and Sanitation was established in May 2014 by President Jacob Zuma with former Gauteng Premier Nomvula Mokonyane becoming the first Minister. 70% of the world is water, but only 2.5 percent of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> water- from this 2.5 percent only one is possible to use.|$|E

40|$|Fresh fruit {{consumption}} is being promoted {{for health reasons}} in North America, Europe and other regions. Consumers are responding, {{as evidenced by the}} 20 percent increase in per capita fruit consumption in the past 30 years. US consumers have increased fruit consumption by 23 percent, but they still consume half the amount recommended by the dietary guidelines of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Fruit production often requires significant intervention with pesticides to control pests and diseases. Thus, health conscious consumers increasingly see organic fruit as a logical package. Fruit and vegetable sales account for about 40 percent of the retail sales of organic foods in the US (93 percent of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> produce), with fruit estimated to represent about half of this. In Europe, organic fruit sales represent about five percent of all fruit sales, but the market penetration differs considerably by the specific fruit. Apples, pears, grapes (including grapes for wine, raisins and table grapes), strawberries and peaches are among the top temperate fruits consumed in the US and Europe. These fruits can also be grown in those regions and thus supply a significant share of the organic market...|$|E
