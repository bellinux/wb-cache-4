Basic mechanical responses are first investigated through drained <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests,</b> showing nonlinear stress strain relations, volumetric dilatancy and pressure sensitivity.

In particular, we are interested in diffuse modes which may appear in common <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> on undrained loose sand specimens. A special series of <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> are reported. These tests resemble the common <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> but are modified {{in such a way that}} after the peak in the stress-strain curve, test control is changed from strain-control to stress-control.

40|$|The {{stability}} of a soil mass against progressive failure, {{caused by the}} weight of the soil or superimposed loads may be predicted by comparing, at all points within the soil mass, the shearing, stresses caused by these loads and the shearing resistance of the soil, The two most generally accepted tests for evaluating the shearing resistance of soils area 1. the direct shear test which measures the shearing resistance directly and 2. the <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> which determines the shearing strength of a cylindrical specimen- of soil by measuring the principal stresses required to cause failure, The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> for determining the shearing resistance of soils by comparing the shear resistance of controlled samples of soil as determined by use of a direct shear apparatus and a triaxial compression apparatus. The scope of the present investigation was limited because of time.

40|$|Since {{rocks are}} {{aggregates}} of mineral particles, {{the effect of}} mineral microstructure on macroscopic mechanical behaviors of rocks is inneglectable. Rock samples of four different particle shapes are established in this study based on clumped particle model, and a sphericity index is used to quantify particle shape. Model parameters for simulation in PFC are obtained by <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> of quartz sandstone, and simulation of <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> is then conducted on four rock samples with different particle shapes. It is seen from the results that stress thresholds of rock samples such as crack initiation stress, crack damage stress, and peak stress decrease with the increasing of the sphericity index. The increase of sphericity leads to a drop of elastic modulus and a rise in Poisson ratio, while the decreasing sphericity usually results in the increase of cohesion and internal friction angle.

40|$|Many {{advantages}} are inherent {{to the successful}} powder metallurgy (P/M) process especially in high volume manufacturing. The strength/density distribution of the compacted product is crucial to overall success. The finite element analysis (FEA) method has become {{an effective way to}} numerically simulate strength/density distribution in a P/M compact. The modified Drucker-Prager cap (DPC) model {{has been shown to be}} a suitable constitutive relationship for metal powder compaction simulation. The calibration of the modified DPC model involves a procedure known as a <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test.</b> Equipment for completing a <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> on metal powders is neither readily available nor standardized in the P/M industry. A robust calibration procedure that requires only simple experimental tests would increase the usability of the simulation procedure. This research created a universal cost/time-effective calibration method to accurately determine all parameters of a modified DPC model by using a combination of numerical simulation methods, numerical optimization methods and common material testing techniques. The use of the <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> is eliminated and the new method relies only upon conventional compaction equipment, standard geometry and readily available metallographic techniques. The DPC parameters were determined by applying the proposed method on ferrous powders. The predicted DPC parameters were verified on a compressed product with complex geometry...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} sand grain {{shape and size}} on the {{mechanical}} behavior of geotextile-reinforced sands is investigated in the present research, {{based on the results}} of <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests.</b> Six clean uniform sands differing in grain shape (subangular or rounded grains) and/or grain size as well as one non-woven and three woven geotextiles with or without apertures, were used in this experimental investigation. <b>Triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted on specimens with a diameter of 70 mm and a height of 144 mm, consisting of dry and dense sands reinforced with 3, 5 and 7 horizontal geotextile disks. The geotextile-reinforced sands present higher strength and axial strain at failure than the unreinforced sands. The strength of reinforced sands increases with decreasing sand grain size, with increasing number of geotextile layers and is affected by the grain shape of sand, since it was observed that reinforced sands with subangular grains attain higher strength values than the reinforced sands with rounded grains. The <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> yielded bilinear failure envelopes for all geotextile-reinforced sands...|$|R

Copyright © 2013 by the American Rock Mechanics AssociationA {{thermodynamic}} {{framework is}} proposed {{to model the}} coupled effects of mechanical and thermal stresses in rocks. The model is based on Continuum Damage Mechanics with damage defined as the second-order crack density tensor. The free energy of damaged rock is expressed {{as a function of}} deformation, temperature, and damage. The damage criterion controls mode I crack propagation, captures temperature-induced decrease of rock toughness, and accounts for the increase of energy release rate necessary to propagate cracks in a damaged medium. Two loading paths have been simulated: (1) increase of ambient temperature followed by a <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test,</b> (2) <b>triaxial</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> followed by a confined heating phase. Results show that: (1) under anisotropic mechanical boundary conditions, heating produces damage, (2) higher temperature induces larger damage and deformation, (3) degradation of rock toughness due to an increase in temperature affects the damage threshold. The proposed framework is expected to bring new insights in the design and reliability assessment of geotechnical reservoirs and repositories, such as nuclear waste disposals, geothermal systems, carbon dioxide sequestration systems, and high-pressure gas reservoirs...|$|E
