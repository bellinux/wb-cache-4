5|$|Ida Silverman (31 October 1882 – 1 November 1973) was a Jewish philanthropist, {{who with}} her husband helped found {{approximately}} 100 synagogues, mostly in Israel. She is the only woman to have served {{as vice president of}} <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> Organization of America and the American Jewish Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1925 Silverman {{made her}} {{first trip to}} Palestine {{and was able to}} use her {{experiences}} to gain speaking engagements in a variety of venues. Throughout the remainder of the 1920s, Silverman served as vice president of <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> Organization of America and vice chair of the hospital building fund for the Hebrew University. In addition to her national organizational work, Silverman was vice president of the New England Zionist Region, the New England Conference of Hadassah, and an honorary president of the Hadassah Organization in Providence. She is the only woman to have served as vice president of <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> Organization of America and the American Jewish Congress.|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{argue that}} the British government's {{decision}} reflected what James Gelvin, Professor of Middle Eastern History at UCLA, calls 'patrician anti-Semitism' in the overestimation of Jewish power in both the United States and Russia. American Zionism was still in its infancy; in 1914 <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> Federation had a small budget of about $5,000 and only 12,000 members, despite an American Jewish population of three million. But <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> organizations had recently succeeded, following {{a show of force}} within the American Jewish community, in arranging a Jewish congress to debate the Jewish problem as a whole. This impacted British and French government estimates of the balance of power within the American Jewish public.|$|E

5|$|The {{declaration}} {{was contained}} in a letter dated 2November 1917 from the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild, {{a leader of the}} British Jewish community, for transmission to <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9November 1917.|$|E
5|$|A Russian immigrant, Silverman {{arrived in}} the United States before she was a year old. Her family settled in Providence, Rhode Island, where she {{completed}} her schooling, married and had four children. While doing relief work during the First World War, she {{became aware of the}} depth of social problems and the effects of war on refugees. Joining <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> movement in the 1900s, within a decade she became a motivational speaker, advocating {{for the establishment of a}} permanent Jewish home in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|By 13 June 1917, it was {{acknowledged}} by Ronald Graham, {{head of the}} Foreign Office's Middle Eastern affairs department, that the three most relevant politiciansthe Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Robert Cecilwere all in favour of Britain supporting <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> movement; {{on the same day}} Weizmann had written to Graham to advocate for a public declaration.|$|E
50|$|In this book, Hillel Cohen, {{a scholar}} at the Harry S. Truman Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem {{documents}} the thousands of Arabs, ranging from wealthy absentee landlords to fellahin smallholders, who sold land to Zionist organizations. He shows that everyone understood that control of land was a necessary precondition to fulfillment of national goals, both Jewish and Arab. Cohen explains the varied motives of sellers: Some wanted money, some sold land or acted as intelligence agents for <b>the</b> <b>Zionists</b> even while publicly denouncing land sales, {{but there were also}} non-monetary motivations. Some thought that cooperating with <b>the</b> <b>Zionists</b> would improve <b>the</b> life of their clans and villages. Others thought {{that it was impossible to}} defeat <b>the</b> <b>Zionists</b> and, therefore, wiser to cooperate with them. Others were committed nationalists who believed that staying on the land was paramount, and that working for and cooperating with <b>the</b> <b>Zionists</b> was <b>the</b> strategy that would enable them to stay on the land. Others were driven to collaborate with <b>the</b> <b>Zionists</b> or with <b>the</b> British out of their intense hatred for Hajj Amin al-Husayni.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> American <b>Zionist</b> Movement {{was founded}} in 1993 as a {{successor}} organization of <b>the</b> American <b>Zionist</b> Federation.

5|$|Gunther Erich Rothenberg {{was born}} in Berlin. His family was a {{culturally}} assimilated German Jewish family. In 1937, Rothenberg moved to the Netherlands with his mother; his father later joined them. The family moved next to Britain, where Rothenberg had some schooling. In 1939, he moved to Mandatory Palestine, then under British rule. There he joined <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> movement and Hashomer Hatzair (The Youth Guard), a Socialist-Zionist youth movement. He retained his passion for a Jewish homeland throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s and early 1900s {{there were a}} number of {{resettlement}} plans for European Jews that were precursors to the Madagascar Plan. Paul de Lagarde, an Orientalist scholar, first suggested evacuating the European Jews to Madagascar in his 1878 work Deutsche Schriften ("German Writings"). Members of <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> movement in 1904–1905 seriously debated the British Uganda Programme, by which Russian Jews, who were in immediate danger from ongoing pogroms, would be settled in what today is Kenya. The plan was later rejected as unworkable by <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> Congress. Adherents of territorialism split off from the main Zionist movement and continued to search for a location where Jews might settle and create a state, or at least an autonomous area. The idea of Jewish resettlement in Madagascar was promoted by British antisemites Henry Hamilton Beamish, Arnold Leese, and others. With the cooperation of the French, the Polish government commissioned a task force in 1937 to examine the possibility of deporting Polish Jews to the island. The head of the commission, , felt the island could accommodate 5,000 to 7,000 families, but Jewish members of the group estimated that only 500 or even fewer families could safely be accommodated.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} spurred {{an unintended}} and extraordinary {{increase in the}} number of adherents of American Zionism; in 1914 the 200 American Zionist societies comprised a total of 7,500 members, which grew to 30,000 members in 600 societies in 1918 and 149,000 members in 1919. Whilst the British had considered that the declaration reflected a previously established dominance of <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> position in Jewish thought, it was the declaration itself that was subsequently responsible for Zionism's legitimacy and leadership.|$|E

5000|$|Cohen {{sees the}} Arabs of Mandatory Palestine as split between two positions. There {{were those who}} agreed with al-Husayni that all of Palestine must remain Arab and <b>the</b> <b>Zionists</b> must be fought, and {{there were those who}} argued that <b>the</b> <b>Zionists</b> were too {{powerful}} to be defeated and that, therefore, the path of wisdom lay in some sort of co-existence.|$|R
5|$|President Arthur was {{purchased}} in October 1924 by the Jewish-owned American Palestine Line to begin regular service between New York, Naples, and Palestine. On her maiden voyage to Palestine, she reportedly {{became the first}} ocean liner to fly <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> flag at sea and the first ocean liner ever to have female officers. Financial difficulties for American Palestine ended the service after three roundtrips, and the liner was sold to the Los Angeles Steamship Company for Los Angeles–Honolulu service. Following three years of carrying tourists and freight, the liner burned in Honolulu Harbor in 1930. She was deemed too expensive to repair and was eventually scrapped in Japan in 1933.|$|E
5|$|The first {{high level}} {{negotiation}} between the British and the Zionists can be dated {{to a conference}} on 7 February 1917 that included Sir Mark Sykes and <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> leadership. Subsequent discussions led to Balfour's request, on 19 June, that Rothschild and Chaim Weizmann submit a draft of a public declaration. Further drafts were discussed by the British Cabinet during September and October, with input from Zionist and anti-Zionist Jews but with no representation from the local population in Palestine. The release of the final declaration was authorised by 31 October; the preceding Cabinet discussion had referenced perceived propaganda benefits amongst the worldwide Jewish community for the Allied war effort.|$|E
5|$|While the Apostolic Faith Mission {{was founded}} in 1908 and Pentecostalism brought to South Africa by American missionaries, several factors helped create a {{favorable}} climate for the Pentecostal movement to spread in the country. First, revivals in the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (DRC) in 1860, 1874 and 1884 were characterized by deep conviction of sin followed by conversion, fervent prayer and some ecstatic phenomenon. Thus in 1908, some older DRC members were familiar and open to Pentecostalism. Second, the Dutch Reformed minister Andrew Murray was a prominent holiness teacher and helped create a climate for revival. A third factor was <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> churches, led by John Alexander Dowie from Zion City, Illinois, United States.|$|E

5|$|After Hergé had redrawn The Black Island for {{publication}} in the United Kingdom, his British publishers at that time, Methuen, suggested that alterations be made to Land of Black Gold before releasing it into the UK market. In the original versions Tintin arrived in British-occupied Palestine, where he was arrested by British police before being captured by <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> paramilitary organization Irgun, who mistake him for {{one of their own}} agents. In this revised version Tintin arrives in Khemed, where he is arrested by the Arab military police before being captured and taken to Bab El Ehr. The inclusion of forces from the British Palestinian Mandate and the Irgun were no longer seen as relevant and so were removed from the story. Background detail was changed accordingly, with Jewish shop fronts with Hebrew signage being removed. A number of characters were also dropped, including the British officers Thorpe and Lieutenant Edwards. Whereas earlier versions had contained fictional Arabic script, for the 1971 version this was corrected to real Arabic.|$|E
5|$|In the camp, {{the detainees}} {{suffered}} from tropical diseases and inadequate food and clothing. Jewish {{organizations such as}} the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, the Jewish Agency, and <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> Federation, sent food, clothing, medicine, and religious items to the detainees. Initially, a ban on interaction between the sexes was enforced; the men were held in a former jailhouse and the women in adjacent iron huts. After the ban was lifted, 60 children were born in the camp. In total, 128 prisoners died in the camp, and were buried in the Jewish section of St. Martin Cemetery. At the end of World War II, the detainees were given the choice of returning to their former homes in Europe or immigrating to Palestine. Most chose Palestine, and on August 6, 1945, 1,320 landed in Haifa.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century sources {{refer to}} Palestine as {{extending}} from the sea to the caravan route, presumably the Hejaz-Damascus route east of the Jordan River valley. Others {{refer to it as}} {{extending from the}} sea to the desert. Prior to the Allied Powers victory in World War I and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, which created the British mandate in the Levant, most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Damascus (Syria), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the Vilayet of Hejaz. What later became Mandatory Palestine was in late Ottoman times divided between the Vilayet of Beirut (Lebanon) and the Sanjak of Jerusalem. <b>The</b> <b>Zionist</b> Organization provided its definition of the boundaries of Palestine in a statement to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.|$|E

5|$|The American Palestine Line was a {{steamship}} company, {{formed in}} 1924 in the U.S., {{for the purpose}} of providing direct passenger service from New York to Palestine. It was reportedly the first steamship company owned and operated by Jews. The company negotiated to purchase three ocean liners from the United States Shipping Board, but it was only able to purchase one, , a former North German Lloyd steamer that operated as Princess Alice before being seized by the United States during World War I. After refurbishing the liner, the company inaugurated service between New York and Palestine in March 1925, when President Arthur sailed on her maiden voyage. A crowd of 15,000 witnessed ceremonies that included songs, prayers, and speeches in English and Yiddish. The company claimed that President Arthur was the first ocean liner to fly <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> flag at sea and the first ocean liner ever to have female officers.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was heavily}} involved in World WarII, with many members serving in the armed forces, including Dudley Weinberg, who had succeeded Cohn as assistant rabbi. Children of Israel published a special newsletter for overseas members; {{by the end of}} the war, approximately four hundred congregants had served—and fourteen had died—in the U.S. military. As with many other Reform congregations, the members of Temple Israel were split on the issue of Zionism. It is likely that a majority were anti-Zionist, and the synagogue president joined the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism, though other prominent members supported Zionism, and still others were simply non-Zionist. Ettelson initially opposed Zionism, though he did not join the council. With the growth of antisemitism inside and outside the United States, his views changed, and he was an early member of the local chapter of <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> United Palestine Appeal. Nevertheless, he successfully kept the issue from becoming divisive at the temple.|$|E
5|$|Under Knight Ridder, The Inquirer {{continued}} to be editorially independent. However, conservative commentators have labeled The Inquirer left leaning, and the paper has not endorsed a Republican candidate for President of the United States since Gerald Ford in 1976. Throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, groups supportive of Israel such as <b>the</b> <b>Zionist</b> Organization of America often accused The Inquirer of being anti-Israel. At the same time, Edward S. Herman, a University of Pennsylvania media analyst, has written many articles accusing The Inquirer of having given in to conservative pressure and including a conservative slant in the paper's reporting and editorial page. In 2006, The Inquirer {{became one of the}} only major United States newspapers to print one of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons. Afterwards, protesting the printing of the cartoon, Muslims picketed outside The Inquirer Building.|$|E
