5|$|During {{the course}} of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less {{frequently}} treated as the personification of a supernatural power but becomes increasingly identified as a malevolent human being, a witch. Still later, with the rise of the witch persecution {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, the Bilwis was demonized; she becomes an incarnation of the devil for the witch and sorcerer. A final development has taken place since the sixteenth century, especially in northeast Germany, the Bilwis has been conceived of as a grain spirit bringing wealth; yet this latest manifestation of the Bilwis has its harmful side, the Bilwis-cutter, who is blamed for the unexplained patterns that are formed among the rows of standing grain. The cutter is a sorcerer or witch that cuts down the corn with sickles that are fastened <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet.</b> He is classified as an essentially malevolent Corn Spirit. Thus, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on many appearances and meaning in all German-speaking areas throughout the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one of the strangest and most mysterious beings in all folklore; its varying forms reflect the concerns of a farm culture, and it serves to explain the eerie appearance of turned-down rows of plants in cornfields.|$|E

He savaged Maastricht, poured scorn on monetary union, patronised the PM...and brought the conference (or a good part of it) <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> roaring for more. He stood there, arms aloft, acknowledging the ovation, Norman the conqueror.|$|E

25|$|At the party, Bender is overheard {{saying that}} all the robots are doomed, causing panic. Farnsworth arrives with Fry and Leela and {{delivers}} {{a solution to the}} robots; every last one needs to blast their exhaust vents at the same time, straight up in the sky, in order to push the Earth farther from the Sun, thus cooling the Earth and causing the EMP cannon to miss its target. During the panic Bender and the turtle are knocked onto their backs and cannot get up, leaving not enough exhaust to move the Earth. As Bender is lamenting his fate, the turtle rocks from side to side and rolls <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet.</b> Shocked and inspired, but not to be shown up, Bender does the same, allowing him to release his massive exhaust, just barely saving the robots from the EMP. Farnsworth receives a medal of pollution for his work, and the extra week caused by the new orbit of the Earth is declared Robot Party Week.|$|E
500|$|All {{the donkey}} handler did was laugh. Just as I turned round, the donkey's face was right {{by me and}} it shook its head and I stuck a punch in among it somewhere, and the donkey went down like it was shot ... much to my amazement. But not to as much amazement as the donkey handler's– [...] I've never seen a bloke sober up so quick. It was a hole in one: the donkey {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> and looked really willing to go {{up the hill and}} the donkey handler lost his laugh.|$|E

New Directions {{is the first}} group to compete, and Mercedes arrives {{just in time to}} go onstage with the group, healthy again thanks to Sue. The Troubletones lead off with [...] "The Edge of Glory". Rachel then performs [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now". Carmen arrives during the number, for which Rachel receives a standing ovation. The finale is [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light", which also brings the audience <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet,</b> and gets an approving whistle from Carmen. Later, in the lobby, Jesse approaches Carmen and recommends Rachel for NYADA.|$|E

60|$|The hill offered many {{advantages}} to a force {{standing on the}} defensive. The great eastern road passed close <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>foot,</b> and <b>its</b> possession barred {{the passage of the}} invaders in that direction. The ground between it and the sea was marshy and broken, and its occupation by an English force left the Normans no choice but to come out and attack them.|$|R

500|$|Trauma or illness {{may also}} {{result in a}} cow unable to rise <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] Such animals are {{sometimes}} called [...] "downers." [...] Sometimes this {{occurs as a result}} of muscle and nerve damage from calving or a disease such as mastitis. [...] Leg injuries, muscle tears, or a massive infection of some sort may also be causes. Downer cows are encouraged to get to their feet and have a much greater chance of recovery if they do. If unable to rise, some have survived—with medical care—as long as 14 days and were ultimately able to get back on their feet. Appropriate medical treatment for a downer cow to prevent further injury includes rolling {{from one side to the}} other every three hours, careful and frequent feeding of small amounts of fodder, and access to clean water.|$|E
500|$|At {{the moment}} these skirmishers were rejoining their parent {{battalion}}s, the brigade was ordered <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> {{and started to}} return fire. On {{the left of the}} brigade, where the 7th Dutch Militia stood, a [...] "few files were shot down and an opening in the line thus occurred". The battalion had no reserves and was unable to close the gap. D'Erlon's troops pushed through this gap in the line and the remaining battalions in the Bylandt brigade (8th Dutch Militia and Belgian 7th Line Battalion) were forced to retreat to the square of the 5th Dutch Militia, which was in reserve between Picton's troops, about 100 paces to the rear. There they regrouped under the command of Colonel Van Zuylen van Nijevelt. A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later. Bylandt was wounded and retired off the field, passing command of the brigade to Lt. Kol. De Jongh.|$|E
500|$|Ochs {{described}} himself as a [...] "singing journalist", saying he built his songs from stories he read in Newsweek. By the summer of 1963 he was sufficiently well known in folk circles to be invited to sing at the Newport Folk Festival, where he performed [...] "Too Many Martyrs" [...] (co-written with Bob Gibson), [...] "Talking Birmingham Jam", and [...] "Power and the Glory"—his patriotic Guthrie-esque anthem that brought the audience <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet.</b> Other performers at the 1963 folk festival included Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and Tom Paxton. Ochs's return appearance at Newport in 1964, when he performed [...] "Draft Dodger Rag" [...] and other songs, was widely praised. But he was not invited to appear in 1965, the festival when Dylan infamously performed [...] "Maggie's Farm" [...] with an electric guitar. Although many in the folk world decried Dylan's choice, Ochs was amused, and admired Dylan's courage in defying the folk establishment.|$|E

5000|$|The {{story of}} Su Wu {{is at least}} part of the origin of the use of the image of a flying goose as a {{messenger}} (Alfreda Murck calls it the [...] "locus classicus"), wherein the goose appears carrying a written message tied <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>foot</b> (perhaps symbolically) — a letter between two people separated so far seasonally north and south that a migrating goose could indeed be conceived as a plausible mode of communication.|$|R

He continuously brought the massive crowd <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> with his unorthodox style and free running. From that day, David Campese stamped his mark on the game and within weeks he had been elevated to the Australian team." ...|$|E

[...] Beorn agreed that it was worth trying, and they {{returned}} to the men, rearmed themselves, and spoke to Osgod.|$|R

2500|$|Calf roping, {{also called}} [...] "tie-down roping," [...] {{is an event}} where a calf is roped around the neck by a lariat, the horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws {{it to the ground}} and ties three feet together. (If the horse throws the calf, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> so that the cowboy can do the work. The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope) This {{activity}} is still practiced on modern working ranches for branding, medical treatment, and so on.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{was known}} for {{stirring}} crowds with his oratory. The Huntsville Times interviewed Bill Jones, Wallace's first press secretary, who recounted [...] "a particularly fiery speech in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1964 that scared even Wallace, [...] angrily shouted to a crowd of 1,000 people that 'little pinkos' were 'running around outside' protesting his visit, and continued, after thunderous applause, saying, 'When you and I start marching and demonstrating and carrying signs, we will close every highway in the country.' The audience leaped <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> {{and headed for the}} exit," [...] Jones said, [...] "It shook Wallace. He quickly moved to calm them down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Calf Roping, {{also called}} Tie-down roping, {{is based on}} ranch work in which calves are roped for branding, medical treatment, or other purposes. It is the oldest of rodeo's timed events. The cowboy ropes a running calf around the neck with a lariat, and his horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws {{it to the ground}} and ties three feet together. (If the calf falls when roped, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> so that the cowboy can do the work.) The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope. [...] A well-trained calf-roping horse will slowly back up while the cowboy ties the calf, to help keep the lariat snug.|$|E

She has since sung it at several major events, such as at the Canadian Juno Awards of 2005, where it [...] "brought the audience <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> for a two-minute ovation." [...] Lang also sang it at the 2006 Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame when Cohen {{was inducted into the}} Hall of Fame. Cohen's partner, singer Anjani Thomas, said: [...] "After hearing k.d. lang perform that song at the Canadian Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 2006 {{we looked at each other}} and said, 'well, I think we can lay that song to rest now!

[...] Daly stated that [...] "if anyone was evicted it was the duty of his fellows to assemble in their thousands and reinstate him the next day." [...] James Bryce Killen ended his speech by wishing that [...] "everyone at the meeting were armed with a rifle". On 19 November Davitt, Daly and Killen were arrested {{on a charge of}} using seditious language. Their arrest led to mass protest meetings, Parnell used it to launch a propaganda drive in Britain and the United States, and the authorities failed to achieve a conviction. Moody states that 'The government had thus incurred a great deal of ridicule'.|$|E
