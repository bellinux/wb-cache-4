500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I would also like to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>inviting</b> my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done." ...|$|E

40|$|I thank Mariana García for her {{valuable}} {{contribution in}} preparing this work. I {{want to begin}} by <b>thanking</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>inviting</b> me to this Conference celebrating the copper and mining research center CESCO’s twenty-fifth birthday. It is an honor {{to have the opportunity}} to speak about the impact of the mining industry, and of copper especially, on Chile’s development, given its importance for the country and in which I have great professional interest. Chile is abundant in natural resources. One of the most distinctive characteristics of our economy is its large mining sector, particularly of copper, which places it as the world’s main copper producer. As a country we were blessed by nature with this enormous treasure. But as with every benefit, there can be related costs and risks that must be assessed. For a long time, natural resources have been part of the discussion about economic development. Many years ago, natural resources were thought to be destined to a path of permanent price decline, which served as an argument to push forced industrialization. Such a vision proved to be based on wrong grounds. Nonetheless, development-related problems within the context of natural resource abundance have made their way back to the academi...|$|R

I think this particular conference is a model {{for the rest of the}} world as well. I have not been to a conference where I have seen the combination of academics, employers and those people who are trying to bring the two together – practitioners in that sense, but in a conference of this size and with so many guest speakers. I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> very much <b>for</b> <b>inviting</b> me along <b>for</b> this conversation.

When Bob asked me to serve as your mystery speaker, he told me that the choice of topic was mine to make. After considering the breadth of agricultural education, I chose to focus my remarks on an occurrence that I have observed happening in our profession throughout my professional career. Its intensity has steadily increased over the years to the point that I believe it requires that we consider some changes in how we prepare young people to enter the agriculture teaching profession.

Ethiopia is Africa’s largest producer; major international markets are in the Middle East and South Asia. Improved varieties and extension in East Shewa Zone in the Oromia region have resulted in a 90 % yield increase (2003 - 05 average compared with 2008) and 40 % increase nationwide. The total production of chickpea jumped from 168 thousand metric tons in 2003 - 05 to 312 thousand metric tons in 2008.

Novella gave her father's lectures when he was occupied elsewhere. However, to avoid her beauty from distracting her male students she drew a veil in front of her face (de Pisan, 1982 [1405]).

40|$|<b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> so much <b>for</b> <b>inviting</b> me {{to speak}} {{as part of this}} symposium. It is a great honor to be here in the company of such {{distinguished}} speakers to learn about the impressive legacy of Senator Muskie. My presentation today connects the legacy of Senator Muskie, and specifically, his work on urban development and Model Cities, to contemporary urban development legislation. Thus, this presentation picks up where my co-panelist, Don Nicoll, left off, by considering how the Model Cities legacy is both a foundation of and a counterpoint to contemporary urban development policies and programs. While urban development legislation can come from any level of government, some of the most innovative legislative responses to the challenges faced by cities today are being crafted by local governments themselves. Everyone here can probably think of examples of urban development legislation from their own city, whether it’s Detroit addressing abandoned and vacant housing through a blight reduction plan; Seattle passing a living wage ordinance that will help accommodate the high cost of living in that city; San Francisco promoting community health through urban agriculture zoning; or New Orleans redeveloping public housing in the Treme by integrating subsidized and market-priced housing in a mixed-use development...|$|R

We are among the growing number of scientists who see the need to oppose corporate control of life and our life-support system, and finally, of thought.

40|$|A lecture {{series on}} {{fundamental}} socio-economic rights; from both a Zimbabwean and international perspective. l want to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> very much <b>for</b> <b>inviting</b> {{me to give}} a talk on social and economic rights and constitutional reform. We from LEDRIZ very much identify with the theme I have heard being constantly referred to here of- ‘Nothing for us without us. ” LEDRIZ has been very much involved in research and advocacy work on socio-economic rights including labour rights, and the talk I will give today is based on some of that work. 2 The necessities of life such as food, health, education, housing, basic public utilities (such as water, electricity and sanitation), transport and decent work are socio-economic rights, but this is seldom known by many. These rights are entrenched in international law instruments such as the African Charter of Human and Peoples’ Rights and the UN Charter among others. In South Africa they are enshrined in the Bill of Rights section of their constitution. Zimbabwe inherited from colonialism a dual and enclave economy with a developed and diversified formal economy co-existing alongside an underdeveloped peasant-based subsistence rural economy. The formal sector employed only 20 % of the labour force, 17 % of which were female, with the remaining 80 % in the non-formal sector. Overtime {{with the collapse of}} the formal economy, starting with the adoption of neoliberal policies in the late 1980 s under the Economic Structural Adjustment Programme (ESAP) and subsequently the near collapse of the economy after 2003, this dualism has deepened as the informal sector has expanded tremendously. Formal sector employment declined from 14 % of the population in 1980 to 10 % by 2004 and 6 % by 2006. Now 4 out of 5 jobs are informalised. The levels of poverty increased from 55 % of the population in 1995 to 72 % by 2003 and an estimated 90 % now. Today we face a near collapse of social services, health, education and welfare thereby denying the people their rights. Below I highlight some of the important socio-economic rights that every person is entitled to as recognized under international and regional laws...|$|R
