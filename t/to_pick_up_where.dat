5|$|In 2008, Pegasus Books {{published}} The Tragedy of Macbeth Part II: The Seed of Banquo, a play by American {{author and}} playwright Noah Lukeman that endeavoured <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> the original Macbeth left off, and to resolve its many loose ends, particularly the prophesied ascension of {{the seed of}} Banquo. Written in blank verse, the play was published to critical acclaim. Another book published in 2009 by Penguin Books, Banquo's Son, {{is the first in}} a trilogy that follows on from the Shakespearean story. The novels are written by New Zealand author and English teacher, T.K. Roxborogh.|$|E
5|$|Sam {{died while}} him, Nathan and their {{associate}} Rafe Adler attempted {{to find the}} whereabouts of Henry Avery's Gunsway haul in a Panamanian prison. Nathan and Rafe escaped, while Sam is shot 'dead'. In reality, he was imprisoned once again after his wounds were tended to,a distraught Nate did attempt to find him, still thinking he was alive but was lead {{to believe that he}} was dead by the guards who wanted Sam to rot in prison as revenge for them indirectly killing a guard. 15 years later, he tracks down a retired Nathan and convinces him <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> they left off in the search for the Gunsway haul by feeding Nathan a false breakout story. The story involves Hector Alcazar, who broke Sam free and demands half of the treasure of the Gunsway. These events kick off the main story of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. It is later revealed that Rafe bribed the prison to release Sam, and that Sam double crossed Rafe to resume the search with Nathan.|$|E
5|$|Despite Autumn Games' {{support and}} desire to expand Skullgirls, their {{continued}} litigation prevented the publisher from providing any financial backing. Attempting <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> they left off, Lab Zero Games decided to ask its fanbase for help once more, following {{the success of the}} EVO 2013 charity drive. On February 25, 2013, Lab Zero Games set up an Indiegogo page for Skullgirls, in an effort to raise $150,000 {{for the development of the}} game's first DLC character, Squigly. Contributors received various rewards, including desktop wallpapers, a digital copy of the official soundtrack, Steam keys for the PC release, Steam keys for Half-Minute Hero, and the chance to add a background character to the game, among others. The campaign reached its initial goal in less than 24 hours, while the stretch goal of a second DLC character, Big Band, secured funding in just over 2 weeks. A third DLC character, determined by fan vote, was funded during the final two days, along with a playable robotic version of Ms. Fortune named Robo-Fortune. An additional stretch goal that would provide a free license for the game's engine, Z-Engine, to the developers of Them's Fightin' Herds (at the time called Fighting is Magic) was also funded. With minutes left before the end of the drive, the last stretch goal was met, securing funding for another fan-selected DLC character. The Indiegogo campaign raised nearly $830,000 of its original $150,000 goal. Several alternate character and announcer voice packs were also funded. All downloadable characters and voice packs were free to download on all platforms within the first three months of their release.|$|E
50|$|Love for Sail! was {{the first}} Larry game since the third <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> {{immediately}} <b>where</b> its predecessor left off; typically, it features Larry getting dumped by the woman who represented {{the ultimate goal of}} Larry 6, Shamara.|$|R
50|$|A {{television}} film adaption of the series, Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie, has been green-lit. It is expected <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> from <b>where</b> the series ended and will resolve unanswered plot {{lines of the}} story. The film is scheduled to premiere in November 2017.|$|R
50|$|In Week 14 of the 2013 season, Pitta {{returned}} to on field action {{for first time}} since Super Bowl XLVII. He caught 6 passes for 48 {{yards and a touchdown}} in a 29-26 win against the Minnesota Vikings. Many people stated that he seemed <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> exactly <b>where</b> he had left off.|$|R
25|$|By 1869, Wagner {{was living}} at Tribschen on Lake Lucerne, {{sponsored}} by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. He returned to Siegfried, and, remarkably, was able <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> he left off. In October, he completed the final {{work in the}} cycle. He chose the title Götterdämmerung instead of Siegfrieds Tod. In the completed work the gods are destroyed {{in accordance with the}} new pessimistic thrust of the cycle, not redeemed as in the more optimistic originally planned ending. Wagner also decided to show onstage the events of Das Rheingold and Die Walküre, which had hitherto only been presented as back-narration in the other two parts. These changes resulted in some discrepancies in the cycle, but these do not diminish the value of the work.|$|E
25|$|Capcom later {{released}} Final Fight 2 in 1993, {{a sequel}} created {{specifically for the}} SNES. In this installment, Guy's sensei, Genryusai and his daughter Rena (Guy's fiancee), are kidnapped by the new incarnation of Mad Gear. In the game's story, Guy is off on a training mission and is unable to rescue his fiancee and master. Instead, the game features Guy's sister-in-law, Maki Genryusai, who has also been trained in the same fighting style, and Carlos Miyamoto, a South American swordsman. Guy only makes an appearance {{in the end of}} the game, although the game does feature power-up icons shaped after his character. In Final Fight 3, released in 1995, Guy finally returns to Metro City and teams up with Haggar to rid Metro City of the Skull Cross gang, the latest gang to try <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> Mad Gear had left off. They are joined by Metro City SCU officer Lucia Morgan and former gang member who double crossed the gang, Dean (who wanted revenge when Skull Cross murdered his family). The four succeed, and are able to rid Metro City of the criminals. Metro City is left in shambles, but Guy does not seem to care, and leaves that to Haggar.|$|E
500|$|The Tuskegee Airmen {{decided to}} restore the aircraft. [...] The five-year {{restoration}} occurred at Tri-State Aviation in Wahpeton, North Dakota. [...] In 2007, Gerry Beck, {{one of the primary}} restorers, was in a fatal collision of his P-51A and a P-51D during AirVenture 2007. Beck was the owner of Tri-State Aviation, but about a half dozen other CAF volunteer aviation mechanics contributed to the effort <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> he left off. [...] The rebuilding continued with the mounting of the engine in 2008 and the mating of the wing in 2009. [...] On July 22, 2009, four days before AirVenture 2009 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the P-51C had its first flight. Then, it was flown to Wisconsin for its public debut. [...] After the show it returned to Minnesota with a 6 AT-6 escort. [...] The aircraft has also served a tribute via military flyovers for fallen Tuskegee Airmen.|$|E
50|$|The Cougars {{started the}} 1991 season poised <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> right <b>where</b> they left off. After routing Louisiana Tech 73-3 {{in the first}} game of the season, the next game was a nationally {{televised}} road game against the Miami Hurricanes. They lost 40-10. Houston won only seven more games during the remainder of Jenkins' tenure. He resigned under fire in the spring of 1993.|$|R
5000|$|Star Wars is set <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> from <b>where</b> Return of the Jedi left off, with The Force Awakens {{the first}} in the new trilogy. Additionally, more {{spin-off}} media is also underway with the debut of Star Wars Rebels, a television series set in between the Star Wars prequels and the original trilogy, and an anthology of stand-alone Star Wars films, starting with Rogue One, which was released in December 2016.|$|R
50|$|Yeley also raced in the IRL in 2000 in an underfunded {{effort with}} McCormack Motorsports, but {{ultimately}} returned <b>to</b> USAC racing, <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> {{he had left}} off by winning the 2001 and 2003 National Sprint, 2002 and 2003 Silver Crown, and 2003 National Midget Series titles.|$|R
2500|$|The UN Human Rights Council renewed {{the mandate}} of the Special Rapporteur in 2014. The vote allowed Darusman <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> the Commission left off a month prior. It also called on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to {{establish}} a “field presence” in the country by assigning permanent staff to monitor human rights developments. The office was opened on 23 June 2015. [...] The DPRK reacted by threatening to harm the UN staff affiliated with the new Seoul office.|$|E
2500|$|It stays {{straight}} {{to its first}} major intersection, the northern terminus of NY397 a mile later, which is followed [...] later by a junction with NY158 just east of Watervliet Reservoir. After another , CSX's main line crosses over the highway again. Development begins <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> NY146 comes in from the north for a short overlap that ends at Hartmans Corners and Tawasentha Park. The road reaches the Albany suburbs two miles (3km) to the east, where NY155 intersects US20 in Westmere. Just beyond the community is Crossgates Mall, a major Albany-area destination. Immediately east of the mall is US20's first crossing of the Thruway, now I-87, since the southern Buffalo suburbs, and {{the southern end of}} Fuller Road Alternate, an extension of the Adirondack Northway, in an area known as McKownville.|$|E
2500|$|Sherwood's hard luck, unfortunately, did {{not stop}} there, and he was plagued with a {{frustrating}} amount of mechanical problems. For starters, he loses his battery box and batteries (resulting in two days lost while a replacement box is fabricated on the spot), suffers a flat tire, and then experiences problems with his truck’s on-board computer that forces him to abandon a load on the roadside. Sherwood ends up driving the truck of expelled driver Todd White just <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> he left off, yet ends up suffering through problems in that truck, as well (as seen in episode 7). [...] Hugh Rowland, the truck's owner, and Lee Parkinson, Rowland's mechanic, blamed many of these mechanical problems squarely on Sherwood. Sherwood ultimately decides enough is enough and leaves the ice roads to return home.|$|E
50|$|The Raiders {{moved to}} the Big 12 for the 1996-97 season, and {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> right <b>where</b> they left off with a solid 19-9 season. It was discovered during the inaugural Big 12 basketball tournament, however, that two players had played the entire season while academically ineligible. Hours after the team's first-round game, Texas Tech {{announced that it was}} withdrawing from postseason consideration and forfeiting its entire conference schedule. The Raiders had lost that game, and would have had to forfeit it if they had won.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} set in the Australian Outback during the 1920s and deals with one year {{in the life of the}} Carmody family. Paddy Carmody, Australian-born son of Irish migrants, is an {{itinerant}} worker, travelling the country with his wife Ida and son Sean in a horse-drawn wagon. Whilst Ida longs to settle in a place of their own, Paddy is unwilling to abandon his way of life and continues <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> work <b>where</b> he can. He takes cattle-droving jobs and also sheep-shearing - which he doesn't like, but pays well.|$|R

2500|$|The Hurricanes looked poised <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> {{they left}} off in 2002–03, but never {{recovered}} from a 10-loss January and finished dead last in the league with 61 points. [...] After a similarly slow start to the 2003–04 season, Paul Maurice, {{who had been the}} team's coach since midway through their next-to-last season in Hartford, was fired and replaced with former New York Islanders bench boss Peter Laviolette. Under Laviolette, Weekes remained tough, but the offense was suspect; center Josef Vasicek led the team with a mere 19 goals and 26 assists for 45 points. Many of the new fans attracted to the team (and to hockey itself) during the 2002 playoff run lost interest and attendance declined. One of the few positive results of these losing years, however, was the team's drafting of future star Eric Staal in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Stephanie Maslansky, {{talking about}} the inspiration and vision for the series, said [...] "Daredevil {{is rooted in the}} authentically gritty New York City neighborhood, Hell's Kitchen where Matt Murdock grew up. In the comics—particularly those of the Frank Miller era in the early 1990s—there were detailed illustrations we endeavored to bring to life in a grounded, gritty, and updated way, with respect and a strong nod to the original characters. We wanted <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> the comics version left off. I studied the illustrations from The Man Without Fear, Daredevil Yellow, and the issues of the 1960s, to which the newer collections pay homage. I wanted the costume design to reflect the illustrations of those volumes through a modern lens while maintaining a retro sensibility." [...] Joshua Shaw, who has also done design work on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., helped design costumes for several characters on Daredevil, while Lorraine Calvert took over as costume designer for the second season.|$|E

In addition to appearing in musicals she made a variety of Westerns where she learned how to ride a horse. She made a variety of television appearances with a planned series Queen of the Range never coming to be. She stated she only left making films when they no longer made B Westerns.|$|R
50|$|Instead, {{the player}} should find a pirate who was {{blocking}} {{access to an}} exit (or perhaps a power-up) and kill him with it, thus advancing progress through the game. This strategic rationing of cutlasses (i.e. knowing <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> them <b>up</b> and <b>where</b> <b>to</b> use them) in order to progress around the island was a major gameplay element.|$|R
50|$|A new film, Return to Sleepaway Camp, was {{completed}} in 2003 and initially struggled to complete visual effects. It was directed by Robert Hiltzik, {{the director of the}} original 1983 film. He decided that this chapter will ignore the story lines of the previous sequels, stating that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> from <b>where</b> the original film ended. According to Fangoria.com the digital effects were redone from 2006 to 2008. The film found distribution, and was released November 4, 2008, by Magnolia/Magnet Pictures. Review copies of the film had been sent out, and the movie's screener had already been leaked prior to the release, ruining the surprise ending.|$|R

2500|$|It {{was only}} with the {{societal}} upheavals associated with the year 1968, which in Switzerland as elsewhere in the West began to move the mainstream of academic thought to the political Left, that the approach of Swiss historians began <b>to</b> shift again. <b>Picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>where</b> Rappard and Fueter had left off, historians of the 1960s and 1970s published large treatises on {{the social and economic}} history of Switzerland.|$|R

First she composed the Songs of Milarepa, followed by Jetsun Mila, an evocation of the life of this great master; the creation of these works was sponsored by the French government.|$|R
