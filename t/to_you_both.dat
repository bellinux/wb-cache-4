500|$|On May 14, 1995, a {{referendum}} {{was conducted in}} all regions of Belarus. Out of four questions, one was the following: [...] "Do you support {{the introduction of the}} new national symbols?" [...] With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new state symbols were approved by a ratio of 3:1 (75.1% to 24.9%). The way the referendum was carried out was heavily criticized by the opposition, including the exact wording of the question about the national insignia. Supporters of the Pahonia also criticize that the Pahonia and the former white-red-white flag were compared to ones, used by collaboration forces, in propaganda that was published during the run-up to the vote. The comparison was made due to the white, red, white flag and Pahonia being used on the patches and symbols of the Belarusian Central Rada, the Belarusian government under the control of Nazi Germany. Alexander Lukashenko claimed the selection of the Soviet-inspired symbols as a victory, especially to his Great Patriotic War veteran base, by saying [...] "we have returned to you the flag of the country for which you fought. We have returned <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> memory and a sense of human pride." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] said John. [...] "I'm much obliged <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> You're {{certainly}} {{there with the}} goods as fighting editors. I don't know what I should have done without you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suspect {{none that}} belong <b>to</b> <b>thee.</b> <b>Both</b> thy father and thyself, Gelsomina, are placed {{here by the}} {{interposition}} of the saints, that the fiends should not have too much power on earth." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CHESHIRE. Is {{his love}} big enough <b>to</b> carry <b>you</b> <b>both</b> over everything?.... <b>You</b> know it isn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "'My horse, {{after three}} hours' rest, {{will be able}} <b>to</b> carry <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> <b>You</b> can sit behind Saleh, and hold him on with your {{unwounded}} arm.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Forgive!' cried Tom. 'I'll {{never forgive}} you {{as long as}} I live, Martin, if you say another {{syllable}} about it. Joy <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both!</b> Joy, my dear fellow, fifty thousand times.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You saw me at Soto's, {{the night}} that Victor Bidlake was murdered," [...] he {{reminded}} her. [...] "I stood quite close <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> while you were waiting for your taxi." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and Miss Fairclough," [...] Lessingham went on, [...] "have rather {{scoffed at}} my {{presence}} here {{on behalf of}} our Secret Service. It seemed <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> very ridiculous. Now you understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Tommy,' said Merton, 'we must waken Batsy, and Miss Blossom {{is going}} <b>to</b> take <b>you</b> <b>both</b> home. Hope we shall often meet.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean {{either to}} bring her back with me here to her father and <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> or <b>to</b> make an {{appointment}} with her <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>both</b> where she is now living," [...] I replied.|$|R
6000|$|... "The young man," [...] I continued, [...] "will {{be here in}} ten minutes--perhaps sooner--prepared <b>to</b> grasp <b>you</b> <b>both</b> by {{the hand}} and {{exchange}} reminiscences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good night, my boy. May this {{friendship}} {{of yours}} be a lifelong stay and blessing <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> {{even though it}} may cost you some pain and self-command, as all good things must, Aubrey.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, Tom, a fool and {{his money}} are soon parted. There's a five-pound note for him, you begging, insinuating dog, and be hanged <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both!</b> I shall {{die in the}} workhouse at this rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her ladyship ignored him. [...] "He owes it <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> {{that you}} have estranged him from his father, set up a breach between them that is never like to be healed. 'Tis what he owes you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I will {{be equally}} so <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now. <b>Both</b> I and your {{daughter}} are absolutely ruined unless you reconsider your purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father was {{so pleased}} <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>both</b> come in," [...] she said, softly; [...] "itâ€™s very dull for him here of an {{afternoon}} with only me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{and all our}} hearty and childlike salutations <b>to</b> <b>you</b> [...] <b>both,</b> and <b>to</b> {{the good}} Nane" [...] (Nanette) [...] "my brotherly [...] salutation.|$|R
6000|$|Robert's {{best regards}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> always, {{and he is}} no believer in {{magnetism}} (only I am). Do mention Mr. C. Hanford's health. How strange that he should come to witness my marriage settlement! Did you hear? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] {{he remarked}} {{in his most}} offhand manner, [...] "I am much obliged <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> On sober {{reflection}} I {{have come to believe}} that you did the very best thing for my reputation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--they make it {{infinitely}} worse. He {{should have}} felt {{himself to be}} debarred from writing <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>both</b> as being my wife and as being {{the wife of the}} man whom he intends to oppose at Silverbridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well then, I come <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>both</b> that I {{am ready}} to find the money to meet those {{mortgages}} and to pay them off in full." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to {{interrupt}} this little feast," [...] Mr. Cullen said, [...] "but I shall have <b>to</b> trouble <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>to</b> come {{with me for a}} short time." ...|$|R
6000|$|O Catherine! (for of all interjections, [...] <b>To</b> <b>thee</b> <b>both</b> oh! and ah! belong {{of right}} [...] In love and war) how odd are the {{connections}} [...] Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight! [...] Just now yours were cut out in different sections: [...] First Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite; [...] Next of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch; [...] And thirdly he who brought you the despatch! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Soames; [...] "you think so! I came to {{tell you}} that I'll divorce her with every {{circumstance}} of disgrace <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> unless you swear to keep clear of each other from now on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doubt {{not that}} he will come back <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> safe and prosperous, my fair dame," [...] quoth Sir Nigel. [...] "Meanwhile it grieves me that as I have already given my purse to a beggar up the road I----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Robert's love <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> We often talk of our {{prospect}} of meeting you again. And for the past, dearest Aunt Nina, believe {{of me that}} I feel to you more gratefully than ever I can say, and remain, while I live, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Speak out, old boy--you're {{talking to}} a friend. I have chosen <b>you</b> <b>to</b> serve <b>you,</b> <b>both</b> as one I like, and as the oldest captain in the fleet. Whoever catches that ship will hear more of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>both</b> so ruddy; Cobhurst air {{must agree}} with you. And now, before we say {{anything}} else, {{let me ask}} you a question: Have you had your supper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad <b>to</b> meet <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> nevertheless. Since {{my husband}} likes you, I am sure to do so;" [...] {{and she smiled}} pleasantly, as she gave a hand to each.|$|R
60|$|I am old; I {{recognize}} it but I don't realize it. I wonder {{if a person}} ever really ceases to feel young--I mean, for a whole day at a time. My love <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> and {{to all of us}} that are left.|$|E
6000|$|... "I drink <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> {{with the}} {{greatest}} pleasure," [...] he said, looking John full in the face. [...] "It is a most remarkable coincidence. To-night is {{the anniversary of the}} night when Louise Maurel pledged herself to me in somewhat different fashion!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm much obliged <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> for warning me that I am {{so easy to}} deceive," [...] the General remarked satirically. [...] "Unfortunately, the {{mischief}} is done. Three {{men have}} answered my advertisement already. I expect them here tomorrow to be examined for the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need help}} and sympathy more, Anna," [...] he pleaded, [...] "and I {{have the right}}, yes I have the right <b>to</b> offer <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> I will not be sent away." ...|$|R
