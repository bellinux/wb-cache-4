5|$|Boisselier {{became the}} {{scientific}} director of Clonaid, an organization founded by Raël that sought <b>to</b> <b>clone</b> humans, in 1997. That year, Boisselier {{was interviewed by}} Le Monde about her role in Clonaid, and she lost her position with Air Liquide after the company learned of this. Air Liquide stated that her termination was due to her holding dual employment, {{and that she was}} strained by her Clonaid service. She filed a lawsuit against Air Liquide, arguing that she was the victim of religious discrimination. Her suit was successful: in 1999, she won a judgment of about US$30,000.|$|E
5|$|Brigitte Boisselier (born 1956), {{also known}} as Brigitte Roehr, is a French chemist and Raëlian {{religious}} leader {{best known for her}} claim to have overseen the creation of the first human clone. A native of Champagne-Ardenne, she studied chemistry in France and the United States, earning two PhDs. From 1984 to 1997, she lived near Paris and worked as a research chemist and a sales manager for Air Liquide. She embraced Raëlism in 1992; the group was unpopular in France and her conversion led to tensions with those around her. Five years later, she joined Clonaid, a Raëlian organization that sought <b>to</b> <b>clone</b> a human. After her service as their scientific director was publicized, she lost her position with Air Liquide and focused on cloning full-time.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Mason Wren (J. E. Freeman) {{is one of}} five {{scientists}} {{employed by}} the USM <b>to</b> <b>clone</b> the Alien Queen. After the Queen is extracted from Ripley, Wren conducts social experiments on Number 8 (whom he considers a predator). He discovers Call infiltrating Number 8's cell, and orders the mercenaries rounded up for execution. They overpower the infantry and take Wren hostage, forcing him to lead them to the Betty. During an Alien attack, Wren shoots Call and escapes from his captors. He confronts the crew of the Betty aboard the ship as Larry Purvis' Alien begins to emerge from his chest. Wren shoots Purvis, who overpowers him and pulls Wren's head to Purvis' chest. The chestburster erupts through Purvis' rib cage and Wren's skull, killing them both.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the populations}} of cheetah in India saw a drastic fall. The last {{physical}} evidence of the cheetah in India {{was thought to be}} three individuals, all shot by the Maharajah of Surguja (a man also noted for holding a record for shooting 1,360 tigers), in 1947 in eastern Madhya Pradesh, but a female was sighted in Koriya district, present-day Chhattisgarh, in 1951. During the early 2000s, scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, proposed a plan <b>to</b> <b>clone</b> Asiatic cheetahs obtained from Iran. India asked Iran to transport one live pair to India, or, if that was not possible, allow them to collect sperm and eggs of the cheetah pair in Iran itself. However, Iran rejected both proposals.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} in which multiple Alien Bounty Hunters appear involved {{the use of}} motion control, a method in which a motion-control camera on a computerized module is repeatedly run through the same motion while elements are continually added. The shot, according to John Wash, {{was one of the}} few times in the series in which the production crew was able to use motion control and therefore presented a slight challenge. In the filming of the sequence, both a blank plate, for just the set, and lighting elements, that were in the set, were shot before the production crew filmed five different passes, each one with the Alien Bounty Hunter in a different position. The production crew were finally able <b>to</b> <b>clone</b> the Bounty Hunter by blending all the passes together.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, {{scientists}} tried <b>to</b> <b>clone</b> the extinct Pyrenean ibex (C. p. pyrenaica).

In 2009, a second attempt was made <b>to</b> <b>clone</b> the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.|$|E

40|$|Code Cloning is {{regarded}} as a threat to software maintenance, because it is generally assumed that a change <b>to</b> a code <b>clone</b> usually has <b>to</b> be applied <b>to</b> the other <b>clones</b> of the clone group as well. However, there exists little empirical data that supports this assumption. This paper presents a study on the changes applied <b>to</b> code <b>clones</b> in open source software systems based on the changes between versions of the system. It is analyzed if changes <b>to</b> code <b>clones</b> are consistent <b>to</b> all code <b>clones</b> of a clone group or not. The results show that usually half of the changes <b>to</b> code <b>clone</b> groups are inconsistent changes. Moreover, the study observes that when there are inconsistent changes <b>to</b> a code <b>clone</b> group in a near version, it is rarely the case that there are additional changes in later versions such that the code clone group then has only consistent changes...|$|R

25|$|Virtually any DNA {{sequence}} can be cloned and amplified, {{but there}} are some factors that might limit the success of the process. Examples of the DNA sequences that are difficult <b>to</b> <b>clone</b> are inverted repeats, origins of replication, centromeres and telomeres. Another characteristic that limits chances of success is large size of DNA sequence. Inserts larger than 10kbp have very limited success, but bacteriophages such as bacteriophage λ can be modified to successfully insert a sequence up to 40 kbp.|$|E
