5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Brussels was still in many ways a medieval city. The royal quarter in the upper town, inhabited mainly by the nobility and the richer members of the bourgeoisie, was upscale and modern. The rest of the city, however, in particular the lower town, located in the western half of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon,</b> <b>was</b> densely populated and industrial, characterized by an illogical street layout, back alleys, narrow streets, and numerous dead ends.|$|E
5|$|In Arlington County, The Pentagon Memorial was {{completed}} and {{opened to the}} public on the seventh anniversary of the attacks in 2008. It consists of a landscaped park with 184 benches facing the Pentagon. When <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> repaired in 2001–2002, a private chapel and indoor memorial were included, located at the spot where Flight 77 crashed into the building.|$|E

5|$|The damaged {{section of}} <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt and {{occupied}} {{within a year}} of the attacks. The temporary World Trade Center PATH station opened in late 2003 and construction of the new 7World Trade Center was completed in 2006. Work on rebuilding the main World Trade Center site was delayed until late 2006 when leaseholder Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed on financing. The construction of One World Trade Center began on April 27, 2006, and reached its full height on May 20, 2013. The spire was installed atop the building at that date, putting 1 WTC's height at 1,776 feet (541m) and thus claiming the title of the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. One WTC finished construction and opened on November 3, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the World Trade Center and nearby infrastructure caused serious damage to the economy of Lower Manhattan and {{had a significant effect}} on global markets, resulting in the closing of Wall Street until September 17 and the civilian airspace in the U.S. and Canada until September 13. Many closings, evacuations, and cancellations followed, out of respect or fear of further attacks. Cleanup of the World Trade Center site was completed in May 2002, and <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> repaired within a year. On November 18, 2006, construction of One World Trade Center began at the World Trade Center site. The building was officially opened on November 3, 2014. Numerous memorials have been constructed, including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by American architect George Bergstrom (1876–1955), and built by general contractor John McShain of Philadelphia. Ground was broken for construction on September 11, 1941, {{and the building}} was dedicated on January 15, 1943. General Brehon Somervell provided the major motive power behind the project; Colonel Leslie Groves was responsible for overseeing the project for the U.S. Army.|$|E

25|$|Representative Duncan D. Hunter {{announced}} plans in January 2011 {{to introduce a}} bill designed to delay the end of DADT. His proposed legislation required all of the chiefs {{of the armed services}} to submit the certification at the time required only of the President, Defense Secretary and Joint Chiefs Chairman. In April, Perkins of the Family Research Council argued that <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> misrepresenting its own survey data and that hearings by the House Armed Services Committee, now under Republican control, could persuade Obama to withhold certification. Congressional efforts to prevent the change in policy from going into effect continued into May and June 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> done {{during a time}} when parts of the U.S. were under legally-mandated racial segregation. This had structural consequences to the design of the building. Under the supervision of colonel Leslie Groves, the decision to have separate eating and lavatory accommodations for white persons and black persons was made and carried out. The dining areas for black persons were put in the basement and on each floor there were double toilet facilities separated by gender and race. These measures of segregation were said to have been done in compliance with the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia's racial laws. The Pentagon as a result has twice the number of toilet facilities needed for a building of its size.|$|E
25|$|Contracts totaling $31,100,000 were {{finalized}} with McShain and {{the other}} contractors on September 11, and ground was broken for the Pentagon the same day. Among the design requirements, Somervell required the structural design to accommodate floor loads of up to 150 pounds per square foot, which was done in case the building became a records storage facility at some time {{after the end of}} the current war. A minimal amount of steel was used as it was in short supply during World War II. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> built as a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the Potomac River, and a lagoon was created beneath the Pentagon's river entrance. To minimize steel usage, concrete ramps were built rather than installing elevators. Indiana limestone was used for the building's façade.|$|E

25|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the city's {{population}} grew rapidly {{with the creation}} of additional Federal agencies under the New Deal programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, during which most of the Federal Triangle buildings were constructed. World War II brought further population increases and a significant housing shortage, as existing residents were urged to rent rooms to the influx of Federal staffers who arrived from throughout the country. During the war, as many as 200,000 railroad passengers passed through Union Station in a single day. <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> built in nearby Arlington to efficiently consolidate Federal defense offices under one roof. One of the largest office buildings in the world, it was built rapidly {{during the early years of}} the war, partially opening in 1942, and complete in 1943.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} stimulus of the World War brought full employment for workers, high wages, and high profits for farmers. It brought in {{many thousands of}} soldiers and sailors for training. Virginia sent 300,000 men and 4,000 women to the services. The buildup for the war greatly increased the state's naval and industrial economic base, as did the growth of federal government jobs in Northern Virginia and adjacent Washington, DC. <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> built in Arlington as the largest office building in the world. Additional installations were added: in 1941, Fort A.P. Hill and Fort Pickett opened, and Fort Lee was reactivated. The Newport News shipyard expanded its labor force from 17,000 to 70,000 in 1943, while the Radford Arsenal had 22,000 workers making explosives. Turnover was very high—in one three-month period the Newport News shipyard hired 8400 new workers as 8,300 others quit.|$|E
25|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> built, the United States Department of War was {{headquartered}} in the Munitions Building, a temporary structure erected during World War I along Constitution Avenue on the National Mall. The War Department, {{which was a}} civilian agency created to administer the U.S. Army, was spread out in additional temporary buildings on the National Mall, as well as dozens of other buildings in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. In the late 1930s a new War Department Building was constructed at 21st and C Streets in Foggy Bottom but, upon completion, the new building did not solve the department's space problem and ended up {{being used by the}} Department of State. When World War II broke out in Europe, the War Department rapidly expanded in anticipation that the United States would be drawn into the conflict. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson found the situation unacceptable, with the Munitions Building overcrowded and the department spread out.|$|E

25|$|On September 11, 2001, the 60th {{anniversary of}} the Pentagon's groundbreaking, a team of five al-Qaeda {{affiliated}} hijackers took control of American Airlines Flight 77, en route from Washington Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport, and deliberately crashed the Boeing 757 airliner into {{the western side of}} the Pentagon at 9:37am EDT as part of the September 11 attacks. All 59 civilians and the 5 terrorists on the airliner were killed, as were 70 civilians and 55 military personnel who were in the building. The impact of the plane severely damaged the outer ring of one wing of the building and caused its partial collapse. At the time of the attacks, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> under renovation and many offices were unoccupied, resulting in fewer casualties. Only 800 of 4,500 people who {{would have been in the}} area were there because of the work. Furthermore, the area hit, on the side of the Heliport facade, was the section best prepared for such an attack. The renovation there, improvements which resulted from the Oklahoma City bombing, had nearly been completed.|$|E
500|$|In August 1939, the Secretary of War {{relocated}} his offices {{from the}} overcrowded State-War-Navy Building (Old Executive Office Building) to the Munitions Building.

According to Time, the U.S. military had been effectively forced to rely on nonskeds such as Imperial Airlines to carry troops within the U.S. because of the combination of two laws. First, the Congress had mandated the use of civilian air carriers (for economic reasons); and second, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>was</b> obligated to bid for such services and select the lowest bidder, which often turned out to be financially unsound companies with a poor safety record.|$|E
