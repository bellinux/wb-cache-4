5|$|He {{was finally}} able <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic by {{capturing}} Lissus and its seemingly impregnable citadel, after which the surrounding territories surrendered. Perhaps the capture of Lissus rekindled in Philip hopes of an Italian invasion. However {{the loss of his}} fleet meant that Philip would be dependent on Carthage for passage to and from Italy, making the prospect of invasion considerably less appealing.|$|E

5|$|A URN is a URI that {{identifies}} a resource by {{name in a}} particular namespace. A URN {{may be used to}} talk about a resource without implying its location or how to access it. For example, in the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) system, ISBN 0-486-27557-4 identifies a specific edition of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The URN for that edition would be urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4. <b>To</b> <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> book, its location is needed, for which a URL would have to be specified.|$|E

The GID and the CIA {{thought they had}} turned al-Balawi to penetrate al-Qaeda in the Pakistani tribal areas to provide intelligence for high-level targets. Instead, al-Balawi used this trust <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CIA base in Afghanistan unsearched and perpetrate the attack. The Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda claimed responsibility, saying they helped al-Balawi with the attack.|$|E

Two U.S. Marshals receive a similar phone call about an escaped prisoner. The drug dealers arrive in pairs as the man attempts <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> files. Just as he does, the two Marshals appear and order everyone onto the floor, causing a shootout.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 2006, over 600 people {{attended}} {{a protest against}} the high carbon emissions. It was coordinated by the Camp for Climate Action group.

5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} {{recorded}} {{of the first}} twenty years of Egbert's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s. The historian Richard Abels argues that {{the silence of the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was probably intentional, concealing Egbert's purge of Beorhtric's magnates and suppression of rival royal lines. Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish subjects were distant. Kentish ealdormen did not attend the court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury (805–832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's primary concern seems to have been <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wealth of Kent. His successors Ceolwulf I (821–23) and Beornwulf (823–26) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, Baldred.|$|E
5|$|Charles trusted Isabeau {{enough by}} 1402 {{to allow her}} to {{arbitrate}} the growing dispute between the Orléanists and Burgundians, and he turned control of the treasury over to her. After Philip the Bold died in 1404 and his son John the Fearless became Duke of Burgundy, the new duke continued the political strife in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> royal treasury for Burgundian interests. Orléans and the royal dukes thought John was usurping power for his own interests and Isabeau, at that time, aligned herself with Orléans to protect the interests of the crown and her children. Furthermore, she distrusted John the Fearless who she thought overstepped himself in rank—he was cousin to the King whereas Orléans was Charles' brother.|$|E

Additionally, Edaniel and Edrear's other sister, Elala, is found dead. After Edaniel and Edrear lock down the mausoleum, they send Dinah home and she discovers that Maphohetka, a girl hanged for witchcraft and who now as a ghost can control minds in the real world, is manipulating Eniri and the townspeople. Unsuccessful in her attempt to stop her, Dinah flees to the mausoleum and receives a special outfit melted from the gold tolls that she and Vincent paid <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mausoleum. Returning, she confronts Maphohetka, who then orders Edaniel to kill her.|$|E

A computer is {{plugged into the}} dock using a Thunderbolt port in order <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
5|$|Jurassic Park's lead {{computer}} programmer, Dennis Nedry, {{having been}} bribed by Hammond's corporate rival Lewis Dodgson, deactivates the park's security system <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> embryo storage {{room where he}} steals the valuable fetilized embryos. Nedry stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as Barbasol shaving cream, supplied by Dodgson. Because of Nedry, the power goes out and the tour vehicles become stuck. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the Tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the tour group. Grant, Lex, and Tim escape, while the Tyrannosaurus injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus.|$|E

Meanwhile, Doggett has gathered enough evidence to track Mulder's whereabouts before his so-called abduction, discovering that Mulder was dying and had his name engraved in his family's gravestone to mark his death in 2000. Later on, more evidence of high UFO activity in Clifton, Arizona is found by The Lone Gunmen. Concurrently, Doggett receives information about Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) when someone slips his file under his door.|$|E

Since 2006 the Bolivian government have nationalized oil and gas projects and is keeping a tight control over mining its lithium reserves. Already the Japanese and South Korean governments, as well as companies from these two countries and France, have offered technical assistance to develop Bolivia's lithium reserves and are seeking <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lithium resources through a mining and industrialization model suitable to Bolivian interests.|$|E
