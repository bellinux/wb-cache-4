5|$|Quoting the Jewish rabbi and scholar Jacob Neusner, Pope Benedict XVI {{explains}} that to Israel, keeping this commandment {{was more than}} ritual; {{it was a way}} to imitate God, who rested on <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>day</b> after the creation.

5|$|Deshasth Brahmans and Marathas {{observe the}} Champasashthi festival {{every year in}} honour of Khandoba. The festival begins on the bright half of the Hindu month of Margshirsha. The images of Khandoba and Malla are cleaned and worshipped. For six days a fast is observed. On <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>day</b> the worshippers break their fast by a feast known as the Champasashtliiche parne. An {{invitation}} to this feast is regarded as an invitation from the god Khandoba himself and is harder to refuse.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} seven {{days before the}} burning of the Red Cow, they removed the priest who was to burn the cow from his house to a room called the stone chamber facing the {{north-eastern}} corner of the Temple. The Mishnah taught that throughout the seven days, they sprinkled on the priest a mixture of all the sin-offerings that were there, but Rabbi Jose taught that they sprinkled only on the third and <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>days.</b> And Rabbi Hanina the Deputy High Priest taught that on the priest who was to burn the cow they sprinkled all the seven days, but on {{the one who was}} to perform the service on Yom Kippur they sprinkled only on the third and <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>days.</b>|$|R

5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>day</b> {{after the}} person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word {{both for the}} funeral ale and the feast, since it {{involved}} a ritual drinking). The funeral ale {{was a way of}} socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance. If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.|$|E
5|$|Thus Iravan finally {{reaches the}} {{battlefield}} of Kurukshetra to assist {{his father and}} Pandavas against their cousins and opponents, the Kauravas. On {{the first day of}} war, Iravan fights a duel with Srutayush, a Kshatriya king who had been a daitya (demon) called Krodhavasa in a prior incarnation. Srutayush is later killed by Arjuna. On <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>day</b> of war, Iravan also defeats Vinda and Anuvinda, the princes of Avanti, who are later killed by Arjuna.|$|E
5|$|By February17, 80percent of {{the grid}} was restored; however, only 10percent homes were {{actually}} connected. The presence of dead vegetation {{left behind by the}} storm created fire hazards across the island, prompting the government to issue a ban on burning. <b>The</b> <b>Seventh</b> <b>Day</b> Adventist church primary school resumed classes on February15 despite losing a building. All other schools suspended activities until February22; however, the approach of Tropical Depression 11F delayed this until the following day. On February23, the European Union provided US$110,000 in emergency funds to the Cook Islands. Habitat for Humanity later sought to assist in the rebuilding process in April, with a funding goal of NZ$300,000 (US$210,000).|$|E

For six days, the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>day</b> two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians.

In 2012 Sukarkhet Soron was declared officially by the government of Uttar Pradesh as the birthplace of Tulsi Das. His parents were Hulsi and Atmaram Dubey. Most sources identify him as a Saryupareen Brahmin of the Parashar Gotra (lineage), although some sources claim he was a Kanyakubja or Sanadhya Brahmin.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, {{the then}} Governor-General of Jamaica Sir Kenneth O. Hall, {{indicated}} that he wished to step down due to declining health.

On 13 January 2009, the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Bruce Golding (of the Jamaica Labour Party), announced that Allen would succeed Kenneth Hall as governor-general. The announcement generated controversy, both because Allen had strong ties to <b>the</b> <b>Seventh</b> <b>Day</b> Adventist Church, and because as an Adventist, Allen might be unable to attend events due to his strict observation of the sabbath. On 28 January 2009, Allen resigned from his presidency of the West Indies Union. He also resigned as {{chairman of the board of}} Northern Caribbean University, and other religious organisations in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The mission {{plan called}} for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 121:28 mission elapsed time. On the {{original}} plan, {{this would have been}} at 7:44 UTC on September 4, 1983, before accounting for the last-minute launch delay; in the event, this was put back by one day to allow for further communications testing, and Challenger touched down at 07:40:33 UTC (00:40:33 PDT), September 5, 1983, on Runway 22 at Edwards AFB, on the morning of <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>day</b> of the mission. As with the launch, this was the first night landing of the program. The Shuttle orbiters had no on-board lights, due to the difficulty of designing landing lights to survive re-entry, and so the runway was lit by high-intensity xenon arc lamps to guide the orbiter in. There was no pressing operational requirement for a night landing, but there was a desire to prove it was possible. Footage of the landing was shown in the 1986 film SpaceCamp.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} then sailed around Euboea {{to the first}} major target, Eretria. According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided amongst {{themselves}} as to {{the best course of}} action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or to submit to the Persians. In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the city. The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>day</b> two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians.

5|$|One {{building}} at <b>the</b> <b>Seventh</b> <b>Day</b> Adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage. Although damage occurred at Vaitau School, it was utilized as an evacuation shelter. The primary {{school and college}} in Araura also suffered damage. The island's electrically run water supply was substantially effected. A total of 568homes lost access to clean water, with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed. Aitutaki's only hospital fared well through the storm, with some roof damage and flooded rooms. Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ$2.3million (US$1.6million), mainly stemming from the power grid. The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage, amounting to US$1.5million, with some crops experiencing a total loss. The severity of damage raised concerns about food security {{in the months after}} the storm. Particularly hard-hit was the mango crop, which was to be harvested two weeks after Pat struck. Approximately 60–75percent of the coconut trees and 75percent of java plum, mango, and kapok trees sustained damage. Most trees had at least one branch torn off and in most cases, multiple branches. Additionally, the blue lorikeet (Vini peruviana), a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm, with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50percent.|$|E

5|$|The eze Nri was {{the title}} of the ruler of Nri with ritual and mystic (but not military) power. He was a ritual figure rather than a king in the {{traditional}} sense. The eze Nri was chosen after an interregnum period while the electors waited for supernatural powers to manifest in the new eze Nri. He was installed after a symbolic journey to Aguleri on the Anambra River. The authorities must be notified prior to commencement of this journey to obtain the Ududu-eze,the royal scepter. There, the process of paying of homage to all the necessary shrines/deities in Aguleri by the new Eze Nri, visitation to Menri`s tomb at Ama-Okpu, collection of Ofo, purification of the virgin boy to receive the clay from the chosen diver from Umuezeora in Aguleri, sitting on the throne of Eri at Obu-Gad in Aguleri by the new Eze-Nri before going back to Nri on <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>day</b> to undergo a symbolic burial and exhumation, then finally be anointed with white clay, a symbol of purity.
