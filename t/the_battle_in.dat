5|$|Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba {{offers a}} longer account, which Abbot Ségéne {{had heard from}} Oswald himself. Oswald, he says, {{had a vision of}} Columba the night before <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>in</b> which he was toldBe strong and act manfully. Behold, I will be with thee. This coming night go out from your camp into battle, for the Lord has granted me that at this time your foes shall be put to flight and Cadwallon your enemy shall be {{delivered}} into your hands and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily. Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after <b>the</b> <b>battle.</b> <b>In</b> the battle that followed, the British were routed despite their superior numbers; Cadwallon himself was killed.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle is}} {{highlighted}} by many historians specifically because Lucullus overcame the numerical odds facing his army. The Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli remarked upon <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> his book, The Art of War, where he critiqued Tigranes' {{heavy reliance on}} his cavalry over his infantry.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and sequence}} of events regarding the battle and {{the fall of the}} Paulician state is unclear, since the Byzantine sources are contradictory: a number of scholars place <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> 872, others in 878, in both cases either before or after the capture and razing of Tephrike itself by the Byzantines. Thus Alexander Vasiliev proposed a first victorious battle for the Byzantines, followed by the sack of Tephrike and the final Paulician defeat at Bathys Ryax, all in 872. Most recent historians place the battle before the sack of the city, but disagree in the dates of the two events. Some, like Nina Garsoïan or John Haldon, place both events in 878; the French Byzantinist Paul Lemerle, followed by other scholars like Mark Whittow and Warren Treadgold, placed <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> 872 and the final subjugation of Tephrike years later, in 878 (Treadgold in 879).|$|E
5|$|About {{the same}} time Nobel Prize-winner Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote the novel The Knights of the Cross (Polish: Krzyżacy), {{prominently}} featuring <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> one of the chapters. In 1960 Polish filmmaker Aleksander Ford used the book {{as the basis for}} his film, Knights of the Teutonic Order. A museum, monuments and memorials were constructed at the battlefield in 1960. The battle site is one of Poland's official, national Historic Monuments, as designated October 4, 2010, and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland. The battle has lent its name to military decorations (Cross of Grunwald), sports teams (BC Žalgiris, FK Žalgiris), and various organizations.|$|E

50|$|The German historians Peter Kehne and Reinhard Wolters {{believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> was {{probably}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Detmold area, and that Kalkriese {{is the site}} of one of <b>the</b> <b>battles</b> <b>in</b> 15 CE. This theory is, however, in contradiction to Tacitus' account.|$|R

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after this}} loss Xerxes {{attempted}} {{to build a}} causeway across the straits to attack Salamis (although Strabo and Ctesias place this attempt before <b>the</b> <b>battle).</b> <b>In</b> any case this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while advising Xerxes to retreat to Asia with {{the bulk of the}} army. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly. The Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides {{was sent}} to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for {{assistance}} before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta {{the day after he}} left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after <b>the</b> <b>battle),</b> <b>in</b> order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, {{in time to see the}} Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{historian}} Petar Mutafchiev, {{after the battle}} Samuil was {{in control of the}} Balkans. According to some historians, the northeastern parts of the Bulgarian Empire were liberated in the years after the battle. However, according to other sources, they were liberated ten years prior to <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>in</b> 976. The Bulgarians firmly took the initiative and launched continuous attacks towards Thessaloniki, Edessa, and the Adriatic coast. The Serbs were also defeated and their state incorporated into Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>in</b> which pre-dreadnoughts {{proved too}} {{vulnerable}} against more modern battleships, Deutschland {{and her three}} surviving sisters were assigned to coastal defense duties. By 1917, they had been withdrawn from combat service completely, disarmed, and tasked with auxiliary roles. Deutschland {{was used as a}} barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven {{until the end of the}} war. She was struck from the naval register on 25 January 1920, sold to ship breakers that year, and broken up for scrap by 1922.|$|E
5|$|Against Irataba's advice, in 1858 Mohave warriors {{attacked}} the first emigrant wagon train to use Beale's Wagon Road through Mohave country. As a result, the U.S. War Department sent a detachment under Colonel William Hoffman to pacify the tribe. Following {{a series of}} confrontations known as the Mohave War, Hoffman succeeded in dominating the natives, and demanded that they allow the passage of settlers through their territory. To ensure compliance, Fort Mohave was constructed {{near the site of}} <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> April 1859. Hoffman also imprisoned several Mohave leaders. Having been an advocate for friendly relations with the whites, Irataba became the nation's Aha macave yaltanack, an elected, as opposed to hereditary, leader.|$|E
5|$|As a final factor, Lee faced {{a new and}} {{formidable}} {{opponent in}} George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its home territory. Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as Winfield S. Hancock to make decisions where {{and when they were}} needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> the face of fierce Confederate attacks.|$|E
