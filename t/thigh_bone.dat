5|$|Pterosaurs' hip sockets are {{oriented}} facing slightly upwards, and {{the head}} of the femur (<b>thigh</b> <b>bone)</b> is only moderately inward facing, suggesting that pterosaurs had an erect stance. It would have been possible to lift the thigh into a horizontal position during flight, as gliding lizards do.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Australian magpie {{moves around}} by walking, {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (<b>thigh</b> <b>bone),</b> and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, {{although}} birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), <b>thigh</b> <b>bone</b> (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} 198284 Suresh Srivastava, a GSI {{geologist}} at the Palaeontology Division of the GSI's Western Region, collected {{large numbers of}} bone fossil fragments from Rahioli, and also precisely mapped the area. These fossils {{were taken to the}} Palaeontology Division at Jaipur for identification. U. B. Mathur and Suresh Srivastava, under the supervision of S. C. Pant, meticulously cleaned many of the skeletal parts (braincase, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, sacrum, <b>thigh</b> <b>bone,</b> upper arm, shin bones, and others), leading to the publication of multiple research papers. There was a lull in further activity until a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with Punjab University in 199495.|$|E
5|$|Gigantic and {{visually}} impressive, the Megalosaurus {{became one of}} the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the Iguanodon and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (<b>thigh</b> <b>bone),</b> with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured the animal was quadrupedal; palaeontologists now believe it to have been bipedal (standing like Tyrannosaurus rex). The first suggestion that some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, Marsh named {{two species}} of Nanosaurus in {{separate}} publications, based on partial remains from the Morrison Formation of Garden Park, Colorado. One paper described N. agilis, based on YPM 1913, with remains including impressions of a dentary, and postcranial bits including an ilium, thigh bones, shin bones, and a fibula. The other paper named N. rex, a second species which Marsh based on YPM 1915 (also called 1925 in Galton, 2007), a complete <b>thigh</b> <b>bone.</b> He regarded both species as small ("fox-sized") animals. He assigned this genus to the now-abandoned family Nanosauridae.|$|E
50|$|In this regard, {{it is one}} of four species once {{considered}} hypsilophodontids from southeast Australia, along with Leaellynasaura amicagraphica, Atlascopcosaurus loadsi, and Fulgurotherium australe. The four taxa are mostly known from isolated bones and teeth; however the <b>thigh</b> <b>bones</b> of F. australe are very diverse and may belong to three genera.|$|R
50|$|Infants {{with type}} 1 thanatophoric {{dysplasia}} also have curved <b>thigh</b> <b>bones,</b> flattened {{bones of the}} spine (platyspondyly) and shortened thoracic ribs. Note: Prenatal ultra-sound images of the ribs sometimes appear asymmetrical {{when in fact they}} are not. In certain cases, this has caused a misdiagnosis of Osteogenisis Imperfecta (OI) type II.|$|R
2500|$|... 17 May [...] Paleontologists in Argentina {{discover}} {{what appears to}} be the largest dinosaur yet found. Based on its gigantic <b>thigh</b> <b>bones,</b> it was 40m (130ft) long and 20m (65ft) tall, weighing 77 tonnes. The as yet unnamed species of Titanosaur lived in the forests of Patagonia between 95 and 100 million years ago.|$|R
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken <b>thigh</b> <b>bone</b> that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger Allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The <b>thigh</b> <b>bone</b> became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, {{and the growth of}} the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.|$|E
5|$|William's grave is {{currently}} {{marked by a}} marble slab with a Latin inscription dating from the early 19th century. The tomb has been disturbed several times since 1087, {{the first time in}} 1522 when the grave was opened on orders from the papacy. The intact body was restored to the tomb at that time, but in 1562, during the French Wars of Religion, the grave was reopened and the bones scattered and lost, {{with the exception of one}} <b>thigh</b> <b>bone.</b> This lone relic was reburied in 1642 with a new marker, which was replaced 100 years later with a more elaborate monument. This tomb was again destroyed during the French Revolution, but was eventually replaced with the current marker.|$|E

50|$|V. nigeriensis {{was given}} its own genus, Elrhazosaurus, by Galton in 2009. This {{was done on}} the grounds of differing {{morphology}} and geologic age versus V. canaliculatus. He retained it as a dryosaurid. While Elrhazosaurus is sometimes described as only known from <b>thigh</b> <b>bones,</b> at least one upper arm bone has been assigned to the genus.|$|R
5|$|The {{skeleton}} (catalogue number QG24) {{has been}} found weathering out of a hill slope and was partially eroded by surface exponation and plant roots. It includes the pelvis and sacrum, most of the left hind limb and foot, a right <b>thigh</b> <b>bone,</b> and twelve anterior tail vertebrae. These remains pertain to a single individual as they were all found articulated (still connected together). Additionally, several disarticulated bones were found, including the right forearm and some metacarpalia and phalanges from both {{the right and left}} forefeet, probably also pertaining to this individual. Later, the site was revisited by the scientists Geoffrey Bond and Michael Cooper, who were able to collect additional remains including a scapula (specimen QG152, a shoulder blade) and a fragment of a neck vertebra. These remains show that more than one individual was present, and it is possible that they do not pertain to Vulcanodon at all. Today, the Vulcanodon remains are stored in the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo.|$|E
5|$|Nemegtomaia is {{estimated}} to have been around 2m (7ft) in length, and to have weighed 40kg (85lb), a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives. As an oviraptorosaur, {{it would have been}} feathered. The neural spines of the neck (cervical) vertebrae were short, and the neural arches had an x-shaped appearance. The middle three of these vertebrae were the largest. The scapula (shoulder blade) appears to have been 185mm (7in) in total length. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a fossa (depression) in a position similar to modern birds, but atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and appears to have been 152mm (6in) long. The radius of the lower arm was straight, oval in cross-section, and may have been 144mm (5in) long. The first finger was relatively large and had a strong ungual (claw bone), and was more massive than the two other fingers. The second finger was slightly longer than the first, and the third finger was the smallest. The upper margin of the ilium of the pelvis was straight, and though both ilia were close to each other, they were not fused together. The pubic shaft was turned backwards. The femur (<b>thigh</b> <b>bone)</b> {{is estimated}} to have been 286mm (11in) long, and the tibia of the lower leg 317mm long (12in).|$|E
5|$|Sinosauropteryx was anatomically {{similar to}} Compsognathus, differing from its European {{relatives}} in its proportions. The skull of Sinosauropteryx was 15% longer than its thigh bones, unlike in Compsognathus, where {{the skull and}} thigh bones are approximately equivalent in length. The arms of Sinosauropteryx (humerus and radius) were only 30% the length of its legs (<b>thigh</b> <b>bone</b> and shin), compared to 40% in Compsognathus. Additionally, Sinosauropteryx had several features unique among all other theropods. It had 64 vertebrae in its tail. This high number made its tail the longest relative to body length of any theropod. Its hands were long compared to its arms, about 84% to 91% {{of the length of}} the rest of the arm (humerus and radius), and half the length of the foot. The first and second digits were about the same length, with a large claw on the first digit. The first fingers were large, being both longer and thicker than either of the bones of the forearm. The teeth differed slightly (they were heterodont) based on position: those near the tips of the upper jaws (on the premaxillae) were slender and lacked serrations, while those behind them (on the maxillae) were serrated and laterally compressed. The teeth of the lower jaws were similarly differentiated.|$|E
50|$|Osteoplasty is {{the branch}} of surgery {{concerned}} with bone repair or bone grafting. It is the surgical alteration or reshaping of bone. It {{may be used to}} relieve pain associated with metastatic bone disease. Percutaneous osteoplasty involves the use of bone cement to reduce pain and improve mobility. Resection osteoplasty is used in joint preserving surgery on the hip and <b>thigh</b> <b>bones.</b>|$|R

50|$|Two partial <b>thigh</b> <b>bones</b> {{were found}} in the 19th century and would have {{measured}} 160 cm (5.2 ft) when complete. A fragment from the same locality was said to be almost a quarter larger; volumetric analysis then yields a size estimate of 5.2 m tall at the shoulder and 22 t in weight. This makes P. namadicus the largest land mammal known, surpassing the largest indricotheres.|$|R
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180¬∞ {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the <b>thigh</b> <b>bone,</b> which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} belonged to an aged individual. Its taphonomy is unusual {{as it was}} found lying on its back ‚Äì in contrast, most other nearly complete dinosaur skeletons of the Nemegt Formation usually are found lying on their sides. The specimen was found encased in cross-bedded sandstone deposited by a river. Most of the discovered vertebrae were still connected together, forming a continuous series that consisted of 8 dorsal, 6 sacral and 34 caudal vertebrae. An additional 3 vertebrae were found isolated from the series and may belong to the transitional area between back and neck. The remaining parts of the skeleton were shifted slightly out of their original anatomical position. Both the left limb and rib bones {{were found on the}} right side of the body, while conversely the right limb and rib bones were found on the left side. Bite marks have been identified on the skeleton, particularly in the pelvis and the <b>thigh</b> <b>bone,</b> showing that predators had fed on the carcass. The skull and neck are missing, indicating that the carnivores might have carried away these body parts. The completeness of the remains indicate that the individual had died near the discovery site. A flooding event might have transported the carcass a short distance and subsequently covered it with sediment, even before the soft tissue had decayed entirely.|$|E
5|$|The scapula (shoulder blade) {{was longer}} than the humerus (upper arm bone); its blade was slender and narrow, and {{slightly}} twisted, following the contour of the ribs. The scapula did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The coracoid was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a slender shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The deltopectoral crest (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles attach) was weakly developed. The ends of the ulna were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The radius was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the pelvic girdle was very broad for a bipedal archosaur, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The ilium was elongated and the ischium was long and slender. Though the pubis is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of Homalocephale. The femur (<b>thigh</b> <b>bone)</b> was slender and inwards curved, the tibia was slender and twisted, and the fibula was slender and wide at the upper end. The metatarsus of the foot {{appears to have been}} narrow, and the single known ungual (claw bone) of a toe was slender and slightly curved. Though the limbs of Stegoceras are not completely known, other pachycephalosaurs show that they had five-fingered hands and four toes.|$|E
60|$|These, I noticed, as {{we stepped}} into the shadow, were more {{numerous}} than usual just here, for on all sides I saw the white crowns of skulls, or the projecting ends of ribs and <b>thigh</b> <b>bones.</b> Doubtless, I thought to myself, that streamway made a road to the plain above, and in some past battle, the fighting around it was very fierce and the slaughter great.|$|R
50|$|Lagerpetids {{are defined}} as being rather small (length of one hind limb being 25 cm), with ‚Äúvery marked {{locomotor}} specializations‚Äù: final presacral and anteriorly oriented vertebrae, a sacral including two vertebrae, a closed acetabulum, and an up facing ilium". They had a short and wide pubis, and had an ischium with extensive ventral lamina. In relation to the genus Lagosuchus, the genera had shorter <b>thigh</b> <b>bones</b> than shins.|$|R
500|$|The limbs {{were large}} and robust {{to support the}} animal's large weight, and were in some ways similar to and {{convergent}} with those of elephants and sauropod dinosaurs with their likewise graviportal (heavy and slow moving) builds. Unlike such animals, which tend to lengthen the upper limb bones while shortening, fusing and compressing the lower limb, hand, and foot bones, Paraceratherium had short upper limb bones and long hand and foot bonesexcept for the disc-shaped phalangessimilar to the running rhinoceroses from which they descended. Some foot bones were almost [...] long. The <b>thigh</b> <b>bones</b> typically measured , a size only exceeded by those of some elephants and dinosaurs. The <b>thigh</b> <b>bones</b> were pillar-like and much thicker and more robust than those of other rhinoceroses, and the three trochanters on the sides were much reduced, as this robustness diminished their importance. The limbs were held in a column-like posture instead of bent, as in smaller animals, which reduced the need for large limb muscles. The front limbs had three toes.|$|R
25|$|According to {{the revised}} {{diagnosis}} by Taylor, Brachiosaurus altithorax is diagnosed by {{a plethora of}} characters, many to {{be found on the}} dorsal (back) vertebrae. Among the characters placing it in the family Brachiosauridae are a ratio of humerus length to femur length of at least 0.9 (i.e. the upper arm bone is at least nearly as long as the <b>thigh</b> <b>bone),</b> and a very flattened femur shaft (ratio ‚â•1.85).|$|E
25|$|At Fleet City, doctors {{discovered}} Young {{had a large}} {{growth of}} calcium on his right <b>thigh</b> <b>bone.</b> They wanted to operate and thought it would grow larger, but told Young he would lose significant use of his leg after surgery.

25|$|Lewis based her {{identification}} on {{a number}} of factors including Despencer's relationship to the Abbey's benefactors, the age of the remains and the cause of death. The missing bones were also cited as proof; in 1330, Hugh de Despenser's widow, Eleanor de Clare, petitioned the crown for the return of her husband's remains, but is said to have only secured his head, <b>thigh</b> <b>bone</b> and a number of vertebrae.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, the Indian police {{discovered}} {{a stash of}} hundreds of human skulls and <b>thigh</b> <b>bones</b> and arrested a gang for allegedly carrying out the practice of body snatching and indulging in bone trade. This gang was arrested after they exhumed dozens of graves from Muslim cemeteries in Burdwan district, and smuggled the skeletons not just to medical institutions in need of cadavers across the world, but more interestingly this time, to the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan for use in Buddhist monasteries. Kamal Sah was caught carrying 67 human skulls and 10 bones on a bus in Chhapra, {{in the state of}} Bihar, by fellow passengers who had noticed a jagged bone sticking out of a bag beneath his seat. The investigating officer of the incident, Ravinder Nalwa, reported to a Reuters journalist that, [...] "during the interrogation the gang members confessed that the hollow human <b>thigh</b> <b>bones</b> were in great demand in monasteries and were used as blow-horns, and the skulls as vessels to drink from at religious ceremonies." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{challenge}} {{in creating the}} female to male gender illusion is the masking of feminine features and movements. Women move differently from men in general, perhaps due to social programming or the different pelvic shapes, and resulting differences in {{the angle of the}} <b>thigh</b> <b>bones.</b> The stereotypical portrayal of a man utilizes masculine gesture and motion, crisp movements and dance. Contrast to drag queens, who may display smooth, sweeping motions while portraying women.|$|R
5000|$|According to Hearn, {{the bones}} were not treated respectfully by the workers either. He noted, [...] "bones were simply packed into a barrel and stowed {{away in a}} {{convenient}} part of the building. ...
