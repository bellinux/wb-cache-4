25|$|R-Code is a {{high-level}} scripting language for AIBO. R-Code {{allows you to}} very easily create simple programs for AIBO to execute. While it does not allow the low-level control that the OPEN-R SDK has, what it lacks in power it makes up for in simplicity. Remoting is possible via a simple <b>terminal</b> <b>socket</b> connection via WiFi. Commercial usage is allowed, and the license fee is free.|$|E
2500|$|R-CodePlus is a {{derivative}} of R-Code by AiboPet with several added functionalities. R-CodePlus is a superset of R-Code {{in terms of}} language, so everything written in standard R-Code will work on a R-CodePlus memorystick (for the same Model AIBO). R-CodePlus exposes some new [...] "basic" [...] AIBO functions such as simple face recognition, name registration, and camera adjustment settings. In addition to the standard R-Code <b>terminal</b> <b>socket</b> for remoting, R-CodePlus supplies a [...] "Telemety" [...] socket for several binary data transfers such as AIBO's camera image and sending/receiving sound. R-CODE has been extended to R-CODE plus by Aibopet ...|$|E

50|$|The power shelf can be {{combined}} with a distribution and control unit. The distribution unit contains a controller, I/O units and DIN rails for holding AC and DC distribution MCBs, battery connections and battery MCBs, as well as screw <b>terminal</b> <b>sockets</b> for AC input and DC bus connections.|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} where the sockets are polarised, polarity testing is a simple test that {{can be carried out}} using a polarity tester to determine whether the active and neutral of the plug end are correctly connected to the corresponding <b>terminals</b> at the <b>socket</b> end. Note: The earth is tested during the earth continuity test. In the UK, as per BS7671, the phase ('Live' or 'Hot') cable should connect with right hand side <b>terminal</b> of the <b>socket</b> (if we face the socket outlet).|$|R
50|$|A Prontor-Compur {{connection}} (also {{known as}} a PC connector, PC <b>terminal,</b> or PC <b>socket)</b> is a standard 3.5 mm (1/8") electrical connector (as defined in ISO 519) used in photography to synchronize the shutter to the flash.|$|R

50|$|In late 1941, {{the factory}} began {{to send to}} the tank {{factories}} of the Urals and Siberia, the first switches, <b>sockets,</b> <b>terminal</b> sets required for electrical tanks and other weapons. The Company now has also been mined and production of fuzes.|$|R
40|$|Tweezerlike tool {{simplifies}} {{installation of}} screws in places reached only through narrow openings. With changes {{in size and}} shape, basic tool concept applicable to mounting and dismounting of transformers, <b>sockets,</b> <b>terminal</b> strips and mechanical parts. Inexpensive tool fabricated as needed by bending two pieces of steel wire. Exact size and shape selected to suit part manipulated and nature of inaccessible mounting space...|$|R
50|$|Wiring a 3-way lamp is {{a simple}} matter of {{connecting}} the 3-way switch's two switched live wires (frequently red for the low-wattage circuit and blue for the medium-wattage circuit) from the switch to the two live terminals on the 3-way socket. The lamp's power cord must be connected so that the wire from the wide blade on the power cord plug (neutral) connects to the neutral <b>terminal</b> on the <b>socket,</b> and the wire from the narrow blade on the plug (hot) connects to the black wire on the switch.|$|R
30|$|The RTS game {{system on}} the userâ€™s {{intelligent}} <b>terminal</b> establishes <b>socket</b> communication with the cloud server through wireless network such as 3 G, 4 G, and WIFI, realizing the data exchange between application and cloud server. After RTS game system uploads the currently identified image to the cloud, the recognition system retrieves and identifies the image from database. If the current image exists in the database, the RTS game system will download the enhanced information associated with the image to local storage via the cache mechanism. Finally, the interface of the smart phone is designed to show the related enhancement information of the recognition scene, and the rendering engine of Unity 3 D is used to draw the 3 D model in real time, which is divided into subsystems of cloud management and intelligent terminal management. In terms of cloud management subsystem, {{the first step is}} to acquire image through the input device. After pretreatment, the scene is checked whether a target that needs display augmentation exists. If the target exists, 3 D registration is conducted. If not, the automatic tracking program is started. After tracking, 3 D registration is performed and then stored in information database. Meanwhile, an augmentation information database is established to store 3 D model as well as text, video, and audio information. The information index is built to improve retrieval speed. As the basis of image recognition, such information can provide sample training and quick identification. The intelligent terminal management subsystem obtains augmented 3 D model information of the cloud through image recognition. Virtual information is displayed on corresponding coordinate positions through image fusion.|$|R
