5|$|First thing, I saw <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> as scientifically {{accomplished}} but ethically, morons. They {{never had}} any reasons before to have ethical questions. So when they're hit with this device they're blindsided by it. The first thing they do is make money with it. They're {{not talking about the}} ethics of altering your former self.|$|E
25|$|Can {{you imagine}} Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, Chu Berry, Don Byas, and Ben Webster {{on the same}} little jam session? They had a place called Minton's Playhouse in New York. It's kaput now. And <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> man, nothing like it. And guess who won the fight?...Don Byas walked off with everything.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

Her {{daughter}} Shalini aka Linny who is in her late teens, is a smart girl except that she is weak in Mathematics. JoMo has promised the lady that he would convince Aris to teach her daughter Maths. Aris has been dodging this so far.|$|R

25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E
500|$|The live finale for {{the first}} season saw the {{historic}} bout of Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar. Now {{widely regarded as the}} most influential fight in MMA history, the bout took place in what was the first ever MMA event on live and free television. The bout ended in a unanimous decision victory for Griffin and led to the show's renewal on Spike TV. Regarding the success of the show, UFC president Dana White said, [...] "It's amazing to think.... how close we came to not being here today. If it weren't for what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> did, I don't know if there would even be a UFC. I'll never forget <b>these</b> <b>guys.</b> Ever." ...|$|E
500|$|In a mixed {{review for}} Blogcritics, Chris Beaumont summed up that [...] "Watching these promo DVDs {{makes me want}} the Blu-ray that much more. The {{performances}} are great, the sets are great, {{and it is hard}} not to get excited about <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> taking the stage together. This is metal." ...|$|E

50|$|This was to {{have been}} a {{standard}} Leyland wartime utility bus, with 500 commissioned by the Ministry of Supply: a Leyland Utility body was constructed by October 1941, but, in a change of Government policy, Guy Motors were commissioned to build 500 chassis to the same outline drawings as the TD8, and Leyland's output for the duration was centred upon tanks. <b>These</b> <b>Guy</b> buses were the first of the famous utility Guy Arabs, the earliest being bodied in early 1942. TD9 was used internally for the design work on what would become the PD1 and PD2 Titans.|$|R
500|$|In January 2008, McGovern {{wrote an}} op-ed in the Washington Post {{calling for the}} {{impeachment}} of President George W.

The subtitle of the article read [...] "Nixon Was Bad. <b>These</b> <b>Guys</b> Are Worse." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think this}} whole thing has been {{manufactured}} by David Falk", Gattison told The Charlotte Observer Friday night. [...] "The guys he used to initiate the decertification drive aren't concerned with the union and the everyday little guy. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> {{have been in the}} league 10 or 11 years and have yet to voice an opinion about what's going on. Then all of a sudden David Falk doesn't like what's going on." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It was crazy! They had film {{crews and}} video guys, while I'm {{at the board}} trying to produce.

500|$|On Ecstasys {{supporting}} tour My Bloody Valentine {{conceived the}} idea of [...] "the holocaust", an interlude of noise and excessive feedback during live performances which was later attributed to their song [...] "You Made Me Realise" [...] and often exceeded 130decibels. The band toured small student venues and, according to Kevin Shields, at [...] "one particular place, there were <b>these</b> <b>guy</b> playing pool in the background, shouting amongst themselves and being quite loud and not paying attention". Before performing [...] "Clair", Shields said to the band [...] "let's just do it until those guys stop" [...] and performed a two-chord riff in the song that lasted for an approximate 30minutes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the Clyde Fans company came from an actual old {{storefront}} in Toronto called Clyde Fans. Seth related, [...] "I used to look into window when I walked by because I'm very attracted {{to this sort of}} thing. In the dim light of the office you could see on the back wall two photographs of two men, which were probably the owners. I just assumed they were brothers. Over {{the next couple of years}} while working on projects I put together a story of what <b>these</b> <b>guy's</b> lives were about although it probably had nothing to do with the reality of their real lives." ...|$|R
500|$|Sound {{editing and}} mixing work {{took place at}} Todd Soundelux, with Wylie Stateman serving as the supervising sound editor. Stateman {{recorded}} on-location sound during filming, placing microphones on the actors' backpacks and clothing [...] "so [...] would hear explosions and bullets going by as though [...] were with <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> as they were being attacked." [...] In creating sound effects for the environment of each scene, Stateman relied on foley design, rather than traditional sound effects.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, {{he was the}} Republican Party {{standard}} bearer, {{together with}} City Controller candidate, Tom Gola, in the Philadelphia mayoral campaign against the Democratic incumbent James Tate. Two of their slogans were, [...] "We need <b>THESE</b> <b>guys</b> to watch THOSE guys" [...] and [...] "They're younger, they're tougher, and nobody owns them!"

500|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{experience}} of making Che, Soderbergh {{has said that he}} now wishes that he had not made the film and remarked, [...] "Literally I'd wake up and think, 'At least I'm not doing that today.'" [...] The director blamed piracy for the film's financial failure and felt that [...] "It's a film that, to some extent, needs the support of people who write about films.

5000|$|In {{his review}} for JazzTimes, Steve Greenlee says [...] "Other Violets is {{probably}} not among the greatest moments for any of <b>these</b> five <b>guys,</b> but it’s a decent set and a worthy document of what was surely a memorable night." ...|$|R
500|$|On {{taking the}} role of Jigsaw, Bell said - [...] "I did Saw because I {{thought it was a}} {{fascinating}} location for a film to be made. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> locked in a room, to me, was fresh. I did not anticipate the ending when I read the script, so I was quite caught by surprise and {{it was clear to me}} that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} credit family members with {{introducing}} them to rock music through old collections of vinyl records. [...] Boone Daughdrill cites [...] "When the Levee Breaks" [...] as his biggest influence. [...] "When I heard that drum fill {{come in the}} intro...oh! [...] I {{was a little kid}} and my uncle had all of the Zeppelin records. He was a drummer too and he would always be like, 'Man, check <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> out.' I was only three or four and I didn’t know what music was, but I knew that I loved that." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Paul Mullie, having Froot Loops as O'Neill's breakfast was not scripted, {{and he is}} unsure if {{the loop}} {{reference}} was intentional. [...] This was contradicted by Script coordinator Cath-Anne Ambrose who said [...] "I had to get Froot Loops cleared , and so the guy calls me back and says, 'Well {{how do you feel}} about Eggo Waffles? Would you consider using Eggo Waffles instead of Froot Loops?' So I go to <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> [...] and ask, 'How do you feel about waffles?' And they're like, 'No! It's Froot Loops! It's a time loop! No!' Waffle sales were down." ...|$|E

500|$|Bostaph {{eventually}} {{left the}} band before Christmas {{due to a}} chronic elbow injury, saying it would hinder his ability to play. After his departure, Bostaph joined the band Systematic. On December 21, 2001, {{it was announced that}} the original drummer, Dave Lombardo, would [...] "temporarily reclaim his place behind the drums on the next leg" [...] of Slayer's God Hates Us All tour.

500|$|It {{remains the}} custom in Britain, on or around 5November, to let off fireworks. Traditionally, {{in the weeks}} running up to the 5th, {{children}} made [...] "guys"—effigies supposedly of Fawkes—usually made from old clothes stuffed with newspaper, and fitted with a grotesque mask, to be burnt on the 5November bonfire. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> were exhibited in the street to collect money for fireworks, although this custom has become less common. The word guy thus came in the 19th century to mean an oddly dressed person, and hence in the 20th and 21st centuries to mean any male person.|$|E
500|$|Slayer's {{previous}} album, Show No Mercy, became Metal Blade Records' highest selling release, selling 40,000 copies worldwide; {{the success}} led producer Brian Slagel {{to want to}} record another album with them. Slagel hired producer Ron Fair, who worked for Chrysalis Records, and had seen the band perform live and enjoyed their performance. On seeing Slayer in the studio, Fair stated, [...] "Wow, <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> are really angry," [...] as he was inexperienced working with heavy metal musicians. Slagel financed the album, {{in stark contrast to}} Show No Mercy, which was financed by singer Tom Araya, who used his earnings as a respiratory therapist, and a loan from guitarist Kerry King's father.|$|E
