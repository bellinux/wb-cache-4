Pursuing the mysterious attacking vessel, they begin to uncover a plot to derail cooperative relations between the Tellarites, Andorians and Humans.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oblongifolia {{plants can}} live {{for more than}} 60 years. <b>They</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the {{greatest}} number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat, although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are serotinous, that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant.|$|E

25|$|Thus, in {{speaking}} about southeastern Europe, many classic conceptions and systematizations {{of human development}} during the Palaeolithic (and then by implication the Mesolithic) {{should not be considered}} correct in all cases.

25|$|Caudal: The {{upper and}} lower jaws are covered with sensory pits, visible as small, black {{speckles}} on the skin, the crocodilian version of the lateral line organs seen in fish and many amphibians, though arising from a completely different origin. These pigmented nodules encase bundles of nerve fibers innervated beneath by branches of the trigeminal nerve. <b>They</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the slightest disturbance in surface water, detecting vibrations and small pressure changes {{as small as a}} single drop. This makes it possible for crocodiles to detect prey, danger and intruders, even in total darkness. These sense organs are known as domed pressure receptors (DPRs).|$|E

25|$|The {{language}} of the birds {{has long been a}} topic for anecdote and speculation. That calls have meanings that are interpreted by their listeners has been well demonstrated. Domestic chickens have distinctive alarm calls for aerial and ground predators, and <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> these alarm calls appropriately. However, a language has, in addition to words, grammar (that is, structures and rules). Studies to demonstrate the existence of language have been difficult due to the range of possible interpretations. Research on parrots by Irene Pepperberg is claimed to demonstrate the innate ability for grammatical structures, including the existence of concepts such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. Studies on starling vocalizations have also suggested that they may have recursive structures.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of firefighter: wholetime and retained. Wholetime firefighters work {{full-time}} in the fire service. Retained firefighters are on call for long periods (at least 70 hours a week) to respond to incidents. They are paid a salary for the time they spend on call and a greater amount for each incident <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to,</b> on average 2 or 3 per week. Many have jobs outside of the fire service. Large town fire stations have wholetime crews, while small rural ones are usually staffed only by retained firefighters. Voluntary firefighters are now rare: the only voluntary units now in operation are the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade and the Borth Voluntary Fire Unit (near Aberystwyth, Wales).|$|E
25|$|Genes are cogs in the machine, not gods in the sky. They are {{switched}} {{on and off}} throughout life, by external as well as internal events, {{their job is to}} absorb information from the environment at least as often as to transmit it from the past. Genes do more than carry information; <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> experience. Susan Mineka illustrated this concept exceedingly well with her idea of prepared learning in monkeys, where she found the predisposition of genes largely affected the acquisition of fear responses to certain stimuli. Lab-reared monkeys, through vicarious experience, were easily able to acquire a fear response to a snake, but not a flower. Nature provides the instinct, and elements of nurture depend on whether the instinct is expressed.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{reactions}} of professional fishermen, western school whiting are considered to have good to excellent flesh for eating, and fetch similar high prices at market to other whiting species. Due to their offshore nature {{in the south of}} Western Australia, they are rarely taken by recreational fishermen, while {{in the northern part of}} their range where they inhabit shallower waters, they are often overlooked for larger tropical species by anglers. Thus they are not a major recreational fishery either. <b>They</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the same fishing styles as other whitings, generally using light lines and sinkers with worm or mollusc baits. They are caught off beaches, jetties and from boats. There is no size restriction on the species, but a daily bag limit of 40 per person applies.|$|E
25|$|Having {{the ability}} {{to look at a}} patient on an {{individual}} basis will allow for a more accurate diagnosis and specific treatment plan. Genotyping is the process of obtaining an individual’s DNA sequence by using biological assays. By having a detailed account of an individual’s DNA sequence, their genome can then be compared to a reference genome, like that of the Human Genome Project, to assess the existing genetic variations that can account for possible diseases. A number of private companies, such as 23andMe, Navigenics, and Illumina, have created Direct-to-Consumer genome sequencing accessible to the public. Having this information from individuals can then be applied to effectively treat them. An individual’s genetic make-up also plays a large role in how well <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> a certain treatment, and therefore, knowing their genetic content can change the type of treatment they receive.|$|E
25|$|The {{peripheral}} terminal of {{the mature}} nociceptor {{is where the}} noxious stimuli are detected and transduced into electrical energy. When the electrical energy reaches a threshold value, an action potential is induced and driven towards {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). This leads to the train of events that allows for the conscious awareness of pain. The sensory specificity of nociceptors is established by the high threshold only to particular features of stimuli. Only when the high threshold has been reached by either chemical, thermal, or mechanical environments are the nociceptors triggered. The majority of nociceptors are classified by which of the environmental modalities <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to.</b> Some nociceptors respond to more than one of these modalities and are consequently designated polymodal. Other nociceptors respond to none of these modalities (although they may respond to stimulation under conditions of inflammation) and are referred to as sleeping or silent.|$|E

25|$|Blue-footed booby {{parents are}} passive spectators of this intrabrood conflict. They do not {{intervene}} in their offspring's struggles, {{even at the}} point of siblicide. Booby parents even appear to facilitate the demise of the younger sibling by creating and maintaining the inequality between the two chicks. They reinforce the brood hierarchy by feeding the dominant chick more often than the subordinate one. Thus, <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the brood hierarchy and not to the level of begging when deciding which chick to feed, as both chicks beg in equal amounts. This level of passivity towards the very possible death of their younger offspring may be an indication that brood reduction is advantageous for the parents. The Insurance Egg Hypothesis views the second egg and resulting chick as insurance for the parent in case the first egg does not hatch, or if food levels are higher than expected.|$|E
25|$|The western school whiting (also {{known as}} the banded whiting, golden whiting and bastard whiting), is {{distributed}} along the Western Australian coast from Maud Landing in the north to Rottnest Island in the south. They are grow to 30cm in length and 275 g in weight, and are considered to have good to excellent flesh for eating. Due to their offshore nature {{in the south of}} Western Australia, they are rarely taken by recreational fishermen, while {{in the northern part of}} their range where they inhabit shallower waters, they are often overlooked for larger tropical species by anglers. Thus they are not a major recreational fishery. <b>They</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the same fishing styles as other whitings, generally using light lines and sinkers with worm or mollusc baits.

25|$|Microbiologists {{have studied}} the genetic {{mechanisms}} by which the V. cholerae bacteria turn off the production of some proteins {{and turn on the}} production of other proteins as <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall. Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump chloride ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six litres of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn adult mammals, the {{processing}} of complex odor mixtures is elemental or configural. Here, we challenged these processes in newborn rabbits, in evaluating their perception of a binary odor mixture for which perceptual blending occurs in humans. This model of newborn animal was interesting since general questions remain on how odor cues are processed in immature organisms, and since rabbit pups present abilities of rapid odor learning. In the present study, we first demonstrated (Exp. 1) that rabbit pups rapidly acquired the odor of the binary mixture through associative conditioning (when the mammary pheromone was used as unconditioned stimulus). Then, we compared how <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> the mixture, its components and the mammary pheromone, after they had learned the mixture or one of its constituents. After they had learned the odor of the mixture, <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> its odor and the odor of its constituents (Exp. 2). However, after they had learned one constituent's odor, <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> this odor {{but not to the}} mixture's odor (Exp. 3). The response to the mixture appeared nevertheless when pups successively acquired the odor of the two components (Exp. 4). Therefore, both elemental and configural processing of the mixture seem to be displayed by rabbit pups, suggesting that neonatal perception of a simple odor mixture may involve more than the perception of its constituents...|$|R
