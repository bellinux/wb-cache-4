5|$|The {{numbers of}} troops that Xerxes mustered {{for the second}} {{invasion}} of Greece {{have been the subject}} of endless dispute.

50|$|The HP.88 had a 0.36 {{scaled-down}} {{equivalent of}} <b>the</b> <b>Victor's</b> crescent wing and T-tail with slab tailplane. However where <b>the</b> <b>Victor</b> {{had a high}} wing, the Type 521 set the wing low on the fuselage. Also, <b>the</b> <b>Victor</b> design continued to be refined, so the HP.88 was no longer representative of <b>the</b> <b>Victor.</b> <b>The</b> HP.88 wing featured inboard trailing-edge flaps, which badly affected trim when deployed. The tailplane {{was too small to}} counter the trim change, so a system was developed where the ailerons deflected upwards together to balance the trim forces. The system was wholly automatic with no pilot intervention, and in the event of any failure all surfaces would return to their normal positions.|$|R

5|$|At times, when a {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, or they might be broken.

At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, where most of the stelae were found smashed.|$|E
5|$|British troops {{proceeded}} {{to occupy the}} various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. While the French had long cultivated alliances among certain of the Native Americans, the British post-war approach was essentially to treat the Native Americans as a conquered people. Before long, Native Americans who had been allies of the defeated French found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by <b>the</b> <b>victors.</b>|$|E
