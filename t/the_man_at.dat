5|$|The Smiths saw <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> around 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) {{from the}} McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from}} the Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|The man is now standing, {{his arms}} crossed, and watches with {{pleasure}} as Beyoncé continues the private dance. After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> his desk.|$|E

Renamed Guvernøren ("The Governor") in 1920, she served as a whale oil tanker until 30 November 1921, when <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the helm fell down drunk after celebratory drinking, leaving nobody at the wheel. The ship ran aground on rocks at Cow Bay two miles off Cape Carysfort approximately 20 miles from Port Stanley on East Falkland. No crew were lost.

25|$|Post-revolutionary art in Mexico had its {{expression}} {{in the works of}} renowned artists such as David Alfaro Siqueiros, Federico Cantú Garza, Frida Kahlo, Juan O'Gorman, José Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera, and Rufino Tamayo.

Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican National Palace and the Palace of Fine Arts.|$|E
25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed {{me that he had}} not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in front of me.|$|E

25|$|The {{thirteen}} civilians—men, {{women and}} children–have been rounded up for slaughter or enslavement. They are harshly {{presented to the}} viewer in an almost flat plane; slumped, disordered, and unevenly distributed. Their arrangement principally comprises two human pyramids–one pyramid {{to the left of}} the canvas culminating in the man with the red fez, and the other to the right culminating in the mounted soldier. The area between the two pyramids contains two soldiers in shadow, and two more Greek victims–a young man embraced by a young woman. The two men in the pyramid to the left are injured. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the front is on or near to the point of death, and the man poised at the top of the group appears unable to prepare a defence for himself. His gaze is in the direction of the suffering children in front of him, but it does not fall on them. This seeming detachment, coupled with the vacant stare of the dying man lend to this group an air of despondent resignation.|$|E
25|$|Dido was {{followed}} by The Îles of St Tropez (1860), Fair Rosamond (1862) and The Deal Boatman (1863), among many others. His most memorable early success was another musical burlesque, Ixion, or <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>at</b> the Wheel (1863), starring Lydia Thompson in the title role, which found audiences {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. By this time Burnand was a skilled negotiator with theatre managements, and he was among the first authors to insist on profit-sharing instead of fixed royalties. For Ixion this brought him a total of around £3,000. Other notable early works included an opéra bouffe, Windsor Castle (1865), with music by Frank Musgrave, and more pun-filled burlesques, including Helen, or, Taken from the Greek, and Guy Fawkes, or The Ugly Mug and the Couple of Spoons, both in 1866. Later in 1866 Burnand had a huge success with the burlesque The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up, parodying the three-act melodrama by Douglas Jerrold, Black-Eyed Susan; the show ran for 400 nights at the Royalty Theatre, was played for years provincially and in the US, and was twice revived in London.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, despite Metzinger's conceptualism of Cubist painting—the {{reflexive}} {{function of}} complex geometry, juxtaposed multiple perspectives, planar fragmentation suggesting motion and rhythmic play with various symmetry types—there does manifest itself in Danseuse a certain spatial depth or perspective {{reminiscent of the}} optical illusion of space of the Renaissance; in the way, for example, the wall-mounted lighting fixtures become smaller with distance, and so too <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the upper left appearing smaller in the background than his counterparts in the foreground. Interesting because it shows that non-Euclidean geometry does not imply the absolute destruction of classical perspective, or that simply, the breakdown of classical perspective need not be complete. Unlike the flattening of space associated with the Cubist paintings of others, Metzinger {{had no intention of}} abolishing depth of field. Of course here perspectival space is only alluded to by changes of scale, not by co-ordinated linear convergence, resulting in a complex space perfectly adapted to a stage-set. This feature is observed not only in Metzinger's Cubist paintings, but also in his Divisionist and proto-Cubist works between 1905 and 1909, as well as in his more figurative works of the 1920s (during the Return to order phase).|$|E

25|$|The {{railroad}} {{track on}} the eastern bank of Hancock Brook was built in 1850, to complete the Hartford,Provence and Fishkill railroad. Construction of the new railroad line began in 1907, because of treacherous turns and a tragic grade at the pequabuck section of Plymouth, CT. The main focus was the Sullivan hill tunnel, while the remaining sections of the line in Hancock where straightened. In 1940, one track {{was removed from the}} original double track, and the other was moved to the middle, This included abandoning the railroad bridge on Hancock Dam, where two great peninsulas remain. The line was also moved {{out of the way of}} greystone pond, and relocated to the other side. The last passenger train to be operated in the area was in January 1960. This specific area was well known for the amount of hermits that used the line to get from Bristol, CT to Waterbury, Connecticut, one of these hermits was known as a hero, for spotting a boulder that rolled off of lionhead mountain, the hermit ran to the nearest train station in Greystone, and warned <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the office- he was known as a hero of Plymouth, CT and was rewarded a lifetime of food and water, supplied by the town.|$|E

500|$|Since no one {{below the}} status of {{governor}} held the legal power to enforce capital punishment, most recalcitrant Christians would {{have been sent to}} Caesarea to await punishment. The first martyr, Procopius, was sent to Caesarea from Scythopolis (Beit She'an, Israel), where he had been a reader and an exorcist. He was brought before the governor on June 7, 303, and asked to sacrifice to the gods, and to pour a libation for the emperors. Procopius responded by quoting Homer: [...] "the lordship of many is not a good thing; let there be one ruler, one king". The governor beheaded <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> once.|$|E

500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club was {{generally}} {{favorable to the}} episode, giving it a B+. He wrote, [...] "Much like Fringe fan favorite 'The Arrival' (not a favorite of mine, sorry to say), 'The Dreamscape' is an episode more involved with insinuation and mythology-building than with telling a complete-in-one story. But perhaps because I've come to trust Fringe more over its recent run of entertaining episodes, I enjoyed it fairly well, and found myself {{trying to figure out}} what kind of thematic connections I could make using the notion of the body reacting to mere thoughts." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.8/10, explaining that it [...] "certainly moves in the right direction". Fickett found the [...] "coolest moment" [...] to be when Olivia witnesses John Scott's memory, and he also appreciated Peter's backstory ("It's more than Peter usually gets, but what we know isn't much and isn't very exciting."). Fickett criticized Olivia however for leaving <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the hospital unsuitably protected.|$|E
500|$|With overall {{dimensions}} for {{the object of}} [...] high and [...] long, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> least is close to life-size. The painted wooden shell forming both figures likely draws upon South Indian traditions of Hindu religious sculpture. It is typically about half an inch thick, and now much reinforced on the inside following bomb damage in World War II. There are many openings at the head end, formed to match {{the pattern of the}} inner part of the painted tiger stripes, which allow the sounds from the pipes within to be heard better, and the tiger is [...] "obviously male". The top part of the tiger's body can be lifted off to inspect the mechanics by removing four screws. The construction of the human figure is similar but the wood is much thicker. Examination and analysis by the V conservation department has determined that much of the current paint has been restored or overpainted.|$|E
500|$|Mike Scully, who was show runner {{during seasons}} nine through twelve, is held {{responsible}} by many critics and fans for the decline. An op-ed in Slate by Chris Suellentrop argued that The Simpsons {{changed from a}} realistic show about family life into a typical cartoon when Scully was the show runner: [...] "under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon. [...] Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck. The show's still funny, but it hasn't been touching in years." [...] John Ortved wrote in his book [...] that [...] "Scully's episodes excel when compared to what The Simpsons airs nowadays, but he was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the helm when the ship turned towards the iceberg." [...] The Simpsons under Scully has been negatively labeled as a [...] "gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation" [...] by Jon Bonné of MSNBC, and many fans have bemoaned the transformation in Homer's character during the era, from sweet and sincere to [...] "a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf", dubbing him [...] "Jerkass Homer".|$|E
