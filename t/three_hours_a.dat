5|$|The Sanremo Music Festival is an {{important}} venue for popular music in Italy. It has been held annually since 1951 and is currently staged at the Teatro Ariston in Sanremo. It runs for one week in February, and gives veteran and new performers a chance to present new songs. Winning the contest has often been a springboard to industry success. The festival is televised nationally for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> night, is hosted by the best-known Italian TV personalities, {{and has been a}} vehicle for such performers as Domenico Modugno, perhaps the best-known Italian pop singer of the last 50 years.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> <b>a</b> total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E
5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E

As a child, Lynch read the Harry Potter series and became a fan, sending letters to the author, J. K. Rowling. She attended Cartown National School in Termonfeckin until June 2004 and then moved to Our Lady's College in Drogheda, where her father was the deputy principal. In 2008, Lynch studied speculative fiction and drama at the Centre for the Talented Youth of Ireland, a summer school for gifted teens, in Glasnevin. While on the Harry Potter set, she was tutored for at least <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day.

5|$|Velvet Revolver soon gained major label {{attention}} with Warner Bros. and Chrysalis. RCA and Elektra were {{also interested in}} signing the band. They eventually signed with RCA Records. They recorded their album at NRG Recording Studios, while Slash recorded his guitar parts at a smaller studio on the southern corner between Highland Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. During recording, Weiland could only work for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day due to a court order mentioning {{that he was to}} stay in a halfway house. The marketing campaign for Velvet Revolver {{in the run-up to the}} release of the first album was profiled as part of the Frontline program The Way the Music Died, which included interviews with the band members and producers.|$|E

25|$|Early experimenters used gases. In 1806, Swiss {{engineer}} François Isaac de Rivaz {{built an}} engine powered by internal combustion of a {{hydrogen and oxygen}} mixture. In 1826, Englishman Samuel Brown tested his hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engine by using it to propel a vehicle up Shooter's Hill in south-east London. Belgian-born Etienne Lenoir's Hippomobile with a hydrogen-gas-fuelled one-cylinder internal combustion engine made a test drive from Paris to Joinville-le-Pont in 1860, covering some nine kilometres in about <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>A</b> later version was propelled by coal gas. A Delamare-Deboutteville vehicle was patented and trialled in 1884.|$|E
25|$|The first {{clinical}} implantation into a human of a fully implantable pacemaker was in 1958 at the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden, using a pacemaker {{designed by}} Rune Elmqvist and surgeon Åke Senning, connected to electrodes {{attached to the}} myocardium of the heart by thoracotomy. The device failed after <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>A</b> second device was then implanted which lasted for two days. The world's first implantable pacemaker patient, Arne Larsson, went on to receive 26 different pacemakers during his lifetime. He died in 2001, {{at the age of}} 86, outliving the inventor as well as the surgeon.|$|E

In 2004 it became a full time channel, broadcasting motors programming during the day and adult programming in the late evening although the adult programming was dropped when the channel went free-to-air in 2005. It lasted longest of all the channels, and ran until 2010, when it was closed to make way for ITV HD. Most of its programmes were transferred to ITV4.|$|E
25|$|Stuart {{moved his}} 4,500 troopers to get between Sheridan and Richmond. The two forces met {{at noon on}} May 11 at Yellow Tavern, an {{abandoned}} inn located six miles (10km) north of Richmond. Not only did the Union outnumber the Confederates by three divisions to two brigades, it had superior firepower—all were armed with rapid-firing Spencer carbines. The Confederate troopers tenaciously resisted from the low ridgeline bordering the road to Richmond, fighting for over <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>A</b> countercharge by the 1st Virginia Cavalry pushed the advancing Union troopers back from the hilltop as Stuart, mounted on horseback, shouted encouragement. As the 5th Michigan Cavalry streamed in retreat past Stuart, he was shot, and he died in Richmond the following day. The fighting kept up for an hour after Stuart was wounded, Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee taking temporary command.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 1810, Alban was off Læsø island {{when she}} saw six Danish gunboats coming towards her from the {{direction}} of the Skaw. Wind conditions were calm so Alban had to resort to her sweeps to try to escape the Danes. She was unsuccessful and by early afternoon an engagement had commenced. After about <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> <b>a</b> cannon shot took off the back of Thomas's skull. His second in command, Midshipman Alexander Hutchinson, continued the resistance for another hour, but then struck. Alban had lost two men killed (including Thomas), and had three wounded, out of a crew of some 25. She also had five feet of water in her hold, and her rigging and sails were entirely shot away. The subsequent court martial honourably acquitted Hutchinson and the surviving officers and men, and recommended Hutchinson for promotion. The Danish gunboat flotilla was under the command of Lieutenant Jørgen Conrad de Falsen.|$|E

25|$|Seeking {{to attack}} French {{positions}} before {{the bulk of}} Gamelin's army from Damascus arrived to the village, the rebels made a charge against al-Musayfirah on 16 September. While {{they were able to}} consistently charge against French positions for around 10 hours, they were successfully repulsed by French machine gun fire each time. The rebels launched a second major assault in the early morning of 17 September, but once more, no significant number of rebels were able to breach French lines. However, a number of rebels managed to ambush French legionnaires in al-Musayfirah's narrow streets. This part of the battle was largely marked by hand-to-hand fighting, despite the bulk of the French forces being cavalry-based. After sunrise, French aircraft bombarded rebel forces 27 times within the span of <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>A</b> French rescue column, consisting of a battalion of the 16th (or the 18th) Tirailleurs under the commanded of Colonel Charles Andréa arrived in the evening hours.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the paid}} fire service only covered present day Manhattan, until {{the act of}} 1865 which united Brooklyn with Manhattan to form the Metropolitan District. The same year the fire {{department}} consisted of 13 Chief Officers and 552 Company Officers and firemen. The officers and firemen worked a continuous tour of duty, with <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day off for meals and one day off a month, and were paid salaries according to their rank or grade. 1865 also saw the first adoption of regulations, although they were fairly strict and straitlaced. Following several large fires in 1866 which resulted in excessive fire losses and a rise in insurance rates, the fire department was reorganized {{under the command of}} General Alexander Shaler, and with military discipline the paid department reached its full potential which resulted in a general reduction in fire losses. In 1870 the merit system of promotion in the Fire Department was established. Southwestern Westchester County (which would later become the western Bronx) was annexed by New York in 1874 and the volunteers there were phased out and replaced by the paid department. This pattern was repeated as City services expanded elsewhere.|$|E

Mustaine also noted that he initially took a casual approach to the album, starting out working <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> night, four days a week.|$|E
50|$|The {{rebirth of}} Chagres' {{importance}} was short-lived. Although {{the advent of}} steamboat service on the Chagres River had, by 1853, shortened {{the time required to}} cross the isthmus from several days to about twelve hours, the 1855 completion of the Panama Railway further reduced the transcontinental travel time to about <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the railway’s Atlantic terminus, Colón, became Panama's Atlantic port, and Chagres receded from importance.|$|R
