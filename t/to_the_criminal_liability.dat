40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} the questions related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> of legal entities, with {{focus on their}} sanctioning. The criminal law is being traditionally linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> of an individual. The social environment {{has changed in the}} last decades {{in such a way that}} it was vital to reflect its negative consequences. In a number of EU countries, the action resulted in implementation of criminal lability of legal entities. The Czech Republic used to be a country where the criminal lability of legal entities was not complied with for many years. The change was brought by adopting the act of No. 418 / 2011 valid from 1 st January 2012, dealing with criminal liability of legal entities and its related proceedings. The thesis is devided into four chapters. The opening chapter focuses on theoretical questions of criminal liability of legal entities. Different approaches to the matter are analysed here in detail, international and European commitments of the Czech Republic in relation to criminal liability of legal entities are also mentioned. The second chapter is related to the basic rules of sanctioning the legal entities. Theoretical definition of "sentence" and "preventive measure" terms can be found in the first part of the chapter.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{definition}} of (substantive) subsidiarity of criminal repression {{and the possibility of}} its application <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> of legal persons. After defining the liability of legal persons in the relevant legal regulations, the paper presents an interpretation of subsidiarity in Section 12 (2) of the Criminal Code that is significantly different from the “official” opinion. Subsequently, the paper discusses certain criminal law situations in which the application of subsidiarity would lead {{to the conclusion that the}} legal person is not punishable (“non-criminality”). The first aim was thus to present the theoretical concept of subsidiarity of criminal repression, which would be methodologically correct, and therefore generally applicable.

40|$|The {{shortcomings}} of individualist models of corporate criminal liability {{have led to}} the development of more realistic approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> of juristic persons. In this contribution two legislative attempts to impose criminal liability on corporations based on their unique corporate identity or corporate ethos are critically discussed. The Criminal Code Act of 1995 applicable in the Commonwealth of Australia provides that the fault element of an offence must be attributed to a corporate body if that body expressly, tacitly or impliedly authorised or permitted the commission of the offence. One of the manners in which the authorisation or permission for the offence may be established is by having regard to the corporate culture which had existed within the body corporate that directed, encouraged or tolerated the criminal conduct. This approach is often regarded as the most sophisticated and comprehensive model for corporate criminal liability. The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of the United Kingdom of 2007 provides that a jury may take into consideration the extent to which the evidence shows that there were attitudes, policies, systems or accepted practices within an organisation that were likely to have encouraged failure to comply with health and safety legislation. The corporate culture or corporate identity model is not the exclusive model of attribution in these jurisdictions. It does, however, go a long way towards recognising true corporate or organisational fault. Corporate acts are not merely reduced to the fault of individuals but are rather based on the manner in which the corporation is structured. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of whether a sponsor of an initial public offering (IPO) is subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> and civil <b>liability</b> provisions of Hong Kong’s prospectus law has been debated for over 15 years and remains untested in court. The interpretation of the law provided by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in August 2014 is that sponsors are subject to prospectus liability because they are persons who authorize the issue of the prospectus, an interpretation based on certain non-statutory considerations to which sponsors are subject. <b>To</b> examine whether <b>the</b> SFC’s position is supported in law, this article considers three possible routes by which legal liability might be established: through the relationship between non-statutory regulations and law, the law on authority, and the legal, regulatory and commercial context of sponsor work.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the classic {{question of the}} tension between military discipline and individual responsibility; and whether {{and to what extent}} following superior orders may constitute a circumstance excluding <b>criminal</b> <b>liability.</b> Unlawful acts performed pursuant to superior orders can be regarded as a question of necessity – “I was forced to act” – or as a question of mistake of law – “I did not know it was wrong”. Unlike in international criminal law, in Norwegian law necessity can justify an otherwise criminal act but not all actions are justifiable: for example, sacrificing innocent lives to save another life will never be a lawful act of necessity. This may in the author’s view lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unreasonably strict enforcement of the law and a soldier could thus be found guilty of manslaughter for failing to be a hero in an impossible situation. Though mitigation of sentence is granted, the label of guilt remains. There is no criminal responsibility without subjective guilt, but to plead ignorance of the law – “mistake of law” – has in Norwegian general criminal law very rarely led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exclusion of <b>criminal</b> <b>liability.</b> In <b>the</b> Norwegian military <b>criminal</b> code, however, <b>the</b> subordinate is relieved of criminal responsibility for acts performed in compliance with an order unless the subordinate knew or should have known that the order was unlawful. It is the author’s view that soldiers and officers who comply with superior orders are thus treated more leniently than people in general. Furthermore, this may imply the – much contested – possibility of being acquitted for certain war crimes when these are not manifestly unlawful. One example is when a soldier mistakenly considers certain civilian conduct to be direct participation in hostilities, which would temporarily make the civilian a lawful target. This mistake would result in a direct attack on protected persons – a war crime...|$|R

40|$|The inmate who {{escapes from}} a federal or state prison and seeks to {{introduce}} evidence of unconstitutionally cruel and unusual confinement conditions to defend her action is barred by the well-established rule that prison conditions alone, no matter how intolerable or inhumane, neither justify nor excuse escape. If she attempts <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> defense of necessity—a limited exception to this rule—the prisoner {{will be required to}} show that a specific, imminent threat of death or serious injury prompt her escape. Evidence of prolonged or repeated deprivation and mistreatment sufficient to prove a violation of the eighth amendment may not be sufficient to ground a necessity defense. Frequently, such evidence will fail <b>to</b> show that <b>the</b> prisoner 2 ̆ 7 s physical safety was gravely and immediately imperiled at a point in time very close <b>to</b> her escape. <b>The</b> recent case of United States v.

In Bailey, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reexamined the relevance of conditions of confinement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> imposition of <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> for escape. This reevaluation produced a theory of escape which suggests that, under certain circumstances, escape from unconstitutional conditions would not be punishable as a crime. This Note explores the case for broadening <b>the</b> necessity defense <b>to</b> encompass escape from conditions violating the eighth amendment. Using Bailey as a starting point, it argues that recognized constitutional principles suggest that, when no other remedies are available or effective, escape from cruel and unusual punishment can be justified. After considering the theoretical support for this application of the necessity defense, this Note discusses some practical concerns in using the defense, concentrating first on the jury 2 ̆ 7 s role in determining whether conditions are constitutionally impermissible and then on some of <b>the</b> factors relevant <b>to</b> evaluating <b>the</b> presence of viable alternatives to escape...|$|R
