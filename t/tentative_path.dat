To this end, a conventional vehicle was fitted with a set of sensors and actuators to acquire continuous location and environmental data to safely and appropriately interact with a dynamic environment. The vehicle autonomously performs local piloting, following a <b>tentative</b> <b>path</b> initially specified by the human operator through a set of intermediate positions. A wireless LAN is used to get a bi-directional communication between the farming vehicle and the human supervisor. Sensor-fusion algorithms are proposed to overcome the lack of GPS signals so as to obtain continuous and precise positioning. From a set of basic motion agents ADVANCE, TURN, STOP, AVOID OBSTACLE, more specific agents related to the agricultural operation are defined, such as FOLLOWSTRAIGHT LINE and CHANGE OF ROW. Some results are presented to show global navigation. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Cultural {{policies}} {{have become an}} important segment of strategic city planning and cultural interventions have {{assumed the role of}} flagship projects within the urban regeneration schemes. The shift from the old consumption-oriented model to production-oriented cultural policies is linked to the rise of the paradigm of creative city, with creativity as a decisive driver of attractiveness. But, if carefully analyzed, this paradigm clearly shows some evident paradoxes. In fact, the so called creative milieu cannot simply be pinned down in a ghetto or in bureaucratic regulations. How can urban planning and development – which are primarily oriented towards imposing and regulating – be expected {{to come up with an}} effective response to something like the fostering of creative milieus? The article suggests a possible contaminative (and <b>tentative)</b> <b>path</b> towards a more effective involvement of cultural activities within planning practices moving from a concept of art as experience. On the other hand, the case-study, which is at the basis of the conclusive findings, clearly shows the hardships in leading these highly experimental practices within a unique model, also highlighting the limits in terms of innovation of the so-called best practices as a methodology in urban studies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Primary kaolins, {{related to}} Pliocene-Pleistocene {{volcanic}} rocks of acid to intermediate composition {{from the southern}} part of Kimolos island contain kaolinite and quartz + cristobalite. Smectite is rarely present whereas alunite is common and more prevalent than baryte or gypsum. The kaolinites show structural disorder (Hinckley indices ranging from 0. 6 to 1. 1) and contain faults along the c*-axis. The elements Nb, Th, Ce and Sr, La, V constitute two groups with a strong intercorrelation a d the kaolins are enriched in these dements compared to the parent rocks. K, Rb, Y and Ba are positively correlated with feldspar content and decrease with the intensity of kaolinization. The mineral assemblages suggest a zonal pattern which is thought o be related to different ypes of hydrothermal alteration. Starting from the triple point of the alunite-K-feldspar-K-mica-quartz association encountered in Kimolos, a <b>tentative</b> <b>path</b> is presented showing the approximate ranges in concentrations of K 2 SO 4 and H 2 SO 4 required for the formation of the various mineral assemblages. Primary kaolins genetically related to volcanic rocks are scattered in the southern parts of Kimolos island which is situated at the SW end of the Cycladic group of islands, and along with Milos, Antimilos and Poliaigos constitute the Milos island volcanic group (Fig. la), par...|$|E

40|$|The Internet is {{constantly}} growing but the available resources, i. e. bandwidth, are limited. Using bandwidth efficiently to provide {{high quality of}} service to users {{is referred to as}} traffic engineering. This is of utmost importance. Traffic in IP networks is commonly routed along shortest paths with respect to auxiliary link weights, e. g. using the OSPF or IS-IS protocol. Here, shortest path routing is indirectly controlled via the link weights only, and it is therefore crucial to have a profound understanding of the shortest path routing mechanism to solve traffic engineering problems in IP networks. The theoretical aspects of such problems have received little attention. Traffic engineering in IP networks leads to very difficult optimization problems and the key element in exact methods for such problems is an inverse shortest path routing problem. It is used to answer the fundamental question of whether there exist link weights that reproduce a set of <b>tentative</b> <b>paths.</b> Path sets that cannot be obtained correspond to routing conflicts. Valid inequalities are instrumental to prohibit such routing conflicts. We analyze the inverse shortest path routing problem thoroughly. We show that the problem is NP-complete, contrary to what is claimed in the literature, and propose a stronger relaxation. Its Farkas system is used to develop a novel and compact formulation based on cycle bases, and to classify and characterize minimal infeasible subsystems. Valid inequalities that prevent routing conflicts are derived and separation algorithms are developed for such inequalities. We also consider several approaches to modelling traffic engineering problems, especially Dantzig–Wolfe reformulations and extended formulations. We give characterizations of facets for some relaxations of traffic engineering problems. Our results contribute to the theoretical understanding, modelling and solution of problems related to traffic engineering in IP networks...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{algorithm}} OPTGAME 2. 0 to solve N-person discrete-time LQ games exactly, and discrete-time non-linear quadratic games approximately {{by means of}} an appropriate linearization procedure, where N> 2. I. e., the objective function is assumed to be quadratic in the deviations of states and control variables from their respective desired target-values, and will be optimized for a pre-specified period of time subject to a nonlinear autonomous system. OPTGAME 2. 0 allows the calculation of the Nash and Stackelberg equilibrium solutions, and the cooperative Pareto-optimal solutions for any number of players. Emanating from the informational basis of each player's decision, we distinguish between open-loop information patterns, where the player's strategies depend only on the initial state of the dynamic system, and feedback information patterns, where the strategies depend on {{the current state of the}} system (but not on the initial conditions). Deterministic dynamic game models can be solved by using essentially the same techniques as for solving deterministic optimal control models, but the choice of the solution technique determines the information pattern. I. e., the application of the minimum principle generates the open-loop solutions, while the application of the dynamic programming technique determines the feedback solutions. The algorithm OPTGAME 2. 0 starts from computing a <b>tentative</b> <b>path</b> of the state vector from the nonlinear system equations - using the Gauss-Seidl algorithm - with a given <b>tentative</b> <b>path</b> for the control variables. Then the algorithm linearizes the system equations at the reference values obtained before, replacing the nonlinear autonomous system by a linear non-autonomous one. Then, the algorithm calculates numerically the Nash, Stackelberg, and Pareto solutions of non-linear, quadratic deterministic games (with a finite planing horizon) under open-loop and feedback information structure. This is done by use of the appropriate optimization technique corresponding to the desired information structure of the game, and yields so-called Riccati equations which can be solved by backward integration. Then, we derive by forward iteration the so-called feedback matrices, where further substitution of these matrices into linear relations in the preceding state variable delivers the values of the optimal control variables (expressed in feedback form) - as well as the optimal state values. The term äOPTGAME" denotes both, the computer algorithm and its implementation, where the implementation part consists of a set of procedures which are implemented in the programming language GAUSS. GAUSS is a high level matrix programming language specializing in commands, functions, and procedures for data analysis and statistical applications. This interplay is of special interest for the application of OPTGAME 2. 0 in the field of optimal short-run and long-run fiscal policies towards the EMU. Furthermore, GAUSS includes a variety of routines which perform standard matrix operations, e. g. routines to calculate determinants, matrix inverses, decompositions, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and condition numbers. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, construction and control systems {{development of the}} marine cybernetics vessel CS Saucer. CS Saucer is a fully actuated and highly controllable vessel with a spherically shaped hull, much like a flying saucer. The vessel is fitted with three azimuth thrusters which are driven by three Torpedo 800 motors. The embedded controller myRIO from National Instruments is used to control the vessel. The system {{is powered by a}} three cell 11. 1 V Lithium Polymer battery. The hull of the vessel is constructed from three millimeter MDF sheeting, milled Divinycell foam and a woven carbon sheet fitted to the exterior of the vessel with epoxy. This results in a rigid and watertight hull with a low draft. The vessel has a detachable lid made of plexi glass that is secured {{to the top of the}} vessel with four butterfly screws. The drag forces acting on the vessel have been analyzed through testing in the Marine Cybernetics Laboratory (MC Lab) at NTNU. The results have been used to derive the parameters for a dynamic model used in Hardware-in- the-loop testing and for future model based control design. The forces produced by each of the thrusters have been mapped and approximated with linear curve fitting. This approximated force mapping has been used in the implemented thrust allocation with fixed thruster angles. Manual thruster control and manual force control of the vessel can be operated by the application on the host computer or directly from the Dashboard app from National Instruments available on Android and iOS devices. A dynamic positioning system has been implemented on the CS Saucer and tested in the MC Lab. The dynamic positioning system performs as desired when changing the setpoint for the vessel position. A <b>tentative</b> <b>path</b> following controller has also been implemented and tested on the vessel. The completed CS Saucer is a fully functioning vessel and a stable and expandable platform for use in future demonstrations, projects and research at the MC Lab...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for shape {{transformation in the}} plane. The primary strength of the proposed method over previous approaches for shape transformation is that our method can achieve shape transformation in a domain that can contain obstacles which are possibly in motion. A smooth transformation between two given polygonal shapes is to be attained while ensuring that {{any part of the}} shape is free of collision with the obstacles in the domain during the transformation process. The problem is formulated as minimization of a cost function associated with each transformation path that controls length, smoothness, and collision-freedom of the path. The problem is solved in three steps. First, a population of <b>tentative</b> transformation <b>paths</b> is generated by combining path planning for an anchor point in the shape and a randomization process. Second, collision detection and shape deformation techniques are applied to keyframes along the paths to minimize the occurrence of collisio [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: P-T pseudosections were {{calculated}} with the programs THERMOCALC, DOMINO and PERPLEX in the simplified NCFMASH system {{in order to}} constrain the metamorphic path of a kyanite eclogite. Variation of rock composition, thermodynamic data set and solid solution models results in partly distinct different P-T stability fields of mineral assemblages. The rock composition was determined by XRF analyses and by combining mineral modes from thin section measurements with microprobe analyses. With other parameters kept constant, compositional variations resulting {{from different parts of}} the specimen and from zonation of garnet affect the results. THERMOCALC pseudosections suggest that the assemblage omphacite + glaucophane + chlorite ± lawsonite / zoisite / clinozoisite ± paragonite is stable at relatively low temperatures. The garnet-in isograd is placed around 500 °C and garnet growth continues up to the kyanite-in isograd at about 600 °C. An extended temperature interval for garnet growth is also confirmed by Fe-Mg exchange temperatures of omphacite inclusions in garnet. A <b>tentative</b> metamorphic <b>path</b> is given with a maximum P-T position at about 635 °C, 21. 5 kbar in the assemblage garnet + omphacite + kyanite according to THERMOCALC and additional paragonite or zoisite is calculated by DOMINO or PERPLEX. The replacement of kyanite by paragonite during the retrograde stage is predicted by THERMOCALC but the calculated formation of glaucophane is not observed, probably due to unsufficient H 2 O in the rock. Comparison of calculated and observed modal amounts and of mineral compositions is only in part satisfactory, mainly due to uncertainities in thermodynamic data and solid solution models, above all for amphiboles and to the problematic definition of equilibrium bulk composition.

40|$|This thesis {{began with}} {{practitioner}} observations in a specialist personal training practice, where anecdotal themes were noted from middle-aged clients (45 - 65 years old). Sedentary, exercise-averse individuals reported poor experiences {{of physical education}} in secondary school, whereas active clients gave a different narrative. These themes suggested differing life course trajectories {{that could result in}} ‘corporeal dissociation’ (CD), a term, defined here to describe a state of physical detachment that might result in adult inactivity. ‘Lives lived’ were investigated through a lifecourse theoretical perspective, within a pragmatic paradigm. Methodological Bricolage employed both qualitative and quantitative multi-methods to look at the research questions from differing perspectives. In Study 1, 10 practitioners were interviewed qualitatively to see if the original observations were replicated in other practices within the same geographical area. Data was analysed using content and emergent thematic analysis and it was found to be so. In Study 2, 800 middle-aged men and women across England completed a quantitative online survey that covered 63 experiences, grouped thematically, between the ages of 11 - 16 : ‘home’, ‘about me’, ‘school’, ‘friends and leisure activities’. Data was statistically analysed using Principal Component Analysis followed by ANOVA and 16 significant dispositions and experiences centred around PE emerged as signifiers of corporeal dissociation in middle age. Study 3 took a sample of 8 men and 8 women from Study 2. It used narrative inquiry and established lifecourse themes of activity and inactivity that link adolescence and middle-age, with the individual’s relationship with their PE teacher being the biggest signifier and influence on later physical activity. Results show that corporeal dissociation can be found in practice and its origins in PE experience identified. <b>Tentative</b> life <b>path</b> signifiers have been determined and have been mapped between school and middle age. The outcome of the study is an understanding and definition of corporeal dissociation and a scalable tool for the practitioner to identify corporeal dissociation in new clients to help aid initial exercise adherence by prescribing suitable exercise programming...|$|R
40|$|The main {{research}} {{topic of}} this study is universities’ academic research and knowledge-transfer activities in a catch-up country, particularly {{the relationship between the two}} activities, which has been rarely examined in previous research. In order to understand this issue against existing literature, a critical review of previous studies has been attempted, considering the idiosyncratic characteristics of the Korean national innovation system. As a result, at the three analysis levels (i. e. national, organisational and individual levels), we propose three conceptual elements respectively: a <b>tentative</b> historical <b>path</b> of universities in catch-up countries; critical factors influencing knowledge transfer activities of universities in catch-up countries; and academics operating in synergy mode. Thereafter, based on the methodology integrating not only the three analysis levels but also qualitative and quantitative approaches, we analyse the data collected from the interviews with Korean academics, survey responses from Korean academics and government White Papers on the activities of Korean universities. The results show a close and positive relationship between Korean universities’ academic research and knowledge-transfer activities across the three levels. Firstly, during the last several decades, the Korean government has strongly encouraged the development of teaching, academic research and knowledge-transfer activities of Korean universities in harmony with the different developmental stages of Korean industry. This has resulted in selective patterns of the universities’ three activities (e. g. concentration of scientific activities in certain fields). Secondly, organisational factors such as scientific capacity and industry funding are important for universities’ knowledge-transfer activities in a catch-up country, which corroborates the positive relationship between the two activities. Finally, in terms of the factors influencing the synergy mode (i. e. a positive relationship between academic research and knowledge-transfer activities), academics’ career stage and disciplines are important. This is related to the rapid expansion of the Korean academic system and the selectivity found in its activities. Based on these findings, it is tempting to conclude that universities in East Asian catch-up countries have developed their own academic system different from those in developed countries, which can be characterised as having strong government control and a high level of interaction with other actors in the national innovation system. Therefore, the application of the controversy over the direct economic contribution of universities in western countries to the context of catch-up countries is quite limited...|$|R
