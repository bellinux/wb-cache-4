5|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries,</b> {{tropical}} cyclones {{have been}} {{responsible for the deaths of}} about 1.9 million people worldwide. Large areas of standing water caused by flooding lead to infection, as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses. Crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation. Tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure, leading to power outages, bridge destruction, and the hampering of reconstruction efforts. On average, the Gulf and east coasts of the United States suffer approximately US $5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage every year. The majority (83%) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes, category 3 or greater. However, category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year.|$|E

Consideration is paid to the possibilities of reducing fossil fuel dependence but it is shown how unlikely such a ‘powering down’ will be. The author demonstrates how energy is a massive problem for social theory and for 21 st-century societies.

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{problem in}} system theory concerns determining {{whether or not}} a given LTI system x˙=Ax is diagonally stable.

While this problem has attracted much attention over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> half <b>century,</b> <b>two</b> results of note stand out: (i) a result based on Theorems of the Alternative derived by Barker, Berman and Plemmons; and (ii) algebraic conditions derived by Redheffer. This paper is concerned with the second of these conditions. Our principal contribution is to show that Redheffer’s result can be obtained from the Kalman–Yacubovich–Popov lemma. We then show that this method of proof leads to natural generalisations of Redheffer’s result and we use these results to derive new conditions for diagonal and Hurwitz stability for special classes of matrices...|$|R

40|$|Historical {{variability}} in fire regimes and forest age structures is necessary reference information for management of vegetation and landscape patterns in naturally managed ecosystems. In this study, we reconstructed fire history and forest age structure at Point Reyes National Seashore {{on the central}} California coast to document changes in forest conditions over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> ca. <b>two</b> <b>centuries.</b> Surface fire history was reconstructed from dendrochronologically-crossdated fire-scarred trees in two stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) and one stand of coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). Age structure in an approximately 2000 ha area of Douglas-fir forest was examined for tree recruitment patterns. Reconstructed mean surface fire intervals and Weibull median probability intervals ranged from apprx 7 to apprx 13 years. Fires generally occurred late in the growing season or after growth had ceased for a year. Spatial patterns of historic fires and those reconstructed fromthe fire-scar record document often widespread fires in the central Olema Valley. Likely many, if not most, of the fires reconstructed from Point Reyes were ignited by humans given {{the long history of}} intensive use of this area, first by the Coast Miwok and later by European ranchers. Age structures of stands suggest that much of the Douglas-fir overstory is multiaged with little evidence of stand-replacing fire or other disturbance events. Ages of trees in Douglas-fir stands document increasing landscape coverage of Douglas-fir forest at Point Reyes and hardwood recruitment under older Douglas-fir canopies, and suggest that loss of surface fires is having cascading effects on landscape vegetation patterns, community relationships, and probably related ecosystem processesBrown et al "Fire history in Douglas-fir and coast redwood forests at Point Reyes National Seashore, California.

In the Sultanate of Oman, a country characterized by one of the highest rates of consanguineous marriages worldwide, prevalence of genetic hearing loss (GHL) is estimated to be 6 / 10 [*] 000. Families of GHL patients have higher consanguinity rates than the general Omani population, indicating a major role for recessive forms. Mutations in GJB 2, the most commonly mutated GHL gene, have been sporadically described. We collected 97 DNA samples of GHL probands, affected/unaffected siblings and parents from 26 Omani consanguineous families. Analyzing a first family by whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous frameshift duplication (c. 1171 _ 1177 dupGCCATCT) in MYO 15 A, the gene linked to the deafness locus DFNB 3.
