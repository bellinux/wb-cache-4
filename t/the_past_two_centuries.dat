5|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries,</b> {{tropical}} cyclones {{have been}} {{responsible for the deaths of}} about 1.9 million people worldwide. Large areas of standing water caused by flooding lead to infection, as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses. Crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation. Tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure, leading to power outages, bridge destruction, and the hampering of reconstruction efforts. On average, the Gulf and east coasts of the United States suffer approximately US $5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage every year. The majority (83%) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes, category 3 or greater. However, category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year.|$|E

40|$|Historical {{variability}} in fire regimes and forest age structures is necessary reference information for management of vegetation and landscape patterns in naturally managed ecosystems. In this study, we reconstructed fire history and forest age structure at Point Reyes National Seashore {{on the central}} California coast to document changes in forest conditions over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> ca. <b>two</b> <b>centuries.</b> Surface fire history was reconstructed from dendrochronologically-crossdated fire-scarred trees in two stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) and one stand of coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). Age structure in an approximately 2000 ha area of Douglas-fir forest was examined for tree recruitment patterns. Reconstructed mean surface fire intervals and Weibull median probability intervals ranged from apprx 7 to apprx 13 years. Fires generally occurred late in the growing season or after growth had ceased for a year. Spatial patterns of historic fires and those reconstructed fromthe fire-scar record document often widespread fires in the central Olema Valley. Likely many, if not most, of the fires reconstructed from Point Reyes were ignited by humans given {{the long history of}} intensive use of this area, first by the Coast Miwok and later by European ranchers. Age structures of stands suggest that much of the Douglas-fir overstory is multiaged with little evidence of stand-replacing fire or other disturbance events. Ages of trees in Douglas-fir stands document increasing landscape coverage of Douglas-fir forest at Point Reyes and hardwood recruitment under older Douglas-fir canopies, and suggest that loss of surface fires is having cascading effects on landscape vegetation patterns, community relationships, and probably related ecosystem processesBrown et al "Fire history in Douglas-fir and coast redwood forests at Point Reyes National Seashore, California.

In the Sultanate of Oman, a country characterized by one of the highest rates of consanguineous marriages worldwide, prevalence of genetic hearing loss (GHL) is estimated to be 6 / 10 [*] 000. Families of GHL patients have higher consanguinity rates than the general Omani population, indicating a major role for recessive forms. Mutations in GJB 2, the most commonly mutated GHL gene, have been sporadically described. We collected 97 DNA samples of GHL probands, affected/unaffected siblings and parents from 26 Omani consanguineous families. Analyzing a first family by whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous frameshift duplication (c. 1171 _ 1177 dupGCCATCT) in MYO 15 A, the gene linked to the deafness locus DFNB 3.
