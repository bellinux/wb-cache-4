Most of the expenditure of <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> is spent on the NHS—£98.6billion was spent in 2008–2009. In recent years the private sector has been increasingly used to provide more NHS services despite opposition by doctors and trade unions. The average life expectancy of people in England is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four countries of the United Kingdom.|$|E

The building houses <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> and the Department for Work and Pensions and is their main regional offices. The building is controversial. Its imposing design has often been regarded as being domineering and self-important and has led the building to be nicknamed The Kremlin and The Ministry of Truth.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing gender inequity in research, {{a number of}} countries have made women's health the subject of national initiatives. For instance in 1991 in the United States, <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> and Human Services established an Office on Women's Health (OWH) with the goal of improving the health of women in America, through coordinating the women's health agenda throughout the Department, and other agencies. In the twenty first century the Office has focussed on underserviced women. Also, in 1994 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established its own Office of Women's Health (OWH), which was formally authorised by the 2010 Affordable Health Care Act (ACA).|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1966, air-pollution control {{had largely}} been the {{responsibility}} of states and political subdivisions of states like counties and municipalities (cities and towns). The federal government played little role in air-pollution control, {{and to the extent}} that it did, its actions supported the efforts of states and local governments. For example, federal law provided resources like research, training, grants to improve state and local programs, and a conference procedure to convene agencies and polluters under the guidance of <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health,</b> Education and Welfare. Direct regulations—such as, for example, setting emissions standards—were left to states.|$|E
5|$|Robert C. Weaver {{became the}} first African American to hold a Cabinet-level {{position}} when he was appointed Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Patricia Roberts Harris {{became the first}} African-American female cabinet member when she was appointed Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 1977. In 1979, Harris became the first African American to be head of <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health,</b> Education, and Welfare, which was split into the departments of Education and Health and Human Services in the same year. The appointments of Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State made them the highest-ranking African Americans in the United States presidential line of succession.|$|E

5|$|The {{piercing}} gun: The {{vast majority}} {{of women in the}} west have their ears pierced with a piercing gun. The safety of piercing guns, which were originally developed for tagging livestock, has been disputed. <b>The</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> of Western Australia does not recommend their use for piercing body parts other than the lobes of ears, and the Association of Professional Piercers recommends that piercing guns not be used for any piercing, requiring members to agree not to use piercing guns in their practice.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws {{have learned}} to peck open the foil caps of milk bottles left on the doorsteps after {{delivery}} by the milkman. The bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so milk can become contaminated as they drink. This activity was linked to cases of Campylobacter gastroenteritis in Gateshead in northeast England and led <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds attacking bottles in future.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bessell's efforts {{ensured that}} {{for the time being}} the Scott threat was kept at bay. The missing {{insurance}} card meant that Scott's wife, who was pregnant, could not claim maternity benefits. Scott threatened to talk to newspapers, but the matter was resolved by the issue of an emergency card after Bessell's intervention at <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> and Social Security. In 1970 Scott's marriage collapsed; he blamed Thorpe, and again threatened exposure. Bessell successfully prevented Thorpe's name being mentioned in court during the divorce proceedings, and arranged that Thorpe would anonymously pay the legal costs. Early in 1971 Scott moved to a cottage in the village of Talybont in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones. He sufficiently persuaded her of his mistreatment at the hands of Thorpe that she contacted the Liberal MP for the adjoining constituency of Montgomeryshire—Emlyn Hooson, on {{the right wing of the}} party and a friend of neither Thorpe nor Bessell. Hooson suggested a meeting at the House of Commons.|$|E
