50|$|The {{parting line}} must occur {{along the line}} round the {{position}} of maximum dimension when viewed in the draw direction.pyeMany applications (seals, tight running molded parts) that require precision for shape control, call for removal of flashes. Secondary operations are thus employed, in addition to high precision molding dies to remove these flashes. Many molders will repair or even replace the mold tooling so that the flash is reduced to an acceptable tolerance or eliminated altogether. Secondary operations to remove parting line flash include hand trimming, vibratory <b>tumbling,</b> <b>media</b> blasting and cryogenic deflashing.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{cleaning}} of diving cylinders {{may be required}} to remove contaminants or to allow effective visual inspection. Cleaning methods should remove contaminants and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal. Chemical cleaning using solvents, detergents and pickling agents may be used depending on the contaminant and cylinder material. <b>Tumbling</b> with abrasive <b>media</b> may be needed for heavy contamination, particularly of heavy corrosion products.|$|R
50|$|Cryogenic {{deburring}} is a {{cryogenic process}} used to remove burrs and flash from plastic and die cast workpieces. The process works by tumbling and/or abrasively blasting the workpieces at cryogenic temperature levels. The low temperatures (approximately -195 C) are achieved using liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide, or dry ice. This low temperature brings the material below its embrittlement temperature, which causes the flash or burrs {{to be easily}} removed via <b>tumbling</b> or <b>media</b> blasting. This process {{has been around since}} the 1960s to deflash plastic and rubber. Common materials that are typically cryogenically deburred with blast media include PEEK, nylon, Teflon, Delrin, polypropylene, polycarbonate, acetal, PTFE, PET, HDPE, PVC, ABS and many others.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} saturation-recovery {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance (SR-EPR), a time-resolved saturation transfer EPR technique, to measure directly the microsecond rotational diffusion of spin-labeled proteins. SR-EPR uses an intense microwave pulse to saturate a spin population having narrow distribution of orientations {{with respect to the}} magnetic field. The time evolution of the signal is then observed. The signal increases in time as saturation is relieved by spin-lattice relaxation (Tl) as well as by saturation transfer due to spectral diffusion (Tsd), which is a function of rotational diffusion (Tr) and spectral position. In the presence of both events, the recovery is biphasic, with the initial phase related to both Tr and Tl, and the second phase determined only by Tl. We have measured the saturation recoveries of spin-labeled hemoglobin <b>tumbling</b> in <b>media</b> of known viscosities as a function of rotational correlation time (Tr) and pulse duration (tp). The Tr values estimated from the initial phase of recovery were in good agreement with theory. Variation of the pulse time {{can also be used to}} determine Tr. For tp less than Tsd, the recoveries were observed to be biphasic, for tp greater than Tsd a single-exponential. T 1 values were determined from the recoveries after pulses quenching spectral diffusion or from the second phase of recovery after shorter pulses. These results demonstrate that SR-EPR is applicable to the study of motion of spin-labeled proteins. Its time resolution should provide a significant advantage over steady state techniques, particularly in the case of motional anisotropy or system heterogeneity...|$|R
