5|$|Jumping <b>technique</b> <b>has</b> {{played a}} {{significant}} part {{in the history of}} the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This <b>technique</b> <b>has</b> become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.|$|E

5|$|As {{feathers}} grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible {{dark and}} light bands in the fully formed feather. These so-called growth bars and their widths {{have been used to}} determine the daily nutritional status of birds. Each light and dark bar correspond to around 24 hours and the use of this <b>technique</b> <b>has</b> been called ptilochronology (analogous to dendrochronology).|$|E

5|$|Imaging {{tests of}} the veins {{are used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound. Each <b>technique</b> <b>has</b> drawbacks: a single proximal scan may miss a distal DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to distal DVT overtreatment. Doppler ultrasound, CT scan venography, MRI venography, or MRI of the thrombus are also possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This <b>technique</b> <b>has</b> been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.|$|E
5|$|To avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, {{two main}} {{sections}} of Borobudur stairs — the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides — {{are covered with}} wooden structures.

In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with rubber cover. Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.|$|E

5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the <b>technique</b> <b>has</b> been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|Several scales {{exist to}} grade the {{severity}} of acne vulgaris, but no single <b>technique</b> <b>has</b> been universally accepted as the diagnostic standard. Cook's acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8 (0 being the least severe and 8 being the most severe). This scale {{was the first to}} use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the scale has undergone several revisions. The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. The Pillsbury acne grading scale simply classifies {{the severity of}} the acne from 1 (least severe) to 4 (most severe).|$|E
5|$|The {{homes were}} reached through tunnels. Other {{examples}} of subterranean, semi-subterranean or cliff-based dwellings in both {{hot and cold}} climates are found in Turkey, northern China and the Himalayas, and the southwest USA. A number of Buddhist monasteries built from earth and other materials into cliff sides or caves in Himalayan areas such as Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and northern India are often perilously placed. Starting in the 1970s, interest in the <b>technique</b> <b>has</b> revived in developed countries. By setting an earth house into the ground, {{the house will be}} cooler in the warm season and warmer in the cool season.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, a new partial {{discharge}} location technique called three-point <b>technique</b> <b>had</b> {{been introduced to}} locate {{partial discharge}} on underground cable.

The results of the simulation were compared and analysed based on the accuracy, cost of implementation and algorithm complexity of the <b>technique.</b> Three-point <b>technique</b> <b>had</b> shown significant improvement in the accuracy of partial discharge location on underground cable...|$|R
