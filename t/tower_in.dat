5|$|Warkworth Castle is an {{irregular}} enclosure. The keep {{is at the}} north end, overlooking the town, with the bailey to the south.

Immediately west of the church was the kitchen, situated in {{the angle of the}} curtain wall as it changes from its north–south alignment and turns towards the keep. Along the west curtain wall, south of the kitchen, were the pantry, great hall, and withdrawing chambers. In the south-west was a chapel. Apart from the north side, the castle was surrounded by a moat.|$|E
