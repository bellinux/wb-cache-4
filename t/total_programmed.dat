50|$|The {{music for}} the machine {{consists}} of stage adaptations from the original Rock opera Tommy, composed by Pete Townshend of The Who. There are 21 songs <b>total</b> <b>programmed</b> to play throughout gameplay and for various stages and modes. Songs include Captain Walker, It's a Boy, Christmas, See Me Feel Me,Smash the Mirror, Fiddle About, Cousin Kevin, Sensation, Acid Queen, Pinball Wizard, and Sally Simpson. To launch each ball, the player can use either an automatic launch by pressing a flipper button while a ball is in the alley, or manually via the spring plunger assembly. The machine includes an automated silver disc that rotates to cover the flipper portion of the machine to emulate playing pinball as the title character. This mode occurs during each multiball sequence, or for the entire duration of the game by player selection of the Tommy game mode. The owner/operator may program a feature that allows the player to exchange credits for extra ball(s) to continue the game where it left off.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the determinants of quality in obstetric care and particularly why caesarean sections (CS) are experiencing unprecedented increases in developed societies. Design/methodology/approach – The paper exploits a population-based database containing records on the determinants of CS to study the effects of hospital complexity and private financing and controlling for clinical and social determinants. The data refer to the entire population deliveries data from year 2003 as collected by the Catalan Health Service (Conjunt Mínim de Base de Dades). This paper employs multivariate statistical analysis and it distinguishes between <b>total,</b> <b>programmed</b> and non-programmed deliveries. Findings – Privately financed hospitals and hospital complexity are significant determinants of the probability of a CS. Overall, the paper finds significant clinical variability between public and private hospitals. The significance of mother's age suggests that the delay in the motherhood is more likely to increase the probability of a CS in public hospital deliveries while it is not the case of private hospitals. It finds that demand for leisure and capacity explains CS in public hospitals but not in private hospitals. Practical implications – Quality of care is influenced by reimbursement mechanism along with provider complexity, which suggests that there is scope for improvement in providers pay per intervention. Originality/value – The nature of the data and methods. Childbirth, Health services, Hospitals, Lifestyles, Spain...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} total functions, {{which are}} uniformly defined, total procedures (or batch programs), which terminate uniformly, and total processes, which {{consist of a}} UNITY-like set of total procedures, so that they never terminate. This collection is shown to be Turing-complete. It can also appropriate for interactive programming. The paper argues from a software engineering viewpoint that <b>total</b> <b>programming</b> improves the reliability of programs, and makes them easier to reason about, with only a minor sacrifice of expressiveness. In particular, considering only <b>total</b> <b>programs</b> allows definitions and laws to be simplified. Formal derivations of total procedures are given using a novel combination of the Z-style termination convention combined with partial correctness reasoning. The derivations, it is claimed, {{are at least as}} clear and simple as those produced by other methods of formal operational refinement.
