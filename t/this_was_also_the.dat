5|$|In 1914–15, both Ottawa and the Wanderers {{bounced back}} to the top of league, tying each other for the NHA season title. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> season that future Hall of Famer Clint Benedict became the Senators' top goaltender, taking over from Percy LeSueur. Former Wanderer Art Ross joined the Senators and helped Ottawa win in a two-game playoff, 4–1. The Senators then played in the first inter-league Stanley Cup final playoff series with the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast (PCHA) league.

Despite the off-ice problems, Ottawa won the Presidents' Trophy, finishing with a franchise-record 113 points, making them the first Canadian team to win it since the Calgary Flames in 1989. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> highest finish by an Ottawa team in 77 years (since the original Senators finished first overall in 1926).
