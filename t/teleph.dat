40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} general {{approach}} to identifying non-linguistic speech features from the recorded signal using phone-based acoustic likelihoods. The basic idea is to process the unknown speech signal by feature-specific phone model sets in parallel, and to hypothesize the feature value associated with the model set having the highest likelihood. This technique is shown to be effective for text-independent gender, speaker, and language identification. Text-independent speaker identification accuracies of 98. 8 % on TIMIT (168 speakers) and 99. 2 % on BREF (65 speakers), were obtained with one utterance per speaker, and 100 % with 2 utterances for both corpora. Experiments in which speaker-specific models were estimated without using of the phonetic transcriptions for the TIMIT speakers had the same identification accuracies obtained {{with the use of}} the transcriptions. French/English language identification is better than 99 % with 2 s of read, laboratory speech. On spontaneous <b>teleph</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Information Village Research Project is an {{experiment}} in electronic knowledge delivery. Ten villages in Tamil Nadu have been connected using a hybrid wired and wireless network of PCs, phones, VHF duplex radio devices and email through dial-up telephone lines. Local volunteers gather information and enter it into one of several databases (in the local language, Tamil), which can be accessed by villagers via the local intranet. One of the databases contains agricultural information for local farmers such as the prices of agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides) and produce such as rice and vegetables. The project has also compiled a ´Rural Yellow Pages´ where people can post advertisements. The Information Village Research Project is {{an experiment}} in electronic knowledge delivery.

40|$|We {{present a}} new flow control scheme, called virtual credit. This scheme may be {{considered}} either as a credit based flowcontrol algorithm without a queue per session at the ports, or {{as a way to}} modify the credit based scheme and to bring it closer to an end-to-end rate based scheme. Thus, the new scheme brings the credit based and rate based flow control schemes closer to each other, offering an attractive compromise between them. In particular, the new scheme enjoys the main advantages of the credit based flow control scheme, while not requiring a queue per session at the switches. Moreover, the new scheme incurs a buffer requirement at the switches to ensure very low cell loss rate, that is no more than the corresponding buffer requirements in rate based schemes.
