Selznick, who fired him in anger over script changes for A Star is Born (an adaptation of What Price Hollywood). In Sixty Years of Hollywood, John Baxter (author) [...] asserts the victim was the producer of The Devil is a Sissy and resulted in Brown's being replaced as director of the film. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> Brown's having punched a producer; {{the question is whether the}} punch was career-ending.|$|E
2500|$|From 1895, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> {{first-class}} status {{because of}} the official definition. The concept became global from 1947 when it was re-defined by the ICC, {{although there has been}} hardly any controversy about match status outside Great Britain before 1947. Status of limited overs matches, which began in 1963, is governed by the official List A categorisation and there are similarly no issues about major Twenty 20 matches. Although the experts are in general agreement about match status, there have been exceptions although these account for a tiny percentage {{of the total number of}} matches recorded. Apart from one tour of India and Ceylon by a privately organised team in the winter of 1930–31, all the [...] "disputed" [...] matches took place in England before 1895: see Variations in published cricket statistics for further information.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{statement}} about {{the outcome of the}} vote issued on 14 March, Crabb explained: [...] "What this actually means is that those individuals who are considered {{to be able to work}} in the future will now access the same level of benefit as those on Jobseekers Allowance, but will be given better tailored support to help them into employment. It doesn't affect those already claiming ESA. Of course we are protecting those that are 'too ill to work'. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that." [...] Three days later, Crabb claimed on his Facebook page that [...] "only those who are fit to work and actively seeking work are included in the work-related activity group". His post had to be amended: the work-related activity group contains ESA claimants deemed 'too ill to work' but capable of participating in work-related activities, such as job-coaching and pre-employment training, who are assessed as likely to work within two years, not immediately.|$|E

Over there, twenty thousand people in a million elect themselves gentlemen and ladies, and the nine hundred and eighty thousand accept that decree and swallow the affront which it puts upon them. Why, if they didn't accept it, it wouldn't be an election, it would be a dead letter and have no force at all. Over here the twenty thousand would-be exclusives come up to the polls and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen. But the thing doesn't stop there. The nine hundred and eighty thousand come and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen too, and that elects the whole nation. Since the whole million vote themselves ladies and gentlemen, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that election. It does make absolute equality, and there is no fiction about it; while over yonder the inequality, (by decree of the infinitely feeble, and consent of the infinitely strong,) is also absolute--as real and absolute as our equality." ...|$|E

I wrote his wife so afterward. He was worthy of all praise. I shall always remember Walker. He was a little rare, but very good. And then the next morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to--handsome, educated, refined, spoke several languages fluently--a perfect gentleman--he was a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy. For supper we had that Oregon patriarch, and he was a fraud, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it--old, scraggy, tough, nobody can picture the reality. I finally said, gentlemen, you can do as you like, but I will wait for another election. And Grimes of Illinois said, 'Gentlemen, I will wait also. When you elect a man that has something to recommend him, I shall be glad to join you again.' It soon became evident that there was general dissatisfaction with Davis of Oregon, and so, to preserve the good will that had prevailed so pleasantly since we had had Harris, an election was called, and the result of it was that Baker of Georgia was chosen. He was splendid! Well, well--after that we had Doolittle, and Hawkins, and McElroy (there was some complaint about McElroy, because he was uncommonly short and thin), and Penrod, and two Smiths, and Bailey (Bailey had a wooden leg, which was clear loss, but he was otherwise good), and an Indian boy, and an organ-grinder, and a gentleman by the name of Buckminster--a poor stick of a vagabond that wasn't any good for company and no account for breakfast. We were glad we got him elected before relief came." ...|$|E
60|$|How {{certain it}} is that {{a vast number of}} animals which have existed at one period on this earth have entirely perished, and left no trace {{whatever}} of their forms, may be proved to you by other considerations. There are large tracts of sandstone {{in various parts of the}} world, in which nobody has yet found anything but footsteps. Not a bone of any description, but an enormous number of traces of footsteps. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> them. There is a whole valley in Connecticut covered with these footsteps, and not a single fragment of the animals which made them has yet been found. Let me mention another case while upon that matter, which is even more surprising than those to which I have yet referred. There is a limestone formation near Oxford, at a place called Stonesfield, which has yielded the remains of certain very interesting mammalian animals, and up to this time, if I recollect rightly, there have been found seven specimens of its lower jaws, and not a bit of anything else, neither limb-bones nor skull, or any part whatever; not a fragment of the whole system! Of course, it would be preposterous to imagine that the beasts had nothing else but a lower jaw! The probability is, as Dr. Buckland showed, as the result of his observations on dead dogs in the river Thames, that the lower jaw, not being secured by very firm ligaments to the bones of the head, and being a weighty affair, would easily be knocked off, or might drop away from the body as it floated in water in a state of decomposition. The jaw would thus be deposited immediately, while the rest of the body would float and drift away altogether, ultimately reaching the sea, and perhaps becoming destroyed. The jaw becomes covered up and preserved in the river silt, and thus it comes that we have such a curious circumstance as that of the lower jaws in the Stonesfield slates. So that, you see, faulty as these layers of stone in the earth's crust are, defective as they necessarily are as a record, the account of contemporaneous vital phenomena presented by them is, by the necessity of the case, infinitely more defective and fragmentary.|$|E
6000|$|Here, before long, Becky {{received}} {{not only}} [...] "the best" [...] foreigners (as the phrase {{is in our}} noble and admirable society slang), {{but some of the}} best English people too. I don't mean the most virtuous, or indeed the least virtuous, or the cleverest, or the stupidest, or the richest, or the best born, but [...] "the best,"--in a word, people about whom there is no question--such as the great Lady Fitz-Willis, that Patron Saint of Almack's, the great Lady Slowbore, the great Lady Grizzel Macbeth (she was Lady G. Glowry, daughter of Lord Grey of Glowry), and the like. When the Countess of Fitz-Willis (her Ladyship is of the Kingstreet family, see Debrett and Burke) takes up a person, he or she is safe. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> them any more. Not that my Lady Fitz-Willis is any better than anybody else, being, on the contrary, a faded person, fifty-seven years of age, and neither handsome, nor wealthy, nor entertaining; but it is agreed on all sides that she is of the [...] "best people." [...] Those who go to her are of the best: and from an old grudge probably to Lady Steyne (for whose coronet her ladyship, then the youthful Georgina Frederica, daughter of the Prince of Wales's favourite, the Earl of Portansherry, had once tried), this great and famous leader of the fashion chose to acknowledge Mrs. Rawdon Crawley; made her a most marked curtsey at the assembly over which she presided; and not only encouraged her son, St. Kitts (his lordship got his place through Lord Steyne's interest), to frequent Mrs. Crawley's house, but asked her to her own mansion and spoke to her twice in the most public and condescending manner during dinner. The important fact was known all over London that night. People who had been crying fie about Mrs. Crawley were silent. Wenham, the wit and lawyer, Lord Steyne's right-hand man, went about everywhere praising her: some who had hesitated, came forward at once and welcomed her; little Tom Toady, who had warned Southdown about visiting such an abandoned woman, now besought to be introduced to her. In a word, she was admitted to be among the [...] "best" [...] people. Ah, my beloved readers and brethren, do not envy poor Becky prematurely--glory like this is said to be fugitive. It is currently reported that even in the very inmost circles, they are no happier than the poor wanderers outside the zone; and Becky, who penetrated into the very centre of fashion and saw the great George IV face to face, has owned since that there too was Vanity.|$|E
