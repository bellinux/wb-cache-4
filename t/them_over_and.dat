As the four search for their leading lady, veteran actress Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) becomes obsessed with winning <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> native Iowan waitress Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) becomes desperate to make her theatrical dreams a reality.|$|E
5|$|With {{the union}} {{threatening}} strike action, particularly at international matches, in April 1909 the Football Association insisted that all players agree {{to leave the}} union and pledge loyalty to the FA. Manchester United refused to issue the revised contracts to its players, and FA suspended the entire squad. The club then refused to pay the players in lieu of their suspension, and so the players instead took away ornaments from the club's office before Mangnall persuaded them to return the items. The players continued to train, and captain Charlie Roberts {{came up with the}} name of Outcasts F.C. The FA organised a meeting of 200 players, excluding the Outcasts, but a rambling speech from chairman Charles Clegg failed to win <b>them</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> an agreement was reached where the PU would be recognised by the FA.|$|E

The Mareth Line was a series of old French border defences against Italian forces from Libya. Rommel took <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> {{improved}} them greatly. It took a major effort for British forces to break through. However, by this time Rommel had left Africa, never to return.|$|E
25|$|Clapton {{received}} an acoustic Hoyer guitar, made in Germany, for his thirteenth birthday, but the inexpensive steel-stringed instrument {{was difficult to}} play and he briefly lost interest. Two years later Clapton picked it up again and started playing consistently. Clapton {{was influenced by the}} blues from an early age, and practised long hours to learn the chords of blues music by playing along to the records. He preserved his practice sessions using his portable Grundig reel-to-reel tape recorder, listening to <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over until he felt he'd got it right.|$|E
25|$|After Miers {{failed in}} these private meetings, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback began {{drafting}} a letter asking the President's office {{to turn over}} legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew the memos were protected by executive privilege, that the White House was not required to turn <b>them</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> that Miers could refuse to deliver the memos and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request {{as part of a}} face-saving exit strategy for stepping down. In her letter withdrawing her nomination, she pointed to the senators' request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch's independence.|$|E

25|$|In 1638 the Dutch {{signed a}} treaty with King Rajasinha II of Kandy which assured the king {{assistance}} in his {{war against the}} Portuguese {{in exchange for a}} monopoly of the island's major trade goods. The Portuguese resisted the Dutch and the Kandyans but were gradually defeated in their strongholds beginning in 1639. The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 after an epic siege, {{at the end of which}} a mere 93 Portuguese survivors were given safe conduct out of the fort. Although the Dutch (e.g., Rijcklof van Goens) initially restored the captured area back to the Sinhalese kings, they later refused to turn <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> gained control over the island's richest cinnamon lands including Colombo which then served as the capital of the Dutch maritime provinces under the control of the Dutch East India Company until 1796.|$|E
25|$|SANZAR's {{proposals}} were under serious threat from a Sydney-based {{group called the}} World Rugby Corporation (WRC). WRC was formed by lawyer Geoff Levy and former Wallaby player Ross Turnbull. Both wanted a professional worldwide rugby competition funded by Kerry Packer, who had already developed professional cricket. At one point the WRC had {{a majority of the}} All Blacks and Wallaby teams signed up to their competition. In addition to this the Springboks had also signed the WRC contracts but had decided not to hand <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> instead signed up with the South African Rugby Union. The players had been told they would never play for their country again if they committed to the WRC. Most of the All Blacks then followed their Springbok counterparts by signing with their Union. The Australians, realising that without the New Zealanders and South Africans WRC's proposal could not succeed, relented and signed for the Australian Rugby Union.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} {{aircraft}} began assembly in July 1967, and were issued with the serial numbers XV884 and XV885. These were intended as development aircraft, to undertake airframe, avionics and weapons testing prior to them being refurbished as operational units. At the same time, {{the remainder of}} the planned 50 strong fleet were allocated serials from XV886-887 (TF-111K) and XV902-947 (F-111K). The first two airframes were {{in the final stages of}} assembly at General Dynamics' plant at Fort Worth, Texas in early 1968 when the Government then issued a new policy that would see the majority of British forces stationed East of Suez withdrawn by 1971. At the same time it also decided to cancel the F-111K procurement. The devaluation of sterling in 1967 had led to the per unit cost rising to approximately £3m. Additionally, the production schedules were slipping; while the RAAF had its first F-111 delivered in 1968, official acceptance of the type into service did not occur until 1973 due to structural and development problems (which led to the RAAF having to lease 24 F-4 Phantoms as an interim measure). All of the components that had been assembled for the production of the main F-111K fleet that shared commonality were diverted to the FB-111A program, while the two aircraft under construction were re-designated as YF-111As with the intention that they be used as test aircraft in the F-111A program. Ultimately however, the two F-111Ks were never operated as test aircraft – in July 1968, almost exactly a year after the first airframe began construction, the US Air Force decided not to take <b>them</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> General Dynamics were ordered to use them for component recovery.|$|E

500|$|The ZX81's {{popularity}} was publicly {{demonstrated in}} January 1982 when civil servant Mike Johnstone organised a [...] "ZX Microfair" [...] at Westminster Central Hall. Seventy exhibitors set up stalls {{with only a}} few hundred visitors expected in a hall with a capacity of 650 people. More than 12,000 people came and the police had to control the crowd. Thousands, many of whom had travelled long distances, queued outside for up to three hours to get into the hall; Clarke, who was only able to enter after identifying himself as a journalist, wrote that [...] "no one knows how many gave up in despair". The exhibitors sold thousands of pounds' worth of software and hardware [...] "as fast as three pairs of hands on each stall could hand <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> stuff the fivers into improvised overflowing cash boxes", he added. The fair also showed Sinclair Research's relatively unimportant role in the computer's success, with only small crowds at its booth compared to the [...] "rugby scrum" [...] elsewhere. By August 1983 seven more ZX Microfairs were held.|$|E
500|$|Metallica {{opted for}} {{extensive}} touring instead of releasing a single or video {{to promote the}} album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. The group used to play Black Sabbath riffs during sound checks, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname [...] "Alcoholica". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading [...] "Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. [...] "In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won <b>them</b> <b>over.</b> <b>And</b> fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica." [...] Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following.|$|E

2500|$|The evidence—all circumstantial—that Cristofori {{may have}} been hired as an {{inventor}} is as follows. According to Stewart Pollens, there were already a number of qualified individuals in Florence who could have filled the position; however, the Prince passed <b>them</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> paid Cristofori a higher salary than his predecessor. Moreover, Pollens notes, [...] "curiously, [...] there are no records of bills submitted for Cristofori's pianofortes ... This could mean that Cristofori was expected {{to turn over the}} fruits of his experimentation to the court." [...] Lastly, the Prince was evidently fascinated with machines (he collected over forty clocks, in addition to a great variety of elaborate musical instruments), and would thus be naturally interested in the elaborate mechanical action that was at the core of Cristofori's work on the piano.|$|E
