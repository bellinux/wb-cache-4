500|$|When {{asked by}} the {{broadcaster}} Melvyn Bragg in 1984 if the portraits painted {{in the wake of}} Dyer's death were depictions of his emotional reaction to the event, Bacon replied that he did not consider himself to be an [...] "expressionist painter". He explained that he was [...] "not trying to express anything, I wasn't trying to express the sorrow about somebody committing suicide... but perhaps it comes through without knowing it". When Bragg inquired if he often thought about death, the artist replied that he was always aware of it, and that although [...] "it's just around the corner for , I don't think about it, because there's nothing to <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> <b>When</b> it comes, it's there. You've had it." [...] Reflecting on the loss of Dyer, Bacon observed that as part of aging, [...] "life becomes more of a desert around you". He told Bragg that he believed in [...] "nothing. We are born and we die and that's it. There is nothing else." [...] Bragg asked Bacon what he did about that reality, and after the artist told him he did nothing about it, Bragg pleaded, [...] "No Francis, you try and paint it." ...|$|E

Also, when Burke was asked if she had a tape while being interviewed on [...] on 31 May 2011 by Caitriona Perry, Perry asserted that [...] "despite originally believing that she had a recording of the interview, Helen Lucy Burke is now not so sure". Burke explained, [...] "I don't think so, I thought I had a taped cassette, {{but it turns out that}} it was in the one, I wasn't able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box". When Caitriona Perry asked [...] "do you think you have a tape anywhere else", Burke replied [...] "it could be under the mountains of stuff that came down when my ceiling came in". In the last days of the campaign the tape was released and according to the Irish Independent, Ms. Burke [...] "said yesterday she found the tape recently but only released it in the last days of the campaign for “impact.” She said “it would give people something to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> they went to the polls.|$|E

60|$|For a {{few minutes}} they walked on in silence. Ethel knew her companion's {{character}} and admired it; and now she had met Murray, who in some respects resembled him, as did Olcott.

They were direct, simple in a sense which did not imply foolishness, free from petty assumption and incapable of suave diplomacy; but one could rely on them in time of stress.

For my part, I do not wonder at all that so many women have cast their eyes on Margaret Temple as a person they would like to have take their places when they are gone. For one thing, you know they would not be jealous of her; this is very important. Then, they would be as certain as anything can be certain in this world that their children, if they had any, as well as their husbands, would be in most excellent hands. Often, when I have been thinking about her, I have called Margaret Temple the Vice-consort; but I have never told any one this. Please remember.' ...|$|E

This is the second song in which Simple Plan uses fuck, after the demo version of [...] "I'm Just a Kid" [...] (changed to hell in the final studio version, though they still use fuck in live performances). The verses' chord progressions are similar to Green Day's [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" [...] and Oasis' [...] "Wonderwall".|$|R
60|$|His wife now offered {{so little}} {{resistance}} to his moods {{that she was}} practically useless to him. He made his daughter Eleanor into his chief confidante, and the prime of her life was being rapidly consumed by her father. To her he dictated the memoirs which were to avenge his memory, {{and she had to}} assure him constantly that his treatment had been a disgrace. Already, at the age of thirty-five, her cheeks were whitening as her mother's had whitened, but for her there would be no memories of Indian suns and Indian rivers, and clamor of children in a nursery; she would have very little of substance to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> she sat, as Lady Otway now sat, knitting white wool, with her eyes fixed almost perpetually upon the same embroidered bird upon the same fire-screen. But then Lady Otway {{was one of the people}} for whom the great make-believe game of English social life has been invented; she spent most of her time in pretending to herself and her neighbors that she was a dignified, important, much-occupied person, of considerable social standing and sufficient wealth. In view of the actual state of things this game needed a great deal of skill; and, perhaps, at the age she had reached--she was over sixty--she played far more to deceive herself than to deceive any one else. Moreover, the armor was wearing thin; she forgot to keep up appearances more and more.|$|E
