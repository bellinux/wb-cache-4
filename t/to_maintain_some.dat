5|$|General Marshall was Truman's {{principal}} adviser {{on foreign policy}} matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice against offering direct military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist Chinese forces in the Chinese Civil War against their communist opponents. Marshall's opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman's other advisers—Marshall thought propping up Chiang's forces would drain U.S. resources that were needed in Europe to deter the Soviets. When the communists {{took control of the}} mainland, establishing the People's Republic of China and driving the Nationalists to Taiwan, Truman would have been willing <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> relationship between the U.S. and the new government but Mao was unwilling. On June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|In early June 1940 {{following}} the lightning {{advance of the}} Germans through France and the subsequent Dunkirk evacuation, the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, realised the need for Britain <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> form of offensive action and directed his chief staff officer and military adviser, General Hastings Ismay, to begin organising a force which could conduct raids {{along the coast of}} German-occupied Europe. Shortly after this, even before the concept had been fully developed, the War Office put out a request for volunteers among the troops in Britain to join a force they would be known as the Commandos. At this stage it was decided to create 12 commando units, each with an establishment of roughly 500 men.|$|E

25|$|No one {{can confirm}} when {{the concept of}} Taiwanization has started. Some people will say when {{the first wave of}} large Han People {{immigration}} decided to leave from mainland China to Taiwan in the mid-16th-century, then they must have had some concept <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> independence from the control of ruling class in their original hometown. And some other people will say not until the Kingdom of Tungning, with its capital at Tainan, had been built by Zheng Family in 1662, this kind of concept hasn't appeared.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, {{it may be}} {{desirable}} <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> degree of compatibility with simple AM receivers, while still reducing the signal's bandwidth. This {{can be accomplished by}} transmitting single-sideband with a normal or slightly reduced carrier. This mode is called compatible (or full-carrier) SSB or amplitude modulation equivalent (AME). In typical AME systems, harmonic distortion can reach 25%, and intermodulation distortion can be much higher than normal, but minimizing distortion in receivers with envelope detectors is generally considered less important than allowing them to produce intelligible audio.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, {{seven years}} after the {{official}} opening of Victoria's first railway, the Locomotive Engine Drivers' Association was formed in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> standards of employment for these skilled workers. Comprising roughly twenty members, the Association grew to include firemen in 1872, prompting a change of name to the Locomotive Engine Drivers & Firemens' Association. In October 1899 representatives of the Railway Locomotive Enginemen's Associations of New South Wales, South Australia Queensland and Victoria met in Melbourne and voted in favour of forming the Federated Railway Locomotive Enginemens' Association of Australia.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} few years in power Cosgrave's new {{government}} faced a number of problems. The government attempted {{to reduce the size of}} the National Army. During the civil war it had grown to over 55,000 men which, now that the civil war was over, was far too large and costly <b>to</b> <b>maintain.</b> <b>Some</b> army officers challenged the authority of the government to cut the size of the Army. The officers, mostly Pro-Treaty IRA men, were angry that the government was not doing enough to help to create a republic and also there would be massive unemployment.|$|E
25|$|With {{the conquest}} of the American mainland, Hispaniola quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of Mexico and Peru, while new {{immigrants}} from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free blacks, and slaves alike lived in poverty, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding intermixing, resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, African, and Taíno descent. Except {{for the city of}} Santo Domingo, which managed <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became the sole source of livelihood for the island dwellers. In 1586, Sir Francis Drake captured the city of Santo Domingo, collecting a ransom for its return to Spanish rule.|$|E
25|$|One {{would expect}} that all {{simplified}} characters would simultaneously also be z-variants or semantic variants with their traditional counterparts, but many are neither. It is easier to explain the strange case that semantic variants can be simultaneously both semantic variants and specialized variants when Unicode's definition is that specialized semantic variants have the same meaning only in certain contexts. Languages use them differently. A pair whose characters are 100% drop-in replacements for each other in Japanese {{may not be so}} flexible in Chinese. Thus, any comprehensive merger of recommended codepoints would have <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> variants that differ only slightly in appearance even if the meaning is 100% the same for all contexts in one language, because in another language the two characters may not be 100% drop-in replacements.|$|E

Miliband was nicknamed [...] "Red Ed" [...] by some (predominantly right wing) media. After assuming office as Leader of the Opposition, Miliband softened some of the more left-wing ideas he had adopted during the leadership election, but remained committed to causes such as a living wage and the 50% tax rate. However, the Labour Party under Miliband focused on calls for [...] "responsible capitalism" [...] rather than socialism. Labour's shadow chancellor also committed <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>some</b> spending cuts scheduled for 2015 and 2016 by the Conservative-led coalition, and was accused of planning to cut the state pension. These were unpopular moves among traditional socialists.|$|R
25|$|In mid-1954, at {{the time}} the Geneva Conference had concluded, Tuyến had been working for the anti-communist Vietnamese National Army of the State of Vietnam in an {{outlying}} province, only travelling to Hanoi during the weekends. As a result of the discussions in Geneva, Vietnam was to be temporarily partitioned pending national reunification elections in 1956. In the meantime, the Vietminh controlled the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, and the State of Vietnam was handed the south. The agreements also allowed for the free passage of civilians between either side for 300 days, while military personnel were obliged to move to their respective zones. Tuyến had persuaded a substantial number of northern Catholics to leave their homes and move south. As a result, he later tried to persuade Diệm <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> contact with members of the communist regime in Hanoi in the hope of persuading them to defect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: The {{issue of}} which law {{to apply to}} resolve a tort case {{comprising}} elements {{from more than one}} jurisdiction is not an easy one to decide. Many different approaches have been tried and discarded by the courts. Some approaches provide for a general rule but include a flexible exception. Others provide for a completely flexible test. This article traces the Australian courts’ latest attempts to deal with the matter, and documents recent developments in both England and Canada. Reference is made to the vast North American jurisprudence in this area, in particular interest analysis, to suggest the way forward for Australian courts in this area, with a view <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>some</b> flexibility in approach, while retaining the law of the place of the wrong as the primary test...|$|R

The next day, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio, reportedly tapping Bakshi's phone because he was wary of his loyalty as an employee. After Krantz fired Bakshi, he began to seek a replacement director for Heavy Traffic, calling several directors, including Chuck Jones. Arkoff threatened to pull the film's budget unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, who returned a week later. During the film's production, Krantz attempted <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> level of control by issuing memos to Bakshi and other artists requesting various changes. John Sparey remembers being issued a memo asking Sparey to stop posting caricatures of Krantz on the middle of his door.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, the {{operations}} of Schurz Communications-owned NBC affiliate WAGT in Augusta, Georgia were taken over by Media General-owned ABC affiliate WJBF-TV. Both stations were consolidated into new, high-definition capable facilities constructed {{on the site of}} a former Barnes & Noble store, with separate studios for each station, and a third, shared studio. Despite the consolidation, the two stations aimed <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> autonomy from each other: both WAGT and WJBF maintained their own on-air identities, newsrooms, and sales departments within the facility. While the newscasts on both stations did share some [...] "factual" [...] video content, they were otherwise produced independently of each other. However, upon the consolidation, most of WAGT's managerial staff were dismissed and other employees were reassigned to different positions. The agreement was unwound after Gray's purchase of the station, but briefly reinstated following legal action by Media General. After the injunction was struck down, Gray re-assumed control of WAGT on March 28, 2016, adding 5:30p.m. and 7:00p.m. newscasts exclusive to the station, with the remainder simulcast from WRDW.|$|E
500|$|After the race, it was {{announced}} that the FIA was investigating irregularities with an electronic box in Hakkinen's car. This was due to Formula One's governing body discovering that one mandatory seal was missing. Further samples from the electronic box were taken after the race; this was software downloaded which did not discover any issues with the coding. A spokesman for the McLaren team said that: [...] "No one changed the software, so there's no reason for us to be worried." [...] At the hearing on 25 July, the FIA ruled that McLaren did not gain an advantage from the missing seal and that Häkkinen's victory would stand. However, McLaren were deducted 10 points from the Constructors' Championship and fined $50,000 for contravening Article 7 of the 2000 Formula One Sporting Regulations, which stated that competitors had <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> conditions of safety and eligibility during the event. McLaren International managing director Martin Whitmarsh announced that the team would not appeal the penalty. The Vice-President of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport Norbert Haug later criticised the decision and believed that the seal was never put on Häkkinen's car. Haug also said he would not take any further action regarding the matter.|$|E
