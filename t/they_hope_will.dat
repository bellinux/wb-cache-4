25|$|During the 2016 Blizzcon, Blizzard {{announced}} {{their plans for}} their Overwatch League, using an organization of permanent teams in league placements similar to more traditional physical sports, rather than the use of relegation and promotion used in a series like League of Legends Championship Series. Blizzard will help to organize potential team owners and aim to include more geographically-local teams to participate, which <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>will</b> help spark more interest in eSports from spectators and potential sponsors through new activities around supporting a local team. Blizzard anticipates the Overwatch League will have a seven-figure payoff for the winning team {{at the end of}} a season, but plans on paying a salary to all players within the league. The first, shortened season of the League is expected to start in Q3 2017, but will begin in full seasons starting in 2018, with the League having half-year long seasonal breaks starting in Q4 of that year. A meeting for prospective team owners was held at Blizzcon after the announcement, with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke among the attendees.|$|E
500|$|The studio bosses have {{booked a}} hotel room for Bergman, {{complete}} with a [...] "Hollywood Welcoming Committee" [...] – a hooker <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>will</b> persuade him to accept their offer – and a limo shuttles Bergman from meeting to meeting. Visiting [...] "The Studio Commissary", he is brought {{face to face with}} the many European directors who went to make films in Hollywood: Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, F. W. Murnau, Jacques Tourneur, Josef von Sternberg, and Alfred Hitchcock, all apparently happy to work in Hollywood: [...] "Alfred Hitchcock, bless his soul, there chomping on a dinner roll, The Man Who Knew Too Much done twice, in Hollywood, done twice as nice". Bergman is tempted by the prospect of secure funding for his film projects and feels he [...] "must not be hasty" [...] in rejecting the proposal.|$|E
500|$|In {{a note on}} the group's website announcing Songs of Innocence, Bono {{mentioned}} a forthcoming follow-up album, Songs of Experience, that [...] "should be ready soon enough". U2's manager Guy Oseary also indicated that the group had future collaborations with Apple planned dealing with [...] "how music is heard and innovation". He said the band wants to support albums as an [...] "art form of artwork and lyrics and video content" [...] that will engage listeners more so than digital audio. In a 29 September 2014 cover story for Time, U2 revealed they are working with Apple to develop a new digital music format <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>will</b> sway consumers' interest in purchasing music again. Bono described it as [...] "an audiovisual interactive format for music that can't be pirated and will bring back album artwork in the most powerful way, where you can play with the lyrics and get behind the songs". He said the format was 18 months from completion and that the group hopes it will financially benefit lesser-known music artists.|$|E

2500|$|Modern fiscal conservatives remain wary of {{government}} spending. They believe strongly in {{free trade and}} are committed to lowering the federal budget, paying off national debt, and acquiring a balanced budget. Where fiscal conservatism gets more diverse in ideals is what steps {{should be taken to}} balance the budget. Deficit hawks are more willing to increase taxes in addition to cutting spending to balance the budget than libertarians, who want to [...] "starve the beast" [...] by cutting taxes for the purpose of decreasing tax revenue which <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>will</b> cause the government to spend less, and supply-siders who believe that government revenue will increase by lowering taxes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the game's release, some users reported on community forums that levels they had created {{had been taken}} down for [...] "moderation", and were no longer available to play. A representative from Sony stated that once a level is flagged by players using the in-game Good Grief system, levels were reviewed by a moderator and only removed if deemed inappropriate. On 11 November 2008, SCE confirmed that around 200 levels —less than 0.5 percent of levels published — had been removed, the majority of which contained obscenity, while the rest were removed due to copyright violations. Media Molecule acknowledged there were issues with the moderation system and released an update in December to help rectify them. In addition to an on-screen message, users are notified with a PSN message when a level they have published is removed, along with information on the reason for its removal. They are able to play and edit the level themselves whether on or offline. The developers have clarified the rules regarding {{what is and is}} not appropriate and have made several changes [...] "behind the scenes" [...] which <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>will</b> [...] "alleviate most of the issues that creators have experienced." ...|$|E

60|$|After having thus {{submitted}} to the House the general tenor of the proceedings in this trial, your Committee will, with all convenient speed, lay before the House the proceedings on each head of evidence separately which has been rejected; and this <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>will</b> put the House more perfectly in possession of the principal causes {{of the length of}} this trial, {{as well as of the}} injury which Parliamentary justice may, in their opinion, suffer from those proceedings.|$|E
60|$|A {{group of}} people from a British ship have gone ashore to stretch their legs, when enemies approach, the ship's boat retreats to the ship and they are left {{stranded}} ashore. The book deals with their efforts to find what <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>will</b> be civilisation {{in the capital of}} the Island of Madagascar, which is something like the size of France. Unfortunately the reigning Queen has a hatred of Christianity which had been brought to the Island by missionaries some forty years before. Our heroes find themselves assisted by a Christian net-work, but when they get to the capital they are appalled by the carnage and torture they find when the Queen has one of her rages against Christianity.|$|E
