40|$|Abstract—This paper {{demonstrates}} the optimization of a radar waveform based on ambiguity function measurements and spectral mask criteria. Compliance with spectral mask criteria is becoming ever-critical in radar systems {{due to the}} increased number of devices using the wireless spectrum. The capability of reducing ambiguity at certain range-Doppler combinations is useful in enhancing the detection capability of radar systems. This paper shows the combined optimization for both ambiguity function and spectral mask criteria based on time-domain measurements taken with a high-speed oscilloscope. A benefit of optimizing based on measurements is that the <b>transmitter</b> power <b>amplifier’s</b> <b>output</b> waveform can be used, allowing the results of nonlinear distortion to be factored into the optimization process.

40|$|Abstract—The {{ambiguity}} {{function is}} a measure of a radar’s range and Doppler detection capability. Cognitive radar systems require the capability to adjust the waveform in real-time to obtain desired range/Doppler detection capability while meeting stringent spectral requirements. While the ambiguity function of the waveform input to the transmitter can be simulated, it is the ambiguity function of the <b>transmitter</b> power <b>amplifier’s</b> <b>output</b> waveform that will be used for the detection. As such, it is very helpful to be able to measure the ambiguity function output from a power amplifier in the optimization process. This paper describes a technique {{that can be used to}} quickly calculate the ambiguity function for the output waveform from the radar amplifier as measured on an oscilloscope. Brief examination is also given to the effect of amplifier nonlinearity on the ambiguity function. I...|$|R
25|$|The {{linearity}} {{requirement is}} demanding, especially for <b>transmitter</b> RF <b>output</b> circuitry where <b>amplifiers</b> are often {{designed to be}} non-linear in order to minimise power consumption. In practical OFDM systems {{a small amount of}} peak clipping is allowed to limit the PAPR in a judicious trade-off against the above consequences. However, the <b>transmitter</b> <b>output</b> filter which is required to reduce out-of-band spurs to legal levels has the effect of restoring peak levels that were clipped, so clipping is not an effective way to reduce PAPR.|$|R

40|$|This bachelor's thesis aims at {{designing}} the circuit diagram of {{input and output}} circuits of analog to digital and, simultaneously, digital to analog convertors intended to process audio signals and their realization. The introductory theoretical part deals with the qualitative requirements concerning the way low-frequency audio amplifiers process audio signal. The following part focuses on the active component base selection {{with respect to the}} achievement of the required quality and parameters as defined in the task description. The next part comprises the design of the input and <b>output</b> <b>amplifier</b> circuit diagram itself and then the realization of their functional samples. The input amplifier provides some of the functions which are common with high quality sound production; such as attenuator activation, input signal phase inversion, and MUTE function. This amplifier consists of three logically sequenced parts. A preamplifier with approximately 60 dB amplification and with high separation between a useful signal and noise stands for the first part; a high-pass filter that suppresses interfering signals stands for the second part; and an <b>output</b> <b>amplifier</b> ensuring the balanced output for the analog to digital convertor stands for the last part. The <b>output</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which is connected to the digital to analog convertor, is also embraced of three logically sequenced parts.

40|$|Digital imagers {{including}} Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD) {{are essential}} to most forms of modern photographic technologies. The quality of the data produced by digital imagers have made them an invaluable scientific measurement tool. Despite the numerous advantages of digital imagers, there are still factors that limit their performance. One such factor is {{the stability of the}} camera 2 ̆ 7 s gain, the ratio that dictates the imager 2 ̆ 7 s ability to convert incident photons to a measurable output voltage. Variations in gain can affect the linearity of the device and produce inaccurate measurements. One of the factors that determines the gain of the camera is the sensitivity of the <b>output</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the performance of two different <b>output</b> <b>amplifier</b> structures: the traditional source follower (SF) and the charge feedback amplifier (CFA). In studies of other solid state detectors, the CFA has shown a greater stability against variations in certain system parameters and environmental conditions such as operating temperature. It is thought that the CFA shows a superior stability over the SF, because the gain of the SF is dependent on multiple capacitances associated with the reset and output transistors, whereas the CFA gain is only dependent on its feedback capacitance. Furthermore, the CFA is able to handle a larger amount of charge than the SF, which increases the dynamic range of the <b>output</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In this research, <b>output</b> <b>amplifier</b> stability is measured using gain and linearity data collected from a CCD manufactured with both types of amplifiers. Preliminary data is presented that indicates the CFA exhibits a greater linearity, larger dynamic range, and a more stable gain than the SF. Despite this the CFA suffers from a significantly larger level of noise. Suggestions for future research are also given as to how to verify and expand upon the results presented here...|$|R
