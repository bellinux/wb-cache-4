Due {{to their}} high inter-temporal {{variation}} and intermittence, large-scale {{integration of the}} new energies, such as wind power and photovoltaic power, will pose great challenges to the safe and stable operation of power system.

40|$|Abstract—Coordinated {{multi-point}} (CoMP) transmission for LTE-Advanced is {{to improve}} system performance, especially to enhance cell coverage and cell-edge data rate. With efficient resource allocation schemes, CoMP transmission could be a promising technology to increase system throughput. Existing frequency plan schemes on downlink CoMP <b>transmission</b> <b>limit</b> {{the performance of the}} system since they do not take the changes in traffic load as well as link quality into consideration. In this paper, an optimized scheme is proposed that each base station could allocate different proportion of bandwidth to different users’ equipments (UEs) according to their traffic load and link quality, to make the system more flexible and efficient. The scheme is more effective in both system throughput and cell-edge throughput as verified through system level simulation.

30|$|The {{rescheduling}} {{of generation}} and curtailment of transactions as {{an approach to}} the solution to CM has received great attention, as different studies have reported various methods in the rescheduling of generation and curtailment of transactions [5, 9]. Congestion pricing is a generation rescheduling method in CM, in which the cost information of the generating companies is either revealed by the generating companies, or it is inferred from the market behavior after which an optimal power flow (OPF) solution procedure (without the consideration of <b>transmission</b> <b>limit)</b> is applied to determine the initial state of the system. If a transmission line congestion is discovered, an OPF analysis (with the consideration of <b>transmission</b> <b>limit)</b> is performed to relieve the system of congestion, and simultaneously determine a congestion price that will be paid by the power producer [10]. Generator sensitivity to the real power flow in a congested line has also been used to reschedule generation to alleviate transmission congestion by proposing a technique for {{reducing the number of}} participating generators in a pool at the minimum congestion or rescheduling cost [11, 12, 13]. In a work that considered a power market where pool and bilateral/multilateral transactions coexist, transaction curtailment strategies were prioritized into the free mode, the pool protection mode, and the contract protection mode [14]. In the free mode, all market participants are expected to compete for usage of congested lines by paying to avoid curtailment. In the pool protection mode, curtailment is performed on bilateral and multilateral transactions first. In the contract protection mode, contract dispatch is prioritized over pool dispatch, i.e., in the case of congestion, the pool demand will have to be curtailed first. In the majority of works where the rescheduling of generation or curtailment of transaction was used as a tool for CM, the primary objective is to minimize the cost of congestion [15]. This minimization was performed using a CM-based OPF.|$|E
30|$|Xiao and Li [13] {{proposed}} a distributed asynchronous cooperation (DAC) protocol. In DAC, the QAP announces the transmission budget via beacons, {{which is the}} additional amount of time available for each AC during the next beacon interval. Each station determines an internal <b>transmission</b> <b>limit</b> per AC for each beacon interval based on the successfully used transmission time during the previous beacon period and the transmission budget announced from the QAP. When the transmission budget for an AC is depleted, a new flow {{will not be able}} to obtain any transmission time, and existing flows {{will not be able to}} increase their transmission time too. The main weakness of the DAC model is that it can only protect existing flows when the traffic load is not heavy. In addition, this scheme does not provide a direct relationship between transmission opportunity (TXOP) parameters and QoS requirements related to user applications [13, 14].|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} support {{multimedia}} applications such as voice and video over the wireless medium, a contention-based channel access function, called Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA), has been developed in the emerg-ing standard IEEE 802. 11 e. In the EDCA, differentiated channel access is provided for different traffic classes. In this paper, we propose a two-level protection and guarantee mechanism for voice and video traffic in the EDCA-based distributed wireless LANs. In the first-level protection, the existing voice and video flows are protected from the new and other existing voice and video flows via a distributed ad-mission control with tried-and-known and early-protection enhancements. In the second-level protection, the voice and video flows are protected from the best-effort data traffic by adopting frame-based and limit-based data control mecha-nisms. Performance evaluations are conducted in terms of throughput, delay, <b>transmission</b> <b>limit,</b> number of collisions, and throughput square relative difference.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the c-axis infrared conductivity σ_c(ω) in underdoped cuprate superconductors for spinfluctuation exchange scattering within the CuO_ 2 -planes including a phenomenological d-wave pseudogap of amplitude E_g. For temperatures decreasing below a temperature T^* ∼ E_g/ 2, a gap for ω < 2 E_g develops in σ_c(ω) in the incoherent (diffuse) <b>transmission</b> <b>limit.</b> The resistivity shows 'semiconducting' behavior, i. e. it increases for low temperatures above the constant behavior for E_g= 0. We {{find that the}} pseudogap structure in the in-plane optical conductivity is about twice as big as in the interplane conductivity σ_c(ω), in qualitative agreement with experiment. This {{is a consequence of}} the fact that the spinfluctuation exchange interaction is suppressed at low frequencies as a result of the opening of the pseudogap. While the c-axis conductivity in the underdoped regime is described best by incoherent transmission, in the overdoped regime coherent conductance gives a better description.

40|$|The {{transmission}} of ions at low m/z {{can often be}} either necessary for an application or problematic (e. g., when large numbers of low m/z ions consume a large fraction of an ion trap’s capacity). The low m/z ion <b>transmission</b> <b>limit</b> of an electrodynamic ion funnel has been characterized using both experimental and theoretical approaches. A theoretical model is developed based {{on a series of}} infinite wire conductors that represent the ring electrodes of the ion funnel. Mathematical relationships for both low and high m/z cutoffs of the idealized two-dimensional system are derived. The low m/z cutoff is also evaluated through a series of experiments that show it is influenced by both the RF frequency and the DC electric field gradient. However, unlike multipole ion guides, there is no marked dependence of the low m/z cutoff on the RF amplitude, in agreement with theoretical results. With this new understanding, ion funnels can be designed and configured to better match the m/z range requirements for various applications...|$|E
40|$|Lutetium {{aluminum}} garnet (LuAG) is {{the most}} promising candidate for a high-index lens material for use in microlithographic imaging lenses. In the deep ultraviolet spectral range the transmission of high-purity LuAG was measured using monochromatized synchrotron radiation. In {{the vicinity of the}} band gap below 7. 8 eV, a scaling behavior of the absorption as a function of photon energy was observed. Temperature-dependent measurements allowed us to distinguish different absorption mechanisms which differ by their ability to couple to phonon excitations. Interpreting the Urbach tails measured at different temperatures, it was shown that the temperature independent tail is due to defects in the lattice, whereas the temperature-dependent part originates from the short term localization of exciton modes coupling to lattice distortions. These results allowed us to extrapolate the maximum transmittance which can be obtained with LuAG crystals at the lithographic wavelength of 193. 39 nm. Accurate determination of the maximum <b>transmission</b> <b>limit</b> is critical in deciding whether the material can meet industry’s specification for 193 -nm-based high-index lithography...|$|E
