5|$|Many {{scholars}} have gleaned from this passage that the Wicked Priest and the Teacher of Righteousness followed different liturgical calendars, thus enabling the Wicked Priest {{to travel on}} Yom Kippur; some have even suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Teacher</b> of Righteousness was a schismatic High Priest during the pre-Jonathan intersacerdotium.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{included}} the Monitorial System from Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster in his teacher training courses. This system suggested that more advanced students monitored the less advanced students {{and that the}} layout of a classroom should allow one teacher to oversee {{a large number of}} students. Maeser believed that this system was flawed, however, because it focused on developing efficiency and disregarded individuality. Maeser argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> have more personal interactions with students. He implemented his monitorial organization so that each student would be responsible for something or someone else. Students were forced to look outside themselves, creating responsibility and organization.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the shared and individual supporting structures that teachers employ to develop pupils’ reading ability in grade 2. The study used semi-structured interviews with <b>teachers</b> in <b>the</b> lower level of school. <b>The</b> result shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> shared <b>the</b> perception <b>that</b> learning to read is crucial for pupils’ continued development in school. <b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> try to make the pupils aware of why they should learn to read, and in <b>that</b> process <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> use different supporting structures at individual or group level. The study also shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> come close to the socio-cultural perspective with its emphasis on dialogue and learning together...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} teachers’ experiences of working with Writing to Read (WTR), and their perceptions of how pupils develop in reading and writing when they write on computers or similar devices. Another aim is to study teachers’ motives for using the WTR method. The material used for analysis is four interviews with teachers who use WTR. The result of <b>the</b> analysis shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> find <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pupils have a greater love of writing and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> chose to work with the method because they want to change how pupils learn to read and write. Another finding is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> feel <b>that</b> pupils with motor difficulties benefit most from working with WTR. ...|$|R

In 1876 Doyle entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School, where he became a pupil of Joseph Bell, whose deductive processes impressed his pupil so much <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> became the chief model for Holmes. Doyle began writing while still a student, and in October 1879 he had his first work—"The Mystery of the Sasassa Valley"—published in Chambers's Journal. He continued writing short works—both fictional and non-fictional—throughout his career, and had over 200 stories and articles published.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{determine}} the teaching strategies, methods and techniques teachers use in Science and Technology classes and what they lack in this issue. 95 teachers, 45 of whom are science teachers and 50 of whom are primary school teachers, were subjected to a survey, and 33 teachers were interviewed orally. It was revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> don’t have sufficient knowledge about teaching strategies, methods and techniques and that they can’t distinguish between these concepts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} which teaching strategies, techniques and methods are used by teachers in science and technology classes and also to determine the shortcomings they have. A questionnaire was conducted to a total of 95 teachers, 45 of whom were science and technology teachers and 50 of whom were class teachers, and 33 teachers were interviewed. It was found out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> did not have enough information about teaching strategies, methods and techniques and thus were not able to make a precise distinction between them. It was determined <b>that</b> although <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> were aware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most convenient teaching technique is experiment technique, they used direct instruction or question and answer technique more and they sometimes used methods and techniques such as laboratory, trip-observation and drama.

[...] Ultimately, in 1895, Jake Hoover sent a cigar box containing those he had collected while mining gold to an assay office, which in turn sent them via regular, uninsured mail to Tiffany's in New York City for appraisal by Dr. George Frederick Kunz, the leading American gemologist of the time. Impressed by their quality and color, Kunz pronounced them [...] "the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States".

500|$|In November 1948, {{the family}} moved to Memphis, Tennessee. After {{residing}} for nearly a year in rooming houses, they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the Lauderdale Courts. Enrolled at L. C.

When his music teacher informed him {{that he did not have}} an aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, [...] "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me", in an effort to prove otherwise. A classmate later recalled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> [...] "agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing." [...] He was usually too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a [...] "mama's boy". In 1950, he regularly began practicing guitar under the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson, a neighbor two-and-a-half years his senior. They and three other boys—including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette—formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts.

For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies.
