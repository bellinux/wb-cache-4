5|$|Acute <b>toxicity</b> has {{not been}} seen in humans, and the <b>toxicity</b> depends {{strongly}} on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human <b>toxicity</b> data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E

However, the differences of metals and organics acute <b>toxicities</b> to V. fischeri have not been compared. Here, four heavy metals (Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Cd 2 +, Cr 6 +) and five organics (phenol, benzoic acid, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, nitro-benzene and benzene) acute <b>toxicities</b> to V. fischeri were investigated. Heavy metals <b>toxicities</b> to V. fischeri were increased along with the reaction time, while the organics <b>toxicities</b> kept the same level in different reaction times. In order to explain the difference, the relative cell death rate of V. fischeri was detected. In metals <b>toxicities</b> tests, the bioluminescence inhibition rate of V. fischeri {{was found to be}} significantly higher than the relative cell death rate (P< 0. 05), while for the organics <b>toxicities</b> tests, the cell death rate was similar to the bioluminescence inhibition rate. These results indicated that organics acute <b>toxicities</b> to V. fischeri could reflect the death of cell, but metals acute <b>toxicities</b> to V. fischeri may not lead to the death of cell, just represent the bioluminescence inhibition...|$|R

5|$|Poison dart frog (also {{known as}} dart-poison frog, poison frog or {{formerly}} known as poison arrow frog) is the common name {{of a group of}} frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the <b>toxicity</b> of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high <b>toxicity,</b> while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed <b>toxicity.</b> The species that have great <b>toxicity</b> derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites. Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of <b>toxicity,</b> eat a much larger variety of prey. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit.|$|E
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen <b>toxicity</b> are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen <b>toxicity</b> such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen <b>toxicity</b> as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E
40|$|Treatment with melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide {{improves}} {{the outcome of}} patients with multiple myeloma and is now considered a standard of care for patients not eligible for transplantation. However, this treatment is {{a major source of}} morbidity. A meta-analysis of data from individual patients (n= 1680) in six randomized trials was performed, comparing the effects of melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide versus melphalan-prednisone. The main objective was to estimate the risk of serious adverse events and their impact on outcome. The primary endpoints were the 2 -year cumulative incidence of grade 3 - 4 hematologic and non-hematologic <b>toxicities.</b> At least 75 % of the grade 3 - 4 <b>toxicities</b> occurred during the first 6 months of treatment in both treatment groups. The cumulative incidence of grade 3 - 4 hematologic <b>toxicities</b> was higher in the melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide group than in the melphalan-prednisone group (28 % versus 22 %; HR 1. 32, 95 % CI 1. 05 - 1. 66) as was the cumulative incidence of non-hematologic <b>toxicities</b> (39 % versus 17 %, HR 2. 78, 95 % CI 2. 21 - 3. 50). Grade 3 - 4 non-hematologic <b>toxicities</b> were significantly increased in patients with poor Performance Status. Occurrence of grade 3 - 4 non-hematologic <b>toxicities</b> had a negative impact on both progression-free survival (HR 1. 24, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 1. 45) and overall survival, (HR 1. 23, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 47). Besides <b>toxicities,</b> progression-free and overall survival were also negatively affected by advanced International Staging System stage, high creatinine levels and poor Performance Status. Age had a negative impact on survival as well. Although melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide improved outcome, it increased <b>toxicities,</b> especially non-hematologic ones. Serious non-hematologic <b>toxicities,</b> older age, poor Performance Status, and high creatinine levels negatively affected survival. (C) 2013 Ferrata Storti Foundation.

40|$|A major hurdle for {{harnessing}} small interfering RNA (siRNA) for therapeutic {{application is}} an effective and safe delivery of siRNA to target tissues and cells via systemic administration. While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) composed of a cationic lipid, poly-(ethylene glycol) lipid and cholesterol, are effective in delivering siRNA to hepatocytes via systemic administration, they may induce multi-faceted <b>toxicities</b> in a dose-dependent manner, independently of target silencing. To understand the underlying mechanism of <b>toxicities,</b> pharmacological probes including anti-inflammation drugs and specific inhibitors blocking different pathways of innate immunity were evaluated for their abilities to mitigate LNP-siRNA-induced <b>toxicities</b> in rodents. Three categories of rescue effects were observed: (i) pretreatment with a Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitor or dexamethasone abrogated LNP-siRNA-mediated lethality and <b>toxicities</b> including cytokine induction, organ impairments, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy without affecting siRNA-mediated gene silencing; (ii) inhibitors of PI 3 K, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p 38 and IÎºB kinase (IKK) 1 / 2 exhibited a partial alleviative effect; (iii) FK 506 and etoricoxib displayed no protection. Furthermore, knockout of Jak 3, tumor necrosis factor receptors (Tnfr) p 55 /p 75, interleukin 6 (IL- 6) or interferon (IFN) -Î³ alone was insufficient to alleviate LNP-siRNA-associated <b>toxicities</b> in mice. These indicate that activation of innate immune response is a primary trigger of systemic <b>toxicities</b> and that multiple innate immune pathways and cytokines can mediate toxic responses. Jak inhibitors are effective in mitigating LNP-siRNA-induced <b>toxicities...</b>|$|R

5|$|Skin <b>toxicity</b> evolved {{alongside}} bright coloration, perhaps preceding it. <b>Toxicity</b> {{may have}} relied on a shift in diet to alkaloid-rich arthropods, which likely occurred {{at least four times}} among the dendrobatids. Conspicuous coloration in these frogs is further associated with diet specialization, body mass, aerobic capacity, and chemical defense. Either aposematism and aerobic capacity preceded greater resource gathering, making it easier for frogs to go out and gather the ants and mites required for diet specialization, contrary to classical aposematic theory, which assumes that <b>toxicity</b> from diet arises before signaling. Alternatively, diet specialization preceded higher aerobic capacity, and aposematism evolved to allow dendrobatids to gather resources without predation.|$|E

30|$|Using an {{in silico}} assay and a {{molecular}} cloning strategy to isolate 12 HsCIPKs in Tibetan Plateau annual wild barley {{enabled us to}} the effects of heavy metal <b>toxicities</b> on the transcriptional expression patterns of 12 endogenous HsCIPK genes and evaluate their functional roles in the response to multiple heavy metal <b>toxicities</b> and other abiotic stresses in rice. Multiple HsCIPKs were found {{to be involved in the}} response of plants to heavy metal <b>toxicities,</b> including Hg, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Cu and other abiotic stresses, including salt, drought, Al, low and high temperature, and ABA. The ectopic overexpression of HsCIPK 2, 5, 9, 14, 17, 24, and 29 in Nipponbare rice (Oryza sativa) enhanced the tolerance of rice root growth to multiple heavy metal <b>toxicities,</b> whereas the overexpression of HsCIPK 2, 5, 17, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, and 31 promoted root growth tolerance to salt and/or drought stresses. These results suggest that plant-specific CIPKs function in heavy metal <b>toxicities</b> and these HsCIPKs examined will have a broad application in genetically engineered rice and other crops with tolerance to heavy metal <b>toxicities</b> and other abiotic stresses.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human <b>toxicity</b> related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate <b>toxicity</b> experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening <b>toxicity</b> with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious <b>toxicity</b> in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system <b>toxicity</b> is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular <b>toxicity</b> result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen <b>toxicity</b> is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen <b>toxicity</b> is possible.|$|E

5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of <b>toxicity.</b> In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing <b>toxicity.</b> <b>Toxicity</b> can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to <b>toxicity,</b> while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause <b>toxicity.</b> Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of <b>toxicity</b> in children.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol <b>toxicity.</b> Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential <b>toxicity</b> of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
