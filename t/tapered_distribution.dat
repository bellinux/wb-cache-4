The SIW has been suitably converted to an equivalent rectangular waveguide. Elliott's modified design procedure including the internal higher order mode coupling, suitable for the usual range of thickness of the substrate, has been followed to obtain the optimum dimensions and positions of slots. The data for 'self-admittance' of an isolated slot as a function of its length and displacement, a requisite in Elliot's design procedure, has been generated by a commercially available full-wave finite element package Ansoft HFSS using an equivalent circuit for the slot with a subsequent extraction of Stegen-type curves.

30|$|Steam {{breakthrough}} {{has a great}} {{negative influence}} {{on the development of}} steam flooding in heavy oil reservoirs. In this article, a new profile control design based on quantitative identification of steam breakthrough channel is introduced. Firstly, dual-sandpack experiments are conducted to study the characteristics and influencing factors of steam breakthrough. Then based on the experimental results as well as pretreatment and combination of geological parameters and production data, comprehensive identification parameter (CIP) is achieved through the analytic hierarchy process to quantitatively describe the degree of steam breakthrough. Afterward, the breakthrough types of production wells are determined by CIP and the volume of breakthrough channels and profile control parameters among the injector and the producers are calculated according to the <b>tapering</b> <b>distribution</b> of steam breakthrough in the process of steam flooding in heavy oil reservoirs. The experiment results show that there exists a large difference between breakthrough channels and non-breakthrough areas in temperature and oil recovery. Permeability contrast is an important factor, which influences the direction of steam breakthrough, and temperature has a great correlation with oil recovery under the heterogeneous condition. The determination of CIP is an attempt to quantify the degree of breakthrough and it combines many factors, which show the difference between the injector and the producer, as well as the difference between producers. All producers of the steam flooding well group can be divided into complete breakthrough wells with CIP over 0.5 and incomplete breakthrough wells with CIP below 0.5 for calculating conveniently. Based on the <b>tapering</b> <b>distribution</b> of the steam breakthrough channel, blocking parameters considering oil drainage radius around the injector, temperature distribution between the injector and the producer and the demand of blocking effect and field reality are obtained to calculate the blocking volume for complete breakthrough wells and incomplete breakthrough wells. This method {{could be used as a}} tool to judge breakthrough degree and design profile control parameters for oilfields with heavy oil reservoirs.|$|R

In particular, the developed antenna placement method does not require any iterative or stochastic optimization procedure, resulting in a dramatic reduction of the antenna design times (typically {{on the order of}} a few seconds).

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} undersampling on {{estimating}} {{the size of}} extreme natural hazards from historical data is examined. Tests using synthetic catalogs indicate that the tail of an empirical size distribution sampled from a pure Pareto probability distribution can range from having one-to-several unusually large events to appearing depleted, relative to the parent distribution. Both of these effects are artifacts caused by limited catalog length. It {{is more difficult to}} diagnose the artificially depleted empirical distributions, since one expects that a pure Pareto distribution is physically limited in some way. Using maximum-like-lihood methods and the method of moments, we estimate the power-law exponent and the corner size parameter of <b>tapered</b> Pareto <b>distributions</b> for several natural hazard examples: tsunamis, floods, and earthquakes. Each of these examples has varying catalog lengths and measurement thresholds, relative to the largest event sizes. In many cases where there are only several orders of magnitude between the measurement threshold and the largest events, joint two-parameter estimation techniques are necessary to account for estimation dependence between the power-law scaling exponent and the corner size parameter.

30|$|For heavy oil, its {{sensitivity}} of temperature {{leads to a}} great fluidity difference under different temperature. In the stage of steam huff and puff, if the interruption of the working system is out of consideration, the sweep area of steam for a producer {{at the end of}} steam stimulation is similar to a circle. In this area, the temperature of layers increases obviously and the fluidity of oil is better. So the oil produced almost comes from this area. During the following steam flooding process, the injected steam will invade along with the main streamline between the injector and the producer. And only the oil which is heated by steam can flow effectively. Once steam breakthrough happens, the flow resistance in the steam breakthrough channel decreases very fast. Steam and condensate liquid previously flowing to a variety of directions will rapidly move close to the main streamline and aggregate into the production well. In this case, steam sweep efficiency decreases and the fluidity of heavy oil outside the steam breakthrough channel drops drastically. And most of the produced liquid consists of steam and condensate water. Depending on this theory, the steam breakthrough channel can be divided into two areas: near-wellbore part and interwell part. And with the further development of steam channeling, a <b>taper</b> <b>distribution</b> area of steam and condensed water channel which is different from the lobate area in the water flooding process is gradually formed, as shown in Fig.  5.|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} of the work here presented involves three main topics: Wireless Power Transmission (WPT) technology, phased array systems, and microwave components design and modeling. The first topic presents the conceptual design of a WPT system at 2. 45 GHz with 90 % efficiency and 1 MW of DC output power. Second, a comparative study between 2. 45 and 35 GHz WPT operation is provided. Finally, the optimization of a <b>taper</b> <b>distribution</b> with reduced thermal constraints on a sandwich transmitter is realized. For a 250 - and 375 -m antenna radius, 89. 7 % of collection efficiency with 29 % reduction in maximum power density (compared to the Gaussian), and 93 % collection efficiency with 39 % reduction of maximum power density, are obtained respectively with two split tapers. The reduction in maximum power density {{and the use of}} split taper are important to alleviate the thermal problems in high power transmission. For the phased array project, the conceptual design of a small-scale system and in-depth analysis using two main approaches (statistical and field analysis) is realized. Practical aspects are addressed to determine the phased array main design features. The statistical method provides less accurate results than the field analysis since it is intended for large arrays. Careful theoretical analysis led to good correlation between statistical, field analysis and experimental results. In the components chapter, efficient loop transitions used in a patch antenna array are designed at K- and W-band. Measured insertion loss (IL) K-band loop is under 0. 4 dB. The K- and W-band antenna array measured broadside gains are 23. 6 dB at 24. 125 GHz and 25 dB at 76. 5 GHz with return loss under 9. 54 dB from 24 to 24. 4 GHz and 12 dB from 75. 1 to 77. 3 GHz, respectively. Also, a multilayer folded line filter is designed at 5. 8 GHz and compared to planar ring filters. Improved measured bandwidth from 2 GHz to 7. 5 GHz and IL of 1. 2 dB are obtained with approximately half the size of a planar ring resonator.

The first, time-independent model, modified from Helmstetter et al. (2007), provides five-year forecasts for magnitudes m > 4. 95. We show that large quakes occur on average near the locations of small m > 2 events, so that a high-resolution estimate of the spatial distribution of future large quakes is obtained from {{the locations of the}} numerous small events. We employ an adaptive spatial kernel of optimized bandwidth and assume a universal, <b>tapered</b> Gutenberg-Richter <b>distribution.</b> In retrospective tests, we show that no Poisson forecast could capture the observed variability. We therefore also test forecasts using a negative binomial distribution for the number of events. We modify existing likelihood-based tests to better evaluate the spatial forecast. Our time-dependent model, an Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model modified from Helmstetter et al. (2006), provides next-day forecasts for m > 3. 95. The forecasted rate is the sum of a background rate, proportional to our time-independent model, and of the triggered events due to all prior earthquakes. Each earthquake triggers events with a rate that increases exponentially with its magnitude and decays in time according to Omori's law. An isotropic kernel models the spatial density of aftershocks for small (< 5. 5) events. For larger quakes, we smooth early aftershocks to forecast later events.

Perhaps this is due to formation of serpentine along slow ridges and transforms and its absence from fast ridges and transforms. Spreading ridges and oceanic transform faults both have imperfect seismic coupling because: (i) all detailed local studies of seismogenic lithosphere thickness exceed our mean values for coupled thickness, and (ii) if coupling were perfect, and seismogenic lithosphere thickness were as small as our estimated coupled thickness, it would require unreasonable stress drops or rupture shapes to explain the moments of the largest earthquakes...|$|R

Calculations of section wave-drag distributions and wing wave drag are presented for families of <b>tapered</b> plan forms. <b>Distributions</b> of section wave drag along the span of tapered wings are, in general, very similar in shape to those of untapered plan forms. For a given taper ratio and aspect ratio, an appreciable reduction in wing wave-drag coefficient with increased sweepback is noted for the entire range of Mach number considered. For a given sweep and taper ratio, higher aspect ratios reduce the wing wave-drag coefficient at substantially subcritical supersonic Mach numbers. At Mach numbers approaching the critical value, that is, a value equal to the secant of the sweepback angle, the plan forms of low aspect ratio have lower drag coefficients. Calculations for wings of equal root bending stress (and hence different aspect ratio) indicate that tapering the wing reduces the wing wave-drag coefficient at Mach numbers considerably less than the critical value and a decrease of the drag coefficient with taper at Mach numbers near the critical value...|$|R
40|$|One {{major problem}} when using bonded fiber-reinforced plastic {{laminates}} to strengthen and upgrade existing structures {{is the high}} stresses in the adhesive layer, in the area {{close to the end}} of the laminate, which might govern the failure of the joint. One method that has been put forward as a means of reducing the stress concentration in this area, is to taper the end of the laminate. Although this method has been suggested by some design guidelines, no specific information is usually provided about the tapering type, required tapering length, and limitations associated with this method. A parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effect of tapering length and the material properties of joint constituents, i. e., stiffness of the laminate and adhesive, on stress distribution in adhesive joints using the finite element method. Two different configurations, including normal and reverse tapering, were considered. The results indicated that the effect of <b>tapering</b> on stress <b>distribution</b> is highly dependent on the stiffness of the laminate and the adhesive used in the joint. It was concluded that tapering is more effective in joints with softer laminates and stiffer adhesives. Reverse tapering was found to have more favorable effects on stress reduction in comparison to normal tapering...|$|R
