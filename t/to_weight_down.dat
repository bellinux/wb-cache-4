500|$|Gordon {{was again}} arrested on 13 January 2004. Police {{said at the}} time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest {{followed}} new leads. These new leads were later reported to be a confession by Michael Wainwright, who claimed to have been a cellmate of Gordon's during his short prison stay in 1997. The police then revisited the site where the body was discovered, and found a piece of Westmorland green slate, a stone that matched the rocks that made up the wall of the family's bungalow. The case was brought to trial at Manchester Crown Court, and lasted ten weeks. There was no single piece of evidence that pointed to Gordon indisputably, but the prosecution argued that when the evidence was placed together, it could only point at Park, and not a [...] "mysterious stranger or secret lover". Primarily, the case for the prosecution rested on circumstantial evidence, with the jury being asked to consider knots, rocks used <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> the body and the ice axe, all linking Gordon Park to the crime. However, the statements of Michael Wainwright, and another of Gordon's cellmates, who had learning difficulties, were also used as evidence by the prosecution. He was sentenced to be jailed for life, and told that he must serve at least 15 years. The judge said that he had taken into account the [...] "terrible concealment" [...] of the body.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Italian border is less than 20 km away and that Ajdovščina was under Italian {{administration}} from 1918 to 1947, and from 1927 as a commune of the Province of Gorizia (as Aidussina), during Italian rule (1918-1943, nominally lasted to 1947), the style of the town does not resemble that of a typical Italian town. The strong bora winds would cause damage to the usual Italian house construction. Thus the population adopted and modified the classical Karst architecture for their own needs; for example, by putting stones on roofs <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> the tiles against the strong winds.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the {{emergence}} of smart cities, which utilize various sensing data for applications such as pollution monitoring, infrastructure planning and traffic control. Current sensing projects tend to deploy {{a large number of}} low-cost and unreliable sensing sources, rather than a small number of high-quality sensing sources. It is therefore critical to provide data analysis in the face of unreliable sources. This thesis focuses on two types of sensing sources that have been used in smart city sensing projects, namely, environmental sensors and human sensors. The environmental sensors are physical sensors that are made to monitor certain environmental features, such as temperature, humidity, and pollutant concentration. An environmental sensor can fail frequently and will start generating faulty data when there is chemical compound decay, battery exhaustion, or calibration problems. Human sensors, as recently proposed in a new area called social sensing, are online messaging platform users who post observations about their surrounding environments. The data generated by human sensors can be erroneous because the natural language used in their messages does not conform to a machine-readable standard. Based on a survey of existing literature, this thesis presents source profiling-based solutions for three data analysis problems, data cleaning in environmental sensing, observation message classification in social sensing, and message location inference. Each of the solutions is validated with various real-world data and extensive experiments. For data cleaning in environmental sensing, we propose two solutions, approaching from a frequentist perspective and a Bayesian perspective, respectively. The frequentist approach determines sensor reliability based on the frequency of reliable behavior in the past, and in each data collection iteration updates a reliability score, which can be used <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> or remove the data from unreliable sources. The Bayesian approach models sensor reliability as a latent variable, and applies the Expectation Maximization framework to discover the latent sensor reliability and correct reading values for the environmental feature. For observation message classification, we propose supervised and unsupervised solutions. We propose a supervised solution to distinguish messages according to three perspectives, namely, observation, affection, and speculation. We next propose a supervised solution based on user features such as trending activity, communication status, and writing styles. And finally, we propose an unsupervised solution based on lexical analysis and user profiling in four user attributes, namely, originality, interactivity, objectivity, and topic focus. For location inference, we propose a solution based on name entity extraction and user message histories. The proposed solution extracts location names from text messages using a gazetteer, and after retrieving a number of past locations from the message history of a user, it applies outlier removal before inferring the current location. Incorporating observation classification and location inference, we propose an event detection system called Sense and Focus (SNAF), which detects real world events based on discussions exchanged on Twitter. A prototype implementation of the system has shown a number of detection results, 54 % of which corresponding to real-world events, and in many case detected earlier than news reports, and with less than 1. 5 km location error.

Additional racing modifications include a 3 in exhaust with Coast Fab mufflers, C&R racing aluminum radiator, and coolers for the engine oil, transmission and differential. It was designed {{for use in the}} KONI Challenge Series.|$|R
50|$|The W196 was front mid-engined, {{with its}} long {{longitudinally}} mounted engine placed just behind the front axles instead of over them to better balance front/rear weight distribution. A welded aluminum tube spaceframe chassis carried ultra-light Elektron magnesium-alloy bodywork (having a specific gravity of 1.8, {{less than a quarter}} of iron's 7.8), which contributed substantially <b>to</b> keeping dry <b>weight</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ballast used is {{calculated}} {{so that the}} structure has approximate hydrostatic equilibrium (that is, the tunnel is roughly the same overall density as water), whereas immersed tube tunnels are ballasted more <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> them <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the sea bed. This, of course, means that a submerged floating tunnel must be anchored to the ground or to the water surface {{to keep it in}} place (which of these depends on which side of the equilibrium point the tunnel is).|$|R

50|$|For {{the final}} {{production}} design of this antenna and its highly complex drive mechanism, the Army’s Signal Corps Laboratories turned to Chrysler’s Central Engineering Office. There, the parabola was changed from aluminum to steel, allowing production forming using standard automotive presses. <b>To</b> keep <b>weight</b> <b>down,</b> 6,000 equally spaced holed were drilled {{in the face}} (this {{did not affect the}} radiation pattern). The drive mechanism was completely redesigned, using technology derived from Chrysler’s research in automotive gears and differentials. The changes resulted in improved performance, reduced weight, and easier maintenance. A large portion of the Dodge plant was used in building 1,500 of the SCR-584 antennas as well as the vans used in the systems.|$|R
