40|$|The {{frequency}} of recovered X-ray-induced (4000 R) rearrangements that, in all probability, mimic terminal deletions of the X chromosome {{was only one}} of, roughly, 105 X chromosomes screened for tip deficiencies. Although the single exception looks terminally deleted, it is probably capped by a very short or nonpolytene <b>telomeric</b> <b>segment.</b> It is apparent from these data that the probability of "healing" or stabilization of a terminally deleted X in the zygotic nucleus or developing embryo of Drosophila melanogaster is vanishingly small. The telomeric caps in two obviously interstitial deficiencies that were recovered represent, roughly, 1 / 500 {{of the length of}} a mitotic chromosome. These findings give some indication of the extreme difficulty of detecting short telomeric segments capping either deleted polytene chromosomes or deleted metaphase chromosomes of, for example, humans...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The human {{immunoglobulin}} heavy-chain (IGH) locus at chromosome 14 q 32 {{is frequently}} involved in different translocations of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and {{the detection of}} any breakage involving the IGH locus should identify a B-cell NHL. The split-signal IGH fluorescence in situ hybridization-chromogenic in situ hybridization (FISH-CISH) DNA probe {{is a mixture of}} 2 fluorochrome-labeled DNAs: a green one that binds the <b>telomeric</b> <b>segment</b> and a red one that binds the centromeric segment, both on the IGH breakpoint. In the current study, the authors tested the capability of the IGH FISH-CISH DNA probe to detect IGH translocations and diagnose B-cell lymphoproliferative processes on cytological samples. METHODS: Fifty cytological specimens from cases of lymphoproliferative processes were tested using the split-signal IGH FISH-CISH DNA probe and the results were compared with light-chain assessment by flow cytometry AQ 2 (FC), IGH status was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and clinicohistological data. RESULTS: The signal score produced comparable results on FISH and CISH analysis and detected 29 positive, 15 negative, and 6 inadequate cases; there were 29 true-positive cases (66...|$|E
40|$|Although much {{is known}} about the {{pathology}} of human chronic atrophic (type A, autoimmune) gastritis, its cause is poorly understood. Mouse experimental autoimmune gastritis (EAG) is a CD 4 + T cell-mediated organ-specific autoimmune disease of the stomach that is induced by neonatal thymectomy of BALB/c mice. It has many features similar to human autoimmune gastritis. To obtain a greater understanding of the genetic components predisposing to autoimmune gastritis, a linkage analysis study was performed on (BALB/cCrSlc x C 57 BL/ 6) F 2 intercross mice using 126 microsatellite markers covering 95 % of the autosomal genome. Two regions with linkage to EAG were identified on distal chromosome 4 and were designated Gasa 1 and Gasa 2. The Gasa 1 gene maps within the same chromosomal segment as the type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility genes Idd 11 and Nba 1, respectively. Gasa 2 is the more telomeric of the two genes and was mapped within the same chromosomal segment as the type 1 diabetes susceptibility gene Idd 9. In addition, there was evidence of quantitative trait locus controlling autoantibody titer within the <b>telomeric</b> <b>segment</b> of chromosome 4. The clustering of genes conferring susceptibility to EAG with those conferring susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is consistent with the coinheritance of gastritis and diabetes within human families. This is the first linkage analysis study of autoimmune gastritis in any organism and as such makes an important and novel contribution {{to our understanding of the}} etiology of this disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of cell nuclei in callus {{obtained from}} root-tip meristems of Allium fistulosum L. (Monocotyledoneae, Alliaceae) was analysed. The most interesting phenomena observed in long-term callus culture were the different mechanisms of cell polyploidization, enlargement of <b>telomeric</b> <b>segments</b> of heterochromatin, and extensive chromatin elimination, associated with instability of nuclei size and DNA content. 			 			Protruding heterochromatin "spikes" were observed {{on the surface}} of some di- and polyploid nuclei. The presence of these spikes was connected with the formation of small heterochromatic micronuclei frequently found in the cytoplasm. It is suggested that these micronuclei are produced by direct elimination of heterochromatin from the interphase nuclei. 			 			Polyploid cells accumulated with each successive cell collection. The ploidy level attained by highly polyploid cells was 15 C- 220 C. The shape of the nuclei and heterochromatin distribution suggest that polyploid nuclei in A. fistulosum tissue culture are produced by endoreduplication and by restitution cycles...|$|R
40|$|In {{the fungus}} Pneumocystis carinii, {{at least three}} gene {{families}} (PRT 1, MSR, and MSG) {{have the potential to}} generate high-frequency antigenic variation, which {{is likely to be a}} strategy by which this parasitic fungus is able to prolong its survival in the rat lung. Members of these gene families are clustered at chromosome termini, a location that fosters recombination, which has been implicated in selective expression of MSG genes. To gain insight into the architecture, evolution, and regulation of these gene clusters, six <b>telomeric</b> <b>segments</b> of the genome were sequenced. Each of the segments began with one or more unique genes, after which were members of different gene families, arranged in a head-to-tail array. The three-gene repeat PRT 1 -MSR-MSG was common, suggesting that duplications of these repeats have contributed to expansion of all three families. However, members of a gene family in an array were no more similar to one another than to members in other arrays, indicating rapid divergence after duplication. The intergenic spacers were more conserved than the genes and contained sequence motifs also present in subtelomeres, which in other species have been implicated in gene expression and recombination. Long mononucleotide tracts were present in some MSR genes. These unstable sequences can be expected to suffer frequent frameshift mutations, providing P. carinii with another mechanism to generate antigen variation...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Two {{children}} with monosmy IOp 13 are reported. In {{the first case}} the monosomy {{was the result of}} a maternal balanced translocation t(3; 10) (p 27;pl 3) while the second case was a de novo mutation. We reviewed clinical details of cases reported so far and found that certain symptoms are typical of the deletion of a comparatively large segment of chromosome 10 short arms. These symptoms include mental and growth retardation, skull abnormalities, antimongoloid slant of the eyes, ear abnormalities, anteverted nostrils, abnormalities of the hands and feet, cryptorchidism in boys, and, primarily, hypoplasia or aplasia of the olfactory bulbs and olfactory tracts as well as narrow palpebral fissures or eyelid ptosis. Since the first description by Elliott et al 1 of a probable partial deletion of lOp in a child with many clinical symptoms, a number of reports of patients with lOp partial monosomy have been published, 2 - 7 thus enlarging the clinical picture. Deletion of part of the chromosome 10 short arms associated with deletion of the long arm terminal segment is also found in cases with ring chromosome 10. 8 - 12 As a rule, the deletion of both <b>telomeric</b> <b>segments</b> is small and the clinical picture is not as severe as in cases of the above mentioned iOp partial monosomy. Defined chromosome abnormalities, particularly monosomies, are suitable material for human genome mapping. Two enzyme loci have been thought to be located on lOp, namely red blood cell hexokinase (HK 1) and pyrophosphatase (inorganic...|$|R
40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly apparent {{that many of the}} genes in the class III region of the human Major Histocompatibility Complex encode proteins involved in the immune and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, genetic studies have indicated that genes within the class III region, particularly the <b>telomeric</b> <b>segment</b> containing the TNF gene, could contribute to susceptibility to diseases of immune-related aetiology. To further characterise this region and to identify candidate disease susceptibility genes, two overlapping cosmids, TN 62 and TN 82, covering an ~ 82 kb segment of DNA around the TNF gene were selected for sequence analysis. The eight known genes in this region have been precisely positioned with the order: Gl/AIF- 1, 1 C 7, LST 1 (B 144), LTB, TNF, LTA, IKBL, BAT 1 (centromere to telomere) and their genomic structures have been defined. Comparison of the Gl genomic region with previously described cDNA and genomic sequences, together with the results of RT-PCR, indicates that three alternative transcripts, Gl, Allograft Inflammatory Factor- 1 and Interferon-Î³ Responsive Transcript- 1, are all derived from this gene. The completion of the sequence of 1 C 7 (D 6 S 2570) has revealed that this gene encodes a putative novel member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. A number of alternatively spliced transcripts of 1 C 7 were identified by RT-PCR, all of which are expressed in immune-related cell lines. Alternative splicing within the immunoglobulin domain- encoding region was seen to result in possible set switching between an IgV domain and an IgC 2 domain. In addition to this, a previously unidentified gene, homologous to a number of V- ATPase G-subunits, has been located 1 kb telomeric of IKBL. Lastly, the pseudogene UCRH-L and an AIF- 1 gene fragment have been identified in the intergenic region between AIF- 1 and 1 C 7. In order to assess the contribution of loci in this region to disease susceptibility, the genes AIF- 1, 1 C 7, ATP 6 G and the BAT 1 promoter region were subjected to mutation analysis. A total of 28 polymorphisms have been identified, 8 in AIF- 1, 10 in 1 C 7, 7 in ATP 6 G and 3 in the BAT 1 promoter region. Work is at present underway to genotype a number of the identified polymorphisms in control DNAs and in DNA samples from patients with combined variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The information generated from this analysis will bring us closer to explaining the reported linkage of CVID with the telomeric end of the human MHC class III region. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{chromosomal}} {{organization of}} amplified chromosome 12 sequences was studied with fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} in six mesenchymal tumors: two osteosarcomas, one lipoma, two liposarcomas, and one fibrosarcoma. All except the fibrosarcoma contained ring and/or giant marker chromosomes. Amplification of chromosome 12 sequences, demonstrated with whole-chromosome paint in all cases, was confined to ring and giant marker chromosomes in four tumors. In one of the osteosarcomas and in the fibrosarcoma, amplified sequences were added to chromosome 12 and to chromosomes 10, 12, 18, and the Y chromosome, respectively. Hybridizations with single-copy probes demonstrated considerable inter- and intracellular variation in the arrangement of chromosome 12 sequences in ring and marker chromosomes. Amplification of 12 q 13 - 15 sequences, predominantly from the HMGIC-MDM 2 region, was detected in all cases, but the two osteosarcomas also contained amplification of 12 p material. This finding, combined with results from previous studies, indicates that 12 p amplification is a feature distinguishing osteosarcomas from adipose tissue tumors. A novel finding was the presence of positive signals for chromosome 12 alpha-satellite sequences in ring and marker chromosomes in four cases. Rod chromosomes carrying amplified material, in particular those that were relatively stable, frequently exhibited chromosome 12 negative terminal segments; two of these, present in two separate cases, were shown by C-banding to contain constitutive heterochromatin. The significant intercellular heterogeneity in the number and structure of rings and giant markers in a subset of mesenchymal tumors could be explained by continuous recombination through breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. If so, this process will continue until broken ends become stabilized, for example by acquisition of <b>telomeric</b> <b>segments</b> from other chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{description}} of the karyotype of Leporinus desmotes. The diploid female number was 2 n = 54 meta- and submetacentric chromosomes. The nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) were studied by silver nitrate staining and rDNA {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and were found to be located in the telomeric region of the long arm of the 9 th pair. C-banding revealed centromeric and <b>telomeric</b> heterochromatin <b>segments</b> in most chromosomes. Intercalar blocks of heterochromatin were observed in the long arm of six chromosome pairs. Besides a NOR-adjacent heterochromatin, all of the intercalar heterochromatic segments were brightly fluorescent by mithramycin staining. These data suggest that a unique amplification of a primordial GC-rich heterochromatin, probably NOR-associated, may have taken place in the karyotype diversification of this Leporinus species...|$|R
40|$|Human {{genetic linkage}} maps {{are based on}} rates of {{recombination}} across the genome. These rates in humans vary by {{the sex of the}} parent from whom alleles are inherited, by chromosomal position, and by genomic features, such as GC content and repeat density. We have examinedâfor the first time, to our knowledgeâracial/ethnic differences in genetic maps of humans. We constructed genetic maps based on 353 microsatellite markers in four racial/ethnic groups: whites, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and East Asians (Chinese and Japanese). These maps were generated using 9, 291 subjects from 2, 900 nuclear families who participated in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Instituteâfunded Family Blood Pressure Program, the largest sample used for map construction to date. Although the maps for the different groups are generally similar, we did find regional and genomewide differences across ethnic groups, including a longer genomewide map for African Americans than for other populations. Some of this variation was explained by genotyping artifactsânamely, null alleles (i. e., alleles with null phenotypes) at a number of lociâand by ethnic differences in null-allele frequencies. In particular, null alleles appear to be the likely explanation for the excess map length in African Americans. We also found that nonrandom missing data biases map results. However, we found regions on chromosome 8 p and <b>telomeric</b> <b>segments</b> with significant ethnic differences and a suggestive interval on chromosome 12 q that were not due to genotype artifacts. The difference on chromosome 8 p is likely due to a polymorphic inversion in the region. The results of our investigation have implications for inferences of possible genetic influences on human recombination as well as for future linkage studies, especially those involving populations of nonwhite ethnicity...|$|R
40|$|To confirm seizure {{susceptibility}} (SZS) {{quantitative trait}} loci (QTLs) on chromosome (chr) 15 identified previously using C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) and DBA/ 2 J (D 2) mice and to refine their genomic map position, we studied {{a set of}} three congenic strains in which overlapping segments of chr 15 from D 2 were transferred onto the B 6 background. We measured thresholds for generalized electroshock seizure (GEST) and maximal electroshock seizure (MEST) in congenic strains and B 6 -like littermates and also tested their responses to kainic acid (KA) and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Results document that MEST is significantly lower in strains 15 M and 15 D, which harbor medial and distal (<b>telomeric)</b> <b>segments</b> of chr 15 (respectively) from D 2, compared with strain 15 P, which harbors the proximal (acromeric) segment of chr 15 from D 2, and with control littermates. Congenic strains 15 P and 15 M exhibited greater KA SZS compared with strain 15 D and B 6 -like controls. All congenic strains were similar to controls with regard to PTZ SZS. Taken together, results suggest there are multiple SZS QTLs on chr 15 and that two QTLs harbor gene variants that affect MEST and KA SZS independently. The MEST QTL is refined to a 19 Mb region flanked by rs 13482630 and D 15 Mit 159. This interval contains 350 genes, 183 of which reside {{in areas where the}} polymorphism rate between B 6 and D 2 is high. The KA QTL interval spans a 65 Mb region flanked by markers D 15 Mit 13 and rs 31271969. It harbors 83 genes in highly polymorphic areas, 310 genes in all. Complete dissection of these loci will lead to identification of genetic variants that influence SZS in mice and provide a better understanding of seizure biology...|$|R
40|$|Expression {{of surface}} antigen genes in Trypanosoma brucei occurs at {{expression}} sites located near telomeres. Since only one antigen is produced at a time, a mechanism must exist {{to prevent the}} simultaneous activity of multiple expression sites. Here we report that PstI and PvuII restriction sites in silent telomeric antigen genes are partially uncleavable, presumably {{as a consequence of}} DNA modification. The modification, which is absent in transcribed genes but returns after gene inactivation, may be specific for telomeric DNA because (1) it is not detected in non-telomeric genes; (2) modification is highest close to the telomere; (3) the level of modification in a telomeric gene is influenced {{by the size of the}} <b>telomeric</b> DNA <b>segment</b> downstream. Whether telomere modification is cause or consequence of antigen gene switch-off remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} mapped {{the gene}} for ataxia-telangiectasia group A (ATA) to chromosome 11 q 22 - 23 by linkage analysis, using the genetic markers THY 1 and pYNB 3. 12 (D 11 S 144). The most likely order was cent-AT-S 144 -THY 1. The present paper describes further mapping of the AT locus {{by means of a}} panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cM in the 11 q 22 - 23 region centered around S 144 and THY 1. Location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [S 144 -THY 1] segment, as well as three contiguous <b>segments</b> <b>telomeric</b> to THY 1, are each unlikely to contain the AT locus, while the more centromeric [STMY-S 144] segment is most likely to contain the AT locus. These data, together with recent refinements in the linkage and physical maps of 11 q 22 - 23, place the AT locus at 11 q 23...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{imprinted}} Dlk 1 âDio 3 {{region on}} mouse chromosome 12 contains six imprinted genes {{and a number}} of maternally expressed snoRNAs and miRNAs. Here we present a high-resolution sequence analysis of the 1. 1 -Mb <b>segment</b> <b>telomeric</b> to Gtl 2 in mouse and a homology comparison to the human. Ppp 2 r 5 c and Dnchc 1 at the telomeric end of the analyzed sequence are biallelically expressed, suggesting that the imprinted domain does not extend beyond the paternally expressed Dio 3 gene. RT-PCR experiments support the predicted presence of a maternally expressed intergenic transcript(s) encompassing Gtl 2, Rian, and Mirg. These maternally expressed genes, and also the intergenic transcript(s), show pronounced expression in the adult mouse brain, whereas the paternally transcribed Dio 3 and the nonimprinted Ppp 2 r 5 c and Dnchc 1 are expressed in different tissues. Hence, tissue-specific coregulation of maternally expressed genes might be an important feature of this domain...|$|R
