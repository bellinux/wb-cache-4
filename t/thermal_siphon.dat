40|$|The Solar Rating and Certification Corporation (SRCC) has {{established}} a standardized methodology for determining the performance rating of the Solar Domestic Hot Water (SDHW) systems it certifies under OG- 300. Measured performance data for the solar collector component(s) of the system are used along with numerical models for {{the balance of the}} system to calculate the system`s thermal performance under a standard set of rating conditions. SRCC uses TRNSYS to model each of the components that comprise the system. The majority of the SRCC certified systems include a thermal storage tank with an auxiliary electrical heater. The most common being a conventional fifty gallon electric tank water heater. Presently, the thermal losses from these tanks are calculated using Q = U {center_dot} A {center_dot} {Delta}T.

This study is intended to address only that part of the problem that deals with the plumbing fittings attached to the tank. Heat losses from a storage tank and its plumbing fittings involve three different operating modes: charging, discharging and standby. In the charging mode, the tank receives energy from the solar collector. In the discharge mode, water flows from the storage tank through the distribution pipes to the faucets and cold city water enters the tank.

The literature review for this study shows that natural ventilation alone cannot meet year long optimum indoor comfort in buildings. This research, through a design exercise, intends to verify whether a naturally ventilated house, in hot humid region of Austin, TX, can enhance its passive cooling potential through double?walled wind catcher and solar chimney. In this research, a passive solar residence has been designed. Two designs have been explored on the chosen site: a basecase design without the wind catcher and solar chimney and another design with wind catcher and solar chimney. In the designcase, the placement of the wind catcher and the solar chimney has been designed so that a <b>thermal</b> <b>siphon</b> of airflow inside the building can be created. The design might show {{that there will be a}} natural airflow during the time of the year when natural wind does not flow. Moreover, the double walled wind catcher will resist the cool winter wind due to its shape and orientation.

40|$|M. Eng. The {{need and}} problem was {{originated}} from the trends of the earths dwindling energy resource. As time progresses humans {{are becoming more}} aware of need to use so called “alternative energy sources” to alleviate the main energy converters i. e. power stations. The student was tasked with investigating the thermal performance of a solar powered refrigeration cycle (prototype) that could: produce enough refrigeration effect that it replaces the standard home vapour compression unit, used for cooling or freezing of foods, heats up a geyser sufficiently to have hot water for a common house hold, has excess energy to heat or cool liquid or air based environments and {{has the potential to}} lower the electrical bill of a house. The introductory step was to obtain the thermo fluid properties of aqua ammonia solutions. A setback came about when determining the aqua ammonia properties. There were too many conflicting properties being yielded by six different authors. In an attempt to gain confidence in only one author a comparison table was prepared. The table compared the six authors to each other. By looking at all the values compared it brought great clarity to the problem. When continuing the research into the fundamental law approach of solving for the cycle new findings were made. Initially very little comprehensive studies were done which explained in fundamental laws to solve for the absorption cycle. After extensive reviewing of a detailed study on how to solve for absorption refrigeration cycles, then it was able to begin improving on the thermo – fluid design of the cycle. As cycle and component design began to progress the train of thought began to steer in a direction. Each component needed to be detail designed. The advantage of having each component specifically catered for in the cycle design was that it would increase the cycle efficiency. In this way it would ensure that during the concept generation phase the functioning of each component was clear, thereby enabling a clear understanding of how components would compliment each other in a cycle. A mode of solving for the cycle was to endeavour that all parameters could be calculated unambiguously, with the aid of computerisation. Testing was carried out on a real life commercial <b>thermal</b> <b>siphoning</b> machine in order to realistically understand how absorption refrigeration works and gain experience. At {{the end of the study}} the most important result is that the dissertation research shows strong evidence that it will be possible to create a device which can fulfil the four tasks listed above. Another result is a program which is a refined cycle design of the pump absorption type refrigeration. The program solves for points along the cycle. Lastly it was found that even though EES was the simpler program to use for aqua ammonia solution properties it was the only program which catered for sub cooling and super heating...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with geothermal energy and specifically focuses on engineered geothermal systems (EGS), which are among a portfolio of technology options for power generation from geothermal resources. In this cyclic approach (also known as hot-dry-rocks or enhanced geothermal systems), high pressure water (i. e. "geofluid") is first pumped down a borehole (known as injection well) into a bed of hot fractured rock and forced to travel through the bed, capturing the heat content of the rocks. The hot water is then extracted from a second borehole (known as production well) and sent into a binary power plant, where its thermal energy is converted to electricity. The cooled water exiting the power plant is then injected back into the ground to resume the cycle. The aim of this thesis is to advance the understanding of CO₂ based EGS power generation process and verify the merits of using CO₂ rather than water for heat extraction from fractured hot dry rocks. The work has been largely driven by the suitable thermodynamic and transport properties of supercritical CO₂ (scCO₂), {{which makes it a}} desirable candidate for harnessing geothermal energy from hot dry rocks, particularly in regions where water resources are scarce. However, {{only a limited number of}} studies were carried out in the past to assess the viability of the CO₂ based EGS concept. Most of these studies were theoretical examinations of the heat extraction and exergy analysis under a limited range of operational parameters. In addition, research work on the fluid-rock interactions relevant to CO₂ based EGS is also limited and needs further investigation. The present thesis addresses the above knowledge gaps through a combined experimental and theoretical study, resulting to an accurate description of the entire CO₂ based EGS power generation process encompassing the reservoir, wellbore and power plant cycle as well as the fluid-rock geochemical interaction. The specific objectives of the project underlying this thesis were: (1) model development and simulation of the entire CO₂ and H₂O based EGS and the associated power plant cycles, (2) optimisation studies and sensitivity analysis of operating and design parameters affecting CO₂ and H₂O based EGS performance, (3) performance comparison of CO₂ based EGS and H₂O based EGS under the same operating and reservoir conditions, (4) examination of the effect of reservoir parameters on both CO₂ and H₂O based EGS concepts through detailed 3 D reservoir simulations, (5) design and fabrication of a fluid-rock interaction apparatus capable of simulating EGS conditions, and (6) experimental investigation of the fluid-rock interactions at reservoir conditions and its likely impact on the performance characteristics of CO₂ and H₂O based EGS. One dimensional (1 D), 2 D, and 3 D models of integrated reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle were developed to provide an overall description of fluid flow in fractured reservoir (channel flow) and in radial fluid flow in homogeneous porous media. It was also created to investigate " 3 D effects" as well as transient changes during the power generation process. The thermosiphon power generation process was used in CO₂ based EGS model simulations while the Organic Rankine Cycle binary plant with isopentane as the working fluid was employed in the H₂O based EGS simulations. Mass and energy balance equations associated with the integrated 1 D and 2 D reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle model simulations were solved using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES). In the integrated 3 D reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle modelling, the transient geofluid mass and heat flow rates in the reservoir were simulated using TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N software packages while the wellbore flow and power plant cycle calculations were carried out using EES. The use of TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N was validated and calibrated by replicating the results of prior studies done by Pruess (2008) where TOUGH 2 /EOSM simulator was used. A fluid-rock interaction apparatus with titanium made wetted components was designed and fabricated to conduct batch and flow-through experimental studies of rock samples with CO₂ and H₂O at pressures up to 50 MPa and temperatures up to 400 °C. Surface granite from Moonbi near New England Highway, NSW and drill core samples from Mossgiel 1 and Nambucurra 1 boreholes at Murray-Darling Basin, NSW were collected and used as representatives of hot-dry-rock (HDR) EGS reservoir rock formations. The granite samples were pulverised and analysed for particle size distribution as well aselement (fused-bead XRF) and mineral (Rietveld quantitative XRD) compositions prior to any experiments. Fluid-rock interaction experiments were conducted for up to 15 days at different simulated reservoir pressures (20 and 35 MPa) and temperatures(200 and 250 °C). Fluid effluents were analysed using ICP-OES, and the reacted pulverised granite samples were subjected to further XRF, XRD, and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis. The following are the key findings of the integrated 1 D/ 2 D reservoir-wellbore-power simulations: • The mass flow rate of CO₂ has an inverse relation with the injection temperature in a CO₂ based EGS while there is a direct relationship between the mass flow rate of water and injection temperature in CO₂ based EGS. These contrasting behaviours can be assigned to the fact that an increase in the injection temperature lowers the CO₂ density and hence increases its dynamic viscosity whereas in the case of water, an increase in the injection temperature lowers H₂O kinematic viscosity and thereby decreases the dynamic viscosity. • Reservoir pressure loss is generally higher for H₂O than for CO₂ because of the higher H₂O kinematic viscosity. • CO₂ overall mass flow rate is higher than that of H₂O due to lower average CO₂ kinematic viscosity at reservoir conditions. • Wellbore frictional loss of CO₂ is greater than that of H₂O due to the lower average CO₂ density along the length of the wellbore. • Heat extraction rates of H₂O based EGS is generally higher than those of CO₂ based EGS due to higher specific heat capacity of water. • The <b>thermal</b> <b>siphoning</b> is not practical for H₂O based EGS because the production pressure is usually lower than the injection pressure. • Power generation output of H₂O based EGS are higher than that of CO₂ based EGS and increases almost linearly as injection pressure increases while CO₂ based EGS power output shows a parabolic trend. These were found to be due to the dependency of CO₂ thermodynamic properties on pressure while H₂O thermodynamic properties are almost independent of pressure. • Reservoir temperature does not influence the overall CO₂ mass flow rate, but CO₂ heat extraction rate increases as reservoir temperature increases due to increase in the specific enthalpy change. • The maximum power generation of CO₂ based EGS decreases as reservoir pressure decreases due to lower CO₂ production pressure in the wellhead. • For both CO₂ and H₂O based EGS, shorter injection to production well distance gives higher fluid mass flow rate due to the increase in pressure gradient (pressure drop/distance) between the injection and production wells. • As the ratio of production to injection well increases, the CO₂ based EGS power generation output increases due to diminishing CO₂ frictional loss in individual production well as the number of production well increases. • CO₂ based EGS generally performs better in low permeability reservoirs (typically one order of magnitude decrease in reservoir permeability decreases CO₂ mass flow rates by 27 % while H₂O mass flow rates decreases by 67 %). • The overall thermal efficiency at any specified injection and reservoir conditions is constant regardless of CO₂ mass flow rate. Batch and flow-through CO₂-rock interaction experiments show that Ca, Fe, Mg, Al, and Si dissolve in scCO₂, which was found to be partly due to the presence of H₂O in the CO₂ stream leaked from the piston accumulator. Geochemical model simulations show that aqueous Si concentration is in equilibrium with the rock minerals after 1 day exposure in the batch experiment. The log of (Na/K) ratios shows the preferential dissolution of albite over k-feldspar. The SEM image analysis of the treated granites shows signs of erosion (i. e. rounded edges and pebble-like surfaces), which is considered to be due to the formation of carbonates in the surface and its subsequent erosion and dissolution (particularly Na₂CO₃ and K₂CO₃) to the fluid. The XFR analysis of the untreated and treated pulverised granites shows very small changes to SiO₂, Al₂O₃, CaO, MgO, Fe₂O₃, Na₂O, and K₂O major oxide compositions consistent with the ICP-OES analytical results. The Na-K-Mg ternary diagram of the data collected from the fluid-rock experiments shows that the aqueous fluid is far from the equilibrium. The presence and/or absence of minerals (hornblende or chlorite) in the starting material influences the log of (Na/K) ratios. Hornblende alters or converts to chlorite in the CO₂-H₂O mixture. Moreover, the concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Fe decreases with time, which is considered to be due to the formation of a passive layer of insoluble carbonate minerals in the surface, thus preventing further fluid-rock interaction. The pressure loss data collected during the flow-through fluid-rock interaction experiments validate the theory that CO₂ has lower reservoir loss than H₂O. The data also validate the correlation between particle size and intrinsic permeability, which predicts that at the same fluid mass flow rate, a medium with a larger particle size has a lower pressure loss...|$|R
40|$|As low {{temperature}} cryocoolers become more frequently used to cool superconducting magnets, it becomes increasingly {{apparent that the}} connection between the cooler and the magnet has an effect on the design and performance of the magnet. In general, the use of small coolers can be considered in two different temperature ranges; (1) from 3. 8 to 4. 8 K for magnet fabricated with LTS conductor and (2) from 18 to 35 K for magnets fabricated using HTS conductor. In general, both temperature ranges call for the use of a two-stage cooler. The best method for connecting a cooler to the magnet depends on a number of factors. The factors include: (1) whether the cooler must be used to cool down the magnet from room temperature, (2) whether the magnet must have one or more reservoirs of liquid cryogen to keep the magnet cold during a loss of cooling, and (3) constraints on the distance from the cooler cold heads and the magnet and its shield. Two methods for connecting {{low temperature}} coolers to superconducting magnets have been studied. The first method uses a cold strap to connect the cold heads directly to the loads. This method is commonly used for cryogen-free magnets. The second method uses a <b>thermal</b> <b>siphon</b> and liquid cryogens to make {{the connection between the}} load being cooled and the cold head.

40|$|Sloping {{sides of}} natural basins favour the {{formation}} of cross-shore temperature gradients (differential coastal heating/cooling), which cause significant littoral-pelagial water exchange. Autumnal denser water cascading along a sloping lake boundary, modulated by day/night variations of solar heating is considered numerically, in order to reveal {{the development of the}} cascading process in time, spatial structure of the exchange flows, and diurnal variations of volumetric flow-rate of littoral-pelagial exchange flow, as well as to compare its daily maxima at different depths/cross-sections, with known quasi-steady state predictions under constant buoyancy flux. The development of exchange flows progress through two phases: i) appearance and adjustment to day/night buoyancy flux variations; and ii) quasi-steady exchange, when variations of the flow rate in every next diurnal cycle are {{more or less the same}} as the previous day. The duration of the first phase depends on local depth (~ 1 day for depths of about 10 m, ~ 2 days for depths 15 - 25 m, and ~ 5 days down to 30 m for the considered initial linear vertical temperature stratification). Maximum horizontal exchange takes place in the cross-section where the thermocline meets the slope, and the cold down-slope currents detach from the bottom. The location of this cross-section advances off-shore with time, in accordance with the deepening of the upper mixed layer. The existence of a specific coastal circulation cell, with different water dynamics from those above the main part of the slope, is a characteristic feature of horizontal convective exchange. The mean value of the specific volumetric flow rate of the convective exchange, driven by day/night oscillations in its fully developed quasi-steady phase increases almost linearly with local depth, and is about twice as large as the quasi-steady exchange values, predicted by formula Q = 0. 0013 · d 1. 37 (Q is measured in m 2 s - 1, and local depth above the slope d in m), suggesting that the <b>thermal</b> <b>siphon,</b> energized by oscillating day/night buoyancy fluxes, flushes coastal regions twice as efficiently as the cascading, developing under (more or less) uniform external conditions in field observations and laboratory experiments, which lie behind the given formula. Flushing time in the considered case has an order of 10 - 60 hours for a littoral zone of 6 - 30 m depth. Application of convective phase diagrams (e. g., Q vs ΔT) is suggested as a convenient way to describe the day/night convective exchange, allowing for visualization of the flow development process, its coherency and the time lag of the development at different depths...|$|E
