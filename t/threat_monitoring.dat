40|$|Passive Internet {{monitoring}} is {{a powerful}} tool for measuring and characterizing interesting network activity like worms or distributed denial of service attacks. By employing statistical analysis on the captured network traffic, Internet <b>threat</b> <b>monitors</b> gain valuable insight into the nature of Internet threats. In the past, these monitors have been successfully used not only to detect DoS attacks or worm outbreaks but also to monitor worm propagation trends and other malicious activities on the Internet. Today, passive Internet <b>threat</b> <b>monitors</b> are widely recognized as an important technology for detecting and understanding anomalies on the Internet in a macroscopic way. Unfortunately, monitors that publish their results on the Internet provide a feedback loop that can be used by adversaries to deduce a monitor’s sensor locations. Knowledge of a monitor’s sensor location can severely reduce its functionality as the captured data may have been tampered with and can no longer be trusted. This paper describes algorithms for detecting which address spaces an Internet <b>threat</b> <b>monitor</b> listens to and presents empirical evidences that they are successful in locating the sensor positions of monitors deployed on the Internet. We also present solutions to make passive Internet <b>threat</b> <b>monitors</b> "harder to detect". ...|$|R

40|$|Internet <b>Threat</b> <b>Monitoring</b> (ITM) {{systems are}} a widely {{deployed}} facility to detect, analyze, and characterize dangerous Internet threats such as worms and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Nonetheless, an ITM system can also become {{the target of}} attack. In this paper, we address localization attacks against ITM systems in which an attacker impairs the effectiveness of ITM systems by identifying the locations of ITM monitors. We propose an information-theoretic framework for the modeling of localization attacks as communication channels. Based on the information-theoretic model, we generalize all existing attacks as “temporal attacks”, derive closed formulae of their performance, and propose an effective detection approach. The information-theoretic model also inspires a new attack called a spatial attack and motivates the corresponding detection approach. We show simulation results that support our theoretic findings.

Additionally, the article presents the point of designing such system, its concept and components. The main objective of WAZkA is to support the following processes of the KSWSiA: information exchange between the system elements and coordination of the system operations, as well as to prepare assessment and expert analyses, needed by the decision-making bodies, with respect to risk emergency situations during natural disasters, technical failures or other events resulting in biological, chemical or radioactive contamination. The selected modules included in the WAZkA system: Event Tree Analyzer, visualization module (COP) and emulators of the <b>threats</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems, were described as well as the idea of using the system for the purpose of training, including the designed emulators of the risk monitoring systems together with the scenario editor. The Event Tree Anlyzer is a graphical representation of a chronological sequence of events, significant {{from the point of view}} of the functioning of the object, which occur after a given event that initiates such sequence. COP is the GIS tool, which allows to present an operating situation on the basis of background maps. The application offers a possibility of enriching the presented operating situation with the risk data provided in the form of NATO ADat-P 3 (CBRN) reports. Emulators of the <b>threats</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems allow to generate, in an artificial and user-controlled manner, data on risks, which “pretend” to be real data obtained from the monitoring systems. The above approach significantly facilitates the organization of training and learning about rare situations or situations that have never occurred, but that are potentially dangerous...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Web systems {{supporting}} collaborative {{knowledge engineering}} have {{attracted much attention}} recently. By using social software techniques and attractive yet simple user interface, the motivation of users increases and the process can be significantly improved.

We propose a social platform called Social <b>Threat</b> <b>Monitor</b> (STM) aimed at improving safety of local communities in urban environment. The main assumption of the system is the collaboration of users to build and maintain a knowledge base about threats in their neighborhood. Knowledge gathered in the system can be used by the citizens as well as local authorities and police. The system supports collaborative knowledge engineering and management using semantic methods and a GIS component. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} {{a new class}} of attacks, the {{invisible}} LOCalization (iLOC) attack, which can accurately and invisibly localize monitors of Internet <b>threat</b> <b>monitoring</b> (ITM) systems, a class of widely deployed facilities to characterize Internet threats, such as worm propagation, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In the iLOC attack, the attacker launches low-rate port-scan traffic, encoded with a selected pseudo-noise code (PNcode), to targeted networks. While the secret PN-code is invisible to others, the attacker can accurately determine the existence of monitors in the targeted networks based on whether the PN-code is embedded in the report data queried from the data center of the ITM system. We conduct extensive simulations on the iLOC attack using real-world traces. Our data demonstrate that the iLOC attack can accurately identify monitors while remaining invisible to the ITM. Finally, we present a set of guidelines to counteract the iLOC attack. Index Terms—Internet <b>threat</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems, Invisible localization attack, PN-code, Securit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Internet <b>threat</b> <b>monitoring</b> (ITM) {{systems have}} been {{deployed}} to detect widespread threats and attacks on the Internet in recent years. However, the integrity and functionality of these systems largely depend on the location anonymity of their monitors. If the locations of monitors are disclosed, the attacker can bypass the monitors or even abuse them, significantly jeopardizing the performance of ITM systems. In this paper, we study {{a new class of}} attacks, the invisible LOCalization (iLOC) attack. The iLOC attack can accurately and invisibly localize monitors of ITM systems. In the iLOC attack, the attacker launches low-rate port-scan traffic, encoded with a selected pseudo-noise code (PNcode), to targeted networks. While the secret PN-code is invisible to others, the attacker can accurately determine the existence of monitors in the targeted networks based on whether the PNcode is embedded in the report data queried from the data center of the ITM system. We implement the iLOC attack and conduct experiments on a real-world ITM system to validate the feasibility of such attacks. We also conduct extensive simulations on the iLOC attack using real-world traces. Our data demonstrate that the iLOC attack can accurately identify monitors while remaining invisible to the ITM. Finally, we present a set of guidelines to counteract the iLOC attack. Index Terms—Internet <b>threat</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems, Invisible localization attack, PN-code, Securit...|$|E
40|$|We {{employed}} a novel parametric spider picture {{set in the}} context of a parametric fMRI anxiety provocation study, designed to tease apart brain regions involved in <b>threat</b> <b>monitoring</b> from regions representing an exaggerated anxiety response in spider phobics. For the stimulus set, we systematically manipulated perceived proximity of threat by varying a depicted spider's context, size, and posture. All stimuli were validated in a behavioral rating study (phobics n[*]=[*] 20; controls n[*]=[*] 20; all female). An independent group participated in a subsequent fMRI anxiety provocation study (phobics n[*]=[*] 7; controls n[*]=[*] 7; all female), in which we compared a whole-brain categorical to a whole-brain parametric analysis. Results demonstrated that the parametric analysis provided a richer characterization of the functional role of the involved brain networks. In three brain regions-the mid insula, the dorsal anterior cingulate, and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex-activation was linearly modulated by perceived proximity specifically in the spider phobia group, indicating a quantitative representation of an exaggerated anxiety response. In other regions (e. g., the amygdala), activation was linearly modulated in both groups, suggesting a functional role in <b>threat</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Prefrontal regions, such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, were activated during anxiety provocation but did not show a stimulus-dependent linear modulation in either group. The results confirm that brain regions involved in anxiety processing hold a quantitative representation of a pathological anxiety response and more generally suggest that parametric fMRI designs may be a very powerful tool for clinical research in the future, particularly when developing novel brain-based interventions (e. g., neurofeedback training).
