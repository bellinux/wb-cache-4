25|$|A <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is a tool}} used to {{precisely}} apply a specific torque to a fastener such as a nut or bolt. It is usually {{in the form of}} a socket wrench with special internal mechanisms. It was invented by Conrad Charles Bahr in 1918. However, it wasn't until much later on March 16, 1937, that Bahr received U.S. patent #2,074,079 for the invention of the <b>torque</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|E
25|$|Incorrect fitting can distort (warp) discs; {{the disc}}'s {{retaining}} bolts (or the wheel/lug nuts, if the disc is simply sandwiched {{in place by}} the wheel, as on many cars) must be tightened progressively and evenly. The use of air tools to fasten lug nuts can be bad practice, unless a <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is also used for final tightening. The vehicle manual will indicate the proper pattern for tightening as well as a torque rating for the bolts. Lug nuts should never be tightened in a circle. Some vehicles are sensitive to the force the bolts apply and tightening should be done with a <b>torque</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|E
25|$|Engineered joints {{require the}} torque {{to be chosen}} to provide the correct tension preload. Applying the torque to {{fasteners}} is commonly achieved using a <b>torque</b> <b>wrench.</b> The required torque value for a particular fastener application may be quoted in the published standard document, defined by the manufacturer or calculated.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Friction-style and spring-style <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{are used}} to tighten implant {{abutments}} and prosthetic screws. The mechanical stability of these <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> is crucial for the implant–abutment connection. The {{purposes of this study}} were to assess the performance of five brands (Straumann, Zimmer, Implant KA, Bredent, and Biohorizons) of wrench and to evaluate possible changes in applied torque values of aged wrenches. Materials and Methods. Five new and aged wrenches that had been used approximately 250 times in a 1 -year period were tested. The torque applied by friction- and spring-style wrenches was measured with a specially designed strain gauge indicator. Descriptive statistics, the one-sample t-test, and the independent-samples t-test were used to analyze values obtained from all <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches.</b> Results. The accuracy of new and aged torque devices of all brands except Bredent differed significantly from the target values, but the mean values for aged and new wrenches did not differ significantly from each other (p> 0. 05). Values for the spring- and friction-type <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> deviated from the target values by 11. 6 % and 10. 2 %, respectively. Conclusion. The accuracy of aged <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> is adequate for prosthetic screw tightening, but that of new <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> is unsatisfactory and must be examined carefully before delivery...|$|R

50|$|A {{torque tester}} {{is used as}} a quality control device to test or {{calibrate}} torque controlled tools. This includes electronic <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches,</b> click <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches,</b> dial <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches,</b> electric screwdrivers, air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, nutrunners, and torque screwdrivers. Today’s advanced torque testers include the ability to measure in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, convert to 8 engineering units (in·oz, in·lb, ft·lb, N·m, cN·m, kgf·cm, gf·cm, kgf·fm), 3 modes of operation (peak, 1st peak, track), and include a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certificate (or its domestic pendant).|$|R
25|$|There is {{no simple}} method to measure the tension of a {{fastener}} already in place other than to tighten it and identify {{at which point the}} fastener starts extending. This is known as re-torqueing. An electronic <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> can be used on the fastener in question, so that the torque applied can be constantly measured as it is slowly increased in magnitude.|$|E
500|$|The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less {{commonly}} used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass. The kilogram-force {{leads to an}} alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at [...] when subjected to a force of 1kgf. The kilogram-force is {{not a part of}} the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000lbf.|$|E
2500|$|Bolt preload {{can also}} be {{controlled}} by torquing the bolt {{to the point of}} yielding. Under some circumstances, a skilled operator can feel the drop off of the work required to turn the <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> as the material of the bolt begins to yield. At that point the bolt has a preload determined by the bolt area and the [...] yield strength of the bolt material. This technique can be more accurately executed by specially built machines. Because this method only works for very high preloads and requires comparatively expensive tooling, it is only commonly used for specific applications, primarily in high performance engines.|$|E

50|$|As {{with any}} {{precision}} tool, <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> should be periodically re-calibrated. As previously stated, according to ISO standards calibration should happen every 5000 operations or every year, whichever comes first.

50|$|The {{electric}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is sometimes}} confused {{with a standard}} impact wrench, because it looks similar, but it actually a totally different tool. An electric <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the hammers of an impacting wrench. This is why an electric <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> has very little vibration, and an extreme amount of repeatability and accuracy.The electric <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> was first patented in Germany in 1984 by Alkitronic.|$|E

50|$|In 1942, at {{the height}} of World War II, Bill Brodey was engaged in selling various tools and {{machines}} including Joseph Sunnen honing machines used for honing cylinder bores of engines. <b>Torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> were being imported and sold alongside of the honing machines because it was known that uneven torque tightening of engine cylinder head bolts would distort the cylinder bore. Bill and his friend Ernest Thornitt applied to the UK Ministry of Supply requesting permission to manufacture <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> in the UK. <b>Torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> were much in demand for the manufacture of Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines and the UK Government was keen to manufacture in the UK wherever possible to reduce pressure on the Atlantic supply convoys. Consequently, permission was granted to 'The North Bar Tool Company' to start manufacturing <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> in 'North Bar Place', Banbury in the United Kingdom. The address 'North Bar' gave the company its name and this was later contracted to 'Norbar'.|$|R

Because steam sterilization processes like an autoclave are applied to the dental <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> and the length of time in use presents stress on the material, fatigue can occur.|$|R

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is a {{power tool}} designed to exert torque on a fastener to achieve proper tightening or loosening of a connection {{through the use of}} hydraulics. A <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is applied to the nut either directly or in conjunction with an impact socket. Hydraulic torque wrenches apply a predetermined, controlled amount of torque to a properly lubricated fastener.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is significantly}} quieter, lighter weight and {{more accurate than}} pneumatic impact wrenches capable of similar torque output, making it an appealing alternative for many users to the very loud and cumbersome impact wrenches or torque multipliers which were formerly the only viable option for working with very large nuts and bolts until the hydraulic <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> was introduced.|$|E
