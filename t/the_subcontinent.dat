5|$|During the 1959–60 season, Australian {{undertook}} {{an arduous}} tour of <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent,</b> with three and five Tests against Pakistan and India, respectively. Prior to the trip, Harvey made 112 {{in the second}} innings to help Lindwall's XI defeat Benaud's XI by seven wickets.|$|E
5|$|His 1964–65 tour of <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent</b> on the {{way back}} to Australia was even worse, a far cry from his leading role in the {{previous}} tour to <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent.</b> After making 40 and 0 in the First Test win in Madras, he was unable to bat either innings in the Second Test in Bombay after being hospitalised due to persistent vomiting, injury as Australia ceded their series lead. He missed the remainder of the series, the Third Test in Calcutta and a one-off Test in Pakistan. Upon his return home, he has a shortened domestic season before Australia left for the West Indies. In five domestic matches, he scored 357 runs at 59.50, including a 133 not against South Australia.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} serious crop {{failures}} in the late 19th century led to widespread famines on <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent</b> {{in which it is}} estimated that over 15 million people died. The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule. Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930 s, {{reform was}} {{gradually}} legislated by the British; Congress won {{victories in the}} resulting elections. The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent</b> into India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} 2000–500 BCE, {{in terms of}} culture, many regions of <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent</b> transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age. The Vedas, the oldest scriptures {{associated}} with Hinduism, were composed during this period, and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent</b> from the north-west. The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose during this period. On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests {{the existence of a}} chiefdom stage of political organisation. In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period, as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.|$|E

50|$|Notable Modernists on <b>the</b> Indian <b>subcontinent</b> include Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817-98) and Muhammad Iqbal (1877-1938) in <b>the</b> Indian <b>subcontinent</b> (<b>the</b> {{latter was}} also the conceiver of the modern state of Pakistan). Like al-Afghani and Abduh, they {{rejected}} the doctrine of taqlid and asserted the need for Islam to be reinterpreted according to modern conditions.|$|R
5|$|The cyclone {{itself had}} minimal effects on land, but the monsoon {{advanced}} into western India in late May {{in association with}} the system. As the cyclone moved to the west away from <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent,</b> the incursion of moist air from the Arabian Sea persisted over northwestern India for the first three days of June. This brought moderate rainfall to regions of Gujarat, Rajasthan and western Madhya Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Liberal Party, Loxton entered {{politics}} and was a {{member of the}} Victorian Legislative Assembly, representing the electoral district of Prahran from 1955 to 1979. During this time, Loxton was also active in cricket administration at club, state and international level. He was a state selector for over two decades, and served at national level for ten years, starting in 1970–71. He was also the team manager for Australia's tour of <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent</b> in 1959–60, overseeing a successful campaign despite a spate of serious illnesses to personnel. Loxton had to deal with a variety of tumultuous events on and off the field during his tenure, often relating to player misconduct, and retired from cricket administration in 1981 following the underarm incident.|$|E
5|$|Among {{those who}} met with Jinnah to seek his return was Liaquat Ali Khan, who {{would be a major}} {{political}} associate of Jinnah {{in the years to come}} and the first Prime Minister of Pakistan. At Jinnah's request, Liaquat discussed the return with a large number of Muslim politicians and confirmed his recommendation to Jinnah. In early 1934, Jinnah relocated to <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent,</b> though he shuttled between London and India on business for the next few years, selling his house in Hampstead and closing his legal practice in Britain.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} Pathan {{settlers}} continued {{during the colonial}} era, mainly for purposes of trade. Difficult economic conditions in their native homelands may have prompted their migration to <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent's</b> southern regions in the 19th century.|$|R

50|$|The Sena Empire (সেন সাম্রাজ্য, Shen Shamrajjo) was a Hindu dynasty {{during the}} Late Classical period on <b>the</b> Indian <b>subcontinent,</b> that ruled from Bengal through the 11th and 12th centuries. The empire {{at its peak}} covered much of the {{north-eastern}} region of <b>the</b> Indian <b>subcontinent.</b> <b>The</b> rulers of the Sena Dynasty traced their origin to the south Indian region of Karnataka.|$|R
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent.</b> Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E
5|$|By 1761, the Maratha menace had diminished and by 1763, Haider Ali had {{captured}} the Keladi kingdom, defeated {{the rulers of}} Bilgi, Bednur and Gutti, invaded the Malabar {{in the south and}} conquered the Zamorin's capital Calicut with ease in 1766 and extended the Mysore kingdom up to Dharwad and Bellary in the north. Mysore was now a major political power in <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent</b> and Haider's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his defiance formed one of the last remaining challenges to complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinent – a challenge which would take them more than three decades to overcome.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, Jinnah {{had come}} to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, {{demanding}} a separate nation. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula for <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent</b> to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the London trip, Jinnah was in no hurry to reach an agreement, {{considering}} that time would allow him to gain the undivided provinces of Bengal and Punjab for Pakistan, but these wealthy, populous provinces had sizeable non-Muslim minorities, complicating a settlement. The Attlee ministry desired a rapid British departure from <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent,</b> but had little confidence in Wavell to achieve that end. Beginning in December 1946, British officials began looking for a viceregal successor to Wavell, and soon fixed on Admiral Lord Mountbatten of Burma, a war leader popular among Conservatives as the great-grandson of Queen Victoria and among Labour for his political views.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{was appalled}} when Britain made India {{independent}} in 1947—he {{held that the}} British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent</b> indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, a British colony in southern Africa that had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Morgan {{volunteered for}} a six-year tour of India {{and joined the}} 118th Field Battery, 26th Field Brigade, at Deepcut, where it was forming and {{training}} for service in <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent.</b> Later that year the brigade moved to its new station at Jhansi. After three years Morgan was posted to Attock, where he commanded the Divisional Ammunition Column. In 1924 he accepted a temporary staff posting as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (DAAG) of Major-General Herbert Uniacke's 1st (Peshawar) Division at Murree. This was followed in 1925 by a year's secondment to the headquarters of Lieutenant-General Sir Claud Jacob's Northern Command, where Morgan helped plan and direct large-scale manoeuvres.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's team {{arrived in}} Australia {{towards the end}} of 1945, but the armed {{services}} and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt had added the matches in <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent.</b> He implored the administrators to recognise that the players were already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|When a {{rebellion}} {{broke out in}} India in 1857, Disraeli took {{a keen interest in}} affairs, having been a member of a select committee in 1852 which considered how best to rule <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent,</b> and had proposed eliminating the governing role of the British East India Company. After peace was restored, and Palmerston in early 1858 brought in legislation for direct rule of India by the Crown, Disraeli opposed it. Many Conservative MPs refused to follow him and the bill passed the Commons easily.|$|E
5|$|With captain Johnson {{and vice}} captain Miller, the main spinner {{and one of}} the two leading fast bowlers {{retiring}} upon their return from <b>the</b> <b>subcontinent,</b> Australia moved into uncharted territory and needed younger bowlers to step up following three successive series losses to England. The 1956–57 Australian season was purely domestic and a chance for the players to stake their claims to be part of Australia's future. Davidson scored 374 runs at 34.00 including three fifties and took 30 wicket at 27.50 from eight matches. His most effective effort was a 5/65 in the second innings of the match between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI. Davidson's effort helped set up a seven-wicket triumph for Harvey's men.|$|E
