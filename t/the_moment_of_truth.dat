5|$|The Creature—an {{original}} script by Kneale {{concerning the}} legend of the abominable snowman—was his next collaboration with Cartier, broadcast on 30 January 1955, followed by an adaptation of Peter Ustinov's play <b>The</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Truth</b> (10 March 1955), before Kneale was commissioned to write Quatermass II. Specifically designed by the BBC to combat the threat of the new ITV network, which launched just a month before Quatermass II was shown, the serial was even more successful than the first, drawing audiences of up to nine million viewers. Kneale was inspired in writing the serial by contemporary fears over secret UK Ministry of Defence research establishments such as Porton Down, as well the fact that as a BBC staff writer he had been required to sign the Official Secrets Act.|$|E

25|$|Now {{differences}} between the contemporary squid and octopus samples became very clear. In the octopus, broad bands of fibers passed across {{the plane of the}} tissue and were separated by equally broad bands arranged in a perpendicular direction. In the squid there were narrower but also relatively broad bundles arranged in the plane of the section, separated by thin partitions of perpendicular fibers. It seemed I had found a means to identify the mystery sample after all. I could distinguish between octopus and squid, and between them and mammals, which display a lacy network of connective tissue fibers. After 75 years, <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> was at hand. Viewing section after section of the St. Augustine samples, we decided at once, and beyond any doubt, that the sample was not whale blubber. Further, the connective tissue pattern was that of broad bands in the plane of the section with equally broad bands arranged perpendicularly, a structure similar to, if not identical with, that in my octopus sample. The evidence appears unmistakable that the St. Augustine sea monster was in fact an octopus, but the implications are fantastic. Even though the sea presents us from time to time with strange and astonishing phenomena, the idea of a gigantic octopus, with arms 75 to 100 feet in length and about 18 inches in diameter at the base—a total spread of some 200 feet—is difficult to comprehend.|$|E

25|$|That night, Karl and Harry have a {{confrontation}} backstage, in which Karl accuses Harry of murdering Carol; Harry angrily rejects the accusation and challenges that Karl merely finds {{it easier to}} believe that rather than accept the guilt of betraying his best friend. On stage, Karl begins to pioneer his psychic act, but the stooge he has hired in the crowd which he had chosen with a fake random ball toss, accidentally trips and concusses himself on the stage. Upon hearing the sad story of another selected audience member, he decides that he cannot perpetuate the fraud, admitting to the audience {{that he is not}} able to contact the dead. As a result, Dani forgives him. Harry, as 'The Black Widower', starts his guillotine act, but at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> Linda's nerve fails her and she flees the stage. Although Harry’s act would appear to be ruined when he asks if anybody else wants to try, Karl steps forward and announces that he will face the guillotine instead. Karl allows himself to be locked in the guillotine, explaining that Carol was frequently unfaithful and forced Karl to have sex with her. Harry appears to decapitate Karl – although it is merely an illusion, and Karl appears unharmed, the trick having worked perfectly. Harry wins the competition, and in his acceptance speech both forgives Karl and admits that he loves Linda, who joins him on stage and the two kiss. Their friendship mended, Karl and Harry embark on a reunion tour, incorporating Dani and Linda into the act as their assistants.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> for {{the film}} came {{when it opened in}} New York City on October 21, 1983. Carradine had {{discussed}} Americana with film critic Kirk Honeycutt. Upon hearing of Carradine's death in 2009, Honeycutt recalled the discussion, remembering that he was [...] "most impressed." [...] He explained, [...] "I got an assignment from The New York Times to do a profile on Carradine the filmmaker". Honeycutt's profile was planned to coincide with the film's opening at the Embassy 72d Street theater and the East Side Cinema, in New York City. Carradine commented that {{when he arrived at the}} premiere to promote the film, he noticed that the poster and advertisement that he had made for the occasion had been replaced with [...] "inferior ones". He also said that the film received standing ovations at both venues.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} Quatermass serials, Cartier and Kneale collaborated on several one-off dramas, {{including}} literary and theatrical adaptations of Wuthering Heights (6 December 1953) and <b>The</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Truth</b> (10 March 1955), {{as well as}} Kneale's own The Creature (30 January 1955). Of particular note was their collaboration on an adaptation of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, originally broadcast on 12 December 1954, regarded as Cartier's most famous work. The Timess review the day after its broadcast noted its [...] "vividness... the two minutes' hate was, for instance, a wonderfully riotious orgy of vindictiveness." [...] The production also attracted considerable controversy. There were questions asked in the House of Commons concerning some of the graphic scenes of horror in the play, and the BBC received several telephone calls threatening Cartier's life if the second live performance, scheduled for 16 December, went ahead. The BBC took these threats seriously enough to assign him bodyguards. Cartier appeared live on television himself to defend the production in a studio debate, and eventually the Board of Governors of the BBC voted that the second performance should go ahead as planned. The production had by this time received {{the backing of the}} Duke of Edinburgh, who commented during a speech to the Royal Society of Arts that he and the Queen had watched and enjoyed the first performance.|$|E

Most of {{previous research has}} been conducted in banks, restaurants and hotels but none of those were from educational context. There has been keen interest in customer recovery satisfaction recently. During the service encounter, customers witnessed the dyadic interactions and experienced <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>The</b> parties involved are customers, service providers, the physical environment of the service organization and the failure atonement. Despite the best efforts made by the service firms, service failures are inevitable. When service fails, the dissatisfied customers defect to competitors thereby firms loses business, suffer bad word of mouth and grudges. Service firms should recover. It was hypothesized that communications, explanation, feedback, empowerment, tangible, speed and atonement would influence customer recovery satisfaction. It was also hypothesized that organizational climate would moderate the relationship. Data for the study was collected from randomly sampled 103 post-graduate students in a public university in Malaysia using structured questionnaire. Analysis showed that tangible, communication, feedback, and atonement, have positive significant relationship with customer retention as they were enhanced by the organizational climate, as much as, 14. 7 %, 14. 5 %, 15 % and 15. 7 % respectively.
