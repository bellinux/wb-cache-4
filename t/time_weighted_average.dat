The Canadian Centre for Occupation Safety and Health reports that: [...] "Even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure. Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations." [...] To protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 μmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour <b>time</b> <b>weighted</b> <b>average.</b> Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and NIOSH has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 μmol/mol.

2500|$|Ozone {{offers many}} {{advantages}} as a sterilant gas; ozone {{is a very}} efficient sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties (E = 2.076 vs SHE) capable of destroying {{a wide range of}} pathogens, including prions without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the sterilizer from medical grade oxygen. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH immediately dangerous to life and health limit for ozone is [...] smaller than the [...] IDLH for ethylene oxide.

2500|$|Drawbacks of {{hydrogen}} peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing nylon may become brittle. [...] The penetrating ability {{of hydrogen}} peroxide {{is not as}} good as ethylene oxide and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of lumens that can be effectively sterilized and guidance is available from the sterilizer manufacturers. Hydrogen peroxide is primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause bleaching or ulceration depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (> 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Level (IDLH) at 75 ppm, less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0 ppm, calculated as an 8-hour <b>time</b> <b>weighted</b> <b>average.</b> Sterilizer manufacturers {{go to great lengths to}} make their products safe through careful design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas sterilizers are documented in the FDA MAUDE database.

An individual transaction share {{price of a}} specific firm is subject to market microstructure noise. Therefore, we propose trading duration <b>time</b> <b>weighted</b> <b>averages</b> over given <b>time</b> intervals. Averages over long intervals lead to a coarse resolution and averaging over shorter intervals lead to a finer resolution. Arranging sub-intervals of given lengths on scales with coarse to fine resolution imply a structure which can be represented as a directed acyclic graph. Time series models are then formulated using this graph structure. It is shown that these models have a linear state space representation which allows for efficient computation of the likelihood needed in parameter estimation and for a straightforward treatment of missing observations. Application of these models to the log transaction prices of the IBM shares traded at the New York Stock Exchange from February until October 2002 show that the corresponding one-step prediction errors are heavy tailed and therefore a specific variance term is allowed to follow a fiEGARCH specification, improving the tail behavior and leading to a better fit. ...|$|R

However, current trends to reduce greenhouse gas effects have prompted the need for alternative techniques, such as passive sampling. In this research passive sampling {{techniques have}} been used to demonstrate the potential to fulfil these requirements by using solutions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibres. These passive sampling techniques have been calibrated against tracer gas decay techniques and measurements from a standard orifice plate. Two constant sources of volatile organic compounds were diffused into two sections of a humidity chamber and sampled using SPME fibres. From a total of four SPME fibres (two in each section), reproducible results were obtained. Emission rates and air movement from one section to the other were predicted using developed algorithms. Comparison of the SPME fibre technique with that of the tracer gas technique and measurements from an orifice plate showed similar results with good precision and accuracy.

METHODS [...] All the 163 workers received a detailed physical and neurological evaluation. Fixed point air samples were analysed for CS 2. Nerve conduction velocity was studied in 26 workers with symptoms similar to neuropathy. RESULTS [...] Nine workers (53 %) with overt polyneuropathy from the fibre cutting department and 19 workers (13 %) with oligosymptoms similar to polyneuropathy from various jobs were noted. The fixed point air concentrations of CS 2 were 150 - 300 ppm in the cutting areas and 15 to 100 ppm in the spinning areas. The estimated eight hour <b>time</b> <b>weighted</b> <b>averages</b> in the fibre cutting areas were 40 - 67 ppm. The occurrence of polyneuropathy was generally correlated with the degree of exposure to CS 2. Nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) were significantly different in the overt polyneuropathy and subclinical polyneuropathy groups from the normal controls. The sensitive indicators for CS 2 polyneuropathy were distal latency, motor NCV, and amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials in sensory NCVs. CONCLUSION [...] The outbreak of polyneuropathy was attributed to higher concentrations of CS 2 in fibre cutting areas. Even in other jobs with relatively lower concentrations of CS 2, the hazard of subclinical polyneuropathy cannot be overlooked...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the analgesic efficacy of intra-articular injection of magnesium sulphate (4 %) compared with equivalent volume of bupivacaine (0. 5 %) after outpatient knee arthroscopic meniscectomy. Forty patients {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups. Group M (n= 20) received intra-articular magnesium sulphate 4 %, group B (n= 20) received bupivacaine (0. 5 %). Analgesic effect was evaluated by analgesic duration, and by measuring pain intensity at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 h both at rest and on knee movement to 90 °. The primary outcome variable was pain intensity on the VAS at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 h post arthroscopy at rest and on movement (flexion of knee to 90 °), although the magnesium group had lower <b>time</b> <b>weighted</b> <b>averages</b> (TWAs) at rest and on movement, these TWAs were not statistically significant. The median duration of postoperative analgesia was significantly longer in the patients treated with magnesium sulphate (528 min) than in the bupivacaine group (317 min) (p< 0. 0001), with less number of patients needing supplementary analgesia in magnesium group (8 / 20) than those of the bupivacaine group (16 / 20) (p< 0. 022). Also analgesic consumption was significantly lower in the magnesium sulphate group (p< 0. 002). We concluded that the use of magnesium sulphate is rational and effective in reducing pain, and is more physiological and shortens convalescence after outpatient arthroscopic meniscectomy, however our hypotheses that analgesic efficacy of intra-articular isotonic magnesium sulphate would be superior to intra-articular local anaesthetic cannot be supported with this study...|$|R

Exposure of male animals by various routes caused testicular atrophy and microscopic changes, abnormal spermhead morphology, infertility and death. Neither compound affected female fertility when exposure was several weeks prior to mating. Alterations in behavioral test responses and brain neurochemical levels were seen in newborn and 3 week old offspring of dams exposed to 2 EE during pregnancy. No mutagenicity was found for either compound when tested in several strains of Salmonella-typhimurium, with or without mammalian liver S 9 supernatant.
