5|$|The 63rd Guard Fighter Aviation Corps began combat {{trials of}} the La-7 in mid-September 1944 {{in support of the}} 1st Baltic Front. Thirty {{aircraft}} were provided for <b>the</b> <b>trials,</b> which lasted one month. During this time the new fighters made 462 individual sorties and claimed 55 aerial victories while losing four aircraft in combat. Four other La-7s were lost to non-combat causes, mostly related to engine problems. A total of three pilots were killed during <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> to all causes.|$|E
5|$|The British {{held two}} major trials against the top German war criminals who had perpetrated crimes during the Italian campaign. For {{political}} reasons {{it was decided}} to hold <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> in Italy, but a request by Italy to allow an Italian judge to participate was denied on the grounds that Italy was not an Allied country. <b>The</b> <b>trials</b> were held under the Royal Warrant of 18 June 1945, thus under British Military Law. The decision put <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> on a shaky legal basis, as foreign nationals were being tried for crimes against foreigners in a foreign country. The first trial, held in Rome, was of Mackensen and Mälzer for their part in the Ardeatine massacre. Both were sentenced to death on 30 November 1946.|$|E

5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet {{in children and}} young people with epilepsy, as well as six prospective and five retrospective studies. <b>The</b> <b>trials</b> were done among {{children and young people}} for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and only one of <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

During this trial Servetus was convicted of heresy and was burned in effigy, since he had escaped.

40|$|This Thesis {{is focused}} on the most {{important}} phase of criminal proceedings, <b>the</b> <b>trial.</b> <b>The</b> aim of this thesis is to form theoretical and practical analysis of the legal regulation of <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and also to take into consideration the conclusions of the jurisprudence and the foundations of the new Czech Criminal Procedure Code. The Thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter deals with the fundamental principles of criminal proceedings and their mutual relations. These principles represent foundation upon which the whole criminal proceedings including <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> are based. <b>The</b> application of these principles is not absolute and the Czech Criminal Proceedings Code regulates many exceptions. The second chapter describes the preparation of <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and is about the delivery of criminal charge, notice to appear in court, the presence of persons on <b>trial,</b> <b>the</b> order of <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> measures related to the preparation of <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and other decisions. The third chapter describes the course of <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and is divided into three subchapters, the initiation of <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> <b>the</b> process of evidence and the conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>trial.</b> In <b>the</b> context of evidence, attention is given to hearings of the accused, witness, expert and to expert opinions, material and documentary evidence.

5|$|Construction was {{slowed by}} {{industrial}} action after the war, and was suspended on 21October 1919 as Chile wanted to repurchase {{the ship and}} have it re-converted to a battleship. The £2.5 million cost of doing so would have been higher than the £1.5 million offered by the Chileans and the Admiralty decided to retain the ship. The Royal Navy needed to carry out flying trials with a carrier fitted with an island, and the Admiralty approved the use of Eagle on 11 November. Armstrong Whitworth plated over the openings for the undelivered elevators on the flight deck (which had been cancelled when they could not meet the specifications), finished the rear funnel, removed the torpedo tubes, and plated over the forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to the Royal dockyard at Portsmouth for the modifications necessary for <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> on 20April 1920.
