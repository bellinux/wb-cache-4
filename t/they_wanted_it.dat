5|$|By the 1950s, Roosevelt's {{international}} role as {{spokesperson for}} women {{led her to}} stop publicly criticizing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), although she never supported it. In the early 1960s, she announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA {{was no longer a}} threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that they could have the amendment if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it.</b> In 1961, President Kennedy's undersecretary of labor, Esther Peterson proposed a new Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. Kennedy appointed Roosevelt to chair the commission, with Peterson as director. This was Roosevelt's last public position. She died just before the commission issued its report. It concluded that female equality was best achieved by recognition of gender differences and needs, and not by an Equal Rights Amendment.|$|E

They wanted a program that would encourage the young man to continue along the trail to Eagle, but one that would also encourage “bigger” and more challenging activities. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be Scouting, but a version that would be viewed {{to be different from}} traditional Scouting. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be more advanced, one that would hold the interest of a young man entering High School, a more “Senior” version of Scouting.|$|E

25|$|A new Latina group, called Soluna, {{had just}} lost a member and {{was looking for a}} replacement. T Lopez quickly auditioned, and was whisked away on tour. T Lopez {{explained}} that touring with Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias was a crazy roller coaster ride for her because everything happened so fast. But she had a great time, T Lopez said. Latina group Soluna released their 2002 debut album, For All Time, under the Dreamworks Records label. Paramount and UPN quickly took interest in the group and developed a TV pilot based on their lives, co-starring Mario Lopez & Tony Plana. After filming the pilot, Soluna reconvened for a second album but realized they had grown apart musically. The group said that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to work so bad that they were forcing it and they finally just gave up and wished each other well in their individual journeys.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{sources have}} {{influenced}} Suda, from literature to games to {{foreign and domestic}} films and television. His favorite author is Franz Kafka, a German language author who focused {{on a combination of}} mundane and surreal scenarios. Suda's liking of Kafka was originally expressed in Kurayami, an in-development title based on The Castle, with a focus on nighttime combat and survival. The concept changed drastically at the insistence of Electronic Arts as <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> tailored for Western audiences, and the project evolved into Shadows of the Damned. Suda and Mikami both disliked the end product due to the publisher's creative interference, with Mikami in particular saying that Shadows of the Damneds final form broke Suda's heart. Numerous films have inspired elements of Suda's work on The Silver Case, Killer7 and the No More Heroes games. When creating Lollipop Chainsaw, Suda used the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer to flesh out his initial concept. Popular culture have also played a part in Suda's work, with several characters in his games being named after or being homages to sports people or pop singers.|$|E

500|$|Gough and Miller were so {{passionate about}} the pilot that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> {{released}} in some form so the fans could see it.

There were three different iterations of the cover art, with major changes made to the game's protagonist throughout its development, as the studio struggled with the protagonist's portrayal. Insomniac was ultimately satisfied with Ilovedust's finished art design.|$|E

The producers felt it was important to address that they are an interracial couple, and that Hurley was saying what the audience would be thinking. Caldwell agreed with them and thought it would be odd if the issue was not addressed. Anderson also was glad that Hurley brought up the issue, and liked that Jack did not pay any attention.|$|E

500|$|The writing {{staff was}} {{looking for a way to}} end the episode and {{executive}} producer Sam Simon suggested that they watch the film The Quiet Man. The writers came in on a Saturday to watch the film together. They were inspired by the film's fight scene between John Wayne and Victor McLaglen's characters to do a fight scene between Homer and Tom in the episode. The scene was difficult for the producers to sound-mix because <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be funny but not horrifying. They discovered that the more realistic the effects used sounded, the funnier the scene became. The producers tried all sorts of different sounds for when Homer cracks his back on the fire hydrant and chose the tiniest realistic sound, because they believed that it was the most painful and [...] "hilarious".|$|E

Norton dismissed this, [...] "Our healthy process , which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted {{to such a degree that}} it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen. It has always been my firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too much about how they are made diminishes the magic of watching them." ...|$|E

Partington elaborated: [...] "We really wanted it to feel, not sad and somber really but just kind of have a broody feeling." [...] McMahon and Partington wrote songs separately. Partington had written six songs on the album before entering the studio. While touring Europe, the US went to war in Iraq. According to Partington, the group did not [...] "want to be playing a show when there's something so much more important going on." [...] As a result, the band cancelled {{the remainder of the}} tour, and returned to the US. Partington recalled that he and McMahon did [...] "a lot of writing" [...] together, and were [...] "really happy with the songs we had" [...] going into the studio.|$|E

500|$|By 1972, Deep Purple had {{achieved}} considerable commercial success in Japan, including several hit singles, so {{it made sense}} to tour there. Three dates were booked; the Festival Hall, Osaka on 11 and 12 May, and the Budokan, Tokyo on 16 August, though these were later changed to the 15 and 16 August, and 17 August respectively due to an earlier US tour being rescheduled. The dates sold out almost immediately, and consequently the Japanese arm of the band's label, Warner Bros. Records, wanted to record the tour for a live album to be released in the country. The band eventually agreed to the idea, but insisted {{if it was going to}} be released, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be done properly. Gillan recalled, [...] "we said we would have to OK the equipment, we wanted to use our own engineer and we would have the last say on whether the tapes were released". The band enlisted producer Martin Birch, who had worked on previous studio albums, to record the shows onto an 8-track recorder so they could subsequently be mixed.|$|E
500|$|The {{field of}} 34 drivers {{was the biggest}} in an IndyCar series race in 14 years.

ESPN.com senior motorsports writer Terry Blount wrote: [...] "Obviously more cars presents more danger.

Some of the people that were driving in this event yesterday had no business being in it. Some of them had never driven on a track like this. That was a mistake". Chris Powell, president of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, defended the race, saying that the circuit had passed all of the IndyCar Series' accreditation procedures and was deemed suitable for racing. He also went on the record to say that despite the media reporting the concerns of several drivers over the safety of the event, none of those concerns had been raised with him.|$|E
