This fungus {{has been investigated}} {{for use in the}} production of single cell oils (SCO) and storage lipids (like GLA). C. echinulata is also able to selectively take up and sequester metal contaminants from polluted waters, suggesting a potential use in bioremediation of polluted water. However, its role as an agent of opportunistic disease may limit its use in environmental remediation.Cunninghamella echinulata is able to grow on orange rind and assimilate carbohydrates into necessary biomolecules, where the fermented peel does not exhibit appreciable discolouration or odour. Growth of this fungus on organic nitrogen leads yields lipids rich in γ-linolenic acid (GLA). The presence of an active monooxygenase system allows this species to perform oxidative demethylation and hydroxylation. The fungus possesses a p450 cytochrome system similar to that in humans, making it a potentially useful model for the study liver-mediated drug metabolism.|$|E

40|$|Comprehensive {{hyphenated}} two-dimensional {{liquid chromatography}} mass spectrometry (LC×LC-MS) {{is a very}} powerful analytical tool achieving high throughput resolution of highly complex natural samples. However, even using this approach there is still the possibility of not resolving some of the analytes of interest. For instance, <b>triacylglycerols</b> (<b>TAGs)</b> structural isomers in oil samples are extremely difficult to separate chromatographically due to their very similar structure and chemical properties. Traditional approaches based on current vendor chromatographic software cannot distinguish these isomers from their different mass spectral features.

First, the experimental LC×LC-MS data structure is discussed, and results achieved by different methods based on the fulfilment of the trilinear model are compared. Then, the step-by-step resolution and identification of strongly coeluted compounds from different examples of <b>triacylglycerols</b> (<b>TAGs)</b> structural isomers in corn oil samples are described.

Phospholipase A 2 or C exerted its activity on oil bodies only after the exposed portion of oleosins had been removed by trypsin.
