5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue.</b> The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E

The Prime Minister was initially inclined to take the pro-nuclear side, in the meantime {{he did not want}} to risk dividing the party over <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue.</b> The Social Democrats, who kept losing their electorate, had to build a coalition with the adamantly anti-nuclear Communists.

This gave way to alarm when that country refused to allow full inspection of nuclear sites. In November 1993 North Korea demanded that the United States and South Korea cancel a planned joint training exercise as a precondition during discussions on <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue.</b> Aspin rejected this demand and announced that the United States would suspend plans to withdraw its troops gradually from the peninsula.|$|E
25|$|The author {{analyzes}} the strategies {{available to the}} U.S. {{to deal with the}} Iran nuclear situation both diplomatically and militarily, and argues combat would not be feasible. Nance warns that war with Iran in order to potentially limit their nuclear capabilities would lead to financial ruin in America, retaliatory strikes against Israel, increased oil values, conflict by Iran with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and closure of shipping lanes for oil. Nance acknowledges that Iran contributes significantly to supporting terrorists activities around the planet, {{but at the same time}} argues that a peaceful resolution to <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue</b> with the country is worthy of seeing if it can come to fruition.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Ahmadinejad's vocal {{support for}} the program, {{the office of the}} Iranian {{president}} is not directly responsible for nuclear policy.

For a decade, what some people criticized as the former government's controversial and endless handing out of massive aid to North Korea, {{in the name of the}} [...] "National Coexistence, Independence," [...] failed to effectuate change in the North. The former government neglected the discussion on <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue</b> with the North during the summit twice, and struck a mass aid deal without any sort of social consensus and examination on the ways and means of the funding, which some say created an unnecessary burden to the Korean people.|$|E

In terms of security governance, the European Union (EU) has created a format for negotiations, which has undergone subsequent enlargements, consistent with its securitised but multilateral discourses.

2500|$|In government, Huhne {{maintained}} a flexible approach {{on the subject}} of nuclear energy, advocating the three-pronged portfolio approach to energy: a commitment to nuclear energy; the development of more renewable energy, such as wind and sea power; and new carbon-capture technology to mitigate the damaging environmental effects of fossil fuel-fired power plants and industrial facilities. In an interview with The Observer in March 2011, after the Fukushima disaster in Japan, Huhne stated that: [...] "there are a lot of issues outside of the realm of nuclear safety, which we will have to assess.
