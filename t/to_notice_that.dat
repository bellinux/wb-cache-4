5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} moved into dark skies, {{and although it}} faded as it receded from the Sun it remained {{one of the most}} prominent objects in the sky. On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E. Barnard, began <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the comet's nucleus was elongated and broken into two pronounced bright balls of light, and by 17 October it was clear that it had broken into at least five fragments. Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E
5|$|Facts were {{overwhelmed}} with sound, passion substituted for arithmetic, moral indignation pumped {{up to the}} bursting point. But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election... and many listeners undoubtedly failed <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> he was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E

5|$|On January 13, 1982, a train derailed at a {{malfunctioning}} crossover switch {{south of}} the Federal Triangle station. In attempting to restore the train to the rails, supervisors failed <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> another car had also derailed. The other rail car slid off the track and hit a tunnel support, killing three people and injuring 25. Coincidentally, this crash occurred about 30 minutes after Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the nearby 14th Street Bridge during a major snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|In 1935–36, he {{continued}} as a fixture at outside-left, but scored fewer goals. {{one of which}} came as an equaliser against Lincoln City when the referee failed <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> teammate Johnny Wigham punched the ball to him rather than playing it legitimately. All the same, three months into the season he was the team's top scorer with six. As in the previous season, Hartlepools played Halifax Town in the FA Cup, and again, they won after a replay; Bonass was involved in three of their four goals, two of which were scored when his shot was parried to another player. He finished the season with 13 goals, second only to Wigham, as Hartlepools finished eighth in the Third Division.|$|E
5|$|In late 2001, the Hardy Boyz began a storyline {{in which}} they were feuding with one another. Lita {{refereed}} a match between them at Vengeance on December 9. Jeff won the match with a scripted finish that had Lita failing <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> Matt had placed his leg on the rope during Jeff's successful pin attempt. Continuing the storyline on the following episode of Raw, Matt defeated Lita and Jeff in a handicap match, shortly after informing Lita that both their relationship and the Hardy Boyz were finished. On the December 17 episode of Raw, both Jeff and Lita were sidelined with storyline injuries following a title match between Jeff and WWF Hardcore Champion The Undertaker. The injuring of both his brother and ex-girlfriend led to a reconciliation between the members of Team Xtreme, and on the December 20 episode of SmackDown!, Matt faced The Undertaker but was also injured. All three members of Team Xtreme were then removed from WWF television for several weeks.|$|E

5|$|Nina enrolls at Erinsborough High {{after her}} school work suffers {{because she has}} been {{travelling}} the world with her parents, Nick and Trixie. Nina is shy and concealed {{as a result of}} her neglect by her parents. Nina takes up two jobs at the Coffee Shop and at Lassiter's Hotel. The residents of Ramsay Street begin <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> she is shy and has low self-esteem. One night, Harold Bishop hears Nina singing and realises that she is good, but Nina disagrees. Harold manages to convince Nina to join the church choir, and she is asked to perform a solo, but her nerves get to her and is not able to go through with their performance. Connor O'Neill also overhears Nina singing one day and becomes close with her, as he is the only teenager who knows about her talent.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> while an absolute ruler, Ulmanis {{did not allow}} any physical violence or unlawful acts towards minorities and dealt harshly with right and left wing extremists, and with both Nazi and Communist sympathizers. Between 1920 and 1939, many Jews escaping Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany found refuge in Latvia.|$|E

25|$|In December 2012, {{the crash}} {{investigation}} {{determined that the}} plane's terrain warning system had been functioning correctly and had warned the pilots about the collision course with the mountain. The pilots, however, turned the system off, suspecting it to have malfunctioned. Due to being distracted by conversation on the flight deck, unrelated to flying the plane, they failed <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the plane was in danger.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{computer}} programs {{are available to}} help in analyzing qualitative data. The capacity of computers to effectively sort, store and retrieve information makes their use in qualitative data analysis appealing. However, it is important <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> computers can only aid {{in some parts of}} analysis; computer software do not code data or replace the conceptual processes. It cannot analyse qualitative data for the researcher.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that the}} damping of the {{response}} is set by ρ, that is, by the time constants of the open-loop amplifier. In contrast, the frequency of oscillation is set by μ, that is, by the feedback parameter through βA0. Because ρ is a sum of reciprocals of time constants, it is interesting <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> ρ {{is dominated by the}} shorter of the two.|$|E

25|$|Generally, the simplest, though invalid, counterexamples {{attempt to}} create one region which touches all other regions. This forces the {{remaining}} regions to be colored with only three colors. Because the four color theorem is true, this is always possible; however, because the person drawing the map {{is focused on the}} one large region, they fail <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the remaining regions can in fact be colored with three colors.|$|E
25|$|Wacław Sierpiński {{described}} the Sierpinski triangle in 1915. However, similar patterns appear {{already in the}} 13th-century Cosmati mosaics in the cathedral of Anagni, Italy, and other places of central Italy, for carpets in many places such as the nave of the Roman Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and for isolated triangles positioned in rotae in several churches and Basiliche. In {{the case of the}} isolated triangle, it is interesting <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the iteration is at least of three levels.|$|E

The presence of other sacral monuments in the vicinity of the necropolis is in any case suggested by the finding of typical quoins employed in the construction of sacred wells.|$|E
