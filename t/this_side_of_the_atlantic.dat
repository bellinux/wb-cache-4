60|$|Both, it seemed, had {{met with}} {{flattering}} receptions, though they had appeared nervous. The Russian general especially, whose style, said the critic, was somewhat reminiscent of Mr. T. E. Dunville, had made himself a great favourite with the gallery. The report concluded by calling attention once more {{to the fact that}} the salaries paid to the two--eight hundred and seventy-five pounds a week each--established a record in music-hall history on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis not {{absolutely}} {{necessary to be}} an American by birth," [...] he said, [...] "as I have already had occasion to observe, {{in order to understand}} the institutions of the country, and I might possibly mislead you were you to fancy that a native was your instructer. I have often been in the country, however, if not born in it, and few young men, on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> have had their attention pointed, with so much earnestness, to all that affects it as myself." ...|$|E

[...] "And the work upon it cannot to-day be excelled by any sculptors on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> How {{beautiful}} are those three doves, and how natural that wreath! Examine the piece for yourselves, ladies and gentlemen. It is genuine Italian marble, and will not go to pieces in your hands. There you are, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Unhappily,” {{the young}} officer said gloomily, “the ideas of honour on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> differ {{materially}} {{from those in}} the old country. It has been so ever since we set foot in this country. Acts of treachery have been performed by men who at home would shrink from any deed that savoured of dishonour; and although even here one Spaniard would not transgress the code towards another, there are too many who feel no scruples whatever as to any course that they may pursue towards one of another race and another religion.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Brissot is not {{generally}} {{looked upon as}} a [...] "martyr" [...] on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> nor was he allowed to enjoy his [...] "troubled sleep" [...] too long after his fellow-citizens (especially the great and sea-green Incorruptible) had begun in their fraternal fashion to thirst for his blood; but we can easily believe that during those dark days in the Bastille the image and vision of the beautiful river {{thousands of miles away}} was more to him than all his varied stores of knowledge, all his schemes for the benefit of suffering humanity, and perhaps even a better consolation than his philosophy.|$|E

60|$|Whatever may {{be thought}} of this {{reasoning}} on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> and at the present day, it was considered very satisfactory in England two or three centuries ago. The true and proper jurisdiction of an English monarch, as it had existed from ancient times, was considered as an absolute right, vesting in each successive inheritor of the crown, and which the community could not justly interfere with or disturb for any reasons less imperious than such as would authorize an interference with the right of succession to private property. Indeed, it is probable that, with most men at that time, an inherited right to govern was regarded as the most sacred of the two.|$|E

"I don't {{know that}} it quite means what Oxford does to you, but it's {{something}} of the kind; you might have seen the fine buildings {{at the foot of}} the mountain, if you had stayed in Montreal. Then we have Toronto; with deference to the Toronto men, I'll compare that to Cambridge. Still, so far as I understand your English ideas, there's a difference--our boys go to McGill or Toronto with the intention of learning something that will open up a career. They certainly play football and one or two other games pretty well, but that's a very secondary object; so's the acquiring of a polished style. In fact, it's not altogether unusual on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to find university men spending a vacation as waiters in the summer hotels." ...|$|E
60|$|The most extravagantly praised versifier of the age, and {{the first}} to win a {{reputation}} in England as well as in America, was Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672), who wrote a book of poems that a London publisher proudly issued under the title of The Tenth Muse (1650). The best of Colonial poets was Thomas Godfrey of Philadelphia (1736-1763), whose Juvenile Poems, with the Prince of Parthia, a Tragedy contained a few lyrics, odes and pastorals that were different in form and spirit from anything hitherto attempted on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> This slender volume was published in 1765, soon after Godfrey's untimely death. With its evident love of beauty and its carefulness of poetic form, it marks the beginning here of artistic literature; that is, literature which was written to please readers rather than to teach history or moral lessons.|$|E

60|$|Alas! {{that the}} great genius who {{described}} the battle of Waterloo is not alive to-day and on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> for a subject worthy of his pen is at hand,--nothing less than that convention of conventions at which the Honourable Humphrey Crewe of Leith {{is one of the}} candidates. One of the candidates, indeed! Will it not be known, {{as long as there are}} pensions, and a governor and a state-house and a seal and State sovereignty and a staff, as the Crewe Convention? How charge after charge was made during the long, hot day and into the night; how the delegates were carried out limp and speechless and starved and wet through, and carried in to vote again,--will all be told in time. But let us begin at the beginning, which is the day before.|$|E
60|$|DEAR SCOTT,--Among various gifts which I have {{received}} from you, tangible and intangible, was {{a copy of}} the original quarto edition of Whitman's Leaves of Grass, which you presented to me soon after its first appearance in 1855. At a time when few people on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> had looked into the book, and still fewer had found in it anything save matter for ridicule, you had appraised it, and seen that its value was real and great. A true poet and a strong thinker like yourself was indeed likely to see that. I read the book eagerly, and perceived that its substantiality and power were still ahead of any eulogium with which it might have come commended to me--and, in fact, ahead of most attempts that could be made at verbal definition of them.|$|E
6000|$|But {{we should}} not wish our readers to think that Ram Spudd is always and only the contemplative poet of the softer aspects of nature. Oh, by no means. There are times when waves of passion sweep over him in such prodigious volume as to roll him to and fro like a pebble in the surf. Gusts of emotion blow over him with such {{violence}} as to hurl him pro and con with inconceivable fury. In such moods, {{if it were not}} for the relief offered by writing verse we really do not know what would happen to him. His verse written under the impulse of such emotions marks him as one of the greatest masters of passion, wild and yet restrained, objectionable and yet printable, that have appeared on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> We append herewith a portion, or half portion, of his little gem entitled ...|$|E

6000|$|His Indian repute had not preceded him to such {{degree as}} to make the way easy for him through the London crowd. But after a {{somewhat}} dreary winter, during {{which he had been}} making acquaintances and had found irregular employment upon newspapers and magazines, arrangements were made with Messrs. Macmillan & Co. for the publication of an edition of [...] "Plain Tales from the Hills." [...] The book appeared in June. Its success was immediate. It was republished at once in America, and was welcomed as warmly on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> as on the other. The reprint of Kipling's other Indian stories and of his [...] "Departmental Ditties" [...] speedily followed, together with the new tales and poems which showed the wide range of his creative genius. Each volume was a fresh success; each extended the circle of Mr. Kipling's readers, till now he is the most widely known of English authors.|$|E
60|$|In {{our private}} room the cloth could not, for any earthly consideration, {{have been laid}} for dinner without a huge glass dish of {{cranberries}} {{in the middle of}} the table; and breakfast would have been no breakfast unless the principal dish were a deformed beef- steak with a great flat bone in the centre, swimming in hot butter, and sprinkled with the very blackest of all possible pepper. Our bedroom was spacious and airy, but (like every bedroom on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic)</b> very bare of furniture, having no curtains to the French bedstead or to the window. It had one unusual luxury, however, in the shape of a wardrobe of painted wood, something smaller than an English watch-box; or if this comparison should be insufficient to convey a just idea of its dimensions, they may be estimated from the fact of my having lived for fourteen days and nights in the firm belief that it was a shower-bath.|$|E
6000|$|The atrocities constituting this [...] "cold collation" [...] of diabolisms {{are taken}} mainly from various Californian journals.

In the pursuit of my design I think I have killed a good many people in one way and another; but the reader will please to observe that they were not people worth the trouble of leaving alive. Besides, I had the interests of my collaborator to consult. In writing, as in compiling, I have been ably assisted by my scholarly friend Mr. Satan; and to this worthy gentleman must be attributed most of the views herein set forth. While the plan of the work is partly my own, its spirit is wholly his; and this illustrates the ascendancy of the creative over the merely imitative mind.
