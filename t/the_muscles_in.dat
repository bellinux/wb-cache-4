5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter muscles in the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial muscles in the epidermis, but most of <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, {{as well as the}} arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle mass in the legs, particularly at the ankles. To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He found a few similarities between <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less muscle mass in the ankles but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E

In some people, myoclonic jerks occur in only a part of the body, such as the legs, with all <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> that part being involved in each jerk.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to hyperbaric oxygen on the oxidative capacity of <b>the</b> skeletal <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> mice at different ages were investigated. We exposed 5 -, 34 -, 55 -, and 88 -week-old mice to 36 % oxygen at 950 [*]mmHg for 6 hours per day for 2 weeks. The activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is a mitochondrial marker enzyme, of <b>the</b> tibialis anterior <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> hyperbaric mice were compared with those in age-matched mice under normobaric conditions (21 % oxygen at 760 [*]mmHg). Furthermore, the SDH activities of type IIA and type IIB fibers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> were determined using quantitative histochemical analysis. The SDH activity of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> normobaric mice decreased with age. Similar results were observed in both type IIA and type IIB fibers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle.</b> <b>The</b> decrease <b>in</b> the SDH activity of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> was reduced <b>in</b> hyperbaric mice at 57 and 90 weeks. The decreased SDH activities of type IIA and type IIB fibers were reduced in hyperbaric mice at 90 weeks and at 57 and 90 weeks, respectively. We conclude that exposure to hyperbaric oxygen {{used in this study}} reduces the age-related decrease in the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscles...|$|R
50|$|Alverine {{is a drug}} {{used for}} {{functional}} gastrointestinal disorders. Alverine is a smooth muscle relaxant. Smooth muscle {{is a type of}} muscle that is not under voluntary control; it is <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> present <b>in</b> places such as the gut and uterus. Alverine acts directly on <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gut, causing it to relax. This prevents <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> spasms which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Diverticular disease is a condition in which small pouches form in the gut lining. These pouches can trap particles of food and become inflamed and painful. In irritable bowel syndrome, the normal activity of <b>the</b> gut <b>muscle</b> is lost. <b>The</b> <b>muscle</b> spasms result <b>in</b> symptoms such as heartburn, abdominal pain and bloating, constipation or diarrhoea. By relaxing <b>the</b> gut <b>muscle,</b> alverine citrate relieves the symptoms of this condition. Alverine also relaxes <b>the</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> womb (uterus). It is therefore also used to treat painful menstruation, which is caused by <b>muscle</b> spasms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> uterus (dysmenorrhea).|$|R
25|$|In {{the higher}} groups with two {{functional}} pairs of wings, both pairs are linked together mechanically in various ways, and {{function as a}} single wing, although {{this is not true}} in the more primitive groups. There are also exceptions to be found among the more advanced Neoptera; the ghost moth is able to unlock its pair of wings and move them independently, allowing them to hover like dragonflies. What all Neoptera share, however, is the way <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the thorax work: these muscles, rather than attaching to the wings, attach to the thorax and deform it; since the wings are extensions of the thoracic exoskeleton, the deformations of the thorax cause the wings to move as well. A set of dorsal longitudinal muscles compress the thorax from front to back, causing the dorsal surface of the thorax (notum) to bow upward, making the wings flip down. A set of tergosternal muscles pull the notum downward again, causing the wings to flip upward.|$|E
500|$|The {{glossopharyngeal}} (IX), vagus (X) and {{accessory nerve}} (XI) all leave the skull via the jugular foramen {{to enter the}} neck. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides innervation to the upper throat {{and the back of}} the tongue, the vagus provides innervation to <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the voicebox, and continues downward to supply parasympathetic innervation to the chest and abdomen. [...] The accessory nerve controls the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles in the neck and shoulder.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the problems found in lower-level injuries, thoracic (chest height) spinal lesions can affect <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the trunk. Injuries {{at the level of}} T1 to T8 result in inability to control the abdominal muscles. Trunk stability may be affected; even more so in higher level injuries. The lower the level of injury, the less extensive its effects. [...] Injuries from T9 to T12 result in partial loss of trunk and abdominal muscle control. [...] Thoracic spinal injuries result in paraplegia, but function of the hands, arms, and neck are not affected.|$|E

Then the food passes into the secretory part of the stomach (called the glandular stomach, and sometimes the proventriculus or [...] "true stomach").

500|$|Tanner {{became known}} as [...] "Whistler’s Mother’s Boy", [...] "The Whistling Troubador," [...] and [...] "the nation’s best-known whistler".

[...] He had the ability to whistle while triple-tonguing, and like Bing Crosby, he was able to whistle from his throat due to <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> his larynx. [...] His range was from low G to high B. [...] Professional whistler Joel Brandon has named Tanner as a [...] "top pick". Ted Weems considered Tanner's whistling so important to his band, he insured the musician's throat with Lloyd's of London for $10,000 in 1939. The policy provided payment for any medical expenses related to Tanner's possible inability to whistle and included payment to the holder if Tanner was unable to perform.|$|E

He subsequently became a featured performer as a whistler, earning [...] the nicknames [...] "Whistler’s Mother’s Boy", [...] "The Whistling Troubador," [...] and [...] "the nation’s best-known whistler". He began appearing in films as part of the Ted Weems Orchestra in 1936; his first film role was in The Hatfields and McCoys, and he later appeared in the movie Swing, Sister, Swing (1938) and the musical film short, Swing Frolic (1942).
