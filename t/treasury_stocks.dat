500|$|On June 3, 1965, President Johnson sent {{a special}} message to Congress, asking it to pass {{legislation}} allowing the dime and quarter to be made from base metal, and to reduce the silver content of the half dollar to 40 percent. [...] The silver dollar would be unaffected if any were struck, {{but there were no}} plans to do so. He noted that the metal for the silver coinage was being struck from dwindling <b>Treasury</b> <b>stocks,</b> rather than from newly mined silver, and that the government bullion would be entirely used up by 1968. Johnson argued that the metal necessary for industry must not be wasted as a means of exchange. He urged the passage of draft legislation, attached to the message, and said the bill would [...] "ensure a stable and dignified coinage, fully adequate in quantity and in its specially designed technical characteristics to the needs of our Twentieth Century life. It can be maintained indefinitely, however much the demand for coin may grow." ...|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom {{equivalent}} of treasury stock {{as used in}} the United States is treasury share. <b>Treasury</b> <b>stocks</b> in the UK refers to government bonds or gilts.|$|E
50|$|Historically, gilt names {{referred}} to their purpose of issuance, or signified how a stock had been created, such as 10¼% Conversion Stock 1999; or different names {{were used for}} different gilts simply to minimise confusion between them. In more recent times, gilts have been generally named <b>Treasury</b> <b>Stocks.</b> Since 2005-2006, all new issues of gilts have been called Treasury Gilts.|$|E
50|$|Unissued {{stock is}} stock {{that has been}} {{authorized}} in a company's charter, but has never been sold. It differs from <b>Treasury</b> <b>stock</b> (in the UK, Treasury shares, as <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> means something else), in that <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> has been issued, and bought back by the company, whereas unissued stock has never been issued.|$|R
50|$|One way of {{accounting}} for <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> {{is with the}} cost method. In this method, the paid-in capital account is reduced in the balance sheet when the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is bought. When the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is sold back on the open market, the paid-in capital is either debited or credited if it is sold for less or more than the initial cost respectively.|$|R
5000|$|In either method, any {{transaction}} involving <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> cannot {{increase the}} amount of retained earnings. If the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is sold for more than cost, then the paid-in capital <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is the account that is increased, not retained earnings. In auditing financial statements, it is a common practice to check for this error to detect possible attempts to [...] "cook the books." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950's the United State's Treasury became a begrudging {{supplier}} of silver at $ [...]905 an ounce. Bennett {{warned that the}} lack of supply versus the high demand would cause the deficit to fall on the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Stocks.</b> By 1961 the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Stocks</b> had unnecessarily been depleted. In 1963 the government only had 30 million ounces of free silver against the annual coinage requirement for the United States of more than 75 million ounces. The price of silver per ounce was now $ 1.2929 but if the United States bought extra silver the price would go above $ 1.29. The Silver Purchase Act of 1963 was supported by Bennett, the act repealed [...] "existing silver purchase requirements and the transfer of tax of silver bullion." [...] It also allowed the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 notes to replace [...] "silver certificates or the denominations thus making 1.6 billion ounces of silver available to the United States Treasury." ...|$|E
50|$|Two years later, in 1999, {{services}} to Europe were inaugurated through a code share service with Air France, to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. In 2000, the airline was renamed TAM Linhas Aéreas in Portuguese. Long running discussions {{to merge with}} Varig ended in 2004. In 2008, TAM transported 30,144,000 passengers, with an average load factor of 71%. As of 2010, the airline {{is owned by the}} Amaro family (46.25%), Amaro Aviation Part (3.52%), <b>treasury</b> <b>stocks</b> (0.27%) and minority shareholders (49.96%). It employs 24,000 staff.

50|$|Company {{was founded}} in August 2009 as (indirect) {{subsidiary}} of J&T Finance Group, as of October 2009 ownership structure was PPF (40%), J&T (40%) and Daniel Křetínský. In August 2012 PPF converted part of its debt for EPH shares and increase its share to 44.4% (decreasing J&T share to 37.04% and Daniel Křetínský share to 18.52%). In June 2014 PPF sold its stake for 1.1 EUR billions, since then ownership Daniel Křetínský and Patrik Tkáč own 2/3 share and J&T 1/3 share. As of December 31 2014 shareholders were equally BIQUES LIMITED (part of J&T PARTNERS I L.P.), MILEES LIMITED (part of J&T PARTNERS II L.P.) and EP Investment S.à r.l. (owned by Daniel Křetínský), while rest of 44.4% was treasury stock. <b>Treasury</b> <b>stocks</b> were cancelled in September 2015.|$|E
50|$|Another common way for {{accounting}} for <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is the par value method. In the par value method, {{when the stock}} is purchased back from the market, the books will reflect the action as a retirement of the shares. Therefore, common stock is debited and <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is credited. However, when the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is resold back to the market the entry in the books {{will be the same}} as the cost method.|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{corporate}} {{reactions to}} the deregulation of stock repurchases set forth on 1 October 2001, in Japan, {{by looking at the}} motivations for stock repurchases. We found that stock repurchases increased significantly after the ban on <b>treasury</b> <b>stocks</b> was lifted. Our results show that firms with free-cash flow problems initiated a repurchase plan to distribute excess cash to shareholders and reduce agency costs over the sample period. In addition, firms who wanted to signal undervaluation also undertook stock repurchases over the sample period. These firms were affected by the deregulation, unlike firms that repurchase to reduce agency costs. We determined that firms with weak incentives to signal undervaluation increased stock repurchases significantly in order to respond to the deregulation, since these firms had the ability to take advantage of treasury stock purchases. <b>Treasury</b> <b>stocks,</b> Undervaluation, Takeover deterrence, Capital structure, Cash distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to observe a capital surplus dividend and examine how investors react to the information about the implementation of capital surplus dividend. In addition, I focus on the reason why the companies decide to give the capital surplus dividend to shareholders. First, I find that one of the strong reasons is that the companies' financial conditions were not better than other companies which give the dividend derived from the profit. This finding has been also detected by several researchers so far. Further, I make it clear that the relation between the magnitude of the profit and investor's reaction. Finally, I try to consider the financial conditions of companies listed in an emerging market. The sample contains both companies in such market and another. Then I compare the share ratio of a treasury stock in new market companies with that in another market. Consequently I want to emphasize the conclusion that companies in an emerging market have tendency to have more <b>treasury</b> <b>stocks</b> than other firms in a traditional market. I suppose if we base on these results, perhaps companies in an emerging market which gave capital surplus dividend to shareholder only to maintain their stock price. Conclusively, I insist there are some irrelevant companies those should not to pay dividend to shareholder in a new market...|$|E
