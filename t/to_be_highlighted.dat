5|$|In 1981, {{the site}} was {{proposed}} for commercial development, provoking an energetic campaign by the Chiswick Wildlife Group, formed in March 1982, which became the local branch of the London Wildlife Trust. The threat to {{the site was}} one of the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highlighted</b> by the London Wildlife Trust on its formation in October 1981. The campaign led to a Public Inquiry in July 1983, which determined that the site should be devoted to nature conservation. This was the first time anywhere in the United Kingdom that a Public Inquiry had ruled in favour of nature in a city, and the Gunnersbury Triangle example became a test case.|$|E

25|$|This {{formation}} {{is widely used}} by Spanish, French and German sides. While it seems defensive to the eye, {{it is quite a}} flexible formation, as both the wide players and the full-backs join the attack. In defense, this {{formation is}} similar to either the 4–5–1 or 4–4–1–1. It is used to maintain possession of the ball and stopping opponent attacks by controlling the midfield area of the field. The lone striker may be very tall and strong to hold the ball up as his midfielders and full-backs join him in attack. The striker could also be very fast. In these cases, the opponent's defense will be forced to fall back early, thereby leaving space for the offensive central midfielder. This formation is used especially when a playmaker is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highlighted.</b> The variations of personnel used on the flanks in this set-up include using traditional wingers, using inverted wingers or simply using wide midfielders. Different teams and managers have different interpretations of the 4–2–3–1, but one common factor among them all is the presence of the double pivot. The efficiency and the compactness that the double pivot provides makes it vital to have in the modern game. The double pivot is the usage of two holding midfielders in front of the defence.|$|E

500|$|A New York Times story {{reporting}} on Disston's progress in 1883 stated that before Disston's purchase {{and the subsequent}} development, the only places worth seeing in Florida were Jacksonville and St. Augustine, with perhaps an overnight trip on the St. Johns River to Palatka; by 1883 tourist attractions had extended [...] south. More {{attention was paid to}} the St. Johns with the increasing population. Florida was portrayed as an exotic wonderland able to cure failing health with its water and citrus, and the region began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highlighted</b> in travel writings. To relieve his bronchitis, Ralph Waldo Emerson stayed briefly in St. Augustine, calling north Florida [...] "a grotesque region" [...] that was being swarmed by land speculators. Emerson poignantly disliked the public sale of slaves, adding to his overall distaste. Following the Civil War, however, famed author Harriet Beecher Stowe lived near Jacksonville and traveled up the St. Johns, writing about it with affection: [...] "The entrance of the St. Johns from the ocean {{is one of the most}} singular and impressive passages of scenery that we ever passed through: in fine weather the sight is magnificent." [...] Her memoir Palmetto Leaves, published in 1873 as a series of her letters home, was very influential in luring northern residents to the state.|$|E
500|$|Although she is wise {{beyond her}} years, Lisa has typical {{childhood}} issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention. For example, in [...] "Lost Our Lisa" [...] (season nine, 1998), she tricks Homer into {{allowing her to}} ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly lost {{and in need of}} aid from her father. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that incidents like this illustrate that [...] "Even when Lisa's lecturing like a college professor or mounting yet another protest, she never becomes a full-grown adult trapped in a child's body." [...] In , Aeon J. Skoble states that although Lisa is an intellectual, she is still portrayed as a character who enjoys normal childhood and girl activities, plays with Malibu Stacy dolls, loves ponies, obsesses over teenage heartthrobs such as Corey, and watches The Itchy and Scratchy Show along with Bart. He writes, [...] "One might argue that this is typical childhood behavior, but since in so many cases Lisa is presented not simply as a prodigy but as preternaturally wise, the fondness for Itchy and Scratchy and Corey seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highlighted,</b> taking on greater significance. Lisa is portrayed as the avatar of logic and wisdom, but then she also worships Corey so she's 'no better '." [...] When she became depressed over being unable to pursue her dream as a musician due to inheriting her father's fingers and having to spend her time with Marge in being a homemaker, Lisa gives up on school and becomes a juvenile delinquent in Separate Vocations. She is stopped by Bart who encourages her to keep proving the wrong and pursue her dreams as a musician.|$|E

The incoming Labour government elected in 1997 under Tony Blair greatly expanded the size, scope and funding of the project. It also significantly increased expectations {{of what would be}} delivered. Just before its opening Blair claimed the Dome would be [...] "a triumph of confidence over cynicism, boldness over blandness, excellence over mediocrity". In the words of BBC correspondent Robert Orchard, [...] "the Dome was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highlighted</b> as a glittering New Labour achievement in the next election manifesto", but [...] criticised in the 2001 Conservative Party manifesto as [...] "banal, anonymous and rootless", and lacking [...] "a sense of Britain’s history or culture".|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st century, {{the poem}} {{was viewed as}} Wordsworth's best work. Adam Sisman, in 2007, claimed the poem as [...] "one of [...] {{greatest}} works". Following in 2008, Paul Fry argued, [...] "Most readers agree that the Platonism of the Intimations Ode is foreign to Wordsworth, and express uneasiness that his most famous poem, the one he always accorded its special place in arranging his successive editions, is also so idiosyncratic." [...] He continued, [...] "As Simplon and Snowdon also suggest, {{it was a matter}} of achieving heights (not the depth of 'Tintern Abbey'), and for that reason the metaphor comes easily when one speaks of the Intimations Ode as a high point in Wordsworth's career, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>highlighted</b> in any new addition as a pinnacle of accomplishment, a poem of the transcendental imagination par excellence." ...|$|E
