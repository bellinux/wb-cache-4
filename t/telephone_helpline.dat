40|$|The deinstitutionalization {{of society}} {{is in part}} {{associated}} with the growing implementation of new information and communication technologies. These new technologies bring about new collective formations. if the social sciences are succesfully to understand {{the impact of these}} technologies, we will need new ways of thinking about institutions and power. We shall take the case of <b>telephone</b> <b>helplines</b> as a test-bed for Foucault's proposals for understanding institutions' operation of power. Specifically, we use the Foucaultian notion that space, body and norms are constitutive elements of the corporeality of institutions. We report how this applies to the case of <b>telephone</b> <b>helplines,</b> and we claim that Foucault's concepts do not go far enough. Instead, we propose the new concept of 'extitution'. Extuition helps understand new anatomies of power anatomy and new kinds of social practices...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This paper {{describes}} {{a program of}} work designed to inform a service model to address a challenge for <b>telephone</b> <b>helplines,</b> namely frequent callers. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review and four empirical studies that drew on different data sources-(a) routinely collected calls data from Lifeline, Australia's largest telephone helpline; (b) data from surveys/interviews with Lifeline frequent callers; (c) data from the Diagnosis, Management and Outcomes of Depression in Primary Care (diamond) study; and (d) data from Australia's National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. RESULTS: Frequent callers represent 3  % of callers but make 60  % of calls. They are isolated and have few social supports but are not "time wasters"; they have major {{mental and physical health}} problems and are often in crisis. They make use of other services for their mental health problems. The circumstances under which they use <b>telephone</b> <b>helplines</b> vary, but current service models reinforce their calling behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to a service model that might better serve the needs of both frequent callers and other callers. The model involves offering frequent callers an integrated, tailored service in which they are allocated a dedicated and specially trained telephone crisis supporter (TCS), and given set calling times. It also involves promoting better linkages between <b>telephone</b> <b>helplines</b> and other services that provide mental health care, particularly general practitioners (GPs) and other primary care providers. The next step is to refine and test the model. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis Group in the Research on Language and Social Interaction on 06 / 08 / 2014, available online: [URL] article overviews the way conversation analytic work on <b>telephone</b> <b>helplines</b> can make an impact in practical situations. It takes three illustrative themes in helpline research: (a) the giving, receiving, and resisting of advice; (b) the expression of strong emotion and its identification, management, and then coordination with helpline goals; and (c) how helplines' policies and practices shape the interactions between caller and call taker. For each of these themes, we show how conversation analysis research insights have been applied to improve helpline effectiveness. This has been done {{through a variety of}} practice-based reports, consultancy exercises, and training initiatives, including workshops where we aim to identify and facilitate good practice. Intervention studies of this type are at the forefront of interactional research on <b>telephone</b> <b>helplines.</b> Data are in Australian and British English...|$|R

50|$|Formal {{psychological}} support for those experiencing sexual violence {{has been provided}} largely by the nongovernmental sector, particularly rape crisis centres and various women's and men's organizations. Inevitably, the number of victims of sexual violence with access to these services is small.

40|$|Background: Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the services offered by rheumatology <b>telephone</b> <b>helplines</b> in the UK vary widely between NHS Trusts {{because of the lack of}} national or European guidelines. Objective: To conduct an activity analysis of six NHS Trust rheumatology <b>telephone</b> <b>helplines</b> in the south and west of England. Methods: Serial data were collected on the first 100 calls received on or after 1 January 1999 by six rheumatology helplines in the south and west of England. Background information was gathered on the management, availability, setting and purpose of each helpline. Data on the time taken to manage these calls and patient satisfaction were not collected. Results: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were the major users and no significant differences were found in the outcome of their calls between centres, but wide variations were revealed in the management of the helplines, the populations they serve and the services they offer. Conclusion: The rheumatology helpline services in six NHS Trusts in the south and west of England were shown to be the same in name only. They lacked uniformity in the delivery of care and accessibility to relevant patient groups. The geographical variation in service delivery may result in patient dissatisfaction and confusion if a number of hospitals are attended over the course of a patient's chronic disease. Further research is required to identify the helpline needs of the broader rheumatology population, patient satisfaction, outcomes and system costs, and to progress towards the development of national and European guidelines...|$|R

Suicidal behavior is the best conceptualized as a multifaceted complex problem involving social factors and mental illnesses. Broadly, there are two approaches to suicide prevention; population preventive strategies and high-risk preventive strategies. Population preventive strategies include reducing availability of means for suicide, education of primary care physicians, influencing media portrayal of suicidal behavior, education of the public, <b>telephone</b> <b>helplines,</b> and addressing economic issues associated with suicidal behavior. High-risk preventive strategy includes identifying individuals with high risk of committing suicide, intensively treating mental illness if present, and providing psychosocial support. Thus, prevention requires a multipronged effort with collaboration from various sectors including mental health professionals, social justice department, and macroeconomic policy makers...|$|R
