For example, the Society of Automotive Engineers has a series of grades defining many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b> The American Society for Testing and Materials has a separate set of standards, which define alloys such as A36 steel, {{the most commonly used}} structural steel in the United States.

25|$|The bridges in Fulton County exhibit two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> {{truss bridge}} construction, Pratt bridge and Parker, {{which were the}} most common early <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> truss bridges. Due to {{variation}} within each type of bridge, the collection in Fulton County offered {{a unique opportunity to}} view the evolution of late 19th and early 20th century steel truss bridge construction. For example, the now-demolished London Mills Bridge, a Pratt built in 1883, features pinned connection and double eyebars for the lower chord and for the diagonals. This is compared to the also destroyed Indian Ford Bridge, a Pratt bridge built in 1917, which used riveted connections and I-beam construction for its lower chords and diagonals.|$|E
25|$|Billet Steel: When a {{high quality}} {{camshaft}} or low volume production is required, engine builders and camshaft manufacturers choose steel billet. This {{is a much more}} time consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. However, the finished product is far superior. CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, and CNC camshaft grinders will be used during production. Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> bar can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a camshaft from EN40b, the camshaft will also be heat treated via gas nitriding, which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC. These types of camshafts can be used in high-performance engines.|$|E

50|$|Bulat is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> alloy {{known in}} Russia from medieval times; {{regularly}} being mentioned in Russian legends as {{the material of}} choice for cold steel. The name булат is a Russian transliteration of the Persian word fulad, meaning <b>steel.</b> This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> {{was used by the}} armies of nomadic peoples. Bulat steel was the main <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> used for swords in the armies of Genghis Khan, the great emperor of the Mongolian Empire.

2500|$|In 1943, Richard James, a naval {{mechanical}} engineer {{stationed at the}} William Cramp and Sons shipyards in Philadelphia, was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas. James accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf, {{and watched as the}} spring [...] "stepped" [...] in a series of arcs to a stack of books, to a tabletop, and to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. James's wife Betty later recalled, [...] "He came home and said, 'I think if I got the right property of steel and the right tension; I could make it walk.'" [...] James experimented with different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> wire over the next year, and finally found a spring that would walk. [...] Betty was dubious at first, but changed her mind after the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it. She dubbed the toy Slinky (meaning [...] "sleek and graceful"), after finding the word in a dictionary, and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing.|$|E
2500|$|During the pre-World War II {{military}} buildup, {{and throughout}} the war, all Japanese officers were required to wear a sword. Traditionally made swords were produced during this period, {{but in order to}} supply such large numbers of swords, blacksmiths with little or no knowledge of traditional Japanese sword manufacture were recruited. In addition, supplies of the Japanese steel (tamahagane) used for swordmaking were limited, so several other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> were also used. Quicker methods of forging were also used, {{such as the use of}} power hammers, and quenching the blade in oil, rather than hand forging and water. The non-traditionally made swords from this period are called shōwatō, after the regnal name of the Emperor Hirohito, and in 1937, the Japanese government started requiring the use of special stamps on the tang (nakago) to distinguish these swords from traditionally made swords. During this period of war, older antique swords were remounted for use in military mounts. Presently, in Japan, shōwatō are not considered to be [...] "true" [...] Japanese swords, and they can be confiscated. Outside Japan, however, they are collected as historical artifacts.|$|E
