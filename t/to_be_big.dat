5|$|The 2007 Sheraton Hawaii Bowl was a post-season college {{football}} bowl {{game between the}} Boise State University Broncos from the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and the East Carolina University Pirates from Conference USA (C-USA) at the Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii on December 23, 2007. The game was the final competition of the 2007 football season for each team and resulted in a 41–38 East Carolina victory, even though sportsbooks favored Boise State to win by 10½ points. Many experts believed East Carolina <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> underdogs to Boise State, which had defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl. The 2007 Hawaii Bowl paid $750,000 to each team's conference {{in exchange for their}} participation.|$|E

25|$|The Hawks {{missed the}} finals {{altogether}} in 2002, finishing tenth, which {{was considered a}} very disappointing result for the club. Shane Crawford won the Peter Crimmins Medal after another strong season. Players that made their debuts that year, Luke Hodge, Sam Mitchell, Campbell Brown, Robert Campbell and Mark Williams would all play in the 2008 premiership side. In the off-season, the Hawks again proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> players and gained the services of St Kilda ruckman Peter Everitt.|$|E

However, his concert tours continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> draws. Billboard magazine ranked Diamond as the most profitable solo performer of 1986. He released his 17th studio album in 1986, Headed for the Future, which reached number 20 on the Billboard 200 rank. Three weeks later he starred in Hello Again, his first television special in nine years, where he performed comedy sketches and sang a duo medley with Carol Burnett.|$|E

In an interview, he said, [...] "I wasn't relying on solos <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> features because I simply can't play them." [...] Fanning explained that the shorter length of songs was due to him not having [...] "four other people" [...] to back him up when producing independently.|$|E

Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I knew it was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|The Radioactive Man {{character}} {{is based on}} Batman, and several scenes in the episode reference the Batman television series from the 1960s. A Radioactive Man antagonist, The Scoutmaster, is based on actor/comedian Paul Lynde. The scene in the new Radioactive Man film where Radioactive Man and Fallout Boy are captured in Aquaworld is {{a reference to the}} 1995 film Waterworld. The director of the Radioactive Man film says: [...] "That Milhouse is going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big,</b> Gabby Hayes big!", in reference to the American actor Gabby Hayes. Moe Szyslak, the bartender of Moe's Tavern, says that he, as a kid, played the part of Smelly on The Little Rascals, until he killed Alfalfa for stealing his schtick. Bill Withers' song [...] "Lean on Me" [...] from 1972 is played {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E

It's a very sexy record, but it's fun. It's [...] great melodies; it's catchy; the beat knocks. It's so many different elements to it." [...] When asked how is he satisfied with Rihanna's vocals and his prediction on the song he further stated: [...] "She definitely murdered it vocally. I was just at the studio last week listening to a mix of it, and man, she killed it. I really feel like, this song, it's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big.</b> I'm really excited about it."

500|$|Although the {{producers}} {{always wanted to}} find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, Friends was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience {{was an integral part of}} the series. When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> enough for the cameras, lighting, and [...] "for the audience to be able to see what's going on"; the apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the funny scripts. The fourth-season finale was shot on location in London because {{the producers}} were aware of the series' popularity in the UK. The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people. These were the show's largest audiences throughout its run. The fifth-season finale, set in Las Vegas, was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, although Bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.|$|E
500|$|Some reviews {{were more}} positive. Welch D. Everman, author of Cult Science Fiction Films, {{compared}} {{the relationship between}} West and Nelson to that of Victor Frankenstein and his monster in Mary Shelly's novel Frankenstein (1818). Everman wrote, [...] "This {{is the kind of}} movie we've come to expect from AIP — cheaply made, nasty, and lots of fun". John W. Bowen of the Belleville Intelligencer said he enjoyed the [...] "camp" [...] style of the film, adding, [...] "It's both inexplicable and sad this brain-damaged yet fiercely determined little drive-in bottom feeder never garnered more than a tiny cult following over the years". A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "Films like The Incredible Melting Man are not made to be good; they are made to be scary. For anyone looking to raise goosebumps on their flesh, this one is sufficient to give you your money's worth". Matt Maiellaro, co-creator of the Cartoon Network series Aqua Teen Hunger Force, said the film inspired him to start making films himself, adding, [...] "When I was eight, I watched The Incredible Melting Man and knew that horror movies were going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> religion in my life". Z movie director Tim Ritter said he was partially inspired to enter show business by watching a trailer for The Incredible Melting Man at age 9. Ritter said, [...] "I was too young to see the movie, but the trailer really got into my imagination".|$|E

500|$|Eight {{months after}} No Line on the Horizons release, Bono {{said he was}} {{disappointed}} with the album's sales. Regarding the lack of commercial appeal, Bono said, [...] "We weren't really in that mindset. We felt that the 'album' is almost an extinct species, and we [...] create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging {{for people who have}} grown up on a diet of pop stars." [...] Clayton agreed that the album's commercial reception must be [...] "challenged" [...] but said, [...] "the more interesting challenge is, 'What is rock 'n' roll in this changing world?' Because, to some extent, the concept of the music fan—the concept of the person who buys music and listens to music for the pleasure of music itself—is an outdated idea." [...] The Edge predicted that, despite its lack of a big hit, No Line on the Horizon would grow on listeners over time. He noted that the reaction to the songs in the live setting made U2 believe that the material was connecting with the fans, adding, [...] "There's a lot of records that make great first impressions. There might be one song that gets <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> on the radio, but they're not albums that people... play a lot. This is one that I gather from talking to people.... Four months later, they're saying, 'I'm really getting into the album now. McGuinness believed that the conditions of the music market were more responsible for the low sales than any decline in U2's popularity.|$|E
