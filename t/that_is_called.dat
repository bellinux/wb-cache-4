5|$|Amino acids are the {{structural}} units (monomers) {{that make up}} proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy {{of one of the}} organism's genes.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{can form}} very long chains of {{interconnecting}} carbon–carbon bonds, a property <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> catenation. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable. Through catenation, carbon forms a countless number of compounds. A tally of unique compounds shows that more contain carbon that {{those that do}} not. A similar claim {{can be made for}} hydrogen because most organic compounds also contain hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives. These form one word class <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> nominals. Wagiman nominals take case suffixes (see below) that denote their grammatical or semantic {{role in the}} sentence. The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive, and the semantic cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), ablative (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case can be either grammatical or semantic, depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb.|$|E

5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of the central campus area, along Columbia Road, sits the School of Medicine complex. The main School of Medicine {{building}} is the remodeled St. Michael's Hospital building which was built in 1951. Other buildings in the medical school complex include the Biomedical Research Center and the Neuroscience Research Facility. Further north sits an area <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> University Village. This land sat virtually empty for decades, but has recently been developed for UND, commercial, and residential purposes. University Village is anchored by the $100 million Ralph Engelstad Arena, which is used by the men's and women's hockey teams. University Village is also home to the Betty Engelstad Sioux Center, the new Student Wellness Center, university apartments, the UND bookstore, a medical clinic, and several residential and commercial properties.|$|E

25|$|The {{radar beam}} would follow a linear path in vacuum, {{but it really}} follows a {{somewhat}} curved path in the atmosphere because of the variation of the refractive index of air, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the radar horizon. Even when the beam is emitted parallel to the ground, it will rise above it as the Earth curvature sinks below the horizon. Furthermore, the signal is attenuated by the medium it crosses, and the beam disperses.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} of Western Orthodox parishes {{has been compared}} with {{the status of the}} autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches (often called Uniate by Orthodox Christians) in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. For centuries, there have been hierarchical churches in full communion with Rome. Eastern Catholics, despite usages in continuity with, and closely resembling, those of the Orthodox, largely share a common dogma with Latin Catholics, a situation <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> uniatism. Analogously, the Western Rite Orthodox share the same faith as their Byzantine Rite Orthodox brethren despite a different liturgical rite.|$|E
25|$|The {{immune system}} is a complex system {{of the human body}} and {{understanding}} {{it is one of the}} most challenging topics in biology. Immunology research is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying the defense of human body and to develop drugs for immunological diseases and maintain health. Recent findings in genomic and proteomic technologies have transformed the immunology research drastically. Sequencing of the human and other model organism genomes has produced increasingly large volumes of data relevant to immunology research and at the same time huge amounts of functional and clinical data are being reported in the scientific literature and stored in clinical records. Recent advances in bioinformatics or computational biology were helpful to understand and organize these large scale data and gave rise to new area <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> Computational immunology or immunoinformatics.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of strokes: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke happens when a person’s artery, which {{supplies}} blood to different areas of the brain, becomes blocked with a blood clot. This type of stroke happens 80% of the time. The blood clot may form in the blood vessel, which is called a thrombus, or the blood clot can travel from somewhere else in the blood system <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> an embolus. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or bursts. Overall, people experience bleeding inside or around brain tissue. This type of stroke happens 20% of the time and is very serious. The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are weak vessels, traumatic injury, chronic high blood pressure hypertension, and an aneurysm.|$|E
