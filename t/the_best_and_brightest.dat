25|$|Overseas Indians file more patents {{in their}} country of {{residence}} than in India. Thomas Friedman, in his recent book, The World is Flat, explains this trend in terms of brain drain, whereby <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> elements in India emigrate to the U.S. in order to seek better financial opportunities. A joint study by Duke University and UC Berkeley revealed that Indian immigrants to the US have founded more engineering and technology companies from 1995 to 2005 than immigrants from the UK, China, Taiwan and Japan combined. A 1999 study by AnnaLee Saxenian reported {{that a third of}} Silicon Valley scientists and engineers were immigrants and that Indians are the second largest group of Asian-born engineers (23%) following the Chinese (51%). Her research showed that in 1998, seven percent of high-technology firms in Silicon Valley were led by Indian CEOs. A recent study shows that 23% of Indian business school graduates take a job in United States.|$|E
25|$|Warrior Nun Areala is a manga-style American {{comic book}} {{character}} created by Ben Dunn {{and published by}} Antarctic Press, first appearing in Warrior Nun Areala Vol. 1 #1 in December 1994. The story revolves around Sister Shannon Masters, a Joan of Arc like heroine of the Order of the Cruciform Sword, a fictional military order of Warrior Nuns and Magic Priests in service of the Catholic Church.
