5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ordering</b> {{of liquid}} {{crystalline}} phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which {{may be on the}} order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, {{such as the use of}} boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. <b>The</b> <b>ordering</b> in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.|$|E
5|$|As the {{guarantor}} of justice, the Roman emperor {{was expected to}} devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters.

5|$|Along with Engineer Gunnar Tonning, Løvold {{traveled}} {{several times}} to Oslo to meet with national politicians and authorities. In addition to Torp, he consulted the engineering company Aas-Jakobsen, the NATO office and Kolbjørn Varmann, Minister of Transport and Communications. In 1958 a joint municipal and county committee was established to follow up the plans, where Løvold was appointed chairman. Its main function was <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> seismic surveys of Freifjorden, which gave positive results. Major Worm Eide manned for caution and stated {{that there was no}} funding available. Subsequently a committee led by Ole Mollan was appointed, which criticized the original committee for not prioritizing more critical transport investments.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E

5|$|Vestal {{stated that}} he could not support the bill as {{introduced}} because it did not designate who should order the coins, but Gernerd indicated that the Fifth National Bank of New York had agreed to act in that capacity. Stoudt appeared before the committee, explaining that his commission planned a design {{with the arrival of the}} New Netherlandt for one side, and for the other, Peter Minuit purchasing Manhattan from the Native Americans. New Jersey Congressman Ernest R. Ackerman briefly addressed the committee in support, noting that the coins would likely be retained as souvenirs, to the profit of the government. West Virginia's Wells Goodykoontz also spoke in favor. The witnesses, all urging passage of the bill, concluded with a number of local pastors, led by E.O. Watson, secretary of the Federal Council of Churches. On February 10, 1923, Vestal issued a report recommending that the bill pass with an amendment adding the bank as <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> organization.|$|E
25|$|This {{follows from}} the earlier {{equivalence}} with interval graph clique numbers: if G is a subgraph of an interval graph I, represented (as in the figure) {{in such a way}} that all interval endpoints are distinct, then <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> of the left endpoints of the intervals of I has vertex separation number one less than the clique number of I. And in the other direction, from a linear ordering of G one may derive an interval representation in which the left endpoint of the interval for a vertex v is its position in <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> and the right endpoint is the position of the neighbor of v that comes last in <b>the</b> <b>ordering.</b>|$|E

25|$|Big-endian is {{the most}} common format in data networking; fields in the {{protocols}} of the Internet protocol suite, such as IPv4, IPv6, TCP, and UDP, are transmitted in big-endian order. For this reason, big-endian byte order is also referred to as network byte order. Little-endian storage is popular for microprocessors, in part due to significant influence on microprocessor designs by Intel Corporation. Mixed forms also exist, for instance <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> of bytes in a 16-bit word may differ from <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> of 16-bit words within a 32-bit word. Such cases are sometimes referred to as mixed-endian or middle-endian. There are also some bi-endian processors that operate in either little-endian or big-endian mode.|$|E
