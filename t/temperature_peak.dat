40|$|Abstract In this paper, MgSO 4 :Dy,MgSO 4 :Tm and MgSO 4 :Mn {{phosphors}} are prepare by {{high temperature}} solid state reaction. The MgSO 4 :Dy or MgSO 4 :Tm powder are mixed and sintered with MgSO 4 :Mn respectively {{to obtain the}} co-doped MgSO 4 :Dy,Mn and MgSO 4 :Tm,Mn phosphors. The 3 -dimensional thermoluminescence spectra of these two phosphors under different sintering temperature are measured. Results show that when the sintering temperature is below 800 °C, Dy, Tm and Mn ions emissions are independent. However, when the sintering temperature was over 800 °C, the emission peak of Mn becomes weaker, {{and so do the}} low <b>temperature</b> <b>peaks</b> of Dy and Tm, while the high <b>temperature</b> <b>peaks</b> of Dy and Tm become stronger. This indicated that the defect complex structure {{in the formation of the}} thermoluminescence material depends on the sintering temperature. As the sintering temperature rises, more and more Mn ions combine with the rare earth ions. Therefore, the luminescence process of the energy transfer of Mn ions to the rare earth ions can be observed and the suppression to low <b>temperature</b> <b>peaks</b> of Tm and Dy, and also shown in spectra...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{influence}} of a hexagonal boron nitride powder surface on the polymer-ization of a benzoxazine monomer is examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). By varying {{the thickness of the}} benzoxazine coatings on boron nitride particles, a distinct {{influence of}} the surface substrate on the polymerization reaction could be observed. At a coating thickness calculated to be on the order of a monolayer, the heat of reaction is reduced, while the exothermic <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>peak</b> width at half height are increased relative to that of the neat resin values. The reduced heat of reaction and increased exothermic <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> indicate that the boron nitride surface is inhibiting the benzoxazine polymerization reaction. In the intermediate coating thickness region, the heat of reaction increases and the exothermic <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>peak</b> width at half height decrease with increasing coating thickness. With even thicker coatings, the heat of reaction and exothermic <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>peak</b> width at half height reach values corresponding to that of the neat resin and no longer change with thickness. In addition, the influence of surface treated boron nitride particles on the thermal polymerization behavior, as well as the effect of the surface treatment on the viscosity, dynamic mechanical properties, and flexural properties of the filled composites are also investigated. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

30|$|High <b>temperature</b> {{reduction}} <b>peaks</b> (720 and 920  °C) {{were observed}} for LZ and one similar reduction peak (950  °C) was also observed for LPtZ. This {{suggests that these}} high <b>temperature</b> <b>peaks</b> in LPtZ profile {{is due to the}} reaction of oxygen associated with the lanthanum zirconate part of LPtZ pyrochlore. The low <b>temperature</b> <b>peaks</b> (397 and 650  °C) are due to the reaction of oxygen associated with Pt in the pyrochlore structure. For LRuZ, the reduction peaks were at very low temperatures (283 and 449  °C) compared to LZ (605 and 720  °C) and LPtZ (397 and 650  °C). This is consistent with the H 2 TPR results, which suggested that Ru is not stable within the pyrochlore structure, and migrates from the B-site to the surface. The low <b>temperature</b> reduction <b>peaks</b> for LRuZ (Fig.  2 c) could be due to the reaction of oxygen associated with Ru. H 2 -TPR of LRuZ showed that Ru substitution increases the reducibility of lanthanum zirconate, causing it to reduce at temperatures (450 and 551  °C) lower than LZ (490 and 580  °C) (Fig.  2). A similar phenomenon was observed in CH 4 -TPR of LRuZ where the reaction of oxygen associated with lanthanum zirconate was observed at 814  °C compared to 920  °C for LZ and 950  °C for LPtZ. Because H 2 is a stronger reducing agent than CH 4, it reduces the catalyst at much lower temperatures than CH 4. A comparison of Fig.  2 (H 2 TPR) and Fig.  3 (CH 4 TPR) shows this to be true for all the catalysts.|$|R
