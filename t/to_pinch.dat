5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the race. This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E
5|$|Collins played {{minor league}} {{baseball}} for the Joplin Miners until 1919, when he signed with the St. Louis Browns. After spending six seasons with the organization, Collins spent a one-year sojourn {{in the minor leagues}} before he was traded to the New York Yankees, where he spent the next three years and played in the famous 1927 Murderers' Row lineup. At the conclusion of the 1928 season, he was traded to the Boston Braves, with whom he played his last game on May 23, 1929. A two-time World Series champion, he is famous for being the only major league player <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> hit and pinch run in the same game.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting one}} {{out in the}} top of the 7th, Steve Trachsel allowed a single and a walk <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> hitters Brent Mayne and Armando Ríos respectively. The Cubs double switched, {{bringing}} in Matt Karchner to relieve Trachsel and Orlando Merced to play left field. Karchner induced another out before loading the bases on a single by Shawon Dunston. Félix Heredia entered in relief of Karchner and got Barry Bonds to ground out to first base to end the inning. The Cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the 8th inning. After Alvin Morman got Morandini to strike out to open the inning the Giants double switched to bring in José Mesa to pitch and Bill Mueller at third base. Mesa allowed a single to Sammy Sosa and a double to Mark Grace which advanced Sosa to third. Following a ground out Mesa threw a wild pitch while facing Gaetti and Sosa scored to make the game 5–0.|$|E

5|$|As a pinch hitter, Caballero {{came through}} with hits in clutch situations, notably against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 30. Behind 6–3 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, the Phillies sent Caballero {{to the plate}} <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> hit {{in the top of}} the seventh inning. He led off the inning with a single, scoring the first run of a seesaw come-from-behind rally that ended with a 9–8 Phillies victory, closer Jim Konstanty's 13th of the season. Caballero {{displayed}} his running skills again in September, replacing Goliat in the ninth inning of another game against the Cardinals, and scoring a late-inning run in place of Lopata against the Cincinnati Reds several days later to tie a close game that the Phillies eventually lost in 18 innings. On September 26, Caballero scored another crucial run against the Boston Braves when he pinch-ran for outfielder Dick Sisler. Waiting on third base after advancing from first on a Del Ennis single to center field, Jones hit a high ground ball to Boston shortstop Sibby Sisti, who booted the ball and allowed Caballero to score the game-tying run; the Phillies won, 8–7.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{responded by}} scoring three {{runs in the}} bottom of the fourth inning. With one out and no runners on the bases, Hafey hit a single. O'Farrell {{followed}} and hit a ground ball towards Koenig that he bobbled, enabling O'Farrell and Hafey to reach first and second base, respectively. Tommy Thevenow followed with a double to right field that got by Meusel, scoring Hafey and moving O'Farrell to third base. Cardinals' manager Rogers Hornsby then put in left-handed infielder Specs Toporczer <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> hit for Rhem, who was done pitching for the game. Toporczer hit a fly ball to Earle Combs in center field, upon which O'Farrell promptly tagged up to score another Cardinal run. With the game tied at three apiece and a runner at second base, Douthit hit a double in the outfield, which scored Thevenow. Southworth followed with a single to left fielder Ruth, and Douthit immediately tried to score. Ruth threw from left field to catcher Hank Severeid, who tagged Douthit out at home plate.|$|E
5|$|When {{directly}} threatened, many mantis species {{stand tall}} and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem {{larger and more}} threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward {{the safety of the}} ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of a rod {{embedded in}} a matrix undergoing pinching by interfacial-energy-driven bulk diffusion is determined near the point of pinching. We find a self-similar solution that gives a unique temporal power law and interfacial shape prior <b>to</b> <b>pinching</b> and self-similar solutions after pinching. The theory is compared to experiments that employ in situ four-dimensional X-ray tomographic microscopy for rods of liquid or solid pinching by solute diffusion in the high-diffusivity liquid phase. The excellent agreement between experiment and theory confirms that the interfacial morphology near the singularity is universal {{both before and after}} pinching; the shape holds regardless of the material system and initial condition. This also implies that the predictions of the time-dependence of the process can be used to determine the time <b>to</b> <b>pinching</b> {{for a wide variety of}} physical systems, and thus provide estimates of the time required for capillarity-driven break-up of microstructures from the detachment of secondary dendrite arms to polymer blends...|$|R

5|$|In the divisional {{round of}} the playoffs, the Red Sox faced the Anaheim Angels in a best-of-five series. They won Game 1 largely thanks to a 7-run 4th inning, {{and went on to}} sweep the series. In the 7th inning of Game 3, with the Red Sox leading by 4, Vladimir Guerrero tied the game for the Angels with a grand slam. However, David Ortiz won the series with a game winning home run in the 10th. In the American League Championship Series, the Red Sox lost the first three games against the New York Yankees and were {{trailing}} in Game 4 when they began the 9th inning. Kevin Millar was walked by Yankees closer Mariano Rivera. Dave Roberts then came into the game <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> run for Millar and stole second base. Mueller then singled to enable him to tie the game. Another game winning home run by Ortiz won the game for the Red Sox in the 12th inning. Ortiz' single in the 14th inning of Game 5 scored the winning run for the Red Sox, in what was the longest post-season game in baseball history. Despite having a dislocated ankle tendon, Schilling started Game 6 for the Red Sox. He pitched for seven innings, and allowed just one run, during which time his sock became soaked in blood. In the eighth inning, Yankees third baseman Rodriguez slapped a ball out of pitcher Arroyo's hand, allowing the Yankees to score a run. However, after a discussion the umpires called Rodriguez out for interference and canceled the run. Fans then threw debris onto the field in protest and the game was stopped for ten minutes. The Red Sox won the game and became the first baseball team to ever force a Game 7 after having been down 3 games to none. A 10–3 win in Game 7 brought the Red Sox to the World Series {{for the first time in}} 18 years.|$|E
25|$|Al Woods came up <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> hit for Steve Bowling in {{the bottom}} of the fifth inning. With Otto Vélez on the basepads, Woods homered to right field. The score was now 7–4 in favour of Toronto, with the team having scored in every inning of the game to that point.|$|E

25|$|As National League West Champions, the Dodgers {{advanced}} to the 2013 NLDS to play the Eastern Division champion Atlanta Braves. They suffered a blow {{on the last day}} of the regular season when MRI results revealed that Matt Kemp had a severe ankle injury and would not be able to play in the post-season. Andre Ethier was also dealing with an ankle injury and he was limited <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> hitting in the division series.|$|E
25|$|Equalising of {{the mask}} is an {{essential}} skill for any form of diving. Goggles that do not cover the nose can not be equalised and are unsuitable for diving. The mask is equalised by exhaling sufficient air through the nose to provide a balanced internal pressure. Any excess will simply leak out around the skirt. Equalising (or clearing) the ears is necessary to prevent barotrauma to the middle and inner ear. Some divers need <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> the nostrils closed {{as part of their}} equalisation technique, and this must be allowed for in the design {{of the mask}} skirt.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{opening up}} their next series with a four-run lead, the Braves gave up seven {{unanswered}} {{runs in a}} 7–4 loss to the Cardinals. Atlanta also gave up an MLB record three home runs <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> hitters. In {{the second of the}} three-game series against the Cardinals, the Braves allowed nine unanswered runs in a 12–2 loss. After the loss, the Braves were the only team in the National League to have not won a single game yet. Atlanta closed out a three-game series against the Cardinals with a 12–7 loss. Braves pitcher Daniel Winkler suffered an elbow fracture after pitching 6 2/3rd's innings.|$|E
50|$|Rouge {{was used}} as early as in ancient Egypt. It was also applied on the lips, the way {{lipstick}} would be used today. In some times and places, such as the English Regency, {{both men and women}} wore rouge. In Britain in the late Victorian Age, wearing visible makeup such as rouge was associated with low morals. Ladies resorted <b>to</b> <b>pinching</b> their cheeks (and biting their lips) to make them appear red instead.|$|R

25|$|Early model diving masks had {{a single}} {{elliptical}} pane of glass. These masks have indentations in the skirt at the bottom {{on either side of}} the nose, into which the diver can insert a thumb and forefinger <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> the nose, when performing a Valsalva maneuver to clear their ears. This design was improved by bringing the window closer to the face, reducing the volume of air inside the mask, thus making mask clearing easier. The window has a cutout to fit around the nose, which is covered by the rubber or silicone material of the skirt. This facilitates pinching the nose when ear-clearing.|$|E
25|$|After Madotsuki {{falls to}} sleep, {{she begins to}} dream. The player is then {{presented}} with a dream world which resembles the same room Madotsuki lives in. In the dream world, the player is able to leave the room, which {{will lead to a}} nexus of 12 doors, with each leading to a different world, including a colorful neon maze, a forest, a world littered with numerical symbols, and a world full of body parts, among others. These 12 worlds, in turn, connect to a number of other worlds, forming a large and expansive area for the player to explore. The purpose of the game is for the player to navigate the main character's dream worlds to obtain 24 objects, known as effects. The player can attempt to interact with objects, although few will provide any response. The player can choose to wake from the dream world at any time, by causing Madotsuki <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> her cheek and awaken. This behavior ensures that the player has {{a way out of the}} dream world at all times.|$|E
25|$|Having {{only one}} base runner since the third inning, the Red Sox mounted {{a rally in}} the top of the eighth. Bill Buckner led off with a single. Jim Rice {{followed}} with one, and Evans hit a double after that to drive Buckner and Rice in and cut the lead to one. Davey Johnson brought in Jesse Orosco to try and stop the rally with the tying run now in scoring position. Orosco retired Gedman on a lineout, struck Henderson out, and induced a groundout <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter Don Baylor to strand Evans in scoring position. McNamara brought in Al Nipper, who started and lost Game 4, to pitch the bottom half. Darryl Strawberry led off with a home run to make the score 7-5. Knight singled and advanced to second on a groundout by Dykstra. Santana was intentionally walked to get to the pitcher's spot, and Orosco helped his cause by singling to center to drive in Knight. Steve Crawford then came in to face Wilson and hit him, loading the bases. Backman then grounded into a force retiring Santana, and Hernandez grounded out and ended the inning.|$|E

25|$|When the {{infection}} occurs {{in an early}} stage of the tomato plant there may be wilting on leaves because Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis enter the plant by wounds, including root wounds, and if the bacterium gets to the xylem then a systemic infection is likely that may plug the xylem vessels. The wilting may only show {{on one side of the}} leaf and may recover during cooler periods. The entire system of xylem within the plant allows the bacteria to form titers of up to 10^9 bacteria per gram of plant tissue. Wilting may eventually spread to all leaves and these leaves, along with their petioles, may also show distorted, curled growth. One way to diagnose a severe vascular infection is <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> the stem. If the epidermis and outer layer of the cortex separate from the inner stem then you've got a severe vascular infection. These exposed parts will have a soapy feel. Canker lesions, though rare, may develop on the stem. These cankers are necrotic regions where the epidermis is gone. As the bacteria continues its colonization, the canker will deepen and expand. In terms of fruit development, tomatoes may fail to develop altogether or may look marbled because they are ripening unevenly.|$|E
25|$|Also as {{previously}} mentioned, longtime Los Angeles Dodgers' broadcaster Vin Scully called the 1988 World Series {{for a national}} television audience on NBC with Joe Garagiola. Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Kirk Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At {{some point during the}} game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and Scully, observed that Gibson was nowhere to be found. This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda that he was available <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings. Bob Costas, who, along with Marv Albert, hosted NBC's World Series pre-game coverage and handled post-game interviews, made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers' clubhouse (especially Tommy Lasorda). After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a post-game interview with Marv Albert) sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas. While Kirk Gibson was taking practice swings in the Dodgers' clubhouse during Game 1, Orel Hershiser set up the hitting tee for his teammate. Along the way, Costas could hear Gibson's agonized-sounding grunts after every hit. Costas said that the 1988 Dodgers possibly had the weakest hitting line-up in World Series history.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{advanced}} to the NLCS {{for the first time}} since 2009, where they faced off with the St. Louis Cardinals. In the first game of the series at Busch Stadium, Zack Greinke allowed only two runs in eight innings, while striking out a season high 10 batters, the first pitcher to strike out 10 Cardinals in a post-season game since Denny Galehouse in the 1944 World Series. Andre Ethier, making his first post-season start of the season after being limited <b>to</b> <b>pinch</b> hitting the previous round, just missed catching Carlos Beltrán's double at the fence to allow the two runs to score in the third. The Dodgers also managed two runs, on a single by Juan Uribe in the top of the third. The game remained tied into extra innings until Beltran recorded the walk-off hit off Kenley Jansen in the bottom of the 13th inning to give the Cardinals a 3-2 victory. This was the longest game in Dodgers post-season history since the 1916 World Series. In the second game, Clayton Kershaw and two relievers combined to allow only 2 hits and 1 run but that was enough as the Dodgers offense failed to score at all and they lost 1-0. Kershaw was the first starting pitcher in post-season history to lose a game while allowing no earned runs and two or fewer hits.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the {{homology}} of a certain natural compactification of the moduli space, introduced by Kontsevich {{in his study of}} Witten’s conjectures, can be described completely algebraically as the homology of a certain differential graded Lie algebra.
