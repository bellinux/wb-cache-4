40|$|Introduction:External {{hemorrhoids}} {{are located}} {{outside of the}} dentate line and covered by anoderm. <b>Thrombosed</b> external hemorrhoids {{are one of the}} frequent acute anorectal diseases which are treated successfully in the proctology outpatient room. The etiology of this disease is still unknown. Knowledge of the etiology of <b>thrombosed</b> external hemorrhoids could prevent recurrence of this disease and help prepare good prophylaxis. Material/Methods:A group of 50 patients with a diagnosis of <b>thrombosed</b> external hemorrhoids and treated in the Mikolaj Pirogow Regional Specialist Hospital in Lodz was interviewed by means of the author’s own questionnaire concerning demography and published hypothesis. The necessary statistics were conducted by means of STATISTICA 7. 1 and EXCEL 2008 programs. Results:The analysis of the survey results shows a significant relationship of <b>thrombosed</b> external hemorrhoids and presence of internal hemorrhoids, practice of anoreceptive sex and consumption of more alcohol products than usual. There was no statistical relationship between lifting heavy objects, eating spicy food, having hard stools or straining at toilet during motions and <b>thrombosed</b> external hemorrhoids. Conclusions:This study confirmed three hypotheses on the causes of <b>thrombosed</b> external hemorrhoids which were presented in medical journals available in the MEDLINE database. The author of this article believes {{that it is necessary to}} conduct a multi-center study, which would explain the exact etiology of this disease.

40|$|IntroductionEndovascular and {{surgical}} strategies {{have been used}} to manage patients with <b>thrombosed</b> vascular access for hemodialysis. We analyzed the evidence to see whether endovascular or surgical treatment has the best outcome in terms of primary success rate and long-term patency. MethodsWe performed a systematic literature search of endovascular {{and surgical}} repair of <b>thrombosed</b> hemodialysis vascular access. The analysis included meta-analysis, randomized, and population-based studies of <b>thrombosed</b> arteriovenous fistulae and grafts. ResultsOne meta-analysis and eight randomized studies on the treatment of arteriovenous graft thrombosis were identified. Studies conducted before 2002 demonstrated a significantly better primary success rate and primary and secondary patencies of surgical thrombectomy vs endovascular intervention. After 2002, similar results of both techniques have been reported. Only population-based studies on the treatment of <b>thrombosed</b> autogenous arteriovenous fistulae have been published, showing similar outcome of surgical and endovascular intervention in terms of primary success. The long-term primary and secondary patencies are slightly better for surgical treatment, but this concerns only forearm fistulae. ConclusionsThe outcome of endovascular and surgical intervention for <b>thrombosed</b> vascular access is comparable, in particular for <b>thrombosed</b> prosthetic grafts. Surgical treatment of autogenous arteriovenous fistulae is likely to have benefit compared with endovascular means.

40|$|Surrauenv. - Thrombosis, either venous and arterial, is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of death in our society. Thrombin formation is a pivotal step in the pathogenesis of both forms of throm-bosis. Drugs like heparin and yitamin K antagonists act because they inhibit thrombin forma-tion. Better drugs than conventional heparin and oral anticoagulants are howeyer urgently nee-ded. They can be found on basis of a better understanding of thrombin formation. The mechanism of thrombin formation is explained. The mode in which conventional hepa-rin and the newer, low molecular weight heparins inhibit this process is discussed. It is shown that, contrary to current belief, low molecular weight heparins inhibit primarily via their action on thrombin and that the inhibition of factor Xa is of less importance. Thrombin inhibition has u direct qction but also acts indirectly via its influence on thrombin mediated feedback loops. It is argued that rather than anti-factor Xa activity or prolongation of some type of coagulation time, the time-concentration integral of thrombin (thrombin potential) in clotting plasma should be used as a yardstick for the efficiency of a thrombin inhibiting drug. <b>Thrombose</b> et thrombine.
