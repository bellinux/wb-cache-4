50|$|Polyglyphanodontia is an extinct clade of lizards {{from the}} Cretaceous that {{includes}} around a dozen genera. Polyglyphanodontians were {{the dominant group}} of lizards in North America and Asia during the Late Cretaceous. Most polyglyphanodontians are Late Cretaceous in age, though the oldest one, Kuwajimalla kagaensis, is known from the Early Cretaceous (Valanginian to Hauterivian) Kuwajima Formation (Japan). Early Cretaceous South American taxon Tijubina, and possibly also Olindalacerta, might also fall within Polyglyphanodontia or be closely allied to the group, but if so, {{they would be the}} only known Gondwanan examples of an otherwise Laurasian clade. They produced a remarkable range of forms. Chamopsiids, including Chamops, were characterized by large, blunt, crushing teeth, and were most likely omnivores. Macrocephalosaurus, from the Gobi Desert, was a specialized herbivore; it grew to roughly a meter long and had multicusped, leaf-shaped teeth like those of modern iguanas. Polyglyphanodon, from the Maastrichtian of Utah, was another herbivore, but its teeth formed a series of transverse blades, similar to those of Trilophosaurus. Peneteius had remarkable, multicusped teeth, similar to those of mammals. The polyglyphanodontids first appear {{in the latter part of}} the Early Cretaceous in North America, and became extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. Polyglyphanodontians closely resembled the <b>teiid</b> <b>lizards,</b> and purported <b>teiid</b> <b>lizards</b> from the Late Cretaceous appear to be polyglyphanodontians.|$|E
5000|$|A {{large-scale}} phylogenetic {{analysis of}} squamates conducted by Conrad (2008) found polyglyphanodontians (called Polyglyphanodontidae by Conrad) to be {{closely related to}} <b>teiid</b> <b>lizards.</b> In the strict consensus tree recovered in the analysis, polyglyphanodontids {{were part of a}} polytomy (unresolved evolutionary relationship) with teiids, gymnophthalmids, Chamops and lacertids; in the Adams consensus tree polyglyphanodontids were the sister group to teiids. (Some other studies that recognize a close relationship between polyglyphanodontians and teiids use the name Borioteiioidea rather than Polyglyphanodontia, although Borioteiioidea encompasses only North American polyglyphanodontians.) Conrad's analysis also recovered Sineoamphisbaena, a Cretaceous lizard that resembles legless amphisbaenian lizards, as a member of Polyglyphanodontidae. On the other hand, a later large-scale phylogenetic analysis of fossil and living squamates published in 2012 by Gauthier et al. found that Polyglyphanodontia was not particularly closely related to teiids, but rather that it was the sister taxon of the clade containing the extinct marine mosasaurs, their closest relatives and the major lizard group Scleroglossa. Because the first scleroglossans appear in the Late Jurassic, polyglyphanodontians must also have originated in the Late Jurassic if this phylogeny is correct. However, polyglyphanodontians are limited to the Cretaceous, meaning that a long ghost lineage may exist. The primary analysis of Gauthier et al. (2012) did not find polyglyphanodontians and Sineoamphisbaena to be closely related; however, the authors noted that when all snake-like squamates and mosasaurs were removed from the analysis, and burrowing squamates were then added individually to it, Sineoamphisbaena grouped with polyglyphanodontians. Gauthier et al. (2012) considered it possible that Sineoamphisbaena was a burrowing polyglyphanodontian, though, agreeing with. Subsequent analyses based on [...] have also supported Sineoamphisbaenia as a polyglyphanodontian (the combined molecular and morphological analysis of Müller et al.; in the morphology only analyses carried out by Wiens et al. but not their combined molecular and morphological analyses; and in morphology only analyses carried out by [...] who were describing new polyglyphanodontians from Asia and Tianyusaurus).|$|E

Significant differences in sperm dimensions between Cnemidophorus and Aspidoscelis support the recent splitting of these two lineages into different genera. Our results revealed high levels of inter-generic variability in sperm ultrastructure within Teiidae, which produces a data set useful in analyzing relationships between genera and families. In phylogenetic analyses, however, sampling multiple species within teiid genera is essential and recording sperm measurements may profitably complement qualitative ultrastructural characters, maximizing the information content of these structures.

40|$|Aspiration {{breathing}} {{is the dominant}} mechanism of lung inflation among extant amniotes. However, aspiration has two fundamental problems associated with it: paradoxical visceral translation and partial lung collapse. These can constrain the inspiratory tidal volume, reduce the effective lung ventilation, and ultimately curtail the aerobic capacity of an animal. Separation of the pleural and peritoneal cavities by an intracoelomic septum can restrict the cranial shift of abdominal viscera and provide structural support to the caudal lung surface. A muscular septum, such as the diaphragm of mammals or the diaphragmaticus of crocodilians, can exert active control over visceral translation {{and the degree of}} lung inflation. To a lesser degree, a nonmuscular septum can also function as a passive barrier when stretched taut by rib rotation. Studies of the posthepatic septum in <b>teiid</b> <b>lizards</b> and the postpulmonary septum in varanid lizards underscore the importance of nonmuscular septa in aspiration. These septa provide plausible functional models that help us infer the evolution of mammalian and avian lung ventilatory systems, respectively. Wilfried Klein, Tomasz Owerkowic...|$|E

Meiotic data are also included. Karyotypes of K. paulensis, K. vanzoi, and C. ocellifer are reported here for the first time. Inter-generic variability in Ag-NORs location was detected with NORs occurring at the end of long arm of pair 1 in K. calcarata, K. paulensis, and K. vanzoi; pair 5 in C. ocellifer and pair 7 in A. ameiva. the location of NORs, along with the karyological differences between A. ameiva and the Central American species (A. auberi), corroboretes the molecular-based hypothesis that the genus Ameiva is paraphyletic. Inter-populational heteromorphism in Ag-NORs size was detected between populations of C. ocellifer. RBG and CBG banding data demonstrated that the biarmed condition of the C. ocellifer chromosomes is due to multiple pericentric inversion events instead of addition of constitutive heterochromatin.

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{previously}} {{reported that a}} <b>Teiid</b> <b>lizard</b> red blood cells (RBCs) such as Ameiva ameiva and Tupinambis merianae controls intracellular calcium levels by displaying multiple mechanisms. In these cells, calcium stores could be discharged not only by: thapsigargin, {{but also by the}} Na + /H + ionophore monensin, K + /H + ionophore nigericin and the H + pump inhibitor bafilomycin as well as ionomycin. Moreover, these lizards possess a P 2 Y-type purinoceptors that mobilize Ca 2 + from intracellular stores upon ATP addition. Results Here we report, that RBCs from the tropidurid lizard Tropidurus torquatus store Ca 2 + in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pool but unlike in the referred Teiidae, these cells do not store calcium in monensin-nigericin sensitive pools. Moreover, mitochondria from T. torquatus RBCs accumulate Ca 2 +. Addition of ATP to a calcium-free medium does not increase the [Ca 2 +] c levels, however in a calcium medium we observe an increase in cytosolic calcium. This is an indication that purinergic receptors in these cells are P 2 X-like. Conclusion T. torquatus RBCs present different mechanisms from <b>Teiid</b> <b>lizard</b> red blood cells (RBCs), for controlling its intracellular calcium levels. At T. torquatus the ion is only stored at endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Moreover activation of purinergic receptor, P 2 X type, was able to induce an influx of calcium from extracelullar medium. These studies contribute {{to the understanding of the}} evolution of calcium homeostasis and signaling in nucleated RBCs. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} pattern of limbs in the <b>teiid</b> <b>lizard</b> genus Bachia is described and discussed. The pattern which has emerged for Bachia is as follows: Reduction of the limb and girdles can {{be correlated with}} {{the length of the}} limb and the terminal structures of the appendage; the reduction is greater in the hindlimbs than the forelimbs. with the complete loss of hindlimb externally. The forelimbs are greatly reduced (down to 2 - 3 mm in length), but are not lost externally. Comparison of the limbs of the species of Bachia suggests that the pattern of limb formation is a result of paedomorphic development. Comparison of the limb structure with other genera of limb-reduced or limbless forms results in the construction of two possible models: 1) the loss of hindlimbs first with reduction or loss of forelimbs and 2) loss of the forelimbs with reduction, loss or modifications of the hindlimbs.

Here we compare head and skull morphology, bite forces, and feeding kinematics of a snail-crushing <b>teiid</b> <b>lizard</b> (Dracaena guianensis) with those in a closely related omnivorous species (Tupinambis merianae). Our data show that juvenile D. guianensis differ from T. merianae in having bigger heads and greater bite forces. Adults, however, do not differ in bite force. A comparison of feeding kinematics in adult Dracaena and Tupinambis revealed that Dracaena typically use more transport cycles, yet are more agile in manipulating snails. During transport, the tongue plays an important role in manipulating and expelling shell fragments before swallowing. Although Dracaena is slow, these animals are very effective in crushing and processing hard-shelled prey. J. Exp. Zool. 317 A: 371 - 381, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

Young asexual stages and gametocytes are at first polar in the erythrocyte but with elongation, move to a lateral position.

With growth the gametocytes eventually assume a smooth, curved cylindrical shape, with evenly rounded ends. Pigment is scattered or concentrated around a conspicuous vacuole which is slowly developed as the gametocytes mature. Mature male parasites measured 11. 8 x 4. 0 μm (9. 6 x 4. 2 - 13. 2 x 3. 6 μm), shape-index 2. 9 (2. 2 - 5. 0), and females 13. 5 x 4. 5 μm (12. 0 x 4. 5 - 15. 0 x 4. 8 μm), shape-index 3. 0 (2. 2 - 3. 8).

Based on the ontogenetic shift from insectivory to herbivory observed in other herbivorous lizards, we hypothesized that juvenile D. guttulatum would have an omnivorous or insectivorous diet. We found D. guttulatum to be almost exclusively herbivorous (78 – 100 %) and to feed largely (12 – 95 %) on mesquite (Prosopis pallida) leaves and flowers across all plant communities and locations. Contrary to our predictions, there was a large overlap in diet between adult males and juveniles, whereas adult females were most likely to include plant species other than P. pallida in their diet. The consistency of herbivory in both juveniles and adults makes the origin of herbivory in D. guttulatum very interesting.

The karyotypes of all species presented 12 macrochromosomes identical in morphology, but differed in the number of microchromosomes: 22 in C. amazonicus, 24 in T. teguixin and 26 in T. quadrilineatus and T. merianae. The Ag-NOR located at the secondary constriction at the distal end of pair 2 is shared by all species, contrasting with the variability observed for this character in species of the related Teiinae. CBG-banding revealed a species-specific pattern in T. quadrilineatus with conspicuous interstitial C-blocks at the proximal region of the long arm of pair 4 and the whole heterochromatic short arm of pair 6. The karyological data reported here corroborates the relationship hypothesis obtained for Tupinambis based on molecular characters. T. teguixin presents the putative ancestral karyotype for the genus with 2 n = 36 whereas T. merianae and T. quadrilineatus exhibit 2 n = 38, due to an additional pair of microchromosomes.
