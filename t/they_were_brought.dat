5|$|An {{earthquake}} {{opens up}} a previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave {{near the village of}} Ur on the floating continent. Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's impact and come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> up, in order to bring balance back to the world.|$|E

Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E

However, with Cromwell's troops in Lothian, the honours could not be {{returned}} to Edinburgh. The Earl Marischal, as Marischal of Scotland, had formal responsibility for the honours, and in June the Privy Council duly decided to place them at Dunnottar. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> to the castle by Katherine Drummond, hidden in sacks of wool.

Coppola then appealed his suit, {{taking it to the}} California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> too late.

5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her. She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he should tell his wife how he feels about her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer and then get rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too lazy to actually do it. At the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E
5|$|The Newfoundland pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{originating}} in Newfoundland, Canada. They are sturdy and muscular ponies, {{found in many}} colors, including the relatively rare white coloration. The Newfoundland developed from a mix of English, Irish and Scottish pony breeds brought to Newfoundland by settlers {{over a period of}} four centuries. Initially free-roaming, they crossbred to produce the modern type. They were used by settlers as draft and multi-purpose ponies until the mid-20th century, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> {{almost to the point of}} extinction by mechanization and slaughter. The population rebounded slightly after the formation of a breed registry in 1980, but still remains low. In 1997, the Newfoundland pony was declared a heritage breed of Newfoundland and Labrador, which afforded it protection under the law, but the breed has not yet been recognized under the Canadian federal Animal Pedigree Act. As of 2008, there were 248 registered ponies of breeding age, out of a total population of 361. In 2013, the widely dispersed breeding population is still estimated at between 200 and 250 animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Toshiyuki Itahana. In common with his typical drawing style for characters, Itahana created Wol to be a heroic fantasy character that both fitted within and did not conform to earlier Final Fantasy titles. He and other designers created the multiple job outfits to further convey the fantasy setting. After its reveal, some changes {{were made to the}} character's initial costume: due to negative player feedback about the amount of skin shown, the Onion Swordsman outfit was adjusted to be more covering. The game's environments were designed by Takako Miyake, who had previously worked on console Final Fantasy titles. She did not change her working style for Mobius Final Fantasy: all the assets were designed in high definition, and only adjusted slightly when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> into the mobile environment. The visual effects were handled by company veteran Shintaro Takai, whose main preoccupation was to make sure the game did not slow down during the flashier visual combat effects due to hardware constraints. The cutscenes were not affected by these issues.|$|E

5|$|After Maidan Castle, Wheeler {{turned his}} {{attention}} to France, where the archaeological investigation of Iron Age sites had lagged behind developments in Britain. There, he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of Leslie Scott, beginning with a survey tour of Brittany in the winter of 1936–37. After this, Wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at Camp d'Artus, near Huelgoat, Finistère. In addition to bringing many British archaeologists to work on the site, he hired six local Breton workmen to assist the project, coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local Iron Age tribes to defend themselves from the Roman invasion led by Julius Caesar. Meanwhile, Scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of Kercaradec, near Quimper. In July 1939, the project focused its attention on Normandy, with excavations beginning at the Iron Age hill forts of Camp de Canada and Duclair. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> to an abrupt halt in September 1939 as the Second World War broke out in Europe, and the team evacuated back to Britain. Wheeler's excavation report, co-written with Katherine Richardson, was eventually published as Hill-forts of Northern France in 1957.|$|E

5|$|Born in Tokyo to British parents, deHavilland and {{her younger}} sister Joan moved with their mother to California in 1919. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> up by their mother Lilian, a former stage actress who taught them drama, music, and elocution. De Havilland made her acting debut in amateur theatre in Alice in Wonderland. Later, she {{appeared}} in a local production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which led to her playing Hermia in Max Reinhardt's stage production of the play and a movie contract with Warner Bros. Olivia deHavilland made her screen debut in Reinhardt's A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1935. Her career playing demure ingénues opposite popular leading men, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made nine films. They became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. She achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedy films, such as The Great Garrick (1937), and in Westerns, such as Dodge City (1939). Her natural beauty and refined acting style made her particularly effective in historical period dramas, such as Anthony Adverse (1936), and romantic dramas, such as Hold Back the Dawn (1941). In her later career, she was most successful in dramas, such as Light in the Piazza (1962), and unglamorous roles in psychological dramas including Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964).|$|E
5|$|Logan's retrial {{began in}} June 2007, with the {{prosecution}} unable to use Logan's confession to present its case for conviction, for the judiciary had ruled {{that it had been}} obtained with impropriety. In the retrial, the prosecution used the same argument it had used in the original trial back in 2003, arguing that Logan's insanity defense was illegitimate due to his usage of illegal controlled substances. The state's prosecution argued that Logan himself was solely responsible for any deficiencies in his mental health, saying that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> about through his consumption of illegal narcotics, such as cocaine and marijuana, two illegal controlled substances which he had used {{on the day of the}} murders. Ultimately, the first attempt at a retrial ended in June 2007 with a mistrial after jurors couldn't come to a verdict after ten hours of deliberations. On July 1, 2007, Logan's attorney died after being involved in an automobile collision on Route 10 in Glen Burnie, further complicating matters. However, a few months later, Logan was subsequently convicted again after pleading guilty and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment on October 24, 2007, with credit for the five years he had already served, much to the disappointment of the victims' surviving family members, who felt he deserved a lifelong imprisonment for his crime.|$|E
