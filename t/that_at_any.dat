5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's going to stop. It says <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E
5|$|The Waldorf–Astoria gained {{significant}} renown for its fundraising {{dinners and}} balls, regularly attracting notables {{of the day}} such as Andrew Carnegie who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. On February 11, 1899, Oscar of the Waldorf hosted a lavish dinner reception which the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some $250 was spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green turtle soup, lobster, ruddy duck and blue raspberries. Two months later, 120 sailors of the cruiser Raleigh were given a banquet, during which the gallery was decorated with silk banners and flags. One article that year claimed <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> one time the hotel had $7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests. In 1909, banquets, attended by hundreds, were organized for Arctic explorer Frederick Cook in September and Elbert Henry Gary, a founder of US Steel, the following month.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} Tuvaluans are {{employed}} as merchant seamen on cargo ships on contracts {{of up to}} 12 months. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that, as of 2011, there were 800 Tuvaluan men trained, certified and active as seafarers. The ADB estimates <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> one time, about 15 percent of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers. The Ahrenkiel Group of Germany is the shipping company that is the primary employer of Tuvaluan seafarers. The SWIRE shipping company also employs Tuvaluan seafarers.|$|E
25|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{is a consequence}} of a female-biased operational sex ratio. This means <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> given time, there are more females than males seeking to copulate. This occurs because males lose up to 11% of their body mass during mating and once they are done mating, they need time to sequester resources {{that will allow them to}} deliver a spermatophore to the next female they mate with. On the contrary, females do not need time to prepare for their next copulation. Due to the unequal mating rates, males become valuable to females and female-to-female competition rises dramatically as a consequence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, {{as a result of}} unusually high summertime temperatures, many MARTA rail cars became overheated, {{damaging}} on-board propulsion equipment. As a result, many trains broke down and had to be taken out of service for repair. This was further compounded by the fact <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> given time up to 50 older rail cars were out of service as part of MARTA's rail car rehabilitation project. To compensate for the reduced number of operating rail cars, MARTA shortened trains from six to four cars in length. This sometimes resulted in almost half of the trains being shortened, creating crowded conditions for passengers.|$|E

25|$|The Twelve Traditions {{encourage}} {{members to}} practice the spiritual principle of anonymity in the public media and members are also asked to respect each others' confidentiality. This is a group norm, however, and not legally mandated; there are no legal consequences to discourage those attending twelve-step groups from revealing information disclosed during meetings. Statutes on group therapy do not encompass those associations that lack a professional therapist or clergyman to whom confidentiality and privilege might apply. Professionals and paraprofessionals who refer patients to these groups, to avoid both civil liability and licensure problems, have been advised that they should alert their patients <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> time, their statements made in meetings may be disclosed.|$|E
25|$|Tuvaluans {{are well}} known for their {{seafaring}} skills, with the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute on Amatuku motu (island), Funafuti, providing training to approximately 120 marine cadets each year so {{that they have the}} skills necessary for employment as seafarers on merchant shipping. The Tuvalu Overseas Seamen's Union (TOSU) is the only registered trade union in Tuvalu. It represents workers on foreign ships. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that 800 Tuvaluan men are trained, certified and active as seafarers. The ADB estimates <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> one time, about 15% of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers. Job opportunities also exist as observers on tuna boats where the role is to monitor compliance with the boat's tuna fishing licence.|$|E
25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling to think <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to}} be ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E

25|$|A {{military}} dolphin is {{a dolphin}} trained for military uses. A number of militaries have employed dolphins for various purposes from finding mines to rescuing lost or trapped humans. The military use of dolphins, however, drew scrutiny during the Vietnam War when rumors circulated that the United States Navy was training dolphins to kill Vietnamese divers. The United States Navy denies <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> point dolphins were trained for combat. Dolphins {{are still being}} trained by the United States Navy for other tasks {{as part of the}} U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program. The Russian military is believed to have closed its marine mammal program in the early 1990s. In 2000 the press reported that dolphins trained to kill by the Soviet Navy had been sold to Iran.|$|E
25|$|The {{paradoxical}} {{aspect of}} the twins' situation arises from the fact <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> given moment the travelling twin's clock is running slow in the earthbound twin's inertial frame, but based on the relativity principle one could equally argue that the earthbound twin's clock is running slow in the travelling twin's inertial frame. One proposed resolution is that the earthbound twin is at rest in the same inertial frame throughout the journey, while the travelling twin is not: in the simplest version of the thought-experiment, the travelling twin switches at {{the midpoint of the}} trip from being at rest in an inertial frame with velocity in one direction (away from the earth) to being at rest in an inertial frame with velocity in the opposite direction (towards the earth).|$|E
25|$|Although many {{companies}} offer courses in stock picking, and numerous experts report success through technical analysis and fundamental analysis, many economists and academics state {{that because of}} the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) it is unlikely that any amount of analysis can help an investor make any gains above the stock market itself. In the distribution of investors, many academics believe that the richest are simply outliers in such a distribution (i.e. in a game of chance, they have flipped heads twenty times in a row). When money is put into the stock market, it is done with the aim of generating a return on the capital invested. Many investors try not only to make a profitable return, but also to outperform, or beat, the market. However, market efficiency - championed in the EMH formulated by Eugene Fama in 1970, suggests <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> given time, prices fully reflect all available information on a particular stock and/or market.|$|E

25|$|While one Days follows their Lord, their {{counterpart}} {{lives in}} a monastery-type environment in the far north of Orwynne, kept away from anything other than their principal purpose, to compile the life journal of their chosen Runelord. The power of the Days order comes from knowing <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> given time they {{can find out what}} is happening to any particular noble at any place in the world. Therefore, should they wish to, the Days could influence events on a kingdom-wide scale. However, their service is completely focused upon observation, with a strict policy of noninterference – {{even in the face of}} cataclysmic war they would not act to save millions, nor would a Days stop to save a single drowning person. Rumors and legends abound, though, of some Days or another betraying his vows of noninterference and sharing knowledge with his lord. They also seem to use their knowledge to tear down lords who attempt to drive them away, sharing the lord's plans and secrets with his enemies.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the early}} Shia {{differed}} only marginally from mainstream Sunnis in their views on political leadership, {{but it is possible}} in this sect to see a refinement of Shia doctrine. Early Sunnis traditionally held that the political leader must come from the tribe of Muhammad—namely, the Quraysh tribe. The Zaydis narrowed the political claims of Ali's supporters, claiming that not just any descendant of Ali would be eligible to lead the Muslim community (ummah) but only those males directly descended from Muhammad through the union of Ali and Fatimah. But during the Abbasid revolts, other Shia, who {{came to be known as}} Imamiyyah (followers of the Imams), followed the theological school of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, himself the great great grandson of Muhammad's son-in-law Imam Ali. They asserted a more exalted religious role for Imams and insisted <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> given time, whether in power or not, a single male descendant of Ali and Fatimah was the divinely appointed Imam and the sole authority, in his time, on all matters of faith and law. To those Shia, love of the imams and of their persecuted cause became as important as belief in God's oneness and the mission of Muhammad.|$|E
