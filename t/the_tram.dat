5|$|A {{full-size}} mockup of {{the front}} of <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> was constructed in 2009 and displayed on Princes Street for public viewing, moving to Constitution Street {{at the foot of}} Leith Walk in April 2009.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{maintenance}} of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered. Competition from private buses, the MTT's own bus fleet and the growth of private car ownership all took patrons from <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> network. By the 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> network was losing money and being replaced by an electric and petrol-driven bus fleet. Adelaide's tram history is preserved by the volunteer-run Tramway Museum, St Kilda and the continuing use of 1929 H type trams on the remaining Glenelg tram line.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, final {{contracts}} to build <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> system were awarded to BSC, {{a consortium of}} Bilfinger Berger, Siemens and Spanish tram builder Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF).|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> {{was carried out}} by the agency RCP Design Global which covered the general concept, indoor {{environment}} and the outer casing of <b>the</b> <b>trams.</b> <b>The</b> livery of <b>trams</b> is blue and white.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>trams</b> on <b>the</b> network run on [...] track. Initially, {{they were}} powered by {{compressed}} air, but from 1894, <b>the</b> air <b>trams</b> were supplemented by steam <b>trams.</b> Since 1901, <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> have been powered by electricity, at 600 V DC.|$|R
50|$|Kolkata {{is a city}} {{which have}} a rich {{heritage}} for having its own transport system. It is the only city in India to have a <b>tram</b> network. <b>The</b> <b>trams</b> are claimed to slow down other traffic, leading to groups who currently voice abolishing <b>the</b> <b>trams,</b> though <b>the</b> environment-friendliness and the old charm of <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> attract many people.|$|R
5|$|Production of {{electricity}} in the station ceased in 1919, ushered in by the completion of an extension to generating equipment at Newburn Steelworks. The building was retained and continued {{to be used to}} supply power to <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> route by housing a sub-station, which used rotary converters. The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> route was closed. The station's chimney was demolished in 1949, along with remaining structures of the Tyne Iron Works, which had stood next to the power station throughout its operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{light rail}} model {{would have used}} the same {{approach}} as <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> in Ørestad, but would instead have run through a tunnel in the city centre. The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger {{because it would have}} to accommodate overhead wires. The system would have the same frequency as <b>the</b> <b>tram,</b> but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest passenger capacity, the lowest visual and noise impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest net present value.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tram</b> cost $57 {{million to}} build—a nearly {{fourfold}} increase over initial cost estimates, {{which was one}} of several sources of controversy concerning the project.|$|E
50|$|Each 25 m (82 ft) long tram {{can carry}} 192 people, 50 of them seated (about the {{capacity}} of three buses). Access to <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> is at platform level, making it easy for handicapped passengers to get on and off through <b>the</b> <b>tram's</b> eight doors. Speakers in <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> play music and announce each stop. All trams are equipped with climatization.|$|R
50|$|On 22 June 1989, {{the city}} council voted to re-open the line from St. Olavs Gate to Lian. A private company, Gråkallbanen, had been founded to operate <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> without subsidies. Agreements were made to take over seven of <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> from Trondheim Trafikkselskap. <b>The</b> <b>trams</b> would remain owned by the municipality, but rented free of charge to the new company.|$|R
50|$|The city of Gothenburg, Sweden, ordered 40 one-directional Sirio trams {{which were}} {{to be put into}} service on <b>the</b> Gothenburg <b>tram</b> network during 2005 and onwards. <b>The</b> <b>trams</b> were {{delivered}} late and functioned poorly when put into traffic. Among reported problems were excessive track damage caused by <b>the</b> <b>trams,</b> malfunctioning air conditioners inside <b>the</b> <b>trams,</b> and poor ride quality. The City of Gothenburg therefore withheld {{a large part of the}} payment for a delivered tram until fully operational.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tram</b> {{station is}} served by line 17 of the Oslo Tramway. It {{operates}} on a ten-minute headway to the city center. Travel time to Jernbanetorget is 13 minutes. Northwards, the line continues to the final station, Grefsen. While <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> and rapid transit stations are {{within walking distance of}} each other, they are not marked as transfer stations on the schedules. The trams are operated by Oslo Sporvognsdrift on contract with Ruter.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tram</b> {{station is}} served by lines 11, 12 and 13 of the Oslo Tramway. Southbound, all three follow the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line to the city center. Travel time to Kirkeristen is 15 minutes. Northwards, line 11 and 12 {{continue}} on the Kjelsås Line. Both run to Kjelsås outside rush hour, but during peak services, line 12 terminates at the next station, Disen. Line 13 branches off and heads one stop to Grefsen. <b>The</b> <b>tram</b> service is provided by Oslo Sporvognsdrift on contract with Ruter. Storo is one of eight transfer points between the tramway and rapid transit systems.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tram</b> was jointly {{funded by}} OHSU, the City of Portland, and by South Waterfront {{property}} owners, {{with most of}} the funding coming from OHSU. It is owned by the city and operated by OHSU. While most passengers are affiliated with OHSU, it {{is open to the public}} and operated as part of Portland's public transportation network that includes the Portland Streetcar, MAX Light Rail, and TriMet buses. After opening in December 2006, <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> carried its one millionth passenger on October 17, 2007 and its ten millionth rider on January 8, 2014. A round-trip ticket costs $4.70 but are free for OHSU patients and certain visitors; OHSU employees and students ride free by showing their ID badges.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{deficiencies}} {{with the}} trains, a transitional timetable {{was put in}} place for 2013, which added extra peak time journeys using <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> if they were available, and the replacement of <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> with buses if they were not. In addition, since the timetable change, <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> have been used on the newly opened line 22. Owing to the problems with <b>the</b> <b>trams,</b> MVG announced on 28 September 2012 that they had chose not to exercise their option of a further eight trams, instead ordering eight new Siemens Avenio <b>trams,</b> designated as <b>the</b> T series.|$|R
50|$|The system's primary {{infrastructure}} {{consists of}} a single guide-way with a bypass. When approaching the Center station, one tram veers off from the main guideway into the bypass, allowing <b>the</b> two <b>trams</b> to pass each other. The bypass reconnects to the main portion of the guideway beyond the center station. Operating software attempts to keep <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> synchronized, so that <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> arrive at <b>the</b> Center Station simultaneously, {{but this is not}} essential. In <b>the</b> event that <b>trams</b> lose synchronization, as is frequently the case with passenger induced delays, <b>the</b> first <b>tram</b> to arrive at the Center station will be held until <b>the</b> opposite <b>tram</b> enters <b>the</b> bypass area, providing a clear path for <b>the</b> waiting <b>tram.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the tramways were 1303 + 3349 + 417 = 5069 m. Pécs was the 29th city in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy which had <b>tram</b> line. <b>The</b> <b>trams</b> {{operated}} in only one tramway, and in the decades the tramways and <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> themselves became outdated so in 1960 they decided not to renovate <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> but develop <b>the</b> bus network. The last route was on 31 August 1960.|$|R
5|$|A 2001 {{proposal}} envisaged three routes, lines 1, 2 and 3. The {{first was}} a circular route around the northern suburbs, {{and the others were}} radial routes to Newbridge in the west and Newcraighall in the south. All lines would have passed through the city centre. In May 2004, a 15-year operating contract was awarded to Transdev, to operate and maintain <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> network. This contract was cancelled in 2009.|$|E
5|$|By 1958 <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> {{network was}} reduced to just the Glenelg tram (see Decline of the network). The MTT {{continued}} to operate most of the local bus routes in the inner metropolitan area. In 1975 the services of the MTT became the Bus and Tram division of the State Transport Authority and the MTT ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|Lothian Buses' {{services}} have been integrated with Edinburgh Trams, since the trams commenced operation in 2014 – both {{are owned by}} the council, and Lothian Buses services interchange with the trams at various locations. The now closed guided busway element of Fastlink formed part of phase 1a of <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> permanent way.|$|E
50|$|The two depots for <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> {{are located}} by ulica Stwosza in Strzyży {{and by the}} street ulica Władysława IV in Nowy Port. The depots have a {{capacity}} of approximately 40% of all <b>the</b> <b>trams.</b>|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{passenger}} traffic increased {{as a result}} of petrol rationing and people employed in munitions factories around Geelong. In 1943 <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> carried 6,500,000 people. Because of the shortage of men to work on <b>the</b> <b>trams,</b> <b>the</b> SEC decided to employ women to work as conductors.|$|R
500|$|The SL79 is an {{articulated}} tram built {{exclusively for}} the Oslo Tramway in two series with different specifications. <b>The</b> <b>trams</b> were designed by Duewag, who also built 10 units in Düsseldorf, Germany. Fifteen additional units plus <b>the</b> fifteen <b>trams</b> in <b>the</b> second series were built Strømmen outside Oslo. The motors for the first series was delivered by Duewag, while the second series was built by Asea Brown Boveri at their Norwegian subsidiary NEBB. <b>The</b> <b>trams</b> have a steel frame and are [...] long and [...] wide. Without payload <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> weigh [...]|$|R
5|$|Sinsen {{opened on}} 20 August 2006, {{three years after}} the two other stations. The station is located close to, but not adjacent, to <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> stop Sinsenkrysset on the Sinsen Line (tram no. 17). Located at the {{interchange}} between Ring 3 and Trondheimsveien, it also serves as a bus hub.|$|E
5|$|Storo is a {{rapid transit}} {{station on the}} Ring Line of the Oslo Metro, and a tram station on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line of the Oslo Tramway. It is located at Storo in the Nordre Aker borough of Oslo, Norway. <b>The</b> <b>tram</b> station opened on 28 November 1902, and the rapid transit station on 20 August 2003. Metro lines 4, 5 and 6 run to the station, with line 5 {{terminating}} there. <b>The</b> <b>tram</b> station serves lines 11, 12 and 13. The station is {{within walking distance of}} Grefsen Station on the Gjøvik Line. The station also functions as a bus hub, being located along Ring 3. Storo is a mixed commercial and residential area, and a shopping center is located just north of the subway station.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 1 {{opened on}} March 15, 1963, and was {{expanded}} between 1970 and 1974 {{with the current}} A and B Gates buildings. Currently, Terminal 1 has four concourses, {{each of which is}} connected to a central pre-security area. Ticketing and baggage claim are located on Level 1 of this area. Level 2 houses the three security checkpoints, an esplanade with several retail outlets, and a USO lounge for military service members. West of the pre-security area are the A Gates and the B Gates, two Y-shaped concourses with circular ends. To the south are the C Gates, which can be accessed by the Green Line of <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> system. The satellite D Gates concourse, which opened in 1998, lies to the east and contains three lounges: the Centurion lounge for American Express card holders; the Club at LAS, which is available to all passengers at a fee; and the United Club. The Blue Line of <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> system links the D Gates with the pre-security area.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Glengowrie <b>Tram</b> Depot houses <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> (launched in 1927) which service Adelaide's only {{remaining}} tramline from Adelaide to Glenelg.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trams</b> were {{unidirectional}} and had {{a single}} door at the front and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a single door at <b>the</b> rear. <b>The</b> <b>trams</b> were originally delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with linoleum floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. <b>The</b> <b>trams</b> originally had incandescent light bulbs, but these were replaced with fluorescent lamps after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> were rebuilt to remove the conductor, and the driver was given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had the rear door taken out of use and blocked with an extra seat.|$|R
25|$|Launched in {{an initial}} light grey livery, {{following}} the takeover by Stagecoach <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> were reliveried in Stagecoach's corporate livery from 1997. From 2006 <b>the</b> <b>trams</b> were refurbished, {{and a new}} dedicated Supertram blue–based livery was launched, rolled out by 2008.|$|R
5|$|The {{upper station}} is located {{adjacent}} to OHSU Hospital, on the university's Marquam Hill campus. The two stations are exactly {{east and west}} of each other separated by a horizontal distance of 3,300feet (5/8mi, 1km) and a vertical distance of 500feet (150m). The maximum vertical clearance between <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> and the ground is 175feet (53.4m).|$|E
5|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international experts recommended that <b>the</b> <b>tram</b> company should not choose that solution. The goal was to decrease the weight so the trams could operate with less-powerful motors, giving a lower cost. The first prototype was a full-scale model of a tram, built at Homansbyen Depot in 1935, using an undercarriage from disused horsecars.|$|E
5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than <b>the</b> <b>tram,</b> and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line {{was connected to the}} old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E
