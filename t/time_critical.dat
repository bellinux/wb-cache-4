5|$|Some {{treatments}} for stroke are time-critical. These include clot dissolution or surgical {{removal of a}} clot for ischaemic strokes, and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes. As stroke is <b>time</b> <b>critical,</b> hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the brain. MRI scans, not as widely available, {{may be able to}} demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately, particularly with ischaemic stroke.|$|E

The film was a financial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office, and is credited with catapulting Eastwood into stardom.

Eugene Kelly and a few members from The Reindeer Section also appear as choir in various songs throughout the album. Simpson credited Lee for being supportive of the band, and at the same <b>time</b> <b>critical,</b> when necessary. Each band member used to come to him for opinion on work they were doing. Morale during the sessions was high, with the band feeling a sense of togetherness seeing the hard work everyone was doing.|$|E
500|$|Treatment of an MI is <b>time</b> <b>critical.</b> Aspirin is an {{appropriate}} immediate treatment for a suspected MI. Nitroglycerin or opioids {{may be used to}} help with chest pain; however, they do not improve overall outcomes. Supplemental oxygen should be used in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath. In a STEMI, treatments attempt to restore blood flow to the heart, and include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where the arteries are pushed open and may be stented, or thrombolysis, where the blockage is removed using medications. People who have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are often managed with the blood thinner heparin, with the additional use of PCI in those at high risk. In people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be recommended rather than angioplasty. [...] After an MI, lifestyle modifications, along with long term treatment with aspirin, beta blockers, and statins, are typically recommended.|$|E

500|$|In {{the case}} of Weber's {{critique}} of the left, he complained that {{the leaders of the}} leftist Spartacus League which was led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg and controlled the city government of Berlin while Weber was campaigning for his party: [...] "We have this [...] revolution to thank for the fact that we cannot send a single division against the Poles. All we see is dirt, muck, dung, and horse-play—nothing else. Liebknecht belongs in the madhouse and Rosa Luxemburg in the zoological gardens.” [...] Weber was at the same <b>time</b> <b>critical</b> of the Versailles Treaty which he believed unjustly assigned [...] "war guilt" [...] to Germany when it came to World War I. [...] Weber believed that many countries were guilty of starting World War I, not just Germany. [...] In making this case, Weber argued that “In {{the case of}} this war there is one, and only one power that desired it under all circumstances through its own will and, according to their political goals required: Russia. [...] …It never crossed [...] mind that a German invasion of Belgium [...] was nothing but an innocent act {{on the part of the}} Germans." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{animated}} series {{received a}} generally positive reception in North America. [...] In January 2004, Yu Yu Hakusho {{was named the}} second best action-adventure anime by Anime Insider. It was voted by the users of IGN as the tenth best animated series of all <b>time.</b> <b>Critical</b> reviews focused on the series' attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. Animerica's Justin Kovalsky defined Yu Yu Hakusho as a character-driven series and compared it to other anime like Phantom Quest Corp., Rurouni Kenshin, and Flame of Recca in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology. Allen Divers of the Anime News Network identified Yu Yu Hakusho as [...] "one of the best action series out there", and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series. Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, [...] "It's a fun show with a great cast, a sense of humor, {{and a lot of}} action so there's no excuse not to at least give it a chance." [...] He recommended the first three-season box sets of Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as the original boxset of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show's third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines. N. S. Davidson of IGN concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that good writing, interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime's final episodes that Yu Yu Hakusho possesses all of these qualities. This was concurred upon by Joseph Luster of Otaku USA, who summed up his feelings about the universe of Yu Yu Hakusho by stating, [...] "Togashi's world is eternally hellish and dark, but wildly varied. The only thing that doesn't change throughout its run is the fact that you'll still be rooting for the well-defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode." ...|$|E

[...] Over 3.5 million cubic yards were removed in a 12-month period, with 85% being removed in a 10-month time frame. [...] The time-critical phase accelerated the removal of ash from the river by 75% over original expectations and safely transported it to a permanent, lined and leachate collecting facility in Perry County, Alabama called Arrowhead landfill. [...] Arrowhead landfill is located on {{a thick layer of}} Selma chalk. [...] Significant benefits were derived by the receiving community in both jobs and county improvements.

6000|$|Literary {{success was}} {{followed}} in the usual order by social temptation. Miss Martineau removed from Norwich to London, and she had good reasons for making the change. Her work dealt with matters of a political kind, and she could only secure a real knowledge of what was best worth saying by intercourse with those who had a better point of view for {{a survey of the}} social state of England than could be found in a provincial town like Norwich. So far as evening parties went, Miss Martineau soon perceived how little 'essential difference there is between the extreme case of a cathedral city and that of literary London, or any other place, where dissipation takes the turn of book-talk instead of dancing or masquerading.' She went out to dinner every night except Sundays, and saw all the most interesting people of the London of five-and-forty years ago. While she was free from presumptuousness in her judgments, she was just as free from a foolish willingness to take the reputations of her hour on trust. Her attitude was friendly and sensible, but it was at the same <b>time</b> <b>critical</b> and independent; and that is what every frank, upright, and sterling character naturally becomes in face of an unfamiliar society. Harriet Martineau was too keen-sighted, too aware of the folly and incompetent pretension of half the world, too consciously self-respecting and proud, to take society and its ways with any diffidence or ingenuous simplicity. On the importance of the small littérateur who unreasonably thinks himself a great one, on the airs and graces of the gushing blue-stockings who were in vogue in that day, on the detestable vulgarity of literary lionising, she had no mercy. She recounts with caustic relish the story about a certain pedantical lady, of whom Tierney had said that there was not another head in England that could encounter hers on the subject of Cause and Effect. The story was that when in a country house one fine day she took her seat in a window, saying in a business-like manner (to David Ricardo): 'Come now, let us have a little discussion about Space.' We remember a story about a certain Mademoiselle de Launay, afterwards well known to the Paris of the eighteenth century, being introduced at Versailles by a silly great lady who had an infatuation for her. 'This,' the great lady kept saying, 'is the young person whom I have told you about, who is so wonderfully intelligent, who knows so much. Come, Mademoiselle, pray talk. Now, Madame, you will see how she talks. Well, first of all, now talk a little about religion; then you can tell us about something else.' ...|$|E
