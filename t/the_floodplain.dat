However, numerous exotic plants also inhabit the site.|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple unsteady flow model was proposed which estimates velocities, friction factors and {{the components of}} discharge in the main channel and on <b>the</b> <b>floodplains</b> simultaneously. Bottom roughness of the main channel and <b>the</b> <b>floodplains,</b> <b>the</b> flow resistance of vegetation on <b>the</b> <b>floodplains</b> and <b>the</b> flow resistance caused by the momentum transfer between the main channel and <b>the</b> <b>floodplains</b> {{were included in the}} model using Nuding’s method. A pre-processing program was developed to convert topographic field data that can be derived from a digital terrain model into cross-sectional input data of the flow model. The model was applied to a 28 -km reach on the Upper Rhine for three steady flow cases and for two unsteady flood event cases to investigate resistance effects of partly vegetated floodplains. Computed discharges and water levels correlated well with the measured data. It was found that a significant component of discharge was transported by <b>the</b> <b>floodplains</b> in some cross-sections during high flows. 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|The {{city and}} {{government}} {{decided to change}} the type of development allowed near the river. <b>The</b> <b>floodplain</b> bordering the Red River was converted into a large park known as the Greater Grand Forks Greenway.

East Grand Forks developed a related greenway park on its side of the river, as it has also suffered extensive flooding that year.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There {{is lack of}} {{adequate}} information on the fertility situations of the soils of Abakaliki urban flood plains. Farming activities have therefore been carried out on the surrounding uplands only. This study was therefore conducted in 2009 raining seasons, to evaluate the fertility status of the flood plains and compare it with the fertility of the uplands {{with a view to}} making recommendations for sustainable agricultural production. Soil samples were obtained from <b>the</b> Iyiudene <b>floodplain,</b> Iyiokwu floodplain, Ebonyi river basin and the surrounding upland and subjected to physical and chemical analysis. The soil texture ranged from loam in the upland areas to clay loam in the flood plains and the river basin. Soil bulk density of the upland soils was significantly higher than the flood plains. The bulk density of the flood plains was respectively suitable for crop production. The soil water holding capacity of the upland was rather too low, whereas <b>the</b> <b>floodplains</b> had adequate water holding capacity for crop production purposes. The soil organic matter was generally low for both the upland and the flood plains. However, <b>the</b> <b>floodplains</b> and <b>the</b> river basin soils contained significantly (p< 0. 05) higher organic matter than the upland. The upland soil was very acidic whereas the soils of <b>the</b> <b>floodplains</b> were acidic. <b>The</b> soils available phosphorus was low, however <b>the</b> <b>floodplains</b> had significantly (p< 0. 05) higher soil available P than the upland. Total N, soil pH and exchangeable acidity were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in the upland soils than in the soils of <b>the</b> <b>floodplains.</b> Whereas <b>the</b> <b>floodplains</b> had significantly (p< 0. 05) higher exchangeable Ca, Mg, Na, CEC and base saturation when compared with upland soils. The overall soil fertility status of <b>the</b> <b>floodplains</b> was therefore superior to the upland soils...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>floodplain</b> of Johnson Creek is {{a remnant}} of large glacial floods known as the Missoula Floods that {{deposited}} thick sediments between 18,000 and 13,000years ago in the Columbia River Basin, including much of the Willamette Valley. Underlying the sediments are substantial thicknesses of basalt lavas from the Columbia River Basalt Group. The lava, exposed mainly in the uplands, has been folded and faulted to form a series of sub-basins, including the Johnson Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{literature}} has been preserved {{on a wide}} variety of media. This includes papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of <b>the</b> <b>floodplain</b> of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E
5|$|In the Abrahams Creek watershed, 94 {{percent of}} the rock is {{interbedded}} sedimentary rock. The remaining 6 percent is sandstone. The main rock formations in the watershed of Abrahams Creek include the Catskill Formation, the Llwellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation. These formations mainly consist of coal, limestone, sandstone, shale, and siltstone. The Catskill Formation mainly occurs in the watershed's upper reaches. The Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pocono Formation, and the Pottsville Group occur under the Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge. The Llwellyn Formation also occurs there, in addition to underlying <b>the</b> <b>floodplain</b> in the watershed. A considerable area in the watershed has been strip mined.|$|E

5|$|Latest {{research}} has also shown that Murray cod in fact live their entire lifecycle within the main channel of the stream. Earlier ideas that Murray cod spawn on floodplains, or the larvae feed on floodplains, are incorrect. Murray cod breed in the main river channel or, in times of spring flood, the inundated upper portion of the main channel and tributary channels, but not on floodplains.

5|$|Long before {{non-indigenous}} people {{explored the}} region, tribes of Native Americans fished and hunted along the slough. In the early 19thcentury fur trappers and explorers including Lewis and Clark visited the area before large migrations of settlers began arriving from the east. The newcomers farmed, cut timber, built houses, {{and by the}} early 20thcentury established cities, shipping ports, roads, rail lines and industries near the slough. Increased investment in <b>the</b> <b>floodplain</b> led to larger losses during floods, and these losses prompted levee building that greatly altered the area. A flood pouring through a levee break in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport, which was never rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|Sedimentological {{data from}} the Mussentuchit Member {{indicates}} that Eolambia lived on a poorly-drained floodplain, around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated {{between high and low}} water levels in Milankovitch cycles of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits. During dry periods, the exposed lakebed formed a broad beach devoid of plants. The cracked mud of the lakebed produced mud clasts, while organic debris and scavenged carcasses were scattered around the water's edge as the lake progressively retreated. Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded <b>the</b> <b>floodplain,</b> which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Riverina {{comprises}} several troughs and sedimentary basins. The western Riverina {{is presumed}} to be {{a continuation of the}} Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone while eastern sections are underlain by western portions of the Lachlan Fold Belt. There is potential for the Riverina to host several mineral deposit types including coal, petroleum, coal seam methane, gypsum, orogenic gold, Cobar style polymetallic systems, heavy mineral sands and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins. Riverina soils are generally sandy along the river channels, with more saline grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the perimeter of <b>the</b> <b>floodplain.</b> As the Murrumbidgee passes downstream, the water and soil become more saline.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of Dunedin's settlement, much of the city's growth was on two areas of {{reasonably}} flat land close to the harbour, separated by the large Bell Hill and an area of low swampy land. The northern of these two flat areas surrounded <b>the</b> <b>floodplain</b> of the Water of Leith, a small river that runs through Dunedin. As the city grew the swamp was drained to become the new city's centre, and the hill was lowered by excavation to allow access between the two areas of settlement. A street grid was set up with the main road split in two by the city centre (now The Octagon) - Princes Street to the south and George Street to the north. As with many of the city's other place names, both these names and that of the Water of Leith reflect the names of places in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, the {{southern}} two-thirds of Georgia was declared a disaster by President Bush.
