40|$|We {{describe}} {{in this paper}} a choice relation framework for supporting category-partition test case generation. We capture the constraints among various values (or ranges of values) of the parameters and environment conditions identified from the specification, known formally as choices. We express these constraints in terms of relations among choices and combinations of choices, known formally as <b>test</b> <b>frames.</b> We propose a theoretical backbone and techniques for consistency checks and automatic deductions of relations. Based on the theory, algorithms {{have been developed for}} generating <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> from the relations. These <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> can then be used as the basis for generating test cases. Our algorithms take into consideration the resource constraints specified by software testers, thus maintaining the effectiveness of the <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> (and hence <b>test</b> cases) generated. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for automatically generating logical schemata that specify groups of black-box test cases from formal specifications containing universal and existential quantification. These schemata are called <b>test</b> <b>frames.</b> Previous automated techniques {{have dealt with}} languages based on propositional logic. Since this new technique deals with quantification it {{can be applied to}} more expressive specifications. This makes the technique applicable to specifications written at the system requirements level. The limitations imposed by quanti cation are discussed. Industrial needs are addressed by the capabilities of recognizing and augmenting existing <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> and by accommodating a range of specification-coverage schemes. The coverage scheme taxonomy introduced in this paper provides a standard for controlling the number of <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> produced. This technique is intended to automate portions of what is done manually by practitioners. Basing this technique on formal rules of logical derivation ensures that the <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> produced are logical consequences of the specification. It is expected that deriving <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> automatically will offset the cost of developing a formal specification. This tangible product makes formal specification more economically feasible for industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} strength testing of space steel frame accounting for local buckling was performed. Considering {{a majority of}} large-scale <b>frame</b> <b>tests</b> in the past, only two-dimensional frames or three-dimensional frames comprised of compact section are experimentally studied. Therefore, three-dimensional experiments accounting for local buckling are needed to extend the knowledge of this field. Three two-story, single-bay, and sway allowed frames consisting of non-compact section subjected to proportional vertical and horizontal loads were tested. The details of the <b>test</b> <b>frames,</b> <b>test</b> instruments, and test procedures are presented. The load–displacement curves of the <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> are provided. The experiment results are useful for verification of the three-dimensional analytical models. It was observed that the load carrying capacities calculated by the AISC-LRFD method were 13 – 21 % conservative when {{compared with those of}} the experiment. This difference is attributed {{to the fact that the}} AISC-LRFD approach does not consider the inelastic moment redistribution but the experiment includes the inelastic redistribution effect...|$|R
40|$|An object {{rotating}} {{in depth}} presents a coherent sequence of views but each view is seen only briefly. This scenario raises two questions {{addressed in the}} present study: (1) Do observers encode {{the dynamics of the}} motion sequence or only the discrete views that comprise the sequence? (2) If motion dynamics are encoded, how do they affect recognition? Observers viewed a movie of an object rotating in depth (study) followed by a static frame showing a single view (test) and judged whether study and test showed the same or different objects. We also manipulated the diagnosticity of the shape information present in the stimulus set and where the test view fell along the rotation trajectory implied by the movie (preceding, early, middle, late, following — all equally spaced). We found that: (1) <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> that followed the trajectory of the motion sequence were better recognized than <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> that preceded the motion sequence; (2) <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> that were actually seen in the sequence were better recognized than following test frames; (3) <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> {{from the end of the}} sequence were better recognized than frames from the middle or early part of the sequence. We conclude that observers are biased to encode or remember views that occur near the end of an implied motion trajectory. Moreover, observers use dynamic information to predict unseen views of an object that are consistent with the implied direction of motion. Interestingly, a similar pattern across test conditions was observed for both same and different object trials, suggesting that information encoded about object dynamics is not limited to the particular object being viewed, but instead generalizes to visually-similar objects...|$|R

5000|$|Latency: {{measures}} the round-trip time {{taken by a}} <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> to travel through a network device or across the network {{and back to the}} test port. Latency is the time interval that begins when the last bit of the input frame reaches the input port and ends when the first bit of the output frame is seen on the output port. It is the time taken by a bit to go through the network and back. Latency variability can be a problem. With protocols like voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), a variable or long latency can cause degradation in voice quality.|$|E
50|$|Partly {{because of}} this {{deliberate}} design decision to help shield users from component failures, the few shared markers contain {{a great deal of}} self-checking circuitry. This is feasible because {{there are only a few}} markers, and beneficial because their correct function was critical. Digit codes, for instance, are checked to ensure that exactly two out of the five lines are activated. When the built-in self-test circuits of a marker detect an error, a large punch card is produced at the test station recording the failure in order to assist the switchmen in detecting it and diagnosing the source. The card punch, with some cards, is visible in the lower left of the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> picture below.|$|E

MTF can select particular outgoing trunks, including testing {{the ability of the}} markers to select different lines to particular trunks. This test facility became more valuable as Centrex, direct distance dialing, and other innovations brought more complications to the tasks of translation and trunk selection.

Shaking table test is carried out to estimate the modal properties of the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> such as natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes. Among many different model structures, ARX (Auto Recursive Exogenous) model structure is used for modal identification of the frame structure system. The unknown parameters in the obtained ARX model structure are estimated by Least-Square method by minimizing the AIC criteria {{with the help of}} a program coded in advanced computing software MATLAB®.

40|$|Advances {{in space}} {{telescope}} and aperture technology {{have created a}} need to launch larger structures into space. Traditional truss structures will be too heavy and bulky to be effectively used {{in the next generation}} of space-based structures. Large deployable structures are a possible solution.

It involves identification of maximum bugs which is currently being available in the functional blocks or some behaviour by which some faults might occur in future. It is of two basic types black box and white box and they differ in their working area. Black box works by verifying the overall behaviour of functional bock without knowing the internal logics. White box deals with internal structure of the programs. Both testing methodology requires some functional and cost drivers for performing test. Some of these are test cases, suites and <b>test</b> <b>frames,</b> <b>test</b> oracles, sequences, reordering, coverage, fault detection rate etc. Above factors are selectively applied with testing mechanism for verifying the behaviour of the code.
