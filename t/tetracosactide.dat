50|$|The ACTH test (also {{called the}} cosyntropin, <b>tetracosactide,</b> or Synacthen test) {{is a medical}} test usually ordered and {{interpreted}} by endocrinologists to assess {{the functioning of the}} adrenal glands stress response by measuring the adrenal response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; corticotropin) or another corticotropic agent such as <b>tetracosactide</b> (cosyntropin, tetracosactrin; Synacthen) or alsactide (Synchrodyn). ACTH is a hormone produced in the anterior pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal glands to release cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and aldosterone.|$|E

40|$|Context: During a {{clinical}} trial of regular <b>tetracosactide</b> depot injections, four of 13 patients with autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) developed adverse reactions immediately following <b>tetracosactide</b> injections. We wished to investigate whether these adverse effects {{could be due to}} the production of circulating antitetracosactide (ACTH 1 - 24) antibodies. Design: Anti-ACTH binding activity was investigated using immunoblotting and ELISA on sera from participants in the trial (n = 13; baseline and after <b>tetracosactide</b> exposure), 131 unrelated patients with AAD, 92 patients with Graves' disease (GD), 15 patients with isolated ACTH deficiency and 102 controls. Immunohistochemistry of human pituitary tissue sections was also performed using pooled sera. Results: Bands at approximately 4 and 6 kDa, corresponding to ACTH 1 - 24 and full-length ACTH 1 - 39, respectively, were found in 10 of 13 (77 %) of sera from trial patients exposed to <b>tetracosactide,</b> including all those who had an adverse reaction.

40|$|Background Infantile spasms, which {{comprise}} a severe infantile seizure disorder, {{have a high}} morbidity and are difficult to treat. Hormonal treatments (adrenocorticotropic hormone and prednisolone) have been the main therapy for decades, although little evidence supports their use. Vigabatrin has been recorded to have a beneficial effect in this disorder. We aimed to compare the effects of vigabatrin with those of prednisolone and <b>tetracosactide</b> {{in the treatment of}} infantile spasms. Methods The United Kingdom Infantile Spasms Study assessed these treatments in a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in 150 hospitals in the UK. The primary outcome was cessation of spasms on days 13 and 14. Minimum doses were vigabatrin 100 mg/kg per day, oral prednisolone 40 mg per day, or intramuscular <b>tetracosactide</b> depot 0 · 5 mg (40 IU) on alternate days. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings Of 208 infants screened and assessed, 107 were randomly assigned to vigabatrin (n= 52) or hormonal treatments (prednisolone n= 30, <b>tetracosactide</b> n= 25). None was lost to follow-up. Proportions with no spasms on days 13 and 14 were: 40 (73 %) of 55 infants assigned hormonal treatments (prednisolone 21 / 30 [70 %], <b>tetracosactide</b> 19 / 25 [76 %]) and 28 (54 %) of 52 infants assigned vigabatrin (difference 19 %, 95 % CI 1 %– 36 %, p= 0 · 043).

In {{the absence of the}} polymer the peptide did not degrade or aggregate irreversibly when in contact with methanol and methylene chloride or under the conditions used in the first step of WOW, as proven by HPLC, electrospray-mass spectrometry (MS) and circular dichroism (CD). During the extraction process, used to isolate the peptide from the microparticles, <b>tetracosactide</b> was partially oxidised. The highest stability of the peptide during microencapsulation was guaranteed with high molecular weight l-PLA, when using WOW or ASES, and with very low molecular weight PLGA, in the case of spray drying and WOW.

Exceptionally, in the case of very low molecular weight PLGA, to which <b>tetracosactide</b> showed a very strong affinity during the in vitro adsorption study, no burst effect was observed. In addition, these microparticles released the peptide continuously, whereas for the others, composed of high molecular weight PLA and PLGA, the burst release was followed by a lag phase. During in vitro release peptide degradation increased with increasing polymer hydrophilicity but could be reduced by increasing drug loading.

40|$|Introduction: Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} (CAH) due to 21 -Hydroxylase deficiency {{occurs in}} 90 - 95 % of cases, being a common autosomal recessive condition that can present {{with a wide}} range of hyperandrogenemic signs in childhood or adulthood. Severity of this disease is correlated with the enzymatic blockade of 21 -Hydroxylase which depends of the mutation in gene CYP 21 A 2. Two clinical forms are possible: classic, subdivided in salt-wasting and simple virilizing form (severe) and nonclassic or late onset (less severe). Aims: We studied two portuguese families with NCCAH due to 21 -Hidroxilase deficiency in order to improve clinical management and genetic counseling of their members. Methods: Clinical presentation and hormonal assays (including test of <b>tetracosactide)</b> were performed in index cases (IC). Genomic DNA of each family member was sequenced for the 9 most frequent mutations in CYP 21 A 2. Total deletion of CYP 21 A, conversion in non functioning CYP 21 A 1 P or CYP 21 A 1 P_ CYP 21 A 2 quimeras were also analyzed by enzymatic restriction. Results: Family 1 - IC: Female, 31 years old with NCCAH diagnosed at age 6, after investigation of precocious pubarche and with test of <b>tetracosactide</b> positive (17 -alpha hydroxyprogesterone levels > 10 - 15 ng/ml). Molecular study of CYP 21 A 2 showed a mutation g. 1683 G> T, homozygous, in CYP 21 A 2 and a non functioning allele of CYP 21 A 2, heterozygous (non severe 21 -Hidroxilase deficiency).

40|$|Purpose. The {{interaction}} of hormones of the pituitary-adrenal axis and adrenal cortex-associated circulating microRNAs is mostly unknown. We {{have studied the}} effects of dexamethasone and adrenocorticotropin on the expression of five circulating microRNAs (hsa-miR- 27 a, hsa-miR- 200 b, hsa-miR- 214, hsa-miR- 483 - 5 p, and hsa-miR- 503) reported {{to be related to}} the adrenal cortex in plasma samples. Methods. Expression of microRNAs was studied in plasma samples of 10 individuals examined by 1 [*]mg dexamethasone suppression test and another 10 individuals stimulated by 250 [*]μg <b>tetracosactide</b> (adrenocorticotropin). Total RNA was isolated and microRNA expression was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction normalized to cel-miR- 39 as reference. Results. Only circulating hsa-miR- 27 a proved to be significantly modulated in vivo by hormonal treatments: its expression was upregulated by dexamethasone whereas it was suppressed by adrenocorticotropin. Secreted hsa-miR- 27 a was significantly induced by dexamethasone in vitro in NCI-H 295 R cells, as well. The expression of hsa-miR- 483 - 5 p proposed as diagnostic marker for adrenocortical malignancy was not affected by dexamethasone or <b>tetracosactide</b> administration. Conclusions. hsa-miR- 27 a expression is modulated by hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis both in vitro and in vivo. The biological relevance of hsa-miR- 27 a modulation by hormones is unclear, but the responsiveness of circulating microRNAs to hormones of the pituitary-adrenal axis is noteworthy...|$|E
40|$|Background: In Europe, {{synthetic}} corticosteroids are {{not allowed}} in animal breeding for growth-promoting purposes. Nevertheless, a high prevalence of non-compliant urine samples was recently reported for prednisolone, however, without any indication of unauthorized use. Within this context, 20 beta-dihydroprednisolone and the prednisolone/cortisol ratio have been suggested as potential tools to discriminate between exogenous and endogenous urinary prednisolone. In this study, the validity of these strategies was verified by investigating the plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion profiles of relevant glucocorticoids in bovines, subjected to exogenous prednisolone treatment or <b>tetracosactide</b> hexaacetate administration to induce endogenous prednisolone formation. Bovine urine and plasma samples were analysed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Results: Based on the plasma pharmacokinetics and urinary profiles, 20 beta-dihydroprednisolone was confirmed as the main prednisolone-derived metabolite, being detected in the biological fluids of all 12 bovines (plasma AUC(0 -inf) of 121 h mu g L- 1 and urinary concentration > 0. 695 mu g L- 1). However, this metabolite enclosed no potential as discriminative marker as no significant concentration differences were observed upon exogenous prednisolone treatment or <b>tetracosactide</b> hexaacetate administration under all experimental conditions. As a second marker tool, the prednisolone/cortisol ratios were assessed along the various treatments, {{taking into account that}} endogenous prednisolone formation involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and is associated with an increased cortisol secretion. Significantly lower ratios were observed in case of endogenous prednisolone formation (i. e. ratios ranging from 0. 00379 to 0. 129) compared to the exogenous prednisolone treatment (i. e. ratios ranging from 0. 0603 to 36. 9). On the basis of these findings, a discriminative threshold of 0. 260 was proposed, which allowed classification of urine samples according to prednisolone origin with a sensitivity of 94. 2 % and specificity of 99. 0 %. Conclusion: The prednisolone/cortisol ratio was affirmed as an expedient strategy to discriminate between endogenous and exogenous prednisolone in urine. Although the suggested threshold value was associated with high specificity and sensitivity, a large-scale study with varying experimental conditions is designated to optimize this value...|$|E

Patients and methods: Eighteen adult nephrotic patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min were recruited. Histological pictures included ten of membranous nephropathy, three of membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis, three of minimal change, and two of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. All patients received the synthetic ACTH analog <b>tetracosactide</b> 1 mg intramuscularly {{once a week for}} 12 months. Estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, serum lipids, albumin, glucose, and potassium were determined before and during the treatment. Results: One of the 18 patients discontinued the treatment after 1 month because of severe fluid retention, and two patients were lost at follow-up. Complete remission occurred in six cases, while partial remission occurred in four cases (55. 5 % responder rate). With respect to baseline, after 12 months proteinuria had decreased from 7. 24 ± 0. 92 to 2. 03 ± 0. 65 g/day (P< 0. 0001), and serum albumin had increased from 2. 89 ± 0. 14 to 3. 66 ± 0. 18 g/dL (P< 0. 0001). Total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol had decreased from 255 ± 17 to 193 ± 10 mg/dL (P= 0. 01), and from 168 ± 18 to 114 ± 7 mg/dL (P= 0. 03), respectively.

In mice, MeSO 2 -DDE induces mitochondrial degeneration and cellular necrosis in the adrenal zona fasciculata. In this study, we used precision-cut tissue slice culture to examine local CYP 11 B 1 -catalyzed irreversible binding of MeSO 2 -DDE in the murine adrenal cortex. We also examined effects on steroid hormone secretion, histology, and ultrastructure. As determined by microautoradiography, selective binding occurred in zona fasciculata of slices exposed to MeSO 2 - [14 C]-DDE.

Corticotropin stimulated cortisol, aldosterone and 18 -hydroxycorticosterone production {{starting at}} " 12 — 10 " 11 mol/ 1 in normal adrenocortical cells. Purified human ß-lipotropin also stimulated steroidogenesis but 100 — lOOOfold higher concentrations of the peptide were needed. In contrast, synthetic human ß-lipotropin was without {{any effect on}} steroid production up to concentrations of 10 ~? mol/ 1. Synthetie ß-lipotropin (5 10 ~ 10 mol/ 1) did not significantly change the dose-response curve for corticotropin (10 ~ 13 mol/ 1 — 10 ~ 9 mol/ 1) versus the three steroids ineasured. y 2 -Melanotropin and ß-endorphin (10 ~ 6 mol/ 1) stimulated the secretion of cortisol, but not of aldosterone. Since synthetic human ß-lipotropin {{has no effect on}} human adrenocortical cells, the purified ß-lipotropin must be contaminated with traces of eorticotropin. Since pathologically elevated levels of proopipmelanocort-in-derived peptides will rarely exceed plasma concentrations of 10 ~ 10 mol/ 1, our findings in vitro do not support a physiological or pathophysiological role of the peptides examined in the regulation of adrenal steroid secretion.

40|$|Background: Infantile spasms {{constitutes}} a severe infantile epilepsy syndrome {{that is difficult}} to treat and has a high morbidity. Hormonal therapies or vigabatrin are the most commonly used treatments. We aimed to assess whether combining the treatments would be more effective than hormonal therapy alone. Methods: In this multicentre, open-label randomised trial, 102 hospitals (Australia [three], Germany [11], New Zealand [two], Switzerland [three], and the UK [83]) enrolled infants who had a clinical diagnosis of infantile spasms and a hypsarrhythmic (or similar) EEG no more than 7 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (1 : 1) by a secure website to receive hormonal therapy with vigabatrin or hormonal therapy alone. If parents consented, there was an additional randomisation (1 : 1) of type of hormonal therapy used (prednisolone or <b>tetracosactide</b> depot). Block randomisation was stratified for hormonal treatment and risk of developmental impairment. Parents and clinicians were not masked to therapy, but investigators assessing electro-clinical outcome were masked to treatment allocation. Minimum doses were prednisolone 10 mg four times a day or intramuscular <b>tetracosactide</b> depot 0 · 5 mg (40 IU) on alternate days with or without vigabatrin 100 mg/kg per day. The primary outcome was cessation of spasms, which was defined as no witnessed spasms on and between day 14 and day 42 from trial entry, as recorded by parents and carers in a seizure diary. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with The International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN), number 54363174, and the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EUDRACT), number 2006 - 000788 - 27. Findings: Between March 7, 2007, and May 22, 2014, 766 infants were screened and, of those, 377 were randomly assigned to hormonal therapy with vigabatrin (186) or hormonal therapy alone (191). All 377 infants were assessed for the primary outcome. Between days 14 and 42 inclusive no spasms were witnessed in 133 (72 %) of 186 patients on hormonal therapy with vigabatrin compared with 108 (57 %) of 191 patients on hormonal therapy alone (difference 15 · 0 %, 95 % CI 5 · 1 – 24 · 9, p= 0 · 002). Serious adverse reactions necessitating hospitalisation occurred in 33 infants (16 on hormonal therapy alone and 17 on hormonal therapy with vigabatrin). The most common serious adverse reaction was infection occurring in five infants on hormonal therapy alone and four on hormonal therapy with vigabatrin. There were no deaths attributable to treatment. Interpretation: Hormonal therapy with vigabatrin is significantly more effective at stopping infantile spasms than hormonal therapy alone. The 4 week period of spasm cessation required to achieve a primary clinical response to treatment suggests that the effect seen might be sustained, but this needs to be confirmed at the 18 month follow-up.
