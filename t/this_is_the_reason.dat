5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes {{of the possibility that}} the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E

50|$|Calvene <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{base of a}} huge {{ammunition}} deposit and in Valsavina {{there was}} a large munitions store. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why Italian and English soldiers remained in Calvene until 1919.|$|R
5|$|In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, {{causing a}} {{diaspora}} of {{artists from the}} city to all of northern Italy and beyond. Perhaps <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> {{for the return of}} Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the hegemony of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, in the second-singular, {{inherited}} *-ta -ti {{competed with}} lengthened *-tā -tī for {{masculine and feminine}} forms. The expected result would be -t or -tā for masculine, -t or -tī for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms {{are found in the}} Bible (with -h marking the long -ā and -y marking the long -ī). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with -t and -tā/tī forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders, while speech choose feminine -t but masculine tā. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of such words.|$|E
50|$|After 1696 it was {{permitted}} to build buildings higher than the city's defensive wall. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for <b>the</b> Dominican Order to {{increase the size of}} their monastery by a third story.|$|R

5|$|Bernsten said audiences {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were not ready for such characters. He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did not relate to them {{because they did not}} foresee hideous puppets behaving in such a mature manner.

50|$|Arthur Laurents claimed an {{important}} subplot regarding Wayne's homosexuality in <b>the</b> original script <b>was</b> cut from <b>the</b> film by Herbert Ross and his wife. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why Wayne's character's develop doesn't progress steadily throughout the film.|$|R
30|$|What {{is left to}} show is that A is {{a compact}} operator. Although this follows by {{straightforward}} calculations, we describe all <b>the</b> details, since <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why we had to consider the space H^ 2 _rad(R^N) rather than H^ 2 (R^N).|$|R
50|$|Guatiza was {{originally}} {{located on a}} slope of the mountain in which the cemetery stands today.

2500|$|Titor {{claimed that}} the [...] "Everett–Wheeler model of quantum physics," [...] better known as <b>the</b> many-worlds interpretation, <b>was</b> correct. <b>The</b> model posits that every {{possible}} outcome of a quantum decision occurs in a separate [...] "universe."

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors have relatively good decoupling {{properties in the}} lower frequency range up to about 1nbsp&MHz due to their large capacitance values. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for using {{electrolytic capacitors}} in standard or switched-mode power supplies behind the rectifier for smoothing application.|$|E

25|$|Overall, the {{research}} shows that all beta lactams have the intrinsic hazard of very serious hazardous reactions in susceptible patients. Only the frequency of these reactions vary, based on the structure. Recent papers have shown that a major feature in determining frequency of immunological reactions is the similarity of the side chains (e.g., first generation cephalosporins are similar to penicillins), and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> the β-lactams are associated with different frequencies of serious reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis).|$|E

50|$|General Dru-Zod had {{originally}} created bizarro duplicates of himself {{to dominate the}} planet, Krypton.
