5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter in the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark matter in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E
5|$|After Leavitt's death, Edwin Hubble {{used the}} luminosity–period {{relation}} for Cepheids together with spectral shifts first measured by fellow astronomer Vesto Slipher at Lowell Observatory {{to determine that}} <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> expanding (see Hubble's law).|$|E

5|$|The cosmic {{abundance}} of vanadium in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> 0.0001%, making the element nearly {{as common as}} copper or zinc. Vanadium is detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and sometimes {{in the light from}} other stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} 4.9% of the mass–energy of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> ordinary matter, that is, atoms, ions, {{electrons and}} the objects they form. This matter includes stars, which produce {{nearly all of}} the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media, planets, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze. As a matter of fact, the great majority of ordinary matter in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.|$|E
40|$|FRW {{models of}} <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> have <b>been</b> {{studied in the}} cosmological theory based on Lyra’s manifold. A new class of exact {{solutions}} has been obtained by considering a time dependent displacement field for variable deceleration parameter from which three models of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>are</b> derived (i) exponential (ii) polynomial and (iii) sinusoidal form respectively. The behaviour of these models of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>are</b> also discussed. Finally some possibilities of further problems and their investigations have been pointed out...|$|R
50|$|The omnipresence of {{a supreme}} being is {{conceived}} differently by different religious systems. In monotheistic beliefs like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam the divine and <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>are</b> separate, but <b>the</b> divine is present everywhere. In pantheistic beliefs the divine and <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>are</b> identical. In panentheistic beliefs the divine interpenetrates <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> but extends beyond {{it in time}} and space.|$|R

5|$|The size of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> {{somewhat}} {{difficult to}} define. According to a restrictive definition, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> everything within our connected spacetime {{that could have}} a chance to interact with us and vice versa. According to the general theory of relativity, some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E

5|$|Fundamental to the {{structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> the existence of dark matter and dark energy. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.|$|E
5|$|Hubble's law has two {{possible}} explanations. Either {{we are at}} the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the Copernican principle—or <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> uniformly expanding everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen and helium are {{estimated}} to make up approximately 99 per cent of all ordinary matter in the universe. Less than five per cent of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> believed {{to be made of}} ordinary matter, represented by stars, planets and living beings.

5|$|Observations, {{including}} the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and Planck {{maps of the}} CMB, suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> infinite in extent with a finite age, as described by the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) models. These FLRW models thus support inflationary models and the standard model of cosmology, describing a flat, homogeneous universe presently dominated by dark matter and dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Other {{attempts}} to modify general relativity {{have been made}} in the context of cosmology. In the modern cosmological models, most energy in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> in forms that have never been detected directly, namely dark energy and dark matter. There have been several controversial proposals to remove the need for these enigmatic forms of matter and energy, by modifying the laws governing gravity and the dynamics of cosmic expansion, for example modified Newtonian dynamics.|$|E

5|$|The {{solutions}} for R(t) depend on k and Λ, but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale R of the Universe can remain constant only if <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein. However, this equilibrium is unstable: because <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> {{known to be}} inhomogeneous on smaller scales, R must change over time. When R changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago and never moved faster {{than the speed of}} light.|$|E
