5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out}} before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic (Old, Middle and New Stone Age), Bronze Age and Iron Age, comprising implements such as stone knives, flint blades {{and the head of}} a mace, along with buildings and graves. Other evidence of occupation from prehistoric times is provided by the henge monument at Stanton Drew, long barrow at Chewton Mendip, and Fairy Toot tumulus at Nempnett Thrubwell. Maes Knoll fort, on Dundry Down in the northern reaches of the valley, is a Scheduled Ancient Monument <b>that</b> <b>dates</b> from the Iron Age; it later served as a terminus for the early medieval Wansdyke earthworks.|$|E
5|$|Bronze Age {{settlers}} also constructed megaliths {{at various}} sites, {{many of them}} dating from the second millennium BC, although the chambered cairns were replaced by burial cists, found on for example, Inchmarnock.

The Queen of the Inch necklace is an article of jewellery made of jet found on Bute <b>that</b> <b>dates</b> from circa 2000 BC.

The Zarqa River is well known for its amber deposits that date back to the Hauterivian era of the Early Cretaceous (135 m.y.). A remarkable flora and fauna was reported from this amber reflecting tropical paleoenvironmental conditions prevailing during the time of resin deposition (Kaddumi, 2005; 2007).|$|E

Salukis and Greyhounds were increasingly depicted on Egyptian tombs from the Middle Kingdom (2134 BC–1785 BC) onward, however {{it was during the}} Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt that Salukis rose to prominence, replacing the Tesem (thought to be similar to modern Pariah dogs or a generic term for a dog) in ancient Egyptian art.

5|$|The creek flows {{generally}} south-southwest {{through a}} narrow coastal watershed at the southern extreme end of the arid Los Angeles Basin in a fairly straight course. Owing to the submersion of Southern California in the Pacific Ocean as recently as 10million years ago, the creek flows over marine sedimentary rock <b>that</b> <b>dates</b> from the late Eocene to the Pliocene. The present-day form of the watershed, with its broad sediment-filled valleys and deeply eroded side canyons, was shaped by a climate change during the previous Ice Age that produced Aliso Canyon, the creek's final gorge.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} period A, is {{dated to}} the proto Halaf culture c. 6500 BC, {{when a small}} settlement existed. Many objects dated to that period were discovered including the Halaf pottery.

Excavations and surface survey of the site and its surroundings, unearthed a large platform of patzen bricks <b>that</b> <b>dates</b> to late Ubaid, and revealed that Tell Brak developed as an urban center slightly earlier than better known cities of southern Mesopotamia, such as Uruk.|$|E
