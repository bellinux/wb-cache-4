5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, for <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> of processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III.

That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E
