5|$|A {{road in the}} {{location}} of PA284 first shows on maps as early as 1873. PA284 was first designated along its current alignment during the 1928 renumbering of state highways in Pennsylvania. <b>The</b> <b>designation</b> was done as a spur to the alignment of PA84, which was designated from Piatt Township to the New York state line. The entire alignment of PA284 was paved by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in 1932, including the bridge over Flooks Run and Blacks Creek. However, the alignment has remained relatively unchanged since. In 1961, with <b>the</b> <b>designation</b> of Interstate 84, the alignment of PA84 was re-designated as PA287 to avoid duplication.|$|E
5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received <b>the</b> <b>designation</b> 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received <b>the</b> <b>designation</b> 55 Cancri c.|$|E

5|$|Officially, {{the entire}} length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. As a {{practical}} matter, this name is not used on the southernmost segments of the Interstate. The American Legion was honored with <b>the</b> <b>designation</b> in 1969 in a state law that required private interests to finance the signage. Public Act174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands. Another name that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976. <b>The</b> <b>designation</b> was formally repealed in 2001.|$|E
