5|$|Prior {{to writing}} The Demi-Virgin, Hopwood was a {{well-established}} author of bedroom comedies. His past {{efforts in the}} genre included Fair and Warmer, produced by Edgar Selwyn in 1915, and The Gold Diggers, produced by David Belasco in 1919. Producer Albert H. Woods had an even longer <b>track</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> the genre, starting with The Girl from Rector's in 1909. Such material had been very profitable for Woods, who commissioned originals and adapted foreign farces, and for Hopwood, {{who was one of}} the most successful authors in the genre. Their first work together was The Girl in the Limousine in 1919, which Hopwood revised from an earlier script by Wilson Collison. Hopwood then helped revise Ladies' Night in 1920 and Getting Gertie's Garter in 1921. The Demi-Virgin was Hopwood's first play written for Woods without a collaborator. Hopwood was inspired by an earlier theatrical adaptation of Les Demi-vierges, an 1894 novel by the French writer Marcel Prévost that had been dramatized in 1895, but used little from it beyond the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumference}} {{of the track}} was a large 452 yards with long straights of 160 yards. An 'outside Sumner' hare was used and race distances consisted of 300,500, 525 and 700 yards. The kennel facilities were at nearby Cefn Mably in St Mellons and the leading event was the Glamorgan Cup held over 500 yards. In 1932 a notable greyhound called Beef Cutlet made his debut at the track at Arms Park. Beef Cutlet won the Glamorgan Cup and set a new <b>track</b> <b>record,</b> <b>in</b> 28.41sec. Cutlet’s Waterhall kennels based trainer John Hegarty would later become a Racing Manager at the track.A neighbouring track, the White City closed in 1939 and the Welsh Greyhound Derby {{was transferred to the}} Arms Park from White City, Cardiff in 1945.

5|$|Weed {{had wanted}} {{the vice presidential}} {{nomination}} for Seward (who attracted few delegate votes), and Collier had acted to frustrate them {{in more ways than}} one, for with the New Yorker Fillmore as vice president, under the political customs of the time, no one from that state could be named to the cabinet. Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his <b>track</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were something to happen to General Taylor. Delegates remembered him {{for his role in the}} Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E
