5|$|In November 2012, The FreeBSD Security Team {{announced}} that hackers gained unauthorized access {{on two of}} the project's servers. These servers were turned off immediately. More research demonstrated that the first unauthorized access by hackers occurred on 19 September.

These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build third-party software packages.
