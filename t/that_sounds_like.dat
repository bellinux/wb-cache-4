5|$|Right before Van Halen's guitar solo begins, a {{noise is}} heard <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> {{somebody}} knocking at a door. It is {{reported that the}} knock was a person walking into Eddie's recording studio. Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar.|$|E
5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E

25|$|Fresh roe that {{is cooked}} will burst and make light popping sounds when eaten, but roe from the fish {{preserved}} in salt or miso turn rubbery {{and hard to}} chew, resulting in a more blunt sound <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> buri buri which resulted in its name.|$|E
25|$|Stereotypical pirate accents are {{modeled on}} those of Cornwall, South Devon or the Bristol Channel area in South West England, though {{they can also}} be based on Elizabethan era English or other parts of the world. Pirates in film, {{television}} and theatre are generally depicted as speaking English in a particular accent and speech pattern <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a stylized West Country accent, exemplified by Robert Newton's performance as Long John Silver in the 1950 film Treasure Island. A native of the West Country in south west England from where many famous English pirates hailed, Newton also used the same strong West Country accent in Blackbeard the Pirate (1952).|$|E
25|$|A {{very rare}} form {{includes}} the diaphragmatic flutter, the Belly Dancer's Syndrome, or Van Leeuwenhoek's disease. It was first described by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1723, {{who suffered from}} it. The condition characterizes spoken communication <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a short-breathed hiccup. These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day. Rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the average rate found to be 150. Studies show that possible causes include disruptions within the central or peripheral nervous systems, anxiety, nutritional disorder, and certain pharmaceuticals. No single treatment has proven effective, though blocking or crushing of the phrenic nerve can provide instantaneous relief when pharmacologic treatment has proven ineffective.|$|E

25|$|Although Warner had {{intended}} to give the film a 5.1 stereo remastering, {{they were unable to}} do so due to several factors. The main factor was the fact that Ball's vocals in her songs often had to be pieced together line by line {{in order to get a}} more pitch-perfect performance (this method is a lot more obvious on the soundtrack CD, where you can often hear a difference in fidelity in each individual line as well as the occasional line <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> two Lucys singing.) This and the varying conditions of the original master copies caused Warner Bros. to simply restore the original release's mono soundtrack and remaster it in Dolby Digital 1.0 mono and use it for the DVD's audio track.|$|E
500|$|A 2013 four-disc reissue of {{the album}} {{received}} very positive reviews as well. David Fricke of Rolling Stone gave it four stars, writing, [...] "The road to that symmetry is caught in this four-CD set by a disc of rehearsals and outtakes <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> {{the work of a}} more brawny, Southern Grateful Dead." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the album}} is more {{electronic}} and beat-driven than preceding releases, with reviewers commenting that its sound is at times reminiscent of KMFDM. This {{has been attributed to}} Sköld, {{who was a member of}} that band immediately prior to his arrival in Marilyn Manson. It is also not as metallic as their earlier work, with Manson explaining to MTV that he wanted to create music which was dissimilar to the nu metal being played on radio at the time. He also noted the influence of early industrial rock acts such as Ministry, Big Black and Nitzer Ebb on the material. Early twentieth-century German composer Kurt Weill was also claimed as an influence, along with the lucid dreams Manson was having during the album's production, elaborating that he would [...] "wake up and say, 'I want to write a song <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a stampeding elephant' or 'I want to write a song <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a burning piano'." ...|$|E

He mixed in a greater amount of rock music to the station’s play list. The approach was to play rock <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> country and country <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> rock.

The project was not going well and continued to be an ongoing challenge." ...|$|E
500|$|New prog {{describes}} {{the wave of}} progressive rock bands in the 2000s who revived the genre. According to Entertainment Weeklys Evan Serpick: [...] "Along with recent success stories like System of a Down and up-and-comers like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Lightning Bolt, and Coheed and Cambria, the Mars Volta create incredibly complex and inventive music <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a heavier, more aggressive version of ’70s behemoths such as Led Zeppelin and King Crimson." ...|$|E
500|$|Plum cake {{recipes in}} the fruitcake style {{appeared}} in early cookbooks in the Southern United States, {{and did not}} actually call for plums. After 1830 plum cake was {{often referred to as}} fruit cake or black cake. In 1885, in a description of plum cake <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> plum pudding, it was described as [...] "mucilaginous" [...] - a solid, dark-colored, thick cake with copious amounts of plums, gritty notes from raisins.|$|E

500|$|The {{style of}} the band's first studio album {{combined}} progressive metal and space rock with influences and elements from electronica, utilizing programming and synthesizers. Ryan Rayhill from Blender described the album as a [...] "high-minded space opera of epic scope befitting prog-rock prototypes Rush," [...] and wrote that Thirty Seconds to Mars [...] "emerged with an eponymous debut <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Tool on The Dark Side of the Moon," [...] referring to the 1973 album by Pink Floyd.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Haim has been positive. PopMatters' Matt James wrote [...] "It'd {{be hard to}} truly dislike Haim. They're an eminently likeable, albeit slightly kooky, trio whose story already bears the frisson of legend." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis praised the band's songwriting abilities, saying it [...] "has {{a certain kind of}} glossily depthless pop perfection down pat". The band's sound has been described as [...] "nu-folk-meets-nineties-R" [...] and [...] "music <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> it was written on a lakeside retreat attended by Stevie Nicks, John Waite and En Vogue".|$|E

500|$|With Poquita Ropa, Arjona {{wanted to}} {{drastically}} change his musical style.

Arjona said about the album, [...] "music and women look better with little clothes", and that [...] "they [...] are like women; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes, more beauty.
