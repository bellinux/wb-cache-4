5|$|With {{the close}} of the North African {{campaign}} in May 1943, the Allies' attention then turned to the European <b>Theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operations.</b> Despite a preference amongst some sections of the New Zealand government for the 2nd New Zealand Division to be redeployed in the Pacific <b>Theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operations,</b> it was decided that the division, having served with the 8th Army throughout the desert campaign would remain in Europe and take part in the fighting in Italy. Having been based in Maadi Camp since early June, the battalion left Egypt on 6 October as part of the division's shift to Italy and reached Taranto three days later.|$|E

5|$|The brigade was {{the first}} of the US Army's Engineer Brigades to be {{converted}} to a modular design. This means that the Brigade can be deployed and sustain itself independently, without a division or corps level command supporting it. Additionally, the brigade's design allows it to take command of additional units within a <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> allowing for greater versatility on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|After the {{fighting}} in North Africa ceased in 1943, the 25th Battalion participated in the Italian Campaign, fighting in actions at Orsogna and later at Cassino. It finished the war in Trieste, and remained there to counter the presence of Yugoslav partisans that had entered the city. After {{the withdrawal of the}} partisans several weeks later, the battalion moved to Florence while its long-serving personnel began returning to New Zealand. Not required for service in the Pacific <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> the battalion was disestablished in late 1945.|$|E

5|$|Luttwak terminates his {{analysis}} {{at the end}} of Constantine's reign, before the establishment of the diocesan comitatus. Unlike the imperial escort-armies, these were close enough to the <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> to succour the border troops. But their stationing may have differed little from the location of legions in the 2nd century, even though they apparently wintered inside cities, rather than in purpose-built legionary bases. For example, the two comitatus of Illyricum (East and West) are documented as wintering in Sirmium, which was the site of a major legionary base in the Principate.|$|E
5|$|Not {{required}} for {{service in the}} Pacific <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> the regiment was disbanded in December 1945. During the war, the 18th Battalion and its successor, the 18th Armoured Regiment, lost nearly 320 officers and men either killed in action or who later died of their wounds. Of the exactly 350 personnel made prisoners of war, a further 21 men died while in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral Leonard Warren Murray, CB, CBE (22 June 1896 – 25 November 1971) was {{an officer}} of the Royal Canadian Navy who played a {{significant}} role in the Battle of the Atlantic.

40|$|First of all, {{the study}} explores three {{different}} meanings of centre (centrality) and periphery (peripheral status) {{on the international}} arena. Then, the author presents four case studies (that of Athens {{in the context of}} the Peloponnesian War in the 5 th century B. C., that of the campaigns of Alexander the Great, that of some of the campaigns of Napoleon and that <b>of</b> naval <b>operations</b> in World War I) which are significant for better understanding what fighting wars on peripheral <b>theatres</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> (PTOs) means. The study offers compact definitions <b>of</b> central <b>theatres</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> (CTOs) and peripheral <b>theatres</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> (PTOs). Constraints, limits, costs, consequences, synergetic effects of all sorts, relatively stable correlations of resources, goals and results (all these significant both for the level of military strategy and for that of grand strategy) are taken into account. Major positive results (strategic successes) and negative results (together with the strategic mistakes generating them) in campaigns fought on PTOs are evaluated with a lot of details...|$|R
5|$|Accordingly, the 3rd Division {{received}} {{orders to}} begin repatriating personnel back to New Zealand in April 1944 and shortly a {{first group of}} 1,800 soldiers from the division left the Pacific <b>Theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operations.</b> However, the 37th Battalion remained on Nissan Island until 15 June 1944 at which time it boarded the American cargo ship Rotanin for New Caledonia. It remained in New Caledonia for several weeks and during this time, most of the battalion's long serving personnel returned to New Zealand with the rest following in August. Over the next several weeks, {{the men of the}} battalion dispersed into civilian life or to Italy to join the 2nd New Zealand Division. The remnants of the battalion was disbanded at Papakura Military Camp in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Allies {{lost some}} 8,000,000 tons of shipping, {{and though they}} {{replaced}} 7,000,000 tons, U-boats still managed to sink 1,160 out of the 1,664 Allied ships lost. Most of these sinkings {{took place in the}} mid-Atlantic gap, well within range of long-range Sunderlands and Liberators, only the Command lacked these aircraft in quantity. Following the entry of the United States of America into the war, German U-boats had plenty of targets. Coastal Command found it difficult to maintain strength. Its units now operated from the United States, West Africa, the Mediterranean, Iceland, Russia, Gibraltar, North Africa and the Middle East. Squadrons were also sent to the Pacific <b>Theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operations.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 1943, the {{battalion}} was converted to armour and re-designated the 18th Armoured Regiment. To replace men lost at El Alamein, personnel {{were drawn from}} a tank brigade being formed in New Zealand. The regiment {{spent a year in}} Egypt training with Sherman tanks, before embarking for Italy in October 1943 to join up {{with the rest of the}} 2nd New Zealand Division. It participated in the Italian Campaign, fighting in actions at Orsogna and later at Cassino. The regiment finished the war in Trieste and remained there for several weeks until the large numbers of Yugoslav partisans also present in the city withdrew. Not required for service in the Pacific <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> the regiment was disbanded in late 1945.|$|E
50|$|Despite its obsolescence, the Type 38 75 mm Field Gun {{was found}} in <b>theatres</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet-Japanese Border Wars and in the Pacific War.|$|R

50|$|Though a minor {{skirmish}} in the <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the Eastern Front, the Izbushensky charge {{had a great}} propaganda resonance in Italy and it {{is still}} remembered as one of the last cavalry charges in history.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to a request from Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, the American commander of the South Pacific Area, the 3rd Division moved to New Caledonia on garrison duty while the American forces previously stationed there fought in the Battle of Guadalcanal. Conscious that his division was the only sizable non-American unit in a <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> having an overall American command structure, Barrowclough requested, and received, a charter {{that allowed him to}} seek instructions from the New Zealand Government if he felt the division was to be involved in operations that could result in significant casualties.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1916, Phleps was {{promoted}} to Major. Later that month, King Ferdinand of Romania led the Kingdom of Romania in joining the Triple Entente, and subsequently invaded Phleps' homeland of Siebenbürgen. On 27 August, Phleps became {{the chief of staff}} of the 72nd Infantry Division, which was involved in Austro-Hungarian operations to repel the Romanian invasion. He remained in this <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> for the next two years, ultimately serving as the chief quartermaster of the German 9th Army, and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 27 January 1917. In 1918 he returned to the mountains when he was transferred to Armeegruppe Tirol, and ended the war as an Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) and chief quartermaster for the entire Alpine Front.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{the battle}} he {{transferred}} to fighter pilot school in the summer 1940. During the Battle of Britain he served with No. 73 Squadron RAF and No. 145 Squadron RAF. He achieved a probable victory during the battle. In late 1940 {{he transferred to}} Malta in the Mediterranean <b>Theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operations</b> and joined No. 261 Squadron RAF. By February 1941 he had achieved eight victories (two at night) and was awarded a Bar to his DFC. MacLachlan was wounded in action on 16 February 1941. His arm was so severely damaged it was amputated, but he returned to operations in November 1941 with an artificial limb.|$|E
50|$|A Battlegroup is {{considered}} to be the smallest self-sufficient military unit that can be deployed and sustained in a <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> EU Battlegroups are composed of approximately 1500 troops; plus command and support services.|$|R
50|$|The Flechas (Portuguese for Arrows) were {{a special}} forces {{unit of the}} Portuguese secret police (PIDE, latter renamed DGS) that {{operated}} in Angola and Mozambique during the Portuguese Colonial War. Unlike {{most of the other}} Portuguese special forces that were employed in the several <b>theatres</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> the conflict, the Flechas were not a military unit but a PIDE/DGS (police) unit.|$|R
50|$|The French Croix de guerre des TOE {{was created}} in 1921 for wars fought in <b>theatres</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> outside France. It was awarded during the Indochina War, Korean War, and other wars up to the Kosovo War in 1999.|$|R
5|$|While {{the liberation}} of the Brunei area had been {{authorised}} by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, it was {{not supported by the}} British Chiefs of Staff Committee. The British leadership did not want the BPF to be diverted from the main <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> off Japan and preferred to establish a base for the fleet in the Philippines. In response to a suggestion from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Brunei Bay could support future operations in south-east Asia, the Chiefs of Staff Committee judged that it would take too long to establish facilities there, especially as Singapore might have been recaptured {{by the time they were}} complete.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{protests from}} Barrowclough, the disbandment began in April 1944, with a {{contingent}} of nearly 1,900 men returning to New Zealand with more following {{over the next few}} months. By June 1944, {{what was left of the}} division was in New Caledonia, having been withdrawn there after the Battle of the Green Islands. In September, the disbandment was made official and was officially completed the following month. This left a demoralised Barrowclough without a command. He hoped for a suitable position with the 2nd New Zealand Division, possibly taking over from Freyberg. This did not eventuate and instead he was sent to the British Army's 21st Army Group as an observer. In late 1945, he was discharged from the military. His service in the Pacific <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> was rewarded with several decorations, which included the United States Legion of Merit and appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|French Minister of Justice Aristide Briand's {{proposal}} in November {{to attack the}} Ottoman Empire was rejected and {{an attempt by the}} British to pay the Ottomans to join the Allied side also failed. Later that month, Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed a naval attack on the Dardanelles, based in part on erroneous reports of Ottoman troop strength. Churchill wanted to use a large number of obsolete battleships, which could not operate against the German High Seas Fleet, in a Dardanelles operation, with a small occupation force provided by the army. It was hoped that an attack on the Ottomans would also draw Bulgaria and Greece (both formerly ruled by the Ottomans) into the war on the Allied side. On 2 January 1915, Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia appealed to Britain for assistance against the Ottomans, who were conducting an offensive in the Caucasus. Planning began for a naval demonstration in the Dardanelles to divert troops from the Caucasian <b>theatre</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
