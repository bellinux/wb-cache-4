5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, R.C. MacLeod noted several traditions {{concerning}} the flag. One <b>told</b> <b>how</b> the flag {{came into the}} possession of the MacLeods through a fairy. A similar tradition relates of a fairy-lullaby.|$|E
5|$|At the Edinburgh International Television Festival in August 2008, Moffat <b>told</b> <b>how</b> he {{got drunk}} after the wrap party for Jekyll and pitched {{the idea of}} a Press Gang reunion special to the Head of Drama at the BBC, John Yorke. Despite Yorke's approval, the writer said that he was too busy with his work on Doctor Who to pursue the idea.|$|E
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his decision. He thought the letter too vague to {{constitute}} any meaningful threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet know {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to wait, to see how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts <b>told</b> <b>how</b> Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E
60|$|Then King Arthur {{told the}} Queen his sister {{all that had}} befallen. For he <b>told</b> her <b>how</b> that Gareth had come thither and in what guise; and he <b>told</b> her <b>how</b> Gareth had dwelt all that year unknown at the court {{under the name of}} Beaumains because of the {{whiteness}} of his hands; and he <b>told</b> her <b>how</b> that Beaumains had gone forth upon that adventure to the Castle Dangerous; and he <b>told</b> her <b>how</b> he had succeeded in that adventure; and he told her of the several other things that are herein told, and ever Queen Margaise listened to him.|$|R

5|$|The jury heard how {{the murder}} weapons {{had been found}} in a shed at Nazir's house along with two bags of bloodied clothes. DNA and {{fingerprints}} belonging to Nazir was found on the hunting knife and Parker's blood was found on both the hammer and knife. His blood was also found on the clothes of two of the accused, along with Nazir and Mahrad's DNA and a pathologist <b>told</b> <b>how</b> marks on Parker's body matched the hammer found in Nazir's shed. Three balaclavas were also recovered from the property, again containing traces of Parker's blood, Nazir's younger brother Wyed told the court he had seen his brother cleaning the murder weapon {{on the night of the}} killing and witnessed all four defendants with blood on their clothing. Further witnesses reported Nazir admitting to beating someone up, Mahrad admitting to kicking Parker and Awan recalling stabbing him. A witness also saw all four defendants kicking Parker.|$|E

He moved to Nevada and avoided further service. 1940 issue.|$|E
25|$|Food {{was very}} basic and monotonous. One {{incident}} in the early 1900s <b>told</b> <b>how</b> for weeks on end there was not 'pudding' until constant demands resulted in a dessert made from boiled cabbage scraps. Sobriety was encouraged, not always successfully, by {{the establishment of a}} soft drink bottling factory inside the Fort. The 'Artillery' bottles of this factory are much sought after today.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} {{source for}} The Tenant {{is the story}} of Mrs Collins, the wife of a local curate, who in November 1840 came to Anne's father Patrick Brontë seeking advice regarding her alcoholic husband's abusive conduct.

Mrs Collins returned to Haworth in the spring of 1847, while Anne was writing The Tenant, and <b>told</b> <b>how</b> she had managed to build a new life for herself and her two children.|$|E
25|$|In later Greek {{literature}} {{the doctrine}} is mentioned in {{a fragment of}} Menander and satirized by Lucian. In Roman literature it is found as early as Ennius, who, in a lost passage of his Annals, <b>told</b> <b>how</b> he had seen Homer in a dream, who had assured him that the same soul which had animated both the poets had once belonged to a peacock. Persius in his satires (vi. 9) laughs at this, it is referred to also by Lucretius and Horace.|$|E

25|$|The event {{itself is}} divided into two parts: the Encampment, in which Scouts camp from Friday through Sunday on the Presidents' Day weekend, and the Pilgrimage which is all day Saturday. During the Pilgrimage, {{participants}} move around the Valley Forge NHP to hear volunteer interpreters from the National Park Service tell how the Continentals lived. Replicas of the original huts provide a glimpse of daily life. Conditions during the winter were poor, so the stories are also <b>told</b> <b>how</b> more than 2,000 soldiers died from typhus, dysentery, typhoid and pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|The author’s {{second book}} Hidden Power (see under 'Career') {{followed}} up the factual theme in Program for a Puppet {{on the way}} the American public was manipulated into voting for candidates by slick computer-based campaigns. Hidden Power concentrated on the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984. The book explained how advertising techniques had been superseded in elections by more sophisticated methods, including marketing and computer analysis. It was published in 1984. The book, as much narrative as analysis, <b>told</b> <b>how</b> the two key campaign ‘pollsters’ steered their candidates. It was not critical of president Ronald Reagan, but was seen by the Republican campaign as hostile to him.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{thought that}} “to slog on at one spot” on the Somme was “dreadfully lacking in imagination” {{and would have}} {{preferred}} a joint offensive by Russia, Italy and Romania in Spring 1917 to draw off 15 or 20 German divisions, allowing the BEF to “completely smash the Boch line”. Summoned to see Lloyd George (13 November 1916) and asked if Britain could still hope to defeat Germany, Wilson advised him that she could, provided Haig were given enough men to fight “two Sommes at once”, but that in reality Haig should be firmly <b>told</b> <b>how</b> many men he was to receive and told to plan accordingly. He thought {{at the end of}} 1916 that both sides were claiming victory from that year’s fighting, but victory “inclined to us”, and that Germany might be driven to sue for peace in 1917.|$|E
