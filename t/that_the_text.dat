Bede's work De VIII Quastionibus may have been written for Nothhelm. While he was archbishop, Boniface wrote to him, requesting {{a copy of the}} Libellus responsionum of Pope Gregory I for use in Boniface's missionary efforts. Boniface also asked for information on when the Gregorian mission to England arrived in England. This text of the Libellus responsionum {{has been the subject of}} some controversy, with the historian Suso Brechter arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> was a forgery created by Nothhelm and a Roman archdeacon. The historian Paul Meyvaert has refuted this view, and most historians incline towards the belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> is genuine, although it is not considered conclusively proven.|$|E

A descriptive qualitative design was applied to obtain the data. Some available computer programs were used to find the description of vocabulary in <b>the</b> <b>texts.</b> It was found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> are dominated by low frequency words which compose 16. 97 % of the words in <b>the</b> <b>texts.</b> In terms of high frequency words occurring in <b>the</b> <b>texts,</b> function words dominate <b>the</b> <b>texts.</b> In <b>the</b> case of word levels, it was found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> being used have very limited number of words from GSL (West, 1953).

5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> does {{not prove that}} Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E

5|$|Radiocarbon dating {{determined}} that the papyrus is medieval, and further analysis of the language led most scholars to conclude it was copied from the Gospel of Thomas.

5|$|Recension B, which resembles Recension A, is {{contained}} in a 17th-century Latin treatise, Archaeologus in Modum Glossarii ad rem antiquam posteriorem, written by Henry Spelman in 1626. The tribal names are given in Old English. There are significant differences in spelling between the two recessions. The differences (for instance Spelman's {{use of the word}} hidas) indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> he copied was not Recension A, but a different text, written in Latin. According to Peter Featherstone, the highly edited form of the copied text suggests the possibility that Spelman embellished the Latin text himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} date of Yoga Yajnavalkya is unclear. Prahlad Divanji, an Indologist and Sanskrit scholar, states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> {{was composed}} between {{the second century}} BCE and fourth century CE, because Yoga Upanishads and Hatha Yoga texts contain verses from Yoga Yajnavalkya. Divanji cites Tantra texts, Ayurveda tradition texts, and literature of Advaita Vedanta from the 4th century CE, which mention the Yoga Yajnavalkya, thereafter concluding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> or some version of the Yoga Yajnavalkya text {{must have been in}} existence by the 4th century CE. However, adds Divanji, the text is likely to have been composed after Patanjali's Yogasutra, which itself is variously estimated to have composed sometime between 500 BCE and 400 CE. Divanji premises his dating proposal from the observation that Yoga Yajnavalkya expands on ideas in Patanjali's text, such as its list of Yamas, which includes the Patanjali's five plus five additional ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} Tribal Hidage remains unknown: many scholars {{believe that it was}} a tribute list created by a king, but other possibilities have been suggested. The hidage figures may be purely symbolic and merely reflect the prestige of each territory, or they may represent an early example of book-keeping. Many historians are convinced that the Tribal Hidage originated from Mercia, which dominated southern Anglo-Saxon England until the start of the 9th century, but others have argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> was Northumbrian in origin.|$|E

5|$|There are solo {{parts for}} four shepherds and three spirits.

Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza.|$|E
5|$|Before King {{published}} {{the discovery of}} the fragment, she asked AnneMarie Luijendijk and fellow papyrologist Roger S. Bagnall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University to review the fragment. They determined that it was likely authentic, both because of the skills which would have been required to forge the fragment, and because the papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced. Luijendijk and Bagnall both doubted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> was forged. Giovanni Maria Vian the editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, dismissed the fragment as fake. In a television documentary about the fragment that was presented on the Smithsonian Channel in September 2012, Professor Alberto Camplani of Sapienza University of Rome suggested that he considered it more likely to be authentic.|$|E

In its first draft, Sub pecetea tainei was {{published}} by Gândirea in April 1930-April 1933, while Soborul țațelor was kept in three different variants. In a 1985 essay later published as a preface for Sub pecetea tainei, literary critic Nicolae Manolescu proposed that, while the story was not given a finishing touch, its plot was meant to seem ambiguous, and thus had led other commentators to wrongly assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> ended abruptly.|$|E

5|$|ROT47 is a {{derivative}} of ROT13 which, {{in addition to}} scrambling the basic letters, also treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A–Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII. Specifically, the 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '!' through 126 '~', 94 in total, taken {{in the order of}} the numerical values of their ASCII codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character A is mapped to p, while a is mapped to 2. The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as +1-415-839-6885 is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result Z`\c`d\gbh\eggd. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> has been enciphered.|$|E
5|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the opening}} few words of each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect, turned into carpet pages. The {{decoration of}} these texts is so elaborate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis ("The book of the generation"). The lib of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} manuscripts {{containing}} the story are MS. XXXVI in the National Library of Scotland and H.6.8 in Trinity College, Dublin, written 1690–1691 and c. 1777 respectively. These represent a modernisation {{of the story}} that might {{have been made in the}} 15th or 16th century. The two manuscripts differ from each other in some respects, and the spelling is very poor. William J. Watson notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> of MS. XXXVI was based on the redaction contained in Rawlinson B 512, but not upon that specific manuscript. The changes are so considerable in these modernisations that they are of no value for reconstructing the original text.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Automatically extracting {{texts from}} natural im-ages is very useful for many {{applications}} such as augmented reality. Most of <b>the</b> existing <b>text</b> detection systems require <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> to be detected (and recognized) in an image are taken from a nearly frontal viewpoint. However, texts in most images taken naturally by a camera or a mobile phone can have a significant affine or perspective deforma-tion, making <b>the</b> existing <b>text</b> detection and <b>the</b> subsequent OCR engines prone to failures. In this paper, based on stroke width transform and texture invariant low-rank transform, we propose a framework that can detect and rectify texts in arbitrary orientations in the image against complex back-grounds, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> can be correctly recognized by common OCR engines. Extensive experiments show the ad-vantage of our method {{when compared to the}} state of art text detection systems...|$|R

5|$|The latest {{database}} of translations of the Elegy, amongst which the above version figures, records over 260 in some forty languages. As {{well as the}} principal European languages {{and some of the}} minor such as Welsh, Breton and Icelandic, they include several in Asian languages as well. Through the medium of these, Romanticism was brought to the host literatures in Europe. In Asia they provided an alternative to tradition-bound native approaches and were identified as an avenue to modernism. Study of the translations, and especially those produced soon after the poem was written, has highlighted some of the difficulties <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> presents. These include ambiguities of word order and the fact that certain languages do not allow the understated way in which Gray indicates that the poem is a personalised statement in the final line of the first stanza, “And leaves the world to darkness and to me”.|$|E
5|$|The {{librettist}} is unknown; it {{has been}} speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> was written by Georg Christian Eilmar, minister of Marienkirche, who had earlier prompted the composition of Bach's cantata Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131. It has also been thought that Bach himself may have assembled the text, although the suggestion is unlikely since Bach's musical setting of the final part of the text departs from its bi-strophic form. There is no evidence either way to indicate the authorship of the cantata's text. Along with other early cantatas, Gott ist mein König is of a pre-Neumeister character, not featuring the combination of recitative and arias found in later cantatas.|$|E
5|$|When Obbink {{published}} the Brothers Poem, he attributed it to Sappho {{based on its}} metre, dialect (Aeolic), and references to Charaxos and Larichos, known from other sources to have been Sappho's brothers. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> is an ancient forgery; though the Brothers Song was included {{in at least some}} Hellenistic editions of Sappho, a classical imitation of Sappho is still possible. Nonetheless, evidence provided by Herodotus indicates that Charaxos was mentioned in poems that were attributed to Sappho during the fifth century BC; it therefore is likely that the poem is at least authentically from archaic Lesbos.|$|E
