5|$|In July 2009, {{the policy}} of <b>time-based</b> {{development}} freezes on a two-year cycle was announced. <b>Time-based</b> freezes are intended to blend the predictability of time based releases with Debian's policy of feature based releases, and to reduce overall freeze time. The Squeeze cycle {{was going to be}} especially short; however, this initial schedule was abandoned. In September 2010, the backports service became official, providing more recent versions of some software for the stable release.|$|E
5|$|Periodically, {{the release}} team publishes {{guidelines}} to the developers {{in order to}} ready the release. A new release occurs after a freeze, when all important software is reasonably up-to-date in the Testing branch and any other significant issues are solved. At that time, all packages in the testing branch become the new stable branch. Although freeze dates are <b>time-based,</b> release dates are not, which are announced by the release managers {{a couple of weeks}} beforehand.|$|E
5|$|The project's work {{is carried}} out over the Internet {{by a team of}} volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader and three {{foundational}} documents: the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. New distributions are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after a <b>time-based</b> freeze.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 the {{newspaper}} La Gazzetta dello Sport established the Giro d'Italia, {{inspired by the}} success of the Tour de France, which started in 1903. The first Giro was won by Luigi Ganna, while Carlo Galetti won the two following Giros. In 1912, there was no individual classification, instead there was only a team classification, which was won by Team Atala. The 1912 Giro is the only time the competition has not had an individual classification. From 1914 onwards the scoring format was changed from a points-based system to a <b>time-based</b> system, in which the cyclist who had the lowest aggregate time {{at the end of the}} race would win. The Giro was suspended for four years from 1915 to 1918, due to the First World War. Costante Girardengo was the winner of the first Giro after the war in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Other {{features}} include Bloodhound technology, which looks for virus-like behavior to better find zero day viruses. The Security Inspector looks for common vulnerabilities, including insecure user account passwords and browser insecurities. Advertisement blocking rewrites a website's HTML to prevent advertisements from being displayed. Parental controls, an optional component, can block certain programs from accessing the Internet, such as IM clients, and restrict newsgroup access. Restrictions {{can be assigned}} to different Windows users accounts. Sites are classified in 31 categories, and the four profiles which can be assigned each block different categories of sites. Supervisors define exceptions, add global blocked sites, or block all access to sites not on a user-created whitelist. Both PC Magazine and PC Pro noted the exclusion of <b>time-based</b> restrictions. Information filtering can be controlled on a per-user basis.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Giro used a points {{system to}} {{determine}} the race winner. The organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. Another factor in the organizer's decision {{was that it would}} be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking their times during each stage. The race leader was determined by adding up each rider's placing in each stage. Thus if a rider placed second in the first stage and third in the second stage he would have a total of five points, and whoever had the lowest points total was the leader. Under this system Luigi Ganna was declared the winner, but had the Giro been a <b>time-based</b> event he would have lost to the third-place finisher Giovanni Rossignoli by 37 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} is {{involved}} mainly in event-based {{as opposed to}} <b>time-based</b> prospective memory. Cheng et al. (2008) had participants with lesions in the prefrontal cortex perform event-based and <b>time-based</b> prospective memory tasks. They found that performance was impaired in the event-based tasks, which use event cues to trigger intentions, {{but not in the}} <b>time-based</b> tasks which use time cues to trigger intentions.|$|E
25|$|In <b>time-based</b> {{prospective}} memory tasks, {{participants are}} asked to remember to perform a task {{at a certain point}} in time. There are also numerous possible types of <b>time-based</b> tasks. For example, Cheng et al. (2008) asked participants to check a clock every five minutes during a written test, while Adda et al. (2008) asked participants to remind the experimenter to pay a bill on time.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{prospective}} memory: event-based and <b>time-based</b> prospective memory. Event-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform certain actions when specific circumstances occur. For example, driving past the local library cues the remembrance of the need to return an overdue book. <b>Time-based</b> prospective memory involves remembering to perform an action at a particular point in time. For example, seeing that it is 10:00 PM acts as a cue to watch a favorite television show.|$|E
25|$|SVG {{drawings}} can be {{dynamic and}} interactive. <b>Time-based</b> {{modifications to the}} elements {{can be described in}} SMIL, or can be programmed in a scripting language (e.g. ECMAScript or JavaScript). The W3C explicitly recommends SMIL as the standard for animation in SVG.|$|E
25|$|Standardized {{tests have}} been created to uniformly test {{prospective}} memory and can incorporate different event-based and <b>time-based</b> tasks at the same time. Experimenters can test prospective memory by having people perform tasks in order, perform tasks in order but with interruptions, and multitask.|$|E
25|$|The MTA {{introduced}} a new green and yellow livery and uniform design, with a new logo, showing the integration of Melbourne's public transport system, replacing the MMTB logo, and {{introduced a}} new <b>time-based</b> integrated ticketing system, for all modes of Melbourne's public transport.|$|E
25|$|QuickTime {{consists}} of two major subsystems: the Movie Toolbox and the Image Compression Manager. The Movie Toolbox {{consists of}} a general API for handling <b>time-based</b> data, while the Image Compression Manager provides services for dealing with compressed raster data as produced by video and photo codecs.|$|E
25|$|A study {{comparing}} prospective {{memory of}} non-psychotic first-degree relatives {{of patients with}} schizophrenia and healthy participant showed that the relatives performed significantly worse on <b>time-based</b> and event-based prospective memory tasks. Since schizophrenia has a heritable component, this suggested that genetics {{may play a role}} in affecting prospective memory.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by critics, with aggregate scores of 84.05% at GameRankings and 83/100 at Metacritic, two video game review aggregators. Critics found the story confusing, but praised the overall gameplay. Specifically the shoot 'em up mechanic, <b>time-based</b> mechanic and boss battles received high marks. Reviewers also lauded the game's visuals.|$|E
25|$|In virtual reality, {{participants}} perform prospective memory {{tasks in}} a virtual world on a computer. Experimenters can create event-based tasks such as remembering to label boxes as fragile before moving or <b>time-based</b> tasks such as allowing a removal man to enter the house in five minutes. All tasks involve daily and other real life actions that rely on some aspects of prospective memory.|$|E
25|$|The nursing {{environment}} {{is full of}} event-based and <b>time-based</b> prospective memory tasks. Simple tasks such as remembering to order a drug or calling patient's family and remembering when to switch shifts are just some examples of a nurse's reliance on prospective memory. It is surprising that not much {{research has been done}} concerning the importance of prospective memory in nurses since they face many life-threatening tasks.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of HTM are {{learning}} algorithms that can store, learn, infer and recall high-order sequences. Unlike most other machine learning methods, HTM learns <b>time-based</b> patterns in unlabeled data on a continuous basis. HTM is robust to noise and high capacity, meaning that it can learn multiple patterns simultaneously. When applied to computers, HTM is well suited for prediction, anomaly detection, classification and ultimately sensorimotor applications.|$|E
25|$|Harrington et al. (1998) {{found that}} neural areas {{ranging from the}} {{inferior}} parietal cortex to the frontal gyri are involved in temporal monitoring during <b>time-based</b> prospective memory tasks. Patients with damage to these {{areas of the brain}} had difficulty judging duration and frequency of auditory tones that were presented. Keeping track of information over time is important for prospective memory, remembering intentions to perform in the future.|$|E
25|$|SAIC offers {{classes in}} art and technology; arts administration; art history, theory, and criticism; art {{education}} and art therapy; ceramics; fashion design; filmmaking; historic preservation; architecture; interior architecture; designed objects; journalism; painting and drawing; performance; photography; printmaking; sculpture; sound; time arts (<b>time-based</b> media); video; visual communication; visual and critical studies; and writing. SAIC {{also serves as a}} resource for issues related to the position and importance of the arts in society.|$|E
25|$|Metra allows some {{travellers}} {{to purchase}} reduced fare tickets or even ride for free. These reduced fare and free ride programs are administered by Metra and the RTA. Some pre-college students, youth, senior citizens, {{members of the}} United States Armed Forces and persons with disabilities may qualify for these programs. <b>Time-based</b> and geographical restrictions apply to these programs and passengers must ensure they qualify before attempting to purchase special tickets or ride for free.|$|E
25|$|Standardized tests {{such as the}} Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMT) or the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) {{are written}} tests in which {{participants}} complete event-based and <b>time-based</b> tasks while performing distractor tasks such as a word search. Participants are given verbal and written instructions and are allowed to use strategies such as note-taking in order to aid memory. Their performance is scored {{on a scale of}} 1 to 18, with 18 representing highest prospective memory performance.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with early}} Parkinson's disease suffer {{a large enough}} amount of {{prospective}} memory impairment to be affected in everyday life. These patients show impairment {{in the use of}} internal attentional strategies which are required for intention retrieval. Parkinson's disease leads to poorer performance on <b>time-based</b> but not event-based prospective memory tasks. For example, patients may forget to take medication at certain times of the day, but forgetting is less likely if they see the medicine bottle.|$|E
25|$|Today some 60 {{students}} {{study in}} the Schools on a three-year postgraduate course. The programme is focused on studio-based practice across all fine art media. The studios accommodate {{a wide variety of}} disciplines, including painting, sculpture, print, installation, and <b>time-based</b> and digital media. Selection of candidates is based on evidence of individual ability and commitment, with an emphasis on potential for further development across the three-year course. Students are given the opportunity twice each year to show their work in the Royal Academy.|$|E
25|$|The {{software}} utility Cron is a <b>time-based</b> {{job scheduler}} in Unix-like computer operating systems. People {{who set up}} and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance or administration—though its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals. The origin of the name cron is from the Greek word for time, χρόνος (chronos).|$|E
25|$|This type of card is {{accepted}} at everywhere the Pay-Per-Ride or <b>time-based</b> MetroCard is valid at, with two exceptions: {{it is not}} valid on the PATH, {{and it is not}} valid for ticket purchase on New York City-bound LIRR and Metro-North trains in the morning. Reduced-Fare MetroCards (in any variety) are also not accepted at PATH stations. Reduced fare customers who do not have a MetroCard may purchase a full-fare round trip MetroCard from a subway station agent by presenting proof of eligibility.|$|E
25|$|With advancements in technology, Smartphones {{can serve}} as {{prospective}} memory aids. Electronic calendars are of great use in <b>time-based</b> prospective memory tasks and recently they {{have been shown to}} also cue event-based tasks. The iPhone, as well as phones using the Android operating system, can track the user's location using the phone's Global Positioning System (GPS) and send reminders based on the current location. For example, when a parent is near their children's school, the phone can send a reminder for them to pick up their children after school.|$|E
25|$|Other less {{well-known}} classifications, whose leaders did {{not receive}} a special jersey, are awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the Traguardo Volante, or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known by various names in previous years, and was previously <b>time-based.</b> In 2013 this classification was renamed to the sprints classification and was won by Rafael Andriato.|$|E
25|$|Fares {{are charged}} {{on the basis}} of zones and are <b>time-based.</b> There are two {{concentric}} zones (reduced from three on 4 March 2007), with fares applicable to one or two zones. Tickets are valid for two hours, all day and for longer periods, such as weekly and monthly. Within the time periods, tickets can be used on an unlimited number of services and all modes (train, tram, and bus). There is no extra fee for transfers. Various discounts are also available, such as for off-peak travel and buying tickets in bulk.|$|E
25|$|Adda et al. (2008) {{assessed}} {{patients with}} episodic memory impairment due to epilepsy associated with mesial temporal sclerosis. Patients with this disorder have {{damage in the}} medial temporal lobe and hippocampus. Their performance on both event-based and <b>time-based</b> prospective memory tasks was significantly impaired. Their prospective memory performance was also worse {{than that of the}} control group after immediate, 30-minute, and seven-day delays, but was especially noticeable after the long delays because the patients could not maintain information for long periods of time. Patients also suffered in their speed of processing, disregarding distractions, and episodic memory.|$|E
25|$|While most {{adventure}} games {{typically do}} not include any <b>time-based</b> interactivity by the player, action-adventure games are a hybrid of action games with adventure games that often require to the player to react quickly to events as they occur on screen. The action-adventure genre is broad, spanning many different subgenres, but typically these games utilize strong storytelling and puzzle-solving mechanics of adventure games among the action-oriented gameplay concepts. The foremost title in this genre was Adventure, a graphic home console game developed based on the text-based Colossal Cave Adventure, while the first The Legend of Zelda brought the action-adventure concept to a broader audience.|$|E
25|$|The first Giro was won by Luigi Ganna, while Carlo Galetti won the two {{following}} Giros. In 1912, {{there was}} no individual classification, instead {{there was only a}} team classification, which was won by Team Atala. The 1912 Giro is the only time the competition has not had an individual classification. From 1914 onwards the scoring format was changed from a points-based system to a <b>time-based</b> system, in which the cyclist who had the lowest aggregate time {{at the end of the}} race would win. The Giro was suspended for four years from 1915 to 1918, due to the First World War. Costante Girardengo was the winner of the first Giro after the war in 1919.|$|E
25|$|Studies on {{zebra finch}} {{have shown that}} nuclei in the {{auditory}} thalamus, two steps up from the cochlea, do not passively relay input from peripheral sensory structures into higher forebrain structures. Thalamic nuclei show different patterns of gene expression in response to different stimuli, implicating them {{in the process of}} acoustic discrimination. Neurons in the nucleus ovoidalis (Ov) have receptive fields that are tuned to respond to the specific combination of spectral and temporal features present in syllables of conspecific song. Stimulus-selective tuning is determined by the receptor proteins and ion channels characterizing synapses of these neurons. Neurons can selectively respond to <b>time-based</b> differences between songs (e.g. syllable length or syllable-interval length) if they are post-synaptic to either fast-release (ionotropic) or slow-release (metabotropic) glutamate receptors.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{increasing}} amount {{of research on the}} effect of age on prospective memory where typical studies compare groups of people from different ages. A study by Smith et al. (2010) comparing event-based prospective memory in schoolchildren (7–10 years old) and young adults found that adults had better memory performance. Another study by Kvavilashvili et al. (2009) comparing <b>time-based</b> prospective memory among young adults (18- to 30-year-olds), young-old adults (60- to 75-year-olds) and old-old adults (76- to 90-year-olds) showed that young adults had better performance. Event-based prospective memory was further compared between young-old and old-old adults and findings were that young-old adults performed better than old-old adults. These studies suggested that there is continual improvement of prospective memory from childhood into young adulthood but that a decline begins in late adulthood.|$|E
25|$|The CharlieCard {{can store}} value (keep a cash balance) {{and hold a}} {{combination}} of <b>time-based</b> passes which allow unlimited rides during a set period of time. Passengers use the plastic CharlieCard by tapping it against a target on a gate or a vehicle farebox. If left in a wallet, the card can usually be read when the wallet {{is placed on the}} reader. The gate or farebox then either automatically debits the cost of the passenger's ride, or verifies that the card has a valid transfer or that the card has a pass that is valid for travel at the given time and location. Transit riders can add value or a monthly pass to their cards at machines located at MBTA stations and vehicles, MBTA ticket offices, retail sales terminals at select outlets and online.|$|E
25|$|Kingston {{is home to}} {{many artists}} who work in visual arts, media arts, literature, {{and a growing number}} who work in other <b>time-based</b> {{disciplines}} such as performance art. The contemporary arts scene in particular has two long standing professional non-profit venues in the downtown area, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre (founded 1957), and Modern Fuel Artist-Run Centre (founded 1977). Local artists often participate in the exhibition programming of each organization, while each also presents the work of artists from across Canada and around the world – in keeping with their educational mandates. Alternative venues for the presentation of exhibition programs in Kingston include the Union Gallery (Queen's University's student art gallery), Verb Gallery, Open Studio 22, the Kingston Arts Council gallery, The Artel: Arts Accommodations and Venue, and the Tett Centre for Creativity and Learning.|$|E
