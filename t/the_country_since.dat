5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Oman, the cyclone briefly re-intensified slightly, possibly {{due to the}} warm waters. However, increasing wind shear and entrainment of dry air from the Arabian Peninsula continued to remove deep convection from its eastern semicircle. On June 6, the cyclone turned to the north-northwest, and later that day the JTWC downgraded Gonu to tropical storm status. The IMD followed suit by downgrading Gonu to severe cyclonic storm status and later to cyclonic storm status early on June 7. Gonu crossed the Makran coast in Iran six hours later and the IMD stopped issuing advisories on the cyclone. This made it the first tropical cyclone on record to hit <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>since</b> 1898. After landfall, Gonu persisted as a remnant low over Iran through June 8.|$|E

5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>since</b> {{the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Erica (RSMC Nadi designation: 10F, JTWC designation: 23P) of March 2003 was a {{powerful}} cyclone that severely affected New Caledonia and was considered the worst to affect <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>since</b> Cyclone Beti. The system was the eighth cyclone and the fifth severe tropical cyclone of the 2002-03 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Erica developed from a monsoonal trough on 4 March just off of Queensland. Originally, the storm moved slowly towards the east and then north early in its existence. However, increasing wind shear caused the storm to be degenerated into a tropical low. After conditions once again became more favorable for development, the remnants regenerated into a tropical cyclone on 10 March. Steadily intensifying, Erica reached peak intensity on 13 March as a Category 5 equivalent on the Saffirâ€“Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E

This staggering meant that each of the candidates strategically tried to gain votes in later voting regions based upon the earlier results: bribery and irregularities in the election were rampant. Just before voting began in Atakora, the last department to vote which was a stronghold for Maga, AhomadÃ©gbÃ© supporters instigated violence to undercut turnout. Maga would have won the presidency if he had earned the most votes in Atakora, but instead of allowing the vote to go forward, de Souza suspended the election and immediately called on all sides to come to an agreement forming the next government.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 Myanmar cyclone was {{considered}} the worst to strike <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>since</b> 1968. The second tropical cyclone of the 2004 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it formed as a depression on May16 in the central Bay of Bengal. With low wind shear and a surge in the monsoon trough, the storm intensified while meandering over open waters. The storm eventually began a steady northeastward motion due to a ridge to the north over India. While approaching land, an eye developed {{in the center of}} the storm, indicative of a strong cyclone. On May19, the cyclone made landfall along northwestern Myanmar near Sittwe, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 165km/h (105mph) by the India Meteorological Department. The storm rapidly weakened over land, although its remnants spread rainfall into northern Thailand and Yunnan province in China.|$|E

The Faroe Islands Sports Association was formed in 1939, and three years later a national league was created. Cup competitions were introduced in 1955 before the FSF was founded on 13 January 1979.|$|E
