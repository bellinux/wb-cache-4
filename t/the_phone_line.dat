5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled {{the sale of}} tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by a}} dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line,</b> and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E
5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line.</b> McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Beebe and Barton's Bathysphere dives were {{interrupted}} {{for a year}} due to technical problems and uncooperative weather. An additional difficulty in 1931 was the death of Beebe's father, and Beebe left Nonsuch Island for a week in order to attend his father's funeral. A second year-long interruption occurred in 1933, and was caused {{in part by a}} lack of funds due to the Great Depression. Although Beebe and Barton performed no dives in 1933, their work gathered a large amount of publicity when the Bathysphere was displayed in a special exhibit for the American Museum of Natural History, and later at the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago, where they shared the fair's Hall of Science with Auguste Piccard. Beebe and Barton also obtained publicity for their dives from several articles Beebe wrote describing them for National Geographic, and from an NBC radio broadcast in which Beebe's voice transmitted up <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> from inside the Bathysphere was broadcast nationally over the radio.|$|E
50|$|On 16 August 2007 {{the show}} {{finished}} prematurely after <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> went down, requiring hosts Mills and Garonzi to stall the contest and fill-in for 30 minutes. As they couldn't get <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> {{back up in}} time, the last 30 minutes of the show's schedule {{was replaced by a}} repeat of Keynotes, a short lived game show that aired on Nine in the summer of 1992.|$|R
50|$|On 24 October 2007 {{the show}} started without {{a game to}} display, as <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> were 'down' again.|$|R
50|$|The final five {{performed}} {{in front of}} a live audience for five minutes each. After all five had performed, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> opened to let home viewers vote for their favorite comic. The one with the lowest amount of votes would be eliminated. Each comic had a short bio before their performance. After <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> opened, <b>the</b> current lowest two vote-getters, Roz and Josh Blue, were displayed on the screen, albeit to only half of the audience.|$|R
25|$|The new design, {{housed in}} an {{extruded}} aluminum case sized {{to allow a}} standard desktop telephone to rest on top, was announced in April 1981. It was known simply as the Smartmodem. The Smartmodem was the first modem integrating complete control over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line,</b> and that allowed it {{to be used in}} exactly the same fashion with any computer.|$|E
25|$|On May 18, 2008, Weigman {{and others}} {{drove to the}} {{residence}} of the Verizon investigator who was investigating Weigman’s activity, and attempted to intimidate and frighten him. Weigman had {{admitted that he had}} already placed intimidating and harassing messages and calls to the investigator. When Weigman's phone line was disconnected by Verizon because <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> he was using was illegitimate, he infiltrated the Verizon phone system and used this information to harass the employee and to gain information about the status of the investigation that Verizon was conducting.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the ransoming process, the Cázares {{were allowed}} to talk with their {{remaining}} relatives in three occasions. In their first phone conversation, the victims talked about their concern for their wives and children. Their second conversation was a lot shorter and emotive for the Cázares, however. By July 27, the kidnappers said they needed a final cash deliver in order to release them. The Cázares sent the money to Matamoros from Texas and eagerly awaited at a disclosed location for a white van {{that was supposed to}} deliver their relatives. The van never came and <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> that the family used to contact the kidnappers was out of service. Weeks after that, the family decided to contact law enforcement.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{telephone}} line network which the Meganet ran on {{has been criticized}} for its logistical issues in online gaming. [...] According to Electronic Gaming Monthly, [...] "Even though the TeleGenesis modem has been announced, it has yet to appear and the real usefulness of a device that is used only to play games with friends over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> remains questionable (both have to have <b>the</b> modem, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> must be clear, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> bills will be a problem if it’s a long-distance call, etc.)" [...] The same issues that plagued the Meganet over <b>the</b> use of <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> for Internet connectivity would later resurface when Catapult Entertainment launched the XBAND service in 1994.|$|R
50|$|A {{combination}} of these methods was possible. A set of relays were continuously powered by the power supply. The common-audible ringing signals from the KSU would run though the energized relays to certain phones that would also ring {{if there was a}} power failure. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> that terminated at the KSU were also terminated at these relays and {{in the event of a}} power failure, the relays would de-energize and switch <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> to <b>the</b> ringers of selected phones.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, NORAD {{answered}} {{more than}} 100,000 phone calls. In 2015, more than 1,200 U.S. and Canadian military personnel volunteered to staff <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, by 1943 Pilecki had {{realized}} {{no possibility of}} rescue existed from outside the camp. Deciding {{to break out of}} the camp, and hoping to personally convince the Home Army that a rescue attempt was a valid option, when he was assigned to a night shift at a camp bakery outside the fence, he and two comrades overpowered a guard, cut <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> and escaped on the night of 26–27 April 1943, taking along documents stolen from the Germans. In the event of capture, they were prepared to swallow cyanide. After several days, with the help of local civilians, they contacted a Home Army unit. Pilecki submitted another detailed report on conditions at Auschwitz which was forwarded to London, but the British authorities refused air support for an operation to help the inmates escape. An air raid was considered too risky, and Home Army reports on Nazi atrocities at Auschwitz were deemed to be gross exaggerations. In turn, the Home Army decided that it wasn't able to storm the camp by itself.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} 35 minutes, there were {{technical}} difficulties with the Fort Worth TV relay {{as well as}} with the phone link MacNeil was using to report from the hospital. When the coverage began, McGee was waiting for MacNeil to call in with information. While Ryan and Huntley were recounting the information, McGee got MacNeil on the line and told him to recount chronologically what happened. However, NBC was using a studio that wasn't equipped to patch calls through to the air and thus only McGee could hear MacNeil. While the studio crew worked on a solution, McGee improvised and told MacNeil to relay the information in fragments, which he would then repeat for the audience. While they were talking, Huntley was handed a speaker from off camera and took the receiver from McGee so he could attach it to the earpiece, this enabling MacNeil to be heard. However, by that time there was no further information to report; MacNeil had a medical student from Parkland hold <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> for him so that he could return to the emergency ward for the latest developments.|$|E
500|$|In June 2016, fans {{discovered}} a pizzeria and restaurant in Long Branch, New Jersey called Freddie's, and again called the restaurant in mass numbers to determine affiliation to Five Nights at Freddy's. The hundreds {{of phone calls}} received by the restaurant each day caused difficulty for legitimate customers {{to be able to}} place orders through <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line.</b> A pizzeria called Freddie's Pizza & Pasta in Roseville, California also suffered from this.|$|E

50|$|The first {{telephone}} system in Saskatchewan {{was on the}} Bell Farm built in 1882 by Major Bell on ten miles (16 km) square or 60000 acres at Indian Head. The telecommunications system utilised barbed wire for <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
500|$|... "Telephone" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Lady Gaga for her third EP, The Fame Monster (2009). The song features American singer Beyoncé. The song was written by Gaga, Rodney Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels, Lazonate Franklin and Beyoncé. Inspired by her fear of suffocation, Gaga explained that the lyrics preferring relaxing {{on the dance floor}} to answering her lover's phone call are a metaphor, the phone calling her representing the fear of not having worked hard enough to succeed. Originally, Gaga wrote the song for Britney Spears, who recorded a demo. Musically, [...] "Telephone" [...] consists of an expanded bridge, verse-rap and a sampled voice of an operator announcing that <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> is unreachable. Beyoncé appears {{in the middle of the}} song, singing the verses in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats.|$|E
500|$|These {{reports were}} a {{principal}} source of intelligence on Auschwitz for the Western Allies. Pilecki hoped {{that either the}} Allies would drop arms or troops into the camp or that the Home Army would organize an assault on it from outside. Such plans, however, were all judged impossible to carry out. [...] Meanwhile, the Camp Gestapo under SS-Untersturmfuhrer Maximilian Grabner redoubled its efforts to ferret out ZOW members, succeeding in killing many of them. Pilecki decided {{to break out of}} the camp with the hope of convincing Home Army leaders personally that a rescue attempt was a valid option. When he was assigned to a night shift at a camp bakery outside the fence, he and two comrades overpowered a guard, cut <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> and escaped on the night of 26/27 April 1943, taking with them documents stolen from the Germans.|$|E
500|$|From 1930 to 1934, Beebe and Barton {{used the}} Bathysphere {{to conduct a}} series of dives of {{increasing}} depth {{off the coast of}} Nonsuch Island, becoming the first people to observe deep-sea animals in their native environment. The Bathysphere was lowered into the ocean using a steel cable, and a second cable carried a phone line which the Bathysphere's occupants used to communicate with the surface, as well as an electrical cable for a searchlight to illuminate animals outside the Bathysphere. Beebe's observations were relayed up <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> to be recorded by Gloria Hollister, his chief technical associate who was also in charge of preparing specimens obtained from dredging. Beebe and Barton made a total of 35 dives in the Bathysphere, setting several consecutive world records for the deepest dive ever performed by a human. The record set by the deepest of these, to a depth of [...] on August 15, 1934, lasted until it was broken by Barton in 1949.|$|E

500|$|There {{were only}} 16 presidential primary states in 1920, {{of which the}} most crucial to Harding was Ohio. Harding had to have some loyalists at the {{convention}} to have any chance of nomination, and the Wood campaign hoped to knock Harding {{out of the race}} by taking Ohio. Wood campaigned in the state, and his supporter, Procter, spent large sums; Harding spoke in the nonconfrontational style he had adopted in 1914. Harding and Daugherty were so confident of sweeping Ohio's 48 delegates that the candidate went on to the next state, Indiana, before the April 27 Ohio primary. Harding carried Ohio by only 15,000 votes over Wood, taking less than half the total vote, and won only 39 of 48 delegates. In Indiana, Harding finished fourth, with less than ten percent of the vote, and failed to win a single delegate. He was willing to give up and have Daugherty file his nomination papers for the Senate, but Florence Harding grabbed the phone from his hand, [...] "Warren Harding, what are you doing? Give up? Not until the convention is over. Think of your friends in Ohio!" [...] On learning that Daugherty had left <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line,</b> the future First Lady retorted, [...] "Well, you tell Harry Daugherty for me that we're in this fight until Hell freezes over." ...|$|E

2500|$|Zone Mail Hour, {{as it was}} named, varies {{depending}} on the geographic location of the node, and was designated to occur during the early morning.

5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public <b>phones</b> in <b>the</b> township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines.</b> Initially <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|R

2500|$|After {{packing the}} plug in more securely, and sending the Bathysphere down for another test dive {{in which the}} plug held, Beebe and Barton set off for their radio dive on September 22. [...] The {{first part of the}} radio {{broadcast}} was conducted from on board the Freedom, describing Beebe and Barton preparing for their dive, while the second part would be relayed up <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> from the sphere as Beebe and Barton descended in it. [...] The ocean during this dive was rougher than it had been during any of their previous dives, and as the Freedom rocked on the surface, its motion was transmitted down the steel cable, causing the Bathysphere to swing from side to side like a pendulum. [...] As the Bathysphere descended, Barton succumbed to seasickness and vomited inside it. [...] However, {{the first half of the}} radio transmission had already been broadcast, and neither Beebe nor Barton wished to cancel its second half, so they continued their descent.|$|E
2500|$|Beebe and Barton {{resumed their}} dives in 1932, this time {{launching}} the Bathysphere {{from a single}} ship called the Freedom instead of the Ready and the Gladisfen.

[...] Barton also hoped to film deep-sea creatures from inside the Bathysphere. [...] Beebe normally observed the depths {{through one of the}} Bathysphere's three windows since the searchlight was shone through the second, and a steel plug had been in place of the third, but this was changed when Barton had the steel plug replaced with a third window in order to film through it. [...] When conducting an unmanned test of the Bathysphere with the third window installed, they found it almost entirely full of water.
