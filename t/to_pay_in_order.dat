25|$|Business pricing {{requires}} the company utilizing weather derivative instruments {{to understand how}} its financial performance is affected by adverse weather conditions {{across a variety of}} outcomes (i.e. obtain a utility curve with respect to particular weather variables). Then the user can determine how much he/she is willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to protect his/her business from those conditions in case they occurred based on his/her cost-benefit analysis and appetite for risk. In this way, a business can obtain a 'guaranteed weather' for the period in question, largely reducing the expenses/revenue variations due to weather.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "pirate night vision" [...] myth {{asserts that}} pirates wore a patch over one eye in {{preparation}} for battle {{in order to have}} one eye adjusted to above-deck daylight and the other adjusted to below-deck darkness. The myth supposes that during raids pirates would remove their patches when going below deck and thus be instantly granted one-eyed night vision to easily navigate the ship's dim interior. Although an interesting idea, the loss of depth perception during the critical period of boarding and seizing control of a vessel would be an incredibly large price <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to see better when going below deck, making this myth implausible.|$|E
6000|$|Let us {{hear what}} reason {{the man who}} was in the true secret gives for not {{accepting}} the Rajah's offer. [...] "I rejected," [...] says Mr. Hastings, [...] "the offer of twenty lacs, with which the Rajah would have compromised for his guilt when it was too late." [...] My Lords, he best knows what the motives of his own actions were. He says, the offer was made [...] "when it was too late." [...] Had he previously told the Rajah what sum of money he would be required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to buy himself off, or had he required him to name any sum which he was willing to pay? Did he, after having refused the offer made by the Rajah, say, [...] "Come and make me a better offer, or upon such a day I shall declare that your offers are inadmissible"? No such thing appears. Your Lordships will further remark, that Mr. Hastings refused the 200,000l. {{at a time when the}} exigencies of the Company were so pressing that he was obliged to rob, pilfer, and steal upon every side,--at a time when he was borrowing 40,000l. from Mr. Sulivan in one morning, and raising by other under-jobs 27,000l. more. In the distress [in?] which his own extravagance and prodigality had involved him, 200,000l. would have been a weighty benefit, although derived from his villany; but this relief he positively refused, because, says he, [...] "the offer came too late." [...] From these words, my Lords, we may infer that there was a time when the offer would not have been [...] "too late,"--a period at which it would have been readily accepted. No such thing appears. There is not a trace upon your minutes, not a trace in the correspondence of the Company, to prove that the Rajah would at any time have been permitted to buy himself off from this complicated tyranny.|$|E
