40|$|The {{services}} sector {{plays an important}} role in the economic transformation of a country. The growing tradability of services provides new challenges and opportunities to <b>Thailand's</b> services industries. Underpinning these challenges and opportunities is the competiveness and export structure of the {{services sector}}. <b>Thailand's</b> current services export structure is a manifest of its relative specialisation based upon given resources, activities, and strategies. To assess the competiveness of <b>Thailand's</b> services sector, the paper computes the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) indices of <b>Thailand's</b> transport, travel, insurance and financial services. Specifically, the paper evaluates the shifting export competiveness of <b>Thailand's</b> services industries in the context of ASEAN- 5. Among other factors, export competiveness in services depends upon the height of market access barriers, targeted under GATS and AFAS. The paper analyses <b>Thailand's</b> service liberalisation scorecard in terms of its committments to liberalise trade in services. Acknowledging the fact that the domestic, regional, and global trading environment is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for services firms to participate in international trade, the paper signifies the need to work on various industry, firm, and mode-specific factors that underpin competiveness of the Thai services industry...|$|R
