The objective is concrete — to connect word forms in real <b>text</b> <b>to</b> <b>entries</b> in dictionaries available in electronic format. The connection is done through a morphological component implemented in Functional Morphology. The challenge we face is to find an appropriate model of Old Swedish that is {{able to deal with}} the rich variation in the spelling of the word forms in real text, and connect them with the idealized citation forms of the dictionaries. The reason for the rich variation is twofold: no spelling standards were available for Swedish at that time, and the time period is three hundred years, during which many natural changes occurs. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} morphological description of Old Swedish implemented in Functional Morphology. The {{objective of the}} work is concrete – connecting word forms in real <b>text</b> <b>to</b> <b>entries</b> in electronic dictionaries, for use in an online reading aid for students learning Old Swedish. The challenge we face is to find an appropriate model of Old Swedish able to deal with the rich linguistic variation in real texts, so that word forms appearing in real texts can be connected to the idealized citation forms of the dictionaries. 1. 1. Motivation 1. Background Languages with a long written tradition have accumulated over the centuries a rich cultural heritage in the form of texts from different periods {{in the history of the}} language community. In these texts, we find information on many aspects of the origins and history of our culture. Since languages change over time, older texts can be difficult or impossible to understand without special training. Indeed, the oldest extant texts in many European language...|$|R
40|$|Distant {{supervision}} is {{a successful}} paradigm that gathers training data for information extraction systems by automatically aligning vast databases of facts with text. Previous work has demonstrated its usefulness for the extraction of binary relations such as a person’s employer or a film’s director. Here, we extend the distant supervision approach to template-based event extraction, focusing on the extraction of passenger counts, aircraft types, and other facts concerning airplane crash events. We present a new publicly available dataset and event extraction task in the plane crash domain based on Wikipedia infoboxes and newswire text. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary evaluation of four distantly supervised extraction models which assign named entity mentions in <b>text</b> <b>to</b> <b>entries</b> in the event template. Our results indicate that joint inference over sequences of candidate entity mentions is ben-eficial. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SEARN algorithm outperforms a linear-chain CRF and strong baselines with local inference...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Text {{messaging}} {{through the}} Internet or cellular phones {{has become a}} major medium of personal and commercial communication. In the same time, flames (such as rants, taunts, and squalid phrases) are offensive/abusive phrases which might attack or offend the users for a variety of reasons. An automatic discriminative software with a sensitivity parameter for flame or abusive language detection would be a useful tool. Although a human could recognize these sorts of useless annoying texts among the useful ones, it is not an easy task for computer programs. In this paper, we describe an automatic flame detection method which extracts features at different conceptual levels and applies multilevel classification for flame detection. While the system is taking advantage of a variety of statistical models and rule-based patterns, there is an auxiliary weighted pattern repository which improves accuracy by matching the <b>text</b> <b>to</b> its graded <b>entries...</b>|$|R

40|$|Over the years, Twitter {{has become}} one of the largest {{communication}} platforms providing key data to various applications such as brand monitoring, trend detection, among others. Entity linking is one of the major tasks in natural language understanding from tweets and it associates entity mentions in <b>text</b> <b>to</b> corresponding <b>entries</b> in knowledge bases in order to provide unambiguous interpretation and additional con- text. State-of-the-art techniques have focused on linking explicitly mentioned entities in tweets with reasonable success. However, we argue that in addition to explicit mentions i. e. The movie Gravity was more ex- pensive than the mars orbiter mission entities (movie Gravity) can also be mentioned implicitly i. e. This new space movie is crazy. you must watch it!. This paper introduces the problem of implicit entity linking in tweets. We propose an approach that models the entities by exploiting their factual and contextual knowledge. We demonstrate how to use these models to perform implicit entity linking on a ground truth dataset with 397 tweets from two domains, namely, Movie and Book. Specifically, we show: 1) the importance of linking implicit entities and its value addition to the standard entity linking task, and 2) the importance of exploiting contextual knowledge associated with an entity for linking their implicit mentions. We also make the ground truth dataset publicly available to foster the research in this new research area.

40|$|Although text {{messaging}} services {{are becoming increasingly}} popular in today’s global wireless market, fundamental design issues still linger with respect <b>to</b> <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> methods on mobile communication devices.

Pursuing a deterministic and linguistically optimized approach to character disambiguation, SIMKEYS achieves significant improvement in typing performance over existing methods, verified by extensive simulation results. It also consumes negligible amounts of system resources and incurs minimal development costs. Because of its simplicity and efficiency, SIMKEYS {{opens the door to}} exciting opportunities in the next stage of development of the wireless Internet...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We present GyroPen, {{a method}} to {{reconstruct}} the motion path for pen-like interaction from standard built-in sensors in modern smartphones. The key idea is to reconstruct {{a representation of the}} trajectory of the phone’s corner that is touching a writing or drawing surface from the measurements obtained from the phone’s gyroscopes and accelerometers. We propose to directly use the angular trajectory for this recon-struction, which removes the necessity for accurate absolute 3 D position estimation, a task that can be difficult using low-cost accelerometers. We connect GyroPen to a handwriting recog-nition system and perform two proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate that the reconstruction accuracy of GyroPen is accurate enough to be a promising approach <b>to</b> <b>text</b> <b>entry.</b> In a first experiment, the average novice participant (n “ 10) was able to write the first word only 37 seconds after the starting to use GyroPen for the first time.
