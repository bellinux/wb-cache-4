5|$|Kansas {{received}} Virginia Tech's kickoff, and the Hokies {{attempted to}} give themselves another chance at offense by calling timeouts after Kansas rushed the ball. The timeouts stopped the clock, but Kansas managed {{to earn a}} first down and run out the clock after Tech used its allotted threetimeouts. Heading into halftime, Kansas still had <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> the momentum, but a Virginia Tech touchdown had cut the Jayhawks' lead to just 10points, 177.|$|E
5|$|A {{surprisingly}} fast {{beginning to}} the stage, with a first hour that covered over , {{managed to keep}} any breakaways from going clear for over two hours. Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third group on the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E

5|$|Brad Keselowski won {{the pole}} position, {{although}} he was almost immediately passed by Tony Stewart {{at the start of}} the race. Many Chase for the Sprint Cup participants, including Jimmie Johnson, Kurt Busch, and Hamlin, were in the top ten for most of the race, although some encountered problems in the closing laps. Stewart was leading the race with two laps remaining but ran out of fuel, giving <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> <b>and</b> the win, to Bowyer. There were twenty-one lead changes among eight different drivers, as well as eight cautions during the race.|$|E

Afterward, Earnhardt {{moved into the}} first position, holding it until a caution period on lap nine. Denny Hamlin assumed the lead at the lap 14 and maintained the position until his pit stop 30 laps later. Stewart reclaimed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> held it throughout the remaining 16 laps and two further caution periods to win the first Gatorade Duel. There were three cautions and eight lead changes among five different drivers {{during the course of}} the first race.|$|E
5|$|Di Grassi won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his start line advantage {{on the first}} lap. The race was neutralised on the same lap because of Adam Carroll's stalled car and when the race restarted one lap later Vergne challenged di Grassi for <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> passed him on lap three. Di Grassi lost second place to Buemi shortly afterwards and the Swiss driver moved into the lead after overtaking Vergne on the sixth lap. Buemi kept the lead after the mandatory pit stops to switch into his second car but despite having trouble with braking {{in a straight line}} Buemi remained in first place {{for the remainder of the}} event to secure the victory. There were four lead changes among four different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E

5|$|During this period, no golfer {{suffered}} from the pressure of competing at Augusta more than Greg Norman. In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff to Larry Mize when Mize holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole and win the Masters. In 1996, Norman tied the course record with an opening round 63, and had a six-stroke lead over Nick Faldo entering the final round. Norman shot a 78 while Faldo scored a 67 to win by five shots (for his third Masters championship). Norman also suffered in 1986 when after birdieing four straight holes, and needing only a par to tie Nicklaus for <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> force a Monday playoff, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.|$|E
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings.

5|$|Freda's {{deal with}} his {{producers}} failed {{when he left the}} set on the twelfth day of production. After an argument with the producers, Freda left the production allowing Mario Bava to step in to finish the film in the next two days. Reasons for Freda leaving production differ, and range from Freda having a misunderstanding with the producers, to Bava stating that Freda was taking too long to make the film. Bava's ending was different than Freda's initial ending which involved finding the heroine hanged. Among the changes Bava made to finish the film, included changing the supporting character of the journalist becoming <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> removing a sub-plot about a dismembered criminal who returns to life on being reassembled. Bava also extended other portions of the film with stock footage and montages of newspaper presses.|$|E
5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} white lead was used during Vermeer’s time, {{but of course}} he had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had changed {{significantly}} since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> in the content of trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} round of the NCAA Tournament, Georgetown faced Wyoming and won 5143. The Hoyas then beat the Fresno State Bulldogs by eighteen, after leading by five at halftime, to advance to the {{regional}} finals. Georgetown faced off against Oregon State in the regional final. In the game, the Hoyas shot very well from the field, setting the tournament record for field goal percentage in a game, 77.4%, en route to the 69–45 victory. In the national semifinal against Louisville, both teams shot very poorly. The two teams traded the lead several times throughout the first half, but after three minutes into the second half, Georgetown gained <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> never relinquished it.

5|$|Juan Pablo Montoya {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside Ralf Schumacher. Michael Schumacher, the eventual Drivers' Champion started fourth, behind Mika Häkkinen of McLaren. The race {{was marked by}} an airborne accident going into the first corner involving Michael Schumacher and Luciano Burti for Prost, which caused the track to be scattered with shreds of carbon fibre and the race restarted as a result. Both Williams drivers retained their positions {{at the end of}} the first lap, with Michael Schumacher passing Häkkinen for third. Over the course of the race, Montoya extended a considerable lead over Ralf Schumacher. Montoya lost the lead on lap 24 when an issue with a refulling rig caused him to be stationary for more than 20 seconds. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> held it to win his third victory of the season.|$|E

40|$|An exact {{theoretical}} framework based on Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) is proposed {{in order to}} deal with the time-dependent quantum transport in fully interacting systems.
