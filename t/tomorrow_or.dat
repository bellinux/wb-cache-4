5|$|The University of Central Florida has {{a unique}} campus layout {{that has become a}} model for other universities, {{reminiscent}} of the plans by Walt Disney for his Experimental Prototype Community of <b>Tomorrow,</b> <b>or</b> EPCOT. The campus was designed to be a pedestrian oriented campus, with a series of concentric circles. The outermost circle is Gemini Blvd, which is also the main road for vehicular traffic on campus. Inside of Gemini, there is Apollo Circle, Mercury Circle, and finally Pegasus Circle as the innermost circle. Pegasus Circle contains the student union, which is the center of the campus, with the John C. Hitt Library located directly to the south of it. All academic buildings are located inside of Gemini, with the circle divided up into pie-shaped sections for each college. As there are very few roads inside of Gemini, many buildings' loading docks are accessible only by sidewalks and thus receive most deliveries at night. The University of Central Florida campus is one of only two in the nation with a concentric circle design, the other being the University of California, Irvine. Newsweek has ranked UCF as having the 20th most beautiful university campus in the country. Student housing is provided along the perimeter of the campus. Outside of Gemini, the campus is divided up into different themed sections. The northwest side of campus includes Greek communities, the north side contains Knights Plaza, an uptown style athletic village, the east side contains the Arboretum of the University of Central Florida, and the south side contains student recreation and wellness facilities.|$|E

2500|$|The Romanian {{newspaper}} Gândul {{has reported}} that the Dimitrie Cantemir Christian University from Bucharest started 34 Master's degree curricula which have no legal ground. According to the rector of the university, Corina Dumitrescu, the law has a loophole, since it uses a continuous present for institutional evaluation, which is uncharacteristic of the Romanian language. She says that in her opinion institutional evaluation (required by law) may also happen after the curricula have been taught. The actual wording in Romanian is [...] "universitate acreditată supusă periodic evaluării instituţionale", and Dumitrescu argues that [...] "care se supun" [...] means that an accredited institution can be evaluated [...] "today, <b>tomorrow</b> <b>or</b> the day after tomorrow" [...] (and presumably, any time), not {{that it needs to}} have been evaluated in the past. For the study year 2010-2011, 16 Master's curricula from nine of its faculties are listed as accredited in Order no. 4630/2010 of the Department of Education.|$|E
2500|$|As {{far north}} as Fairbanks, Alaska, a {{reviewer}} wrote that, if the film had been shown {{to the people of}} Europe before the war started {{there would have been no}} war:"'Civilization' is worth $1.50 today, <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>or</b> at any time. It is a masterpiece—a picture that grips and thrills. It preaches a powerful sermon and preaches it in a way that makes it interesting. ... After seeing 'Civilization' one can truthfully say that had Henry Ford produced a film like this one that Ince directed, and sent it broadcast throughout the civilized world as an argument against war, he would have accomplished more for universal peace than did his famous 'peace expedition.' He would have reached the great mass of people who have but a faint recollection of the horrors of war, and would have showed them the pain and the suffering and the sorrow that war brings with it. Had such a picture as 'Civilization' been shown to the people of Europe before the war started there would have been no war." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Lloyd Webber {{hoped to}} bring the Melbourne {{production}} to Broadway in the future, he told The New York Times that, even with the positive reception of the reworked Melbourne production, a Broadway transfer was probably not realistic. The Melbourne production was filmed on 15 September 2011 and made available on DVD. The recording was originally to be released on DVD and Blu-ray 1 February 2012, but it was later delayed till 29 May 2012 in the United States. In the UK, the DVD was released on 12 March 2012, and in Australia it was released on 8 February 2012. The recorded performance also played in select theatres on 28 February and 7 March 2012. It was then screened again in US cinemas on 23 May 2012. Lloyd Webber stated at the time that, even if a Broadway production did not happen, {{he felt that he}} had closed the chapter on the piece, as the filmed version is something he's, [...] "very, very proud of" [...] and it does not really matter to him, [...] "if it comes <b>tomorrow</b> <b>or</b> five years' time".
