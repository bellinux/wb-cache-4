6000|$|... "I did {{not tell}} them {{anything}} of the sort. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> accepted their proposal, and that I could answer for your accepting it too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{until after}} breakfast, sir, anyhow. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might look {{in some time}} in the morning, but that I could not say whether you might want me for anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} lied {{to all of}} them," [...] she replied. [...] "I will have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had plenty. I told her too. I could not be {{lowering}} James More to them." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{have heard}} of that idea of Haile Selassie being the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. I also met certain Rastafarians. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> clearly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a man, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am mortal, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be {{replaced}} by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that the human being is emanated from a deity." [...] Interview with Bill McNeil.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, legally {{it is my}} own. <b>I</b> know <b>that.</b> And {{when there}} was some {{question}} whether {{it should not be}} disputed, I would have fought for it to the last shilling. Somebody--I suppose it was the lawyer--wanted to keep from me the place in Surrey. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> then <b>I</b> would not abandon my right to an inch of it. But they yielded, and now I have given them back the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not going!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{at home to}} no one, and I {{thought that}} you would stay and {{entertain}} me. Sit down again, Wingrave!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{thought you would}} like to see it, and they said that they should be very happy to show it to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{look at me}} {{as though}} I were {{something}} unreal!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was fond of early morning rides, and I saw your light burning here from the park. Tell me--is he worse?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Whether <b>I</b> re-entered <b>that</b> unhappy {{country or}} not was of little {{consequence}} to me. I {{would like to}} have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the sooner <b>I</b> was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was fed up of America's insults and moral pomposity...|$|R
60|$|Being thus invited, I {{consented to}} spin them a yarn. The old gentleman settled {{himself in his}} chair, my mother {{smoothed}} her apron, folded her hands, and looked meekly into my face. Tom Lokins filled his pipe, stretched out his foot to poke the fire {{with the toe of}} his shoe, and began to smoke like a steam-engine; then I cleared my throat and began my tale, and before I had done talking <b>that</b> night, <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> in this little book, almost word for word.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1967 {{recorded}} interview Haile Selassie {{appeared to}} deny his alleged divinity. In the interview Bill McNeil says: [...] "there {{are millions of}} Christians throughout the world, your Imperial Majesty, who regard you as the reincarnation of Jesus Christ." [...] Selassie replied in his native language: I have heard of <b>that</b> idea. <b>I</b> also met certain Rastafarians. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> clearly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a man, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am mortal, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{will be replaced by}} the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Ronald said. [...] "I {{only know}} that two men did {{come up with}} a horse to me this morning, and said that one of the {{officers}} had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to buy one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{explained}} my {{intentions to}} the men, who both held up their arms in horror. Their fears for my safety {{were a little}} mitigated, however, when I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not expect them to come with me.|$|E
60|$|The Committee {{are very}} anxious to have you for a steward, {{as one of the}} heads of a large class; and I have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have no doubt you will act. There is no steward's fee or {{collection}} whatever.|$|E
5000|$|Messick {{created the}} {{character}} of Brenda Starr in 1940, naming it after 1930s debutante Brenda Frazier, and basing her appearance on Rita Hayworth. Messick wanted to produce a strip with a female protagonist; she decided {{a career as a}} reporter would allow her character to travel and have adventures, adventures more glamorous than those actually experienced by most reporters. She said in a 1986 article in the San Francisco Chronicle, [...] "I used to get letters from girl reporters saying that their lives were nowhere near as exciting as Brenda's. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> made Brenda's life like theirs, nobody would read it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope it will. As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> at {{headquarters}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to}} start today, I should not like any of them to run across me here this evening. No doubt the landlord of the hotel can tell us of some man who keeps the sort of animals we want. The saddlery we shall have no difficulty about." ...|$|R
60|$|That afternoon, the Major {{in command}} {{decided to send}} out the two American scouts to scour the grass and discover, if possible, how near our lines the Matabele had penetrated. I begged hard to be {{permitted}} to accompany them. I wanted, if I could, to get evidence against Sebastian; or, at least, to learn whether he was still directing and assisting the enemy. At first, the scouts laughed at my request; but when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> privately <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believed I had a clue against the white traitor who had caused the revolt, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wished to identify him, they changed their tone, and began to think {{there might be something}} in it.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed that}} Hooja {{had made it}} appear that I had {{intentionally}} left Dian behind, and that I did not purpose ever returning to Pellucidar. He <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was of another world and that I had tired of this and of its inhabitants.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I got back, I {{found several}} women waiting outside Saleh's house. His wife had gossiped with a neighbour, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had got the bullet {{out of his}} wound. The news spread rapidly, and these women were all there to beg that I would see their husbands.|$|E
60|$|There were no attendants at home; {{they had}} absconded to make merry {{in honor of}} the time. I had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should not return until the morning, and had given them {{explicit}} orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.|$|E
50|$|His {{problems}} were mostly {{due to the}} fact that in 1658 Cudworth sent a long letter to England, expressing his umbrage and his many complaints, largely regarding his association with Quakers, with whom he did not agree on most issues, but in closing with: but the Quakers and my self cannot close on divers Things; And so I signified to the Court, I was no Quaker…But withal, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> <b>That</b> as <b>I</b> was no Quaker, so I will be no Persecutor. Cudworth went on in his letter to describe to those in England the brutal punishments that the colonial government gave the Quakers and others, for unlawful actions large and small, such as whippings, mutilations and banishments from the Colony on pain of death.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was obliged}} {{to go down and}} show myself to the people an hour since, for they {{assembled}} in a great crowd, clamouring to see me so that they might know I was safe. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> while <b>I</b> thanked <b>them</b> for their loyal care, there was nought to be alarmed about. It was true that there had been an attempt on my life by four men, of whom the leader had a private grudge against me for a disservice I did him some years ago, but that all had been killed by my guards without even penetrating my chamber, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had run no sort of personal risk, nor had I any reason whatever to suppose that the malefactors had accomplices either within or without the palace." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{no doubt}} {{they were married in}} the sight of God, and were bound in {{conscience}} to keep them as their wives; but that the laws of men being otherwise, they might desert the poor women and children hereafter; and that their wives, being poor desolate women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way to help themselves. <b>I</b> therefore <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> unless <b>I</b> was assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing for them, but would take care <b>that</b> what <b>I</b> did should be for the women and children without them; and that, unless they would give me some assurances that they would marry the women, I could not think it was convenient they should continue together as man and wife; for that it was both scandalous to men and offensive to God, who they could not think would bless them if they went on thus.|$|R
60|$|They did {{not attack}} us, {{owing to the}} peace which exists between the Mahars and the Mezops, but I could see that they looked upon me with {{considerable}} suspicion. My friends <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a stranger from a remote country, and as we had previously planned against such a contingency I pretended ignorance of the language which the human beings of Pellucidar employ in conversing with the gorilla-like soldiery of the Mahars.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was a sort}} {{of curiosity}} in his eye that I did not like. I don't know whether the steward had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was [...] "queer" [...] only, or downright drunk, but I know the man meant to have a good look at me. I watched him coming with a smile which, as he got into point-blank range, took effect and froze his very whiskers. I did not give him time to open his lips.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had kept}} silent {{simply because they}} {{thought that they were}} not called to say anything; and when I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{intended}} to run into Singapore and that the best chance for the ship and the men was in the efforts all of us, sick and well, must make to get her along out of this, I received the encouragement of a low assenting murmur and of a louder voice exclaiming: [...] "Surely there is {{a way out of this}} blamed hole." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This thing {{cannot be}} done, Master Guy," [...] the archer said doggedly {{when they reached}} their apartments; [...] "it is not in reason. What should I say when I got home and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> at Summerley <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saved my own skin and left our dear lady and the {{children}} to be murdered without striking a blow on their behalf? The thing is beyond all reason, and I will maintain it to be so." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{no doubt}} {{they were married in}} the sight of God, and were bound in {{conscience}} to keep them as their wives; but that the laws of men being otherwise, they might pretend they were not married, and so desert the poor women and children hereafter; and that their wives, being poor, desolate women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way to help themselves: <b>I</b> therefore <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> <b>that</b> unless <b>I</b> was assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing for them; but would take care <b>that</b> what <b>I</b> did should be for the women and children without them; and that unless they would give some assurances that they would marry the women, I could not think it was convenient they should continue together as man and wife; for that it was both scandalous to men and offensive to God, who they could not think would bless them if they went on thus.|$|R
2500|$|In a 1967 {{interview}} when a Canadian interviewer {{mentioned the}} Rastafari {{belief that he}} was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, he responded by saying: [...] "I have heard of this idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> clearly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a man, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am mortal, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity." [...] His grandson Ermias Sahle Selassie has said that there is [...] "no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement". For some Rastas, Haile Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God. However, critics of the religion have insisted that Haile Selassie was merely a human being who never claimed to be God.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{will go down}} to Berber. I {{have told}} them {{that many of the}} people here are going down, and that they will find no {{difficulty}} in joining a party. They are sure to find people they know, at Berber, for most of the Jaalin who have escaped have gone there, since we occupied the place. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would give them what money I had; for, since I have been in my lord's service, I have had no occasion to spend aught that he has paid me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Another loss of dignity, my child," [...] {{he said to}} her in French, so {{that none}} but Martin-Roget could catch what he said. [...] "I guessed that you would commit some indiscretion, you see, so M. Martin-Roget and myself warned all the people at the inn the moment we arrived. We <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{travelling}} with a sick daughter who had become crazed through the death of her lover, and believed herself--like most crazed persons do--to be persecuted and oppressed. You have seen the result. They pitied you. Even the serving-maids smiled. It would have been wiser to remain silent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I came to find you,” said Tony hastily. “Landed at Havana with Harding’s address as my only guide. He had, I found out, {{left the}} city, but I came across {{two or three}} men who seemed to know him, {{and one of them}} passed me on to his friends, who {{contrived}} to get me here. We travelled, for the most part, at night, hiding in the daytime, and got very little to eat, but most of the men I met did what they could for me when I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had business with a leader of the Sin Verguenza.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had time}} to {{telephone}} to {{a few of my}} women friends, and they just managed to rush round for a few minutes to say good-bye. I couldn't help crying a little when I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about John's uncle dying so far away with none of us near him, and I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about the legacy, and they cried a little to hear of it all; and when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> John and <b>I</b> might not come back direct from Bermuda, but might take a run over to Europe first, they all cried some more.|$|R
2500|$|... "To the contrary, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{explicitly}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{am afraid}} lest there come forth, Heaven forbid, a stumbling block from their hands if they reject the Torah {{and the fear}} of G-d and 'please themselves in the brood of aliens' [...] I brought them examples of this from the past, from the incidents that took place due to people’s sins , from which came forth groups that turned away from G-d and abandoned the source of living waters. But they must guard the holiness of Israel, teachers and students alike, and not follow foreign ideas nor turn aside from the Torah and the mitzvos. And even then, it is not from secular subjects that Torah will come forth, but rather when we support the holy yeshivas, which are dedicated solely to the holiness of the Torah.|$|R
60|$|Having thus conquered them by good usage, I {{thought my}} next work was to inquire into the {{mistakes}} {{which had been}} the foundation of all this: so, before I parted with {{the men who had}} returned to their duty, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> <b>that</b> as <b>I</b> had freely forgiven what was past, so I would keep my word, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would never reproach them with it; but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought it was necessary their judgments should be convinced how much they were imposed upon, as well as their tempers be reduced by my kindness to <b>them.</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> was of the opinion that they had been abused in the account given them of what I had designed to do, and of the reasons I had to give for doing it; and I would desire them to let me know afterwards, whether they had been faithfully informed or not; and whether in their own judgment, now when they were freed from the prepossessions they were under, they could object anything against it or no.|$|R
