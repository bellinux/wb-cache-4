At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the {{diamonds}} are {{passed on to}} another smuggler, Shady Tree.

5|$|One day at Emain Macha, Cú Chulainn overhears Cathbad {{teaching}} his pupils. One {{asks him}} what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes arms that day will have everlasting fame. Cú Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar {{and asks for}} arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy—the warrior who took arms that day would be famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, {{in response to a}} similar prophecy by Cathbad, Cú Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king's own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of Nechtan Scéne, who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar's wife Mugain leads out the women of Emain, and they bare their breasts to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel of cold water, which explodes from the heat of his body. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in a second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, the US Internal Revenue Service seized most of {{the assets}} of Willie Nelson, {{claiming}} he owed $32 million in back taxes, including penalties and interest. He sued Price Waterhouse, contending that <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> into tax shelters that were later disallowed by the IRS. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount.|$|E

In 1862 de Tounens proceeded to visit other tribes as well. However, his servant, Juan Bautista Rosales, contacted Chilean authorities who had de Tounens arrested. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on trial {{and were going to}} send him into an asylum when the French consulate intervened and he was deported to France.|$|E
25|$|It {{was around}} this time where Luke Short {{was said to have}} traded whiskey with Indians around Camp Robinson, Nebraska. According to his nephew Wayne Short, Luke was arrested by the army. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> to a train destined to Omaha, but Luke managed to escape the army escort and went to the {{makeshift}} mining and cowtowns of Denver, Colorado and took up a profession as a gambler. At one point he killed two men on separate occasions due to altercation during their card games.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, {{his father}} died and Carrión {{went to live with}} his older {{half-brother}} José B. Carrión Santiago in the City of Arecibo. His brother was a businessman who kept the accounting records of many of the local businesses. Carrión was then able to attend the Americanized public school system which taught in English and where he would learn the language. In 1902, Carrión moved to San Juan and lived with his sister. He quit school in the eighth grade and worked for various firms until he finally found a job at Lomba & Cia, an importer of goods from the United States and Europe. When the owners of the firm became aware of Carrión's English-language proficiency, <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> charge of transactions made in that language.|$|E

25|$|Singh's most {{significant}} cause was that favouring {{the creation of}} a distinct Punjabi-speaking state. He believed that this would best protect the integrity of Sikh religious and political traditions. He began a hunger strike in 1961 at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, promising to continue it to his death unless the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to his demand for such a state. Nehru argued that India was a secular country and that this meant {{the creation of a}} state based on religious distinction was inappropriate. Nonetheless, Nehru did promise to consider the issue and thus Singh abandoned his fast after 48 days. Singh's fellow Sikhs turned against him, believing that he had capitulated, and <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on trial in a court adjudged by pijaras. He pleaded guilty to the charges laid against him and found his reputation in tatters. He was thought to have abandoned his ideals and was replaced as leader of the SAD.|$|E

His big game was voted {{second in the}} 2010 Fans Choice [...] "Best Game" [...] Minor League Baseball Yearly Awards. Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, {{and we look at}} this little guy and say, 'Where did he come from, and what is he doing here?' We were teasing him, and all he does is go out and hit about a million. I mean, here's this little infielder and <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in the fifth spot ... What's that about?

500|$|At {{the end of}} the Heimskringla saga Hákonar saga góða, {{the poem}} Hákonarmál (by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir) is presented. The saga relates that king Haakon I of Norway died in battle, and yet though he is Christian, he {{requests}} that since he has died [...] "among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you." [...] The saga relates that, shortly after, Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, that he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North Hordaland. Haakon was there buried in a large burial mound in full armor and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, [...] "words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on the way to Valhalla." [...] The poem Hákonarmál is then provided.|$|E

500|$|There was {{discussion}} among {{the producers of}} the series regarding whether Bertram {{should be included in}} the storyline, as he had not appeared in any episodes for several years. An un-used scene was intended for broadcasting which showed Stewie, while trying to find Waldo in an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, saying to Brian [...] "Oh, turn to the next page. I bet <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in someone's utility pocket", but it was never used as it was not deemed funny enough for the episode. Originally, Peter singing [...] "Milkshake" [...] to inmates at a prison was going to be naked and push his nipples from underneath, but broadcasting standards objected; as a result, the show broadcast Peter wearing underpants and pushing his nipples from the side. When Peter and Lois are in the restaurant and Peter leaves to [...] "warn the chef of Lois' arrival", Lois was intended to say [...] "If he won't put something in me, I will", but the gag was never broadcast.|$|E
500|$|By late August 1943, Hartmann had 90 aerial victories. On 19 August, {{in combat}} with Il-2s, his {{aircraft}} was damaged by debris, {{and he was}} forced to land behind Soviet lines. Hartmann's Geschwaderkommodore, Dietrich Hrabak, had given orders to Hartmann's unit to support the dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 2, led by the famous Stuka pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel in a counter-attack. The situation had changed, and the flight of eight German fighters engaged a mass of Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-5 fighter aircraft that were protecting Il-2 Sturmoviks on a ground-attack mission. Hartmann shot down two enemy aircraft before his fighter was hit by debris and {{he was forced to}} make an emergency landing. He then, in accordance with Luftwaffe regulations, attempted to recover the precision board clock. As he was doing so, Soviet ground troops approached. Realising that capture was unavoidable, he faked internal injuries. Hartmann's acting so convinced the Soviets that <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on a stretcher and placed him on a truck. When Hartmann's Crew Chief, Heinz [...] "Bimmel" [...] Mertens, heard what had happened, he took a rifle and went to search for Hartmann.|$|E
500|$|Agnew {{publicly}} supported civil rights, but deplored {{the militant}} tactics {{used by some}} black leaders. During the 1966 election, his record had won him the endorsement of Roy Wilkins, leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In mid-1967, racial tension was rising nationally, fueled by black discontent and an increasingly assertive civil rights leadership. Several cities exploded in violence, and there were riots in Cambridge, Maryland, after an incendiary speech there on July 24, 1967, by radical student leader H. Rap Brown. Agnew's principal concern was to maintain law and order, and he denounced Brown as a professional agitator: [...] "I hope <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> away and throw away the key." [...] When the Kerner Commission, appointed by President Johnson to investigate {{the causes of the}} unrest, reported that the principal factor was institutional white racism, Agnew dismissed these findings, blaming the [...] "permissive climate and misguided compassion" [...] and adding: [...] "It is not the centuries of racism and deprivation that have built to an explosive crescendo, but... that lawbreaking has become a socially acceptable and occasionally stylish form of dissent". In March 1968, when faced with a student boycott at Bowie State College, a historically black institution, Agnew again blamed outside agitators and refused to negotiate with the students. When a student committee came to Annapolis and demanded a meeting, Agnew closed the college and ordered more than 200 arrests.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Kim (born March 26, 1981) auditioned in Los Angeles. He is from Saratoga, California, and {{attended}} Monta Vista High School. Kim, being Korean-American, his motivation for auditioning was {{to alter the}} stereotypical Asian image that William Hung gave during the previous seasons. His performance received unanimous praise from the judges as Randy mentioned that Kim {{has one of the}} best male vocals he has heard this season. In contrast to their early praise, the judges mentioned when <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> through that Paul {{made it to the top}} 24 by [...] "a split decision". He sang barefoot during all of his performances. He is also known as P. Keys.|$|E
2500|$|According to the terrorist's declarations, {{made some}} {{ten years after}} the event, Moro was woken up at 06:00 AM with the excuse that he had to be moved to another secret base. In contradiction to this Bonisoli said that Moro was told that he had been [...] "pardoned" [...] and was going to be freed. The terrorists put him into a wicker basket and brought him to the parking garage of their base in via Montalcini. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> into the trunk of a red Renault and, after {{covering}} him with a red sheet, Moretti shot Moro with a 9mm Walther PPK and after the weapon jammed, a 7.65mm Škorpion vz. 61.

2500|$|After {{stuffing}} the fowl with snow, Bacon contracted a fatal case of pneumonia. Some people, including Aubrey, {{consider these}} two contiguous, possibly coincidental events as related and causative of his death: [...] "The Snow so chilled {{him that he}} immediately fell so extremely ill, {{that he could not}} return to his Lodging ... but went to the Earle of Arundel's house at Highgate, where <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> into ... a damp bed that had not been layn-in ... which gave him such a cold that in 2 or 3 days as I remember Mr Hobbes told me, he died of Suffocation." [...] Aubrey has been criticised for his evident credulousness in this and other works; on the other hand, he knew Thomas Hobbes, Bacon's fellow-philosopher and friend.|$|E

2500|$|The network {{put up a}} green ABC Sports graphic {{while it}} {{scrambled}} to repair the video feed (the broadcast cameras and mics were powered by the local power supply), but audio from the stadium was restored {{after a few seconds}} via a telephone link. Michaels had to pick up a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> back on the air. Michaels cracked, [...] "Well, folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!" [...] accompanied by the combined screams of excitement and panic from fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere.

2500|$|In {{the next}} {{revival of the}} Blackhawks (with issue #244, Jan-Feb 1976), Chop-Chop got a new name, Chopper, and was treated pretty much {{like all the other}} members of the team. He was no longer an ethnic {{caricature}} and the decades of his portrayal as one were simply ignored as if they had never happened. It took a third revival of the title in 1982 (Blackhawk #251) to finally address that issue. [...] Writer Mark Evanier and artist Dan Spiegle avoided all the racial and ethnic stereotypes that had previously defined Chop-Chop’s character except one. [...] <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> back in the coolie outfit that the character had worn for a large part of his existence. [...] This was a deliberate move so they could examine why Chop-Chop was not treated like a full member of the team in a story titled [...] "What’s the Matter with Chop-Chop?" [...] (#265, December 1983). The story has the other Blackhawks examine their attitudes and feelings and, at the end, Wu Cheng gets respect and a uniform.|$|E
2500|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, Game 3 of the 1989 World Series (initially {{scheduled for}} October 17) was delayed by ten days {{due to the}} Loma Prieta earthquake. The earthquake struck at approximately 5:04p.m. Pacific Time. At the moment the quake struck, ABC's color commentator Tim McCarver was narrating taped highlights of the previous Series game. Viewers saw the video signal begin to break up, heard McCarver repeat a sentence as the shaking distracted him, and heard McCarver's colleague Al Michaels exclaim, [...] "I'll tell you what, we're having an earth—." [...] At that moment, the feed from Candlestick Park was lost. The network put up a green ABC Sports graphic as the audio was switched to a telephone link. Michaels had to pickup a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> back on the air.
