5|$|Apart from Rayalavari Karunakruthyamu, Krishnasastri's script {{also took}} {{inspiration}} from Devan Sharar's short story, The Emperor and the Slave Girl, {{which was published}} in the now defunct magazine, The Illustrated Weekly of India. It was Narasimha Reddy's practice to credit the authors of works from which he borrowed the basic premise for a film, but in this film, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Krishnasastry revealed the fact in an interview with Vijayachitra magazine after Narasimha Reddy's death in 1977. However, in the film's opening credits, Buchibabu was listed as the film's writer along with Krishnasastri. Adi M. Irani and B.N. Konda Reddy were the film's cinematographers; S. Rajeswara Rao and Addepalli Ramarao composed the film's music; H.R. Narayana and Vasu edited the film. A.K. Shekhar was the film's production designer and Thota Tharani father Thota Venkateswara Rao assisted him.|$|E
5|$|By May 29, {{four days}} before the opening of the convention, trainloads upon trainloads of delegates, lobbyists, reporters, and {{campaign}} followers had arrived at the Union and Dearborn railway stations in Chicago. Candidate supporters channeled through the Chicago streets with daily parades and rallies. Pre-convention possible outcomes of the voting were published by a number of sources. One, from the Albany Evening Journal, predicted Blaine with 277 votes, Grant with 317, Sherman with 106, and 49 for the other candidates. All of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of the 379 needed to win. Many in Chicago knew that a victor, most probably Grant, would only be determined if the unit rule, which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for the candidate preferred by that state's delegation, was to be in effect. If <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to the other.|$|E

25|$|Figueroa Cordero was {{released}} in 1978. One year later, in 1979, President Jimmy Carter pardoned the remaining Nationalists. Some analysts said this was in exchange for Fidel Castro's release of several American CIA agents being held in Cuba on espionage charges, but the US said <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> The Nationalists were received in Puerto Rico with a heroes' welcome from roughly 5,000 people at San Juan International Airport.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} was alarmed, as it interpreted the mutinies {{as a sign}} of deep malaise in French society. While <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the British Army had to continue offensive warfare on the western front, with only limited support from its allies {{in the second half of}} 1917. The British tried to reinvigorate French morale by launching the Third Battle of Ypres, or Passchendaele, with varied success but pertinently relieving pressure on the French to the south.|$|E
25|$|Just {{like last}} year, Islamabad again faced Karachi in the eliminator. In what {{proved to be}} a thrilling game, Karachi, batting first, scored a measly 126 getting all out in the process. Islamabad was set to win and qualify for the second play off. However, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> as the second innings proved. The Karachi bowlers outshone the Islamabad bowlers with Muhammad Amir, Imad Wasim and Usama Mir each picking up three wickets. Islamabad were all out for a mere 82 runs, their lowest in the tournament and the second-lowest in the tournament's history.Hence, the {{defending}} champions were knocked out.|$|E

25|$|In November, Parker and Snow persuaded RCA to buy Presley {{out from}} Sun for $40,000, and on November 21 Presley's {{contract}} was officially transferred from Sun Records to RCA Victor. Snow attended the signing, thinking that Elvis {{had signed a}} management contract with Jamboree Attractions, which he owned with Parker. However, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> since Elvis was still under contract to Bob Neal. The only document that was signed on November 21 pertained to the record label transfer. In return for a larger financial part of the deal, Neal agreed not to renew his management contract with Presley after it expired in March 1956, allowing Parker the opportunity to claim the job for himself.|$|E
25|$|Blackmun ruled for the {{government}} on both questions. Since Schmuck had enjoyed a continuing relationship with the dealers he sold to, and the cars could not be resold to a retail customer without titles obtained using false information, the dealers' applications were {{an essential element of}} his crime and thus constituted mail fraud. On the second question, Blackmun said the court should have considered whether the elements of odometer tampering were a subset of the elements of the mail fraud, and since <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> Schmuck had been properly denied the instruction. Scalia's dissent focused exclusively on the mail fraud issue. Since Schmuck had already received his payment for the altered vehicles, it did not matter what happened afterwards, a holding he found more consistent with the Court's earlier rulings on the subject.|$|E

25|$|On April 1, 2016 just as {{the show}} {{finished}} airing, a post on the BT Toronto's Facebook page was made in regards to Jennifer Valentyne not {{being a part of}} the show anymore. With it being April Fool's Day many people thinking this was a joke but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Kevin and Dina both addressed this over Twitter confirming that this was in fact true to fans asking. Later that evening, on Jennifer's Facebook page she released a statement confirming that it was in fact true. BT decided to eliminate all Live Eye's across the country to give fans more of what they wanted. Many offered love and support over various social media accounts including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to Jennifer {{and the rest of the}} BT crew.|$|E
25|$|The TWU, for its part, later {{claimed that}} it was forced to strike {{in order to prevent}} the MTA from raising the {{retirement}} age, rather than striking to reduce the retirement age. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> however, because it is state legislation that sets the terms of the pension plan, and under state law pension terms may not even be the subject of collective bargaining. Years after the strike the pension plan remains retirement at age 55 after 25 years worked. And as a result of past underfunding, due to optimistic rate of return assumptions, and other pension enhancements that benefitted the TWU, such a retroactive inflation adjustment for retirees and an end to employee contributions, the cost of the pension plan to New York City Transit soared from $468 million in FY 2005 to $770 million in FY 2010 with a projected $950 million in pension costs forecast for FY 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} her only son Lance Reventlow in an air crash in 1972 sent Hutton {{into a state of}} despair. By this time, her fortune had diminished, due to her extreme generosity, {{including}} donating Winfield House to the United States government as a residence for its UK ambassador. Alleged questionable deals by her longtime lawyer, Graham Mattison, also ate away at her fortune. Eventually she began liquidating assets in order to raise funds to live, yet continued to spend money on strangers willing to pay a little attention to her. She spent her final years in Los Angeles, living at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where she died from a heart attack in May 1979, aged 66. One biographer wrote that, at her death, $3,500 was all that remained of her fortune, but some who actually knew her said <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> She was interred in the Woolworth family mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York.|$|E

25|$|Although for the reactor's backup {{systems were}} available, the power loss proved that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for {{the spent fuel}} pools. No {{measures}} had been taken to prevent small animals entering this important equipment located {{at the back of}} a truck in open air. On 21 March, TEPCO apologized for the delay in reporting the power loss, and for not contacting the media, and promised to improve on this. The NRA decided, that it would speed up the installment of back-up power supply systems, and more durable and reliable systems. A meeting of experts was announced for 29 March 2013 to discuss the TEPCO report on the subject. Serious criticism came from the Japanese government; TEPCO was instructed to install multiple power supplies, and to do more to restore public confidence in the safety of the plant. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference, that TEPCO was ordered to improve its risk management, that TEPCO had not promptly informed the authorities, and that TEPCO's handling of the power failure had greatly damaged public trust in the company.|$|E
25|$|Three holes {{were made}} in the {{perimeter}} wall and oil warehouses were blazing in the southeastern sector. Eight minutes later, Lieutenant Wilhelm Henningsen's crack marines storm unit from the Schleswig-Holstein advanced in three platoons while the Wehrmacht's Pioneers blew up the railroad gate going on the land-bridge, expecting an easy victory over the surprised Poles. Staff Sergeant Wojciech Najsarek, a Polish soldier, was killed by machine-gun fire, the first combat death of both the battle and war. However, soon after crossing the artillery-breached brick wall, the attackers suddenly came into a well-prepared ambush. German soldiers found themselves caught in a kill zone of Polish crossfire from concealed firing points (the Germans believed they were also fired on by snipers hidden in the trees, but in reality <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case),</b> while barbed wire entanglements effectively blocked quick movements. The Poles knocked out a machine gun nest at the German Schupo and Lt. Leon Pająk opened intense howitzer fire on the advancing Germans, who faltered and stopped their attack. The single 76.2mm field gun knocked out machine-gun nests on top of the warehouses across the harbour canal, but was destroyed by the ship's guns after firing 28 shots.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{formation}} of Los Ingobernables ("The Unruly") Rush, La Sombra, La Máscara and Marco Corleone had claimed to be tecnicos diferentes, or {{a different kind of}} good guys, which meant that they did not get along with other tecnico wrestlers but generally fought against rudos. For the Sin Salida show <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> Rush, La Sombra and Marco Corleone faced the tecnico team of Atlantis, Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. and Los Ingobernables clearly played the rudo part of the match, cheating whenever they had a chance including pulling Diamante Azul's mask off at one point and tearing Atlantis' mask apart. With Volador Jr. and La Sombra being bitter rivals for years it was no surprise that the two did not fight a clean match but both Rush and Corleone used underhanded tactics to win the match including a low kick to Volador Jr. to win the third and deciding fall. After the match Volador Jr. challenged La Sombra to put his mask on the line against Volador Jr.'s hair, a challenge turned down by La Sombra as he had already unmasked Volador Jr. Moments later Diamante Azul upped the challenge, Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. against La Sombra and Rush and Azul would put his mask on the line as well. The challenge was not accepted, nor declined by Los Ingorbernables at the time.|$|E
