As of 2005, the federal government had spent more than $17 million studying the problem in its jurisdiction. In December 2007 the Corps groundwater contamination cleanup was put on hold. In August 2008, the city of Salina offered to clean-up former Schilling AFB, as suggested by the Corps. In 2010, after the plume had reached residential areas near the former base, Salina officials, the Salina Airport Authority, the Salina school district and Kansas State University - Salina (now Kansas State University Polytechnic Campus), who own 96% of the property filed a federal lawsuit in Kansas City, Kansas, for the clean up costs. In spring of 2013 the Department of Justice signed a settlement that the government would pay $8.4 million merely toward developing the plan to clean up the former base.

Trichloroethanol level is also linearly related to trichloroethylene concentration, while trichloroacetic acid level deviates from the linear relation when trichloroethylene level exceeds 50 ppm. In the case of tetrachloroethylene exposure, both trichloroethanol and trichloroacetic acid levels, and consequently the total trichloro compound level, reach a plateau at tetrachloroethylene level well below 100 ppm.

40|$|Leather {{industry}} is a relatively large source of waste from raw material, so skin waste recovery is a goal of clean technologies. Capitalization of skin waste aims to obtain: chemical auxiliaries, technical articles, hydrolyzed protein, artificial leather, composite building materials, heat sources and collagen biomaterials with applications in medicine, cosmetics, etc. A {{first step in the}} recovery of skin waste is the degreasing operation. Ultrasound is an effective tool to improve the efficiency of the conventional degreasing affecting the chemical substances as well as the treated skin. In addition, the processing time is reduced. Ultrasound is known to enhance the emulsification and dispersion of oils/fat. The usual degreasing methods requires more emulsifier/solvent ratio and process time for emulsification and additional solvent for washing out the emulsified fat.

Three different four-component two-phase systems (ethanol:water - chloroform:ethyl acetate, ethanol:water - chloroform:trichloroethylene and ethanol:water - trichloroethylene:ethyl acetate) were tested as an extracting solvent to get the final product having more than 98 % of Dgx. The initial amount of the chloroform or trichloroethylene extract in the light phase was varied between 5 and 25 g/L, while the volume ratio of light and heavy phases was {{in the range of}} 1 : 1 to 1 : 2. The best Dgx yield of 98 % was achieved with the system ethanol:water - chloroform:trichloroethylene 35 : 15 : 20 : 30 at the volume ratio of the phases of 1 : 1. 1 and at the initial amount of the extract of 15 g/L. Purity of the separated digoxin was 99. 8 %. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. TR- 34012...|$|E
40|$|A {{historical}} {{prospective study}} {{of cancer in}} lamp manufacturing workers in one plant was conducted. All {{men and women who}} worked for a total of at least 6 months and were employed at some time between 1960 and 1975 were included. Work histories were abstracted and subjects were divided according to whether they had worked in the coiling and wire drawing area (CWD). Cancer morbidity from 1964 to 1982 was ascertained via the provincial registry, and was compared with the site-specific incidence in Ontario, adjusting for age, sex and calendar period. Of particular interest were primary breast and gynecological cancers in women. The cancers of a priori concern were significantly increased in women in CWD, but not elsewhere in the plant. The excess was greatest in those with more than 5 yr exposure (in CWD) and more than 15 yr since first working in CWD, with eight cases of breast and gynecological cancers observed in this category compared with 2. 67 expected. Only three cancers occurred in men in CWD. Environmental measurements had not been made in the past and little information was available on substances used in the 1940 s and 1950 s, the period when the women with the highest excess began employment. It is known that methylene chloride and <b>trichlorethylene</b> have been used, but not enough is known about the dates and patterns of use to draw any conclusions about their relationship with the increase in disease...|$|E
