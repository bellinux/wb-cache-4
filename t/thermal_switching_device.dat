This flight was the first in-space demonstration of the CCPL, a lightweight heat transport and <b>thermal</b> <b>switching</b> <b>device</b> for future integrated cryogenic bus systems. The CCPL- 5 utilized nitrogen as the working fluid and operated between 80 K and 110 K. Flight results indicated excellent performance of the CCPL- 5 under zero-G environment. The CCPL could start from a supercritical condition in all tests, and the loop operating temperature could be tightly controlled regardless of changes in the heat load and/or the sink temperature. In addition, the loop demonstrated successful operation with a heat load of 0. 5 W as well as with parasitic heat loads alone...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{comparison}} between a matrix converter and a back-to-back converter feeding a passive load {{is presented in}} this paper, {{with the aim of}} determining the converter topology which yields the highest output power per switches number. The comparison has been performed for different values of the output frequency. For each output frequency the load power has been increased until one of the <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> reaches the maximum thermal stress, so defining the maxi-mum output power of the converter. For this purpose, a sim-plified thermal model has been used to evaluate the junction temperature of the switches {{on the basis of the}} switch losses. An accurate computer model of both converters has been implemented taking into account the modulation laws and the real characteristics of the <b>switching</b> <b>devices.</b> Simulation results are presented showing the different be-haviour of the two converters as a function of the output fre-quency. It has been verified that matrix converters perform better than back-to-back converters at low output frequencies.

If true in general, then it should be easy to model error probabilities.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a novel {{cascaded}} transformer multilevel inverter is proposed. The {{number of}} the <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> is reduced in the proposed topology. This topology comprises of a DC source, several single phase low-frequency transformers, two main power switches and some bidirectional <b>switching</b> <b>devices.</b> In this topology, only one bidirectional switch is employed for each transformer. However, in conventional cascaded transformer multilevel inverter, four <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> are required for each transformer. Therefore, more output voltage levels can be obtained using fewer switching components. Reduction {{in the number of}} <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> which also means {{reduction in the number of}} gate drivers results in smaller size and low implementation cost.

A <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> is a system to control the heat {{transfer}} "on/off" for the desired functionalities, and this serves as a basic building block to design advanced thermal management systems in various applications including electronic packaging, waste heat recovery, cryogenic cooling, and new applications such as thermal computers. The existing <b>thermal</b> <b>switches</b> employ the macroscale mechanical-based, relatively slow transient "on/off" switch mechanisms, which may be challenging to provide solutions for micro/nanoscale applications. In this study, a fast and efficient <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> mechanism without having extra mechanical controlling system is demonstrated using gas-filled, heterogeneous nanogaps with asymmetric surface interactions in Knudsen regime. Argon gas atoms confined in metal-based solid surfaces are employed to predict the degree of <b>thermal</b> <b>switch,</b> S. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation is used to create the temperature gradient over the two nanogaps, and the maximum degree of <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> is S-max similar to 13, which results from the difference in adsorption-controlled thermal accommodation coefficient (TAC) and pressure {{between the two sides}} of the gaps.
