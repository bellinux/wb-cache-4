5|$|For {{four years}} <b>the</b> <b>workmen,</b> {{some of whom}} brought their families, lived in 300 {{temporary}} wooden bothies either in a field alongside the offices and workshops, opposite the cemetery, or elsewhere {{along the line of}} the tunnel. Day– and night–shift workers lived up to 17 per hut taking turns to use the beds in unsanitary conditions.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{supervised}} by RKO department head Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, {{the scene in}} which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show <b>the</b> <b>workmen</b> showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera craning upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of <b>the</b> <b>workmen.</b> Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.|$|E
5|$|Immense {{quantities}} {{of dust and}} coal rose {{high into the air}} in an inverted cone...In the village of Heworth, this cloud caused a darkness like that of early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of passengers were deeply imprinted in it. As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of <b>the</b> <b>workmen</b> ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.|$|E

5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)). Nor would anonymous bone fragments have been of much interest to the hungry people sifting through {{the tens of thousands of}} tons of rubble and debris after the fire, looking for valuables, or to <b>the</b> <b>workmen</b> clearing away the rubble later during the rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{supposedly}} {{haunted by the}} Black Knight, who wears the armour and regalia of the Order of St. John, and resembles Grand Master de Vilhena. In the 1940s, the knight began to appear {{out of thin air}} near the ruins of the Chapel of St. Anthony of Padua, which had just been bombed in World War II. The apparition was reportedly seen by Maltese and English men within the fort. When the rubble from the ruined chapel began to be cleared, <b>the</b> <b>workmen</b> reported that the knight was supervising their work. When the crypt beneath the chapel was opened, it was found that it had been vandalized, and the remains of knights which had been buried there were scattered around. After the crypt was restored and the bones were reburied, the Black Knight stopped appearing. In 1980, the crypt was vandalized for a second time, and the Black Knight reportedly began to appear again.|$|E
5|$|The priory's lands around Guisborough were {{a source}} of wealth for the Chaloners. Around 1595, Sir Thomas Chaloner's son, also called Thomas, {{established}} England's first alum works at Belman Bank south of the town. Alum was an important product {{with a variety of}} industrial uses. It was especially important to the cloth industry as a mordant (a substance used to fix dyes on cloth). The supply of alum was controlled by a cartel controlled by the Papal States and Spain which were in conflict with England and exercised a virtual monopoly on the provision of alum to Christian Europe, as the import of cheaper Turkish alum was banned by Pope Paul II in the mid-15th century. Chaloner visited the Pope's alum works at Tolfa near Rome and noticed the soil and vegetation around them resembled those of his estate at Guisborough. On his return he established alum works at Belman Bank with the aid of workmen smuggled from Rome, earning him a papal excommunication. John Walker Ord casts doubt on the story, noting an account published a few decades afterwards stated that <b>the</b> <b>workmen</b> came from France and does not mention Chaloner's travels in Italy.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of canals in Britain was superseded by contracts to construct railway projects from 1830 onward, which developed into the railway manias, {{and the same}} term was applied to <b>the</b> <b>workmen</b> employed on building rail tracks, their tunnels, cuttings and embankments.

25|$|Originally {{these houses}} belonged to <b>the</b> <b>workmen</b> {{of the cathedral}} complex: the tailor, the gardener, the bell ringers, etc., until the 19th century when the {{administration}} offices of the Opera della Primaziale were moved in.

25|$|As the {{popularity}} of the new extension to Allhallows, opened in 1932, began to grow, the further decline of Port Victoria became ever more pronounced. During the 1930s, it saw only two trains per day, mainly for <b>the</b> <b>workmen</b> at the refineries on the Isle of Grain - the Medway Oil and Storage Company had been based at Elphinstone Point at the entrance to Colemouth Creek since 1923. Nevertheless, the Flushing Night Mail continued to dock at the port.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1920s, {{a private}} {{search for the}} {{treasure}} of Lafitte extended to the draining of Indian Bayou. As {{an arm of the}} Natalbany River in Springfield, Louisiana, the entire bayou was dyked and drained. The work was financed exclusively to search for the treasure of Lafitte. An Indian dugout canoe found at the time is displayed at the Cabildo in New Orleans. Under unknown circumstances, the crew and all <b>the</b> <b>workmen</b> broke camp and left one night after several weeks of work.|$|E

25|$|A priest named Fr. Sanctulus was {{rebuilding}} {{a church}} of St Lawrence, {{which had been}} attacked and burnt, and hired many workmen to accomplish the job. At one point during the construction, he found himself with nothing to feed them. He prayed to St Lawrence for help, and looking in his basket he found a fresh, white loaf of bread. It seemed to him too small to feed <b>the</b> <b>workmen,</b> but in faith he began to serve it to the men. While he broke the bread, it so multiplied that that his workmen fed from it for ten days.|$|E
25|$|The metayer {{system was}} common, {{especially}} on temple lands. The landlord found land, labour, oxen for ploughing and working the watering machines, carting, threshing or other implements, grain seed, rations for <b>the</b> <b>workmen</b> and fodder for the cattle. The tenant, or steward, usually had other land of his own. If he stole the seed, rations or fodder, the Code stipulated that his fingers be cut off. If he appropriated or sold the implements, or impoverished or sublet the cattle, he was heavily fined and in default of payment, might be condemned {{to be torn}} to pieces by the cattle on the field. Rent was determined by contract.|$|E
25|$|To {{organize}} {{and feed the}} manpower needed to create these pyramids required a centralized government with extensive powers, and Egyptologists believe the Old Kingdom at this time demonstrated this level of sophistication. Recent excavations near the pyramids led by Mark Lehner have uncovered a large city {{that seems to have}} housed, fed and supplied the pyramid workers. Although it was once believed that slaves built these monuments, a theory based on The Exodus narrative of the Hebrew Bible, study of the tombs of <b>the</b> <b>workmen,</b> who oversaw construction on the pyramids, has shown they were built by a corvée of peasants drawn from across Egypt. They apparently worked while the annual flood covered their fields, as well as a very large crew of specialists, including stonecutters, painters, mathematicians and priests.|$|E
