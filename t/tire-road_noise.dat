Exterior <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> is bounded by SPL limits mentioned on a vehicle pass-by as described in UN-ECE R 117 and EC R 661 / 2009.

A full FEM/BEM exterior <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> model combined with measured structure and air-borne transfer paths appears to be most promising. By playing this simulated noise over head phone for a relative small jury one obtains an engineering tool where the tire-road parameters, for a specific car, can be optimised for to a comfortable interior sound field...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that road traffic noise has {{negative}} influences on human health. Hence, as <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> {{is considered to}} be the most dominant cause of road traffic noise above 30 - 50 km/h, a lot of research is performed by the two involving industries: road authorities/manufacturers and tire manufacturers. Usually, the parameters influencing exterior <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> are often examined separately, whereas it is the tire-road interaction which obviously causes the actual noise. An integral approach, i. e. assessing possible measures to reduce <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> from both the road and the tire point of view, is needed to further reduce traffic noise. In a project Silent Safe Traffic, this tire-road interaction is studied in more detail without focusing on either tire or road but looking at the tire-road system. In this publication we present experimental results of tire and road design parameters influencing <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> from a fixed reference tire-road configuration. The influence of tire tread pattern, compound and construction as well as the influence of road roughness, acoustic absorption and driving speed on the exterior <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise,</b> measured by a CPX-set up, is reported.

30|$|There are {{two main}} sources of traffic noise [64]: vehicle engines and the {{interaction}} between tires and road. The <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> increases substantially with speed, and it dominates the total noise at higher speeds (i.e., above 20 – 40  km/h for new cars and above 30 – 60  km/h for new trucks). Consequently, the speed limits (which usually result in lower speeds) are {{likely to lead to}} lower levels of vehicle noise.|$|E
40|$|Noise {{classification}} of road surfaces has been addressed in many European countries. This paper presents the first approach towards noise {{classification of}} Portuguese road pavements. In this early stage, it aims at establishing guidelines for decision makers {{to support their}} noise reduction policies {{and the development of}} a classification system adapted to the European recommendations. A ranking to provide guidance on <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> emission levels for immediate use by decision makers, road authorities, contracting parties and environmental officers will be established. This research was based on the results provided by three early studies covering more than ten different surfaces, among which, rubberized asphalt and experimental non conventional surfaces with optimized grading. On each road trial, the <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> generated by light vehicles and heavy trucks at three speed levels were measured by means of the Controlled Pass-By method (CPB). Three of these runs were also tested by the Close ProXimity method (CPX). Additionally, tests to characterize texture and skid resistance were performed. The early noise classification studies of road pavements focused only on the CPB tests. Three groups with similar acoustical performance were identified. Noise level abatements of about 10 dB were achieved for the gap graded mixtures with a maximum aggregate size inferior to 10 mm...|$|E
40|$|In the Directive 2001 / 43 {{limits are}} put on the maximum noise level of a pass-by noise {{measurement}} on an ISO 10844 surface. This prescribed measurement set-up only gives an LAmax level of the total passage of a whole vehicle equipped with four tires and does not provide enough information for a problem analysis or model validation. Measuring on one tire with (closed or open) CPX-trailers or -cars gives a better insight into <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise.</b> The di culties with these measurement set-ups can be the noise generation of the set-up itself, the acoustics of the trailer-interior or vibrations directly disturbing the microphone signals.

40|$|Quality {{investigations}} {{and design of}} interior car sounds constitute an important challenge for the car industry. Such sounds are complex and time-varying, inducing considerable timbre variations depending on the driving conditions. An interior car sound is indeed a mixture between several sound sources, with two main contributions, i. e. the engine noise {{on the one hand}} and the aerodynamic and <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> on the other. Masking phenomena occur between these two components and should be considered when studying perceptive attributes of interior car sounds in order to identify relevant signal parameters. By combining sensory analysis and signal analysis associated with an auditory model, a relation between a reduced number of signal parameters and perceptive attributes can be found.

Summary: Part of INRETS task in the SILVIA project is to study {{the influence of the}} pavement characteristics on the generation and the propagation of road traffic noise using existing models. This work addresses the reduction of <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> by absorption effects. It aims at finding a numerical correspondence between the two quantities generally available from measurements: pass-by noise noise levels at 7. 5 m distance and acoustic absorption at normal incidence. Estimations are made using an omnidirectional point source for modeling the tyre, and the image method for modeling the reflection of the porous pavement. The approach is validated by comparing calculations to published experimental results. A numerical correspondence is found between the absorption coefficient in normal incidence and the pass by level difference obtained between a source over the absorbing surface and the source over a reflecting surface. The absorption and attenuation curves in function of frequency have similar shapes but are slightly shifted in frequenc...|$|E
40|$|Traffic {{noise is}} still {{considered}} by neighboring population of the road network {{as one of the}} most important factor of annoyance. In order to propose to local authorities new solutions to improve the environment of their citizens, it became necessary during the last decades, to study in detail all the components of the acoustic phenomenon between the source and the receiver. Even if the propagating mechanisms have been widely investigated in the past through researches mainly dealing with noise barriers, ground and atmospheric effects and more recently with diffusion aspects in dense urban areas, road traffic noise emission has also been largely studied both for suburban and urban situations. Those researches induced important works on <b>tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> connected to pavement textures when the engine contribution is negligible and, on the identification of global emitted noise for urban situations where the vehicle speed is low and the driving conditions predominant. A better knowledge of the emission and propagation mechanisms allowed considering and promoting several innovative solutons to mitigate and control the traffic noise impact on populations. Some of these solutions relative to low-noise road pavements, new road equipments and new speed reducing devices will be detailed in the paper...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tire-road</b> <b>noise</b> is {{a serious}} problem, but can be {{significantly}} reduced {{by the use of}} porous asphalt concrete. Here, the sound absorption of the porous asphalt concrete is important and can be predicted by ground impedance models. Yet, modeling porous asphalt concrete is complex, especially when nonlocal effects and scattering effects are considered. The objective of this research is to predict the sound absorption coefficient for a three-dimensional porous structure. The proposed solution is obtained using a novel modeling approach, in which the total solution of the sound field is found by combining the solutions of two subsystems: a background sound field and a scattered sound field. The background sound field contains the (analytical) solution of the sound field including the viscothermal energy dissipation inside the pores of the porous asphalt concrete. In the second subsystem, the (numerical) solution for the scattering on the rigid stone skeleton of the pavement is found. For both subsystems, we use a model containing two layers: an air layer and a viscous air layer with a certain granular structure. The main advantage of this modeling approach is the (relatively) low computation time. In this paper, the proposed modeling approach and the validation of this approach are described. The modeling approach is validated for normal incident plane waves absorbed and scattered by various structures of stacked marbles, using the impedance tube technique. This approach can be applied to predict the absorption coefficient of porous structures, like asphalt concrete roads. Moreover, it can be used as design tool to optimize the sound absorption of new road surfaces...|$|E
