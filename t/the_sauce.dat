5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. The product {{came at a time}} of fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from <b>the</b> <b>sauce.</b>|$|E

25|$|La Varenne is {{credited}} with bringing sauces out of the Middle ages with his publication and may well have invented hollandaise sauce. The French developed Isigny sauce, very similar to hollandaise, and named after the Norman town of Isigny-sur-Mer which produces the finest French butter. Isigny sauce is found in recipe books from the 19th century. However, the story that <b>the</b> <b>sauce</b> began to be called Hollandaise after WWI, when butter shortages forced imports from Holland, is clearly inaccurate. While the Norman butter helped <b>the</b> <b>sauce</b> reach a higher status, it actually dates back to when the Dutch sold butter and cheese to Europe from cattle grazed on reclaimed sea land.|$|E
