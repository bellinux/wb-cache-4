25|$|The {{promotion}} and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise {{awareness about the}} benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavior change of the population. For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary. One example for handwashing promotion in schools is the “Three Star Approach” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements. When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars. Building hand washing stations can be a part of handwashing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.|$|E
25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. Students are expected to do their own learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> will be prepared for life after school.|$|E
