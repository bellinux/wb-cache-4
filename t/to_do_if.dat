5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can Say No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E
5|$|This led {{to further}} {{complications}} in the writing process. For a few days, {{it was thought that}} Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk {{would not be able to}} go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though that would have been the typical thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> someone else were there. Rather, they simply peer through the sliding glass door that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E
5|$|Five SAO Krajina police {{officers}} were prosecuted by Knin District Court in 1992 {{for the murder of}} the Rakić family. The investigation was spurred on by requests from relatives of the victims, who threatened the RSK authorities that they would notify the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) unless the RSK authorities continued searching, which led Đuro Kresović, president of Knin District Court to write to the Minister of the Interior of the RSK asking for instructions on how to proceed, stating that any attempt to retrieve the bodies of the Rakić family would uncover numerous other bodies in the Golubnjača Pit. He requested instructions on how to proceed with the investigation and what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> the UNPROFOR found out about the bodies in the pit. Even though the RSK investigation was completed, trial of those suspected of involvement in the murders did not begin before 2010 in Belgrade. The trial and the appeals process were concluded in 2013, resulting in four convictions: Čedo Budisavljević was sentenced to thirteen years in prison, while Mirko Malinović, Milan Bogunović and Bogdan Gruičić were sentenced to twelve, ten, and eight years in prison respectively.|$|E

5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> a child discloses abuse. Showings of Kids Can Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E
5|$|Gerard became Archbishop of York in December 1100. No source {{mentions}} {{him being}} invested by the king, but as Anselm urged Pope Paschal II to give Gerard his pallium, {{which he would}} have been unlikely <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> Gerard had been invested by Henry, that possibility seems remote. At Whitsun in 1101 King Henry I, with Anselm's support, deprived Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham, of the lands of the see of Durham, because Ranulf had defected to Henry's elder brother Robert Curthose, who also claimed the English throne. Gerard then deposed Ranulf from his bishopric. Soon after his translation to York, Gerard began a long dispute with Anselm, claiming equal primacy with the Archbishop of Canterbury and refusing to make a profession of canonical obedience to Anselm, part of the long Canterbury–York dispute. At the 1102 Council of Westminster, Gerard reportedly kicked over the smaller chair provided for him as Archbishop of York, and refused to be seated until he was provided with one as large as Anselm's. He travelled to Rome in 1102 to receive his pallium from the pope, to whom he presented the king's side against Anselm in the controversy surrounding investitures. The pope decided against the king, but Gerard and two other bishops reported that the pope had assured them that the various papal decrees against the lay investiture of bishops would not be enforced. Their claim was denied by Anselm's representatives and the pope, who excommunicated Gerard until he recanted.|$|E

It was not until the Twenty-fifth Amendment was ratified in 1967 that there was an official procedure for what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> the president became incapacitated.|$|E

25|$|Nininger's {{strategy}} was to search for meteorites in the Great Plains of the United States, where the land was largely cultivated and the soil contained few rocks.

The result was the discovery of over 200 new meteorites, mostly stony types.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, the Australian Army’s Colonel Alfred Conlon, who had {{previously}} chaired Prime Minister John Curtin's committee on national morale, {{was assigned to the}} staff of the Army’s commander-in-chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey. Alf Conlon believed the Army needed a research section to tackle major strategic contingencies, such as what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> Japan invaded Australia, and persuaded Blamey to establish a Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs. Blamey assigned Conlon to head the Directorate, which also provided policy advice on the governance of the Trust Territory of Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, then under Australian administration and the scene of fierce fighting between Allied and Japanese forces.|$|E

25|$|Aside from {{dealing with}} sexual {{harassment}} as it occurs, using the designated procedures, prevention {{is often used}} to eliminate sexual harassment before it begins, particularly in schools.The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has stated that training is part of the prevention of sexual harassment in schools and in their 2001 publishing of Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students or Third Parties, they have indicated that not only should academic institutions provide faculty and teacher training, but also provide students with classroom resources in order to make them aware of what constitutes sexual harassment and what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> it occurs. It is often recommended that consistent anti-sexual harassment workshops begin in the younger grades so that students remain informed and the policies are strongly enforced.|$|E
25|$|The {{moratorium}} on commercial whaling led Iceland to withdraw in protest from IWC, {{as it had}} threatened <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> the moratorium was extended. Both Japan and Norway also threatened to leave the organisation. In April 1992, the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) was established by the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, and Norway under the Agreement on Cooperation in Research, Conservation and Management of Marine Mammals in the North Atlantic. The document clearly responded to what the drafters regarded as inappropriate whale protectionist tendencies of the IWC. Guðmundur Eiríksson of Iceland stated at NAMMCO's inaugural meeting that the organisation was established in part out of dissatisfaction with the IWC's zero-catch quota. Although NAMMCO does not conflict directly with the obligations of membership states under the IWC, it nonetheless presented {{a challenge to the}} legitimacy of the IWC.|$|E
25|$|A new {{signal was}} {{introduced}} instructing squadron commanders to act independently as they thought best while still supporting the main fleet, particularly for use when circumstances {{would make it}} difficult to send detailed orders. The description stressed that this was not intended to be the only time commanders might take independent action, but was intended to make plain times when they definitely should. Similarly, instructions on what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> the fleet was instructed to take evasive action against torpedoes were amended. Commanders were given discretion that if their part of the fleet was not under immediate attack, they should continue engaging the enemy rather than turning away {{with the rest of the}} fleet. In this battle, when the fleet turned away from Scheer's destroyer attack covering his retreat, not all the British ships had been affected, and could have continued to engage the enemy.|$|E
