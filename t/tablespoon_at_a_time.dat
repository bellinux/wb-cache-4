40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{primary goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{generate}} cyclic redundancy check (CRC) using multiple lookup table algorithms. A compact architecture of CRC algorithm (Slicing-by-N algorithm) based on multiple lookup tables (LUT) approach is proposed. This algorithm can ideally read large amounts of data <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> while optimizing their memory requirement to meet the constraints of specific computer architectures. The focus of this paper is the comparison of two algorithms. These two algorithms are Slicing by-N-algorithm and Sarwate algorithm, in which slicing by-N-algorithm can read arbitrarily 512 bits <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> but Sarwate algorithm, which can read only 8 bits <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> This paper proposes the generation of CRC using slicing by 8 algorithm. In this, message bits are chunked to 8 blocks. All are processed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Proposed Slicing-by- 8 algorithm can read 64 bits of input data <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> and it doubles the performance of existing implementations of Sarwate algorithm...|$|R
