This can be realised by embedding intelligence at the product and operational level to provide predictive, risk preventative and high performing manufacturing systems. The work outlined in this paper details how a Returnable Transit Item (RTI) can {{become an integral part}} of the Industrie 4. 0 vision as an intelligent container that can interact with components, machines and other manufacturing services...|$|E
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at IOS Press through [URL] advancement of paradigms such as Industry 4. 0 and cyber physical systems herald increased productivity and efficiency for manufacturing businesses through increased capture and communication of data, information and knowledge. However, interpreting the raw data captured by sensing devices into useful information for decision making can be challenging as it often contains errors and uncertainty. This paper specifically investigates the challenges of analysing and interpreting data recorded using Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) portals to monitor the movements of Returnable <b>Transit</b> <b>Items</b> (RTI), such as racks and stillage, within an automotive manufacturing environment. Data was collected over a yearlong pilot study using an RFID portal system installed across two automotive facilities to trace the movement of RTIs between the sites. Based upon the results key sources of errors and uncertainty have been identified and a data management framework is proposed to alleviate these errors...|$|E
40|$|Measuring and {{monitoring}} {{the performance and}} productivity of passenger transportation has become a popular activity within public and private transit organizations. This paper evaluates some of the indicators of performance that are widely used. The paper emphasizes the need for data suitable for monitoring {{the performance of a}} single operator (ie. what does the operator want to know to make operational decisions?) as as data required for industry-based investigations. The contributions based on the economic interpretation of performance (ie. measures of partial and total factor productivity) have tended to be industry-wide. However, the need for translation down to individual operations is essential if the industry is to accept the new, more relevant, yet more complex measures of performance. Simple mapping procedures are available to implement the economist's approach at the firm level. To highlight some of the practical problems associated with selection of measures of performance we draw on data collected in Australia in the context of private <b>transit.</b> <b>Items</b> of particular interest include the measurement of the cost of capital, the composition of labor, and heterogeneity f output. We highlight the potential for misleading inference from univariate measures of performance...|$|E
50|$|For example, a check {{drawn on}} Bank of America, {{presented}} for deposit at Wells Fargo Bank, {{would be considered}} a <b>transit</b> <b>item</b> by Wells Fargo, while the same item presented for cash or deposit at Bank of America would be an on-us check. Routing numbers, as well as the bank name printed on the check, help to determine an item's classification.|$|R
50|$|The American Bankers' Association wrote a list {{of banks}} in the United States. In this list, {{starting}} at prefix 50, cities and towns are in the bank's listing {{rather than the other}} way around. Bank numbers are more for designating checks than for being an address. In 1911, banks returned groups of checks to other banks for collection. In 2011, the ABA's Key listed in numerical order the nine-digit routing numbers instead of the five-digit ABA <b>transit</b> <b>item</b> numbers. It put a space after every four digits, the digit grouping the fractional form is based on, and told the bank's name, town and state, after its nine-digit number.|$|R
50|$|Over{{shipment}} {{and short}} shipment can both {{be caused by}} an error at the source, where the incorrect quantity is shipped or the incorrect quantity is listed. As the terms indicate, these can fundamentally be caused by errors in {{the source of the}} shipment. Short shipment can be reported by the recipient if some of the goods disappear in transit, such as by theft or loss. Overshipment is unlikely to occur due to changes in <b>transit,</b> unless spurious <b>items</b> somehow enter the cargo or the shipping list is damaged or altered in transit.|$|R
50|$|Nepean's {{policies}} of operational and capital budgeting prudence {{contrasted with the}} budget philosophies of some other municipalities in the area. Nepean instituted a strict 'pay-as-you-go' budgeting scheme. The city entered amalgamation with a large surplus and a record of tax restraint. However, most big-ticket municipal infrastructure <b>items</b> (<b>transit,</b> garbage collection, sanitary sewers, water, arterial roads, social services) were {{the responsibility of the}} Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. The former City of Nepean maintained its own library system from 1954 to amalgamation, its own police force from 1964 until it was regionalized in the 1990s; its own fire service and its own recreation programs. Hydro services were the responsibility of the Hydro-Electric Commission of the City of Nepean (commonly referred to as Nepean Hydro). Education in the City of Nepean was provided by the Carleton Board of Education (later amalgamated with the Ottawa Board of Education to form the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a Two-echelon logistics model for recoverable items with lateral supply {{in a single}} period in the Army. It derives formulas for distribution and inventory costs, and determines the optimal stock level at a depot and at a base to minimize the backorders. During the period, a Poisson demand and distinct units of operating bases which stocks can be shared are assumed. It allows the lateral supply between operating bases. A two-phase method is used to get solutions to the stock level constrained optimization problem. The outcome of this paper {{can be applied to}} lower level of logistics units (e. g. Division, Regiment) rather than higher level of logistics units of the Army (e. g. Corps, Theater) which distribute recoverable items periodically and repair the defective <b>items</b> <b>transited</b> from subordinate units.

40|$|WORKSHOP Dual use export {{controls}} Although EU Regulation 428 / 2009 {{setting up a}} Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and <b>transit</b> of dual-use <b>items</b> system {{is in line with}} the main export control regimes and is seen as a model for others to follow, {{there are a number of}} ways in which the regulation could be enhanced and refined. Part One outlines the current state of play, purpose and implementation of the current regulation. In Part Two, against the backdrop of the European Commission's reform proposal, the effectiveness of the EU's dual-use {{export controls}} regime is explored further with regard to its potential contribution to international, national and human security, as well as their impact on EU economic and trade interests. The study concludes that the system’s effectiveness could be improved in a number of ways, but that this requires an effort to mobilise political will at different levels and across different institutions within the EU and its Member States, and to enhance human resources, cooperation and capacity-building. The European Parliament should also give consideration on a regular basis to issues relating to the scope and implementation of the regulation, in order to ensure that the objectives continue to be achieved...|$|R
40|$|This article {{would like}} to give some {{insights}} about nuclear dual-use items, i. e. goods {{that can be used for}} both civil and military purposes. The contemporary world faces great challenges how to curb nuclear proliferation and provide for legitimate use of items for declared purposes. Effective export control of dual-use items addresses a number of stakeholders – from a single exporter, research institutes, larger companies, national agencies to international fora and non-governmental organisations. The first part of the article intends to encompass several international, legally binding instruments, fora and different groups that deal with the export control of nuclear and other dual-use items. These mechanisms are used by those states which follow their international obligations in the area of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). It includes control of exports, as well as transfers, brokering and <b>transit</b> of dual-use <b>items.</b> The second part will touch upon Slovenian experience in this sphere, in particular its participation in the work of international bodies and organisations, domestic legislation, national inter-agency co-operation and obligations within the European Union (EU). The third part shows a few practical examples of nuclear dual-use items as well as some thoughts about challenges with regard to effective export control. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{ultimate}} goal of inventory management is to decide the timing and the quantity of ordering in response to uncertain demands. Recently, some researchers have focused upon an impact of distortions in the information, e. g., customer order cancellation, on an economical inventory policy. The customer order cancel-lation is considered a kind of distortions in demands, because a demand that is eventually cancelled is equivalent to a phony demand. Also, there are some additional distortions in the inventory information. For instance, the procurement of suppliers may include some nonconforming items {{as a result of}} imperfect production and inspection by the suppliers, and/or damage in <b>transit.</b> The nonconforming <b>item</b> should be considered a kind of distortions in the inventory information, because the nonconforming item is equivalent to a phony stock. In this article, we consider an inventory model under the situation that customers can cancel their orders and the procurement of suppliers may include some nonconforming items. Then, we introduce the customer order re-servation into the inventory model for the purpose of avoiding the costly backlogs, because the customer order reservation gives retailers a period to fulfill customer’s requests. We formulate a periodic review (s, S) inventory model and investigate the economical operation under the situation mentioned above. Further, through the sensitivity analysis, we show the impact of these distortions and the effect of the customer order reservation on the inventory policy...|$|R
