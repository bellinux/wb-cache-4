5|$|When Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. (PMH) {{bought the}} paper in 2006, Brian P. Tierney and the {{business}} people behind PMH signed a pledge promising {{that they would not}} influence the content of the paper. Tierney, a Republican activist who had represented many local groups in the Philadelphia area, had criticized The Inquirer in the past on behalf of his clients. One of Tierney's clients had been the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which he had represented during the Cipriano affair. PMH membership also included Bruce E. Toll, vice chairman of Toll Brothers Inc. Tierney said that the group was aware that <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> to ruin its investment in The Inquirer was to threaten the paper's editorial independence. The 2012 sale of Philadelphia Media Network to six local business leaders also led to concern of conflict of interest. The new owners, which included New Jersey Democratic fundraiser George Norcross III, media entrepreneur H. F. Lenfest, former New Jersey Nets owner Lewis Katz, and CEO of Liberty Property Trust and chairman of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce William Hankowsky, pledged not to influence the content of the paper.|$|E

Certain types of medications can only be given intravenously, such as when there is insufficient uptake by other routes of administration such as enterally. Examples include intravenous immunoglobulin and propofol.|$|E

An intercity toll highway called Cipularang toll road, connecting Jakarta, Karawang, Purwakarta, Padalarang and Bandung, was completed in May 2005 and is <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> to reach Bandung from the capital by road. Driving time is about 1.5 hours on average. There are three other options: the Puncak route (Jakarta-Cianjur/Sukabumi-Bandung), Purwakarta route (Jakarta-Cikampek-Purwakarta-Cikalong Wetan-Padalarang-Cimahi-Bandung) and the Subang route (Jakarta-Cikampek-Subang-Lembang-Bandung).

25|$|Prioritizing a fast {{production}} of weapon-grade material regardless of secrecy: <b>The</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> to produce weapon usable material {{was seen in}} modifying a prior civil fusion power station. Unlike in some nuclear power stations, there is no weapon compatible material during civil use. Even {{without the need for}} covert action this modification would still take about 2 months to start the production and at least an additional week to generate a significant amount for weapon production. This was seen as enough time to detect a military use and to react with diplomatic or military means. To stop the production, a military destruction of inevitable parts of the facility leaving out the reactor itself would be sufficient. This, together with the intrinsic safety of fusion power would only bear a low risk of radioactive contamination.|$|E
25|$|Snell's law can {{be derived}} from Fermat's principle, which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time. By taking the {{derivative}} of the optical path length, the stationary point is found giving the path taken by the light (though {{it should be noted that}} the result does not show light taking the least time path, but rather one that is stationary with respect to small variations as there are cases where light actually takes the greatest time path, as in a spherical mirror). In a classic analogy, the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach, the area of higher refractive index by the sea, and <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> for a rescuer on the beach to get to a drowning person in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell's law.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{a similar}} long list of demands (which the company had {{traditionally}} countered with in the past), Chandler gave the union only seven demands and advised it that these proposals must be dealt with, strike or no strike. The proposals were aimed at largely ending job transfers and seniority, adding five shifts a week, and instituting a mandatory overtime scheme; the company claimed it had lost $1.3 billion over the previous three years over these issues. Many companies in turnaround seek to improve product design and production processes, and managerial expertise before seeking labor concessions. But McCardell concluded that <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> to achieve cost savings was to persuade workers to accept work rules changes which would have cost employees $100 million. Surprisingly, however, IH agreed to match the pay increase pattern set {{earlier in the year}} by automobile manufacturers in Detroit.|$|E

25|$|Fermat's {{principle}} {{is the main}} principle of quantum electrodynamics which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths {{at the point of}} observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer. The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.|$|E
500|$|In 1882, Thomas L.

The only other alternative to building a bridge would have been to lay an additional [...] of track over rough terrain. When built, the bridge was larger than any that had been attempted, and over twice as large as the largest similar structure at the time: the Portage Bridge over the Genesee River in western New York.|$|E
