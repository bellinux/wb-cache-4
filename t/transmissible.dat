5|$|Some {{agents are}} more {{specific}} {{to a certain}} species. <b>Transmissible</b> gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. It {{is believed to be}} introduced to pigs by wild birds and there is no specific treatment available. It is not <b>transmissible</b> to humans.|$|E
5|$|Prions are {{infectious}} agents composed {{entirely of}} a protein material that can fold in multiple, structurally abstract ways, {{at least one}} of which is <b>transmissible</b> to other prion proteins, leading to disease {{in a manner that is}} epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection. Prions composed of the prion protein (PrP) are believed to be the cause of <b>transmissible</b> spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) among other diseases.|$|E
5|$|A crucial safety {{aspect of}} {{international}} airports is medical facilities and practices. In particular, controlling <b>transmissible</b> disease, such as SARS, is deemed important at international airports. While these standards are regulated by ICAO Standards And Recommended Practices (SARPs) and WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR), local authorities have considerable say {{in how they}} are implemented.|$|E
5|$|All known prion diseases, collectively called <b>transmissible</b> spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal. However, {{a vaccine}} {{developed}} in mice may {{provide insight into}} providing a vaccine to resist prion infections in humans. Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant to infection by scrapie prion protein. In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.|$|E
5|$|Bioinformatic screens have {{predicted}} that over 250 human proteins contain prion-like domains (PrLD). These domains are hypothesized {{to have the same}} <b>transmissible,</b> amyloidogenic properties of PrP and known fungal proteins. As in yeast, proteins involved in gene expression and RNA binding seem to be particularly enriched in PrLD's, compared to other classes of protein. In particular, 29 of the known 210 proteins with an RNA recognition motif also have a putative prion domain. Meanwhile, several of these RNA-binding proteins have been independently identified as pathogenic in cases of ALS, FTLD-U, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are <b>transmissible</b> to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily <b>transmissible</b> to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} of malaria parasites {{was found in}} mosquitoes preserved in amber from the Palaeogene period that are approximately 30 million years old. Human malaria likely originated in Africa and coevolved with its hosts, mosquitoes and non-human primates. Malaria protozoa are diversified into primate, rodent, bird, and reptile host lineages. Humans may have originally caught Plasmodium falciparum from gorillas. P. vivax, another malarial Plasmodium species among the six that infect humans, also likely originated in African gorillas and chimpanzees. Another malarial species recently discovered to be <b>transmissible</b> to humans, P. knowlesi, originated in Asian macaque monkeys. While P. malariae is highly host specific to humans, {{there is some evidence}} that low level non-symptomatic infection persists among wild chimpanzees.|$|E
5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly <b>transmissible</b> from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} not entirely clear, but {{is thought to be}} multifactorial. It has even been {{suggested}} that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes. Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism, but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and not sexually <b>transmissible.</b> The mucosal destruction is thought {{to be the result of}} a T cell (T lymphocyte) mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mast cells and macrophages are also involved, secreting TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied, the histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate, 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of heat shock protein 65–60, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.|$|E
25|$|Canine <b>transmissible</b> venereal tumors (CTVTs), {{also called}} <b>transmissible</b> venereal tumors (TVTs), canine <b>transmissible</b> venereal sarcoma (CTVS), sticker tumors and {{infectious}} sarcoma is a histiocytic tumor {{of the external}} genitalia of the dog and other canines, and is transmitted from animal to animal during mating. It {{is one of only}} four known <b>transmissible</b> cancers; another is devil facial tumor disease, a cancer which occurs in Tasmanian devils.|$|E
25|$|BSE is a <b>transmissible</b> {{disease that}} {{primarily}} affects {{the central nervous}} system; it {{is a form of}} <b>transmissible</b> spongiform encephalopathy, like Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and kuru in humans and scrapie in sheep, and chronic wasting disease in cervids.|$|E
25|$|This {{disease is}} {{considered}} to be a zoonosis (an infectious disease that is naturally <b>transmissible</b> from vertebrate animals to humans), with the exception of Leishmania tropica — which is often an anthroponotic disease (an infectious disease that is naturally <b>transmissible</b> from humans to vertebrate animals).|$|E
25|$|Other rare <b>transmissible</b> infections include {{hepatitis}} B, syphilis, Chagas disease, cytomegalovirus infections (in immunocompromised recipients), HTLV, and Babesia.|$|E
25|$|Some {{diseases}} <b>transmissible</b> by {{the sexual}} route include HIV/AIDS, chlamydia, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, syphilis, herpes, and trichomoniasis.|$|E
25|$|HTLV (both types 1 and 2) - Sexually <b>transmissible,</b> {{consumption}} of breast milk breastfeeding, and once mistaken as a HIV, risk of leukemia.|$|E
25|$|Canine <b>transmissible</b> venereal tumor is a tumor of the {{external}} genitalia (penis, vulva). It is spread by sexual contact and {{is more common in}} hot and humid climates.|$|E
25|$|Investigations into {{potential}} {{transmission of}} HIV, MRSA, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis E {{have not found}} any evidence that bed bugs can spread these diseases. However, arboviruses may be <b>transmissible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some subviral {{particles}} {{also cause}} disease: the <b>transmissible</b> spongiform encephalopathies, which include Kuru, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} ("mad cow disease"), are caused by prions, hepatitis D {{is due to a}} satellite virus.|$|E
25|$|Kellogg devoted {{large amounts}} of his {{educational}} and medical work to discouraging sexual activity {{on the basis of}} dangers both scientifically understood at the time—as in sexually <b>transmissible</b> diseases—and those taught by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.|$|E
25|$|Both as {{a doctor}} and an Adventist, Kellogg was an {{advocate}} of sexual abstinence. As a physician, Kellogg {{was well aware of}} the damaging impact of sexually <b>transmissible</b> diseases such as syphilis, which was incurable before the 1910s.|$|E
25|$|Canine <b>transmissible</b> venereal {{tumors are}} histiocytic tumors {{that may be}} {{transmitted}} among dogs through coitus, licking, biting and sniffing tumor affected areas. The concept that the tumor is naturally <b>transmissible</b> as an allograft came from three important observations. First, CTVTs can only be experimentally induced by transplanting living tumor cells, and not by killed cells or cell filtrates. Second, the tumor karyotype is aneuploid but has characteristic marker chromosomes in all tumors collected in different geographic regions. Third, a {{long interspersed nuclear element}} (LINE-1) insertion near c-myc has been found in all tumors examined so far and {{can be used as a}} diagnostic marker to confirm that a tumor is a CTVT.|$|E
25|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a {{dangerous}} bacteria strain because it is resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. Recent strains of the bacteria, EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16, are highly <b>transmissible</b> and durable. This is of extreme importance to those concerned with reducing the incidence of hospital-acquired MRSA infections.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{familial}} (fCJD); or it {{may appear}} without risk factors (sporadic form: sCJD). In the familial form, a mutation {{has occurred in the}} gene for PrP, PRNP, in that family. All types of CJD are <b>transmissible</b> irrespective of how they occur in the patient.|$|E
25|$|The {{containment}} of infestations is generally operated by {{public health services}} through area-wide integrated control plans, which aim to reduce the nuisance perceived by populations and the risks of viraemic transmission. Such plans consist of different activities that include entomological surveillance, larvicide treatments {{in public and private}} areas, information campaigns, and treatments against adult mosquitoes in the zones affected by suspected cases of <b>transmissible</b> viroses.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of hygiene was recognised {{only in the}} nineteenth century; until then it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding. A <b>transmissible</b> disease will spread easily in such conditions. One development {{as a result of}} the Black Death was the establishment of the idea of quarantine in Dubrovnik in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.|$|E
25|$|As {{the flies}} are vectors of many diseases, the {{importance}} of identifying the <b>transmissible</b> agents, the route of transmission, and prevention and treatments {{in the event of}} contact are becoming increasingly important. With the ability to lay hundreds of eggs in a lifetime and the presence of thousands of larvae at a time in such close proximity, the potential for transmission is high, especially at ideal temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Wu Youke (1582–1652) {{developed}} {{the concept that}} some diseases were caused by <b>transmissible</b> agents, which he called liqi (pestilential factors). His book Wenyi Lun (Treatise on Acute Epidemic Febrile Diseases) {{can be regarded as}} the main etiological work that brought forward the concept, ultimately attributed to Westerners, of germs as a cause of epidemic diseases (source: http://baike.baidu.com/view/143117.htm). His concepts are still considered in current scientific research in relation to Traditional Chinese Medicine studies (see: http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js6170e/4.html).|$|E
25|$|Although 90% of HPV {{infections are}} cleared {{by the body}} within two years of infection, it is {{possible}} for infected cells to undergo a latency (quiet) period, with the first occurrence or a recurrence of symptoms happening months or years later. Latent HPV, even with no outward symptoms, is still <b>transmissible</b> to a sexual partner. If an individual has unprotected sex with an infected partner, there is a 70% chance that he or she will also become infected.|$|E
25|$|STD may refer only to {{infections that}} are causing diseases, {{or it may}} be used more loosely as a synonym for STI. Most of the time, people do not know that they are {{infected}} with an STI until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease. Moreover, the term sexually <b>transmissible</b> disease is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission. For instance, meningitis is <b>transmissible</b> by means of sexual contact but is not labeled an STI because sexual contact is not the primary vector for the pathogens that cause meningitis. This discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means other than sexual contact. In general, an STI is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than sexual contact, but has a realistic means of transmission by sexual contact (more sophisticated means—blood transfusion, sharing of hypodermic needles—are not taken into account). Thus, one may presume that, if a person is infected with an STI, e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, HPV it was transmitted to him/her by means of sexual contact.|$|E
25|$|Feline {{coronavirus}} (FCoV) is a positive-stranded RNA {{virus that}} is infectious to cats worldwide. This virus {{is part of}} the Alphacoronavirus 1 species of the Alphacoronavirus genus belonging to the Coronaviridae family of viruses. Alphacoronavirus 1 also includes the canine coronavirus (CCoV) and the porcine <b>transmissible</b> gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). It has two different forms; the FECV (feline enteric coronavirus) that infects the intestines and the FIPV (feline infectious peritonitis virus) that causes the disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).|$|E
25|$|For example, Bacillus anthracis is {{considered}} an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy spores, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered <b>transmissible</b> from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary influenza-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal hemorrhagic mediastinitis within 3–7 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients. Finally, friendly personnel can be protected with suitable antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Embodied {{cultural}} capital comprises {{the knowledge that}} is consciously acquired and the passively inherited, by socialization to culture and tradition. Unlike property, {{cultural capital}} is not <b>transmissible,</b> but is acquired over time, as it is impressed upon the person's habitus (character and way of thinking), which, in turn, becomes more receptive to similar cultural influences. Linguistic cultural capital is the mastery of language and its relations; the embodied cultural capital, which is a person's means of communication and self-presentation, acquired from the national culture.|$|E
25|$|Well {{poisoning}} {{has been}} historically documented as strategy during wartime since antiquity, {{and was used}} both offensively (as a terror tactic to disrupt and depopulate a target area) and defensively (as a scorched earth tactic to deny an invading army sources of clean water). Rotting corpses (both animal and human) thrown down wells were the most common implementation; {{in one of the}} earliest examples of biological warfare, corpses known to have died from common <b>transmissible</b> diseases of the Pre-Modern era such as bubonic plague or tuberculosis were especially favored for well-poisoning.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, AMM staff engaged in {{various types of}} medical research. They pioneered in photomicrographic techniques, {{established}} a library and cataloging system which later {{formed the basis for}} the National Library of Medicine (NLM), and led the AMM into research on infectious diseases while discovering the cause of yellow fever. They contributed to research on vaccinations for typhoid fever, and during World War I, AMM staff were involved in vaccinations and health education campaigns, including major efforts to combat sexually <b>transmissible</b> diseases.|$|E
25|$|A virus, S. invicta 1 (SINV-1), {{has been}} found in about 20% of fire ant fields, where it appears to cause the slow death of {{infected}} colonies. It has proven to be self-sustaining and <b>transmissible.</b> Once introduced, it can eliminate a colony within three months. Researchers believe the virus has potential as a viable biopesticide to control fire ants. Two more viruses have also been discovered: S. invicta 2 (SINV-2) and S. invicta 3 (SINV-3). Polygynous colonies tend to face greater infections in contrast to monogynous colonies. Multiple virus infections can also occur.|$|E
