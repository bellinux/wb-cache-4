40|$|The {{mixed traffic}} (the traffic {{made up of}} {{bicycles}} and automobiles) is widely spread in Chinese cities. It is also greatly responsible for major traffic problems, such as the conflicts, low efficiency and safety problems. These problems are most evident at street intersections. However, {{they have never been}} investigated in Chinese cities. Therefore, it is the mixed traffic at intersections that requires detailed study. To predict types of transportation mode in Chinese cities, an investigation in Shanghai was performed. It is found that within a certain distance range, cycling is more efficient than other modes and it will still remain in future urban traffic system of China. Then, mixed traffic would require a new strategy of management. The mixed <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> was studied in two major intersections of Chinese cities by analyzing digital video. The research showed that for constant number of automobile, the crossing time for mixed traffic increases with number of bicycles following a logarithmic equation. The crossing time of the mixed traffics with constant number of bicycle increases with number of automobiles following an exponential equation. The suggestions of traffic management strategies and intersection design are presented. It is anticipated that the new management strategies that consider severely the bicycle component can decrease the traffic impact on environment...|$|E

40|$|When {{streets are}} {{designed}} {{according to the}} shared space principle, road user are encouraged to interact spontaneously {{with each other for}} negotiating the space. These interaction mechanisms do not follow clearly defined traffic rules but rather psychological and social principles related to aspects of safety, comfort and time pressure. However, these principles are hard to capture and to quantify, thus making it difficult to simulate the behavior of road users. This work investigates <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>situations</b> between pedestrians and motorized vehicles, with the main objective to formulate a discrete choice model for the identification of the proper conflict solving strategy. A shared space street in Hamburg, Germany, with high pedestrian volumes is used as a case study for model formulation and calibration. <b>Conflict</b> <b>situations</b> are detected by an automatic procedure of trajectory prediction and comparison. Standard evasive actions are identified, both for pedestrians and vehicles, by observing behavioral patterns. A set of potential parameters, which may affect the choice of the evasive action, is formulated and tested for significance. These include geometrical aspects, like distance and speed of the conflicting users, as well as conflict-specific ones, like time to collision. A multinomial logit model is finally calibrated and validated on real situations. The developed approach is realistic and ready for implementation in motion models for shared space or any other less organized traffic environment. Comment: 13 pages, 5 tables, 6 figures.

We tested whether {{temporal}} orienting of attention could enhance executive control to select among conflicting stimuli and responses. Temporal orienting was induced by presenting explicit cues predicting the most probable interval for target onset, which could be short (400 ms) or long (1, 300 ms). Executive control was measured both by flanker and Simon tasks involving conflict between incompatible responses and by the spatial Stroop task involving conflict between perceptual stimulus features. The results showed that temporal orienting facilitated the resolution of perceptual conflict by reducing the spatial Stroop effect, whereas it interfered with the resolution of response conflict by increasing flanker and Simon effects. Such opposite effects suggest that temporal orienting of attention modulates executive control through dissociable mechanisms, {{depending on whether the}} competition between conflicting representations is located at perceptual or response levels...|$|R

Therefore, the observation of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflicts</b> has been advocated as a complementary approach to analyze traffic safety.

At the end of 2011, the population of motorcycles reached 67. 83 million units and increased the composition of motorcycle on the road approximately from 60 to 70 %. The huge number of motorcycles showed the changing of traffic flow characteristics and decreased signalized intersection performance. Motorcycles movement at intersection approach is usually caused <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> between motorcycle and other types vehicles. The <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> is potential to cause the accident. Therefore, red box for motorcycle at signalized intersection is designate a space for motorcyclists to wait at a red light.

The sample was N= 628 from 12 schools. Using Rasch measurement, linear unidimensional scales were constructed for Emotion and Behaviour Regulation (10 items) and for Negative Emotionality (10 items). The well-known Short Temperament Scale was Rasch analyzed too, but a linear scale could not be created – it had initially been designed under the True Score Test theory paradigm. The children were divided into Type A (high on negative emotionality and low on emotion and behavior regulation, N= 27 and Type B (low on negative emotionality and high on emotion and behavior regulation, N= 31). The children’s teachers were given <b>conflict</b> <b>situations</b> and asked to state what strategies the Type A and Type B children would adopt in each <b>conflict</b> <b>situation.</b> The first <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> was about the child who was being accidentally pushed by a peer. The second <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> was about the child who is being excluded from a game that has enough participants. The third <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> was about the child being called “a baby” because he/she was playing with baby toys. The fourth <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> was about a peer criticizing and putting marks on a child’s picture. The fifth situation was about a peer pushing ahead and taking a toy that a child has been waiting for a long time. The Type A and Type B children were also asked to state what strategies they would adopt in each <b>conflict</b> <b>situation.</b> When the teachers’ views were compared to the children’s views, {{it was clear that the}} teachers did not know their children’s thought processes very well. For both Type A and Type B children, Rasch analysis was used to create a calm/angry scale and a sad/happy scale. <b>Conflict</b> <b>situation</b> two (being excluded from a game) is very hard on the calm/angry scale and both Type A and Type B children need to have a very high angry measure to answer this item positively. <b>Conflict</b> <b>situation</b> two is moderately easy on the sad/happy scale and both Type A and Type B children need only a low sad measure to answer <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> two positively. In contrast, <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> three (being called a “baby”) is very hard on the sad/happy scale and both Type A and Type B children need to have a very high happy measure to answer this item positively. <b>Conflict</b> <b>situation</b> three is moderately easy on the calm/angry scale and both Type A and Type B children need only a low calm measure to answer <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> three positively. The present study gave strong support for the Social Information Processing Model and for the inclusion of emotion and behavior regulation and negative emotionality in the revised model. The study rejected the Short Temperament Scale as it did not produce a linear, unidimensional scale, and it showed that teachers do not know their children, in terms of strategies selection in common social <b>conflict</b> <b>situations,</b> as well as they think that they do. Children are much more conscious of the variety of strategies that can be used in common <b>conflict</b> <b>situations</b> than teachers would normally give them credit.
