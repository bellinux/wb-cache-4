5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false.</b> For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false.</b> Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a clause in {{which one of the}} clause's two {{variables}} has already been set, and the clause could still become either <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false,</b> then the other variable is set in a way that forces the clause to become true.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false,</b> they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false.</b> But mental ideas or judgments are <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false,</b> so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

5000|$|... {{all types}} of medical test results can be <b>true</b> {{positive}} <b>or</b> <b>false</b> positive and <b>true</b> negative <b>or</b> <b>false</b> negative...these categories are hugely dependent on the prevalence of the disease being tested for; and, for example, a false positive test result is more likely when the prevalence of the disease being tested for is very low (such as a lab test for cold-weather influenza being done in June in South Carolina, USA. and giving a [...] "positive" [...] result).|$|R
50|$|In {{classical}} logic the truth values are certain. Therefore a classification is crisp, since the truth values are either exactly <b>true</b> <b>or</b> exactly <b>false.</b>|$|R
5|$|Subjects may be {{instructed}} not {{to judge}} {{whether or not the}} sentence is grammatically acceptable or logical, but whether the proposition expressed by the sentence is <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false.</b> This task is commonly used in psycholinguistic studies of child language.|$|E
5|$|Creating {{a native}} pet {{industry}} in Australia related to quolls could aid in their conservation. However, concerns exist about this methodology {{in regards to}} animal husbandry, conservation benefits, and other issues. Some scientists believe that keeping quolls as pets could aid in their long-term conservation, but {{further research is needed}} on this topic to conclude whether this is <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, Putnam {{is known}} for the Davisâ€“Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), developed with Martin Davis in 1960. The algorithm finds {{if there is a}} set of <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false</b> values that satisfies a given Boolean expression so that the entire expression becomes true. In 1962, they further refined the algorithm with the help of George Logemann and Donald W. Loveland. It became known as the DPLL algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers.|$|E

5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find a truth {{assignment}} to these variables that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false,</b> so that at least one literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E
5|$|Recuerdos de Provincia (Recollections of a Provincial Past), 1850. In {{this second}} autobiography, Sarmiento {{displays}} a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, {{in contrast to}} Mi defensa, choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. Recuerdos discusses his Similar to Facundo, Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing Recuerdos and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory. Sarmiento's persuasion in this book is substantial. The accounts, whether all <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false</b> against him, {{are a source of}} information to write Recuerdos as he is then able to object and rectify into what he creates as a 'true account' of autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Much of the sunnah is {{recorded}} in the Hadith. Initially, Muhammad had instructed his followers not to write down his acts, so they may not confuse it with the Qur'an. However, he did ask his followers to disseminate his sayings orally. As {{long as he was}} alive, any doubtful record could be confirmed as <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false</b> by simply asking him. His death, however, gave rise to confusion over Muhammad's conduct. Thus the Hadith were established. Due to problems of authenticity, the science of Hadith (Arabic: `Ulum al-hadith) is established. It is a method of textual criticism developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, and the individual narrators involved in its transmission. On the basis of these criteria, various Hadith classifications developed.|$|E

25|$|Not every {{conjecture}} ends {{up being}} proven <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false.</b> The continuum hypothesis, which tries to ascertain the relative cardinality of certain infinite sets, was eventually shown to be undecidable (or independent) from the generally accepted set of axioms of set theory. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new axiom in a consistent manner (much as we can take Euclid's parallel postulate as either <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{assertion}} that one statement {{is a necessary}} and sufficient condition of another means that the former statement is true {{if and only if}} the latter is true. That is, the two statements must be either simultaneously <b>true</b> <b>or</b> simultaneously <b>false.</b>|$|R

25|$|Discussion {{regarding}} destiny {{does not}} necessitate {{the existence of}} supernatural powers. Logical determinism or determinateness {{is the notion that}} all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false.</b> This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false),</b> and {{is referred to as the}} problem of future contingents.|$|E
