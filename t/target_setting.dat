40|$|Abstract: The BlastSets {{strategy}} uses a {{probabilistic model}} to compare a query <b>set</b> to <b>target</b> <b>sets</b> of proteins. <b>Target</b> <b>sets</b> are neighborhoods that group proteins sharing some biological properties. <b>Target</b> <b>sets</b> are generated from a compact internal representation, BlastSets Classifications, {{constructed by the}} interpretation of results taken from the literature. We face a classic time-space trade off: instead of storing {{a very large number}} of sets, it is more intelligent to compute some <b>target</b> <b>sets</b> on the fly from a less explicit representation because only a small fraction of them may be pertinent to a given query set. We present an efficient method for the generation of <b>target</b> <b>sets</b> that are pertinent, in the sense they are likely to have good similarity scores with the query, and that form a qualitatively non-redundant collection of <b>target</b> <b>sets.</b> This method exploits the decomposition of a BlastSets Classification in three types: explicit classifications, where sets must be stored explicitly; hierarchical classifications, that defines an explicit classification; implicit classifications, for which we must provide an algorithm for sets generation. Mathematically, our method embeds each type of representation as partially ordered sets, in which pertinent <b>target</b> <b>sets</b> are minimal upper bounds...|$|R

40|$|In the {{standard}} setting of approachability {{there are two}} players and a <b>target</b> <b>set.</b> The players play repeatedly a known vector-valued game where the first player wants to have the average vector-valued payoff converge to the <b>target</b> <b>set</b> which the other player tries to exclude it from this set.

This extension of {{the standard}} setting has implications even when the original <b>target</b> <b>set</b> is not approachable and when it is not obvious which expansion of it should be approached instead.
