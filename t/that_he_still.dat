5|$|Fowler {{suffered}} an aggravation of a pre-existing hip {{injury in the}} 2002–03 pre-season, and did not recover until December.

It was despite this decrease in form <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>still,</b> in total, scored 15 goals in 31 appearances for Leeds; achieving an impressive strike rate of just less than one goal every two games.

5|$|Johnson {{had never}} seriously {{considered}} coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching {{position with the}} Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request.

Although Johnson's retirement prior to the 1992–93 NBA season voided this contract, Buss insisted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> be paid. It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary. After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.|$|E

However, the alternative ending was rejected and the writers favoured the ending that was eventually broadcast.

5|$|Davis {{began the}} 2013–14 {{season in the}} {{starting}} eleven under yet another new manager, Kenny Jackett, but soon lost his place amid competition from new signing Kevin McDonald and two younger midfielders, Lee Evans and Jack Price. On his last start for Wolves, on 16 November, he was reportedly fortunate not to be sent off before being substituted at half-time. Thereafter he played only 54 minutes of first-team football as the team were promoted back to the Championship at the first attempt, and although Jackett insisted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> had a future at the club, Davis became frustrated. Ahead of the new season, Jackett suggested that, as {{there were at least}} four players more likely than Davis to be selected, a loan move would be best for him. Barnsley of League One were interested, but terms could not be agreed.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{realizes he}} needs to make amends with Lisa, but she is too hurt to even talk with him. Homer briefly cheers her up, but shows <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> only wants to win a bet. She agrees to tell Homer who she thinks the winner will be, but she fears that she may be so distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet, leading her to a cryptic prediction: if she still loves Homer, Washington will win; if she does not, Buffalo. As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer, in which she agrees.
