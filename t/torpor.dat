5|$|In cold or inclement weather, several {{nightjar}} {{species can}} slow their metabolism {{and go into}} <b>torpor,</b> notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks. The European nightjar has been observed in captivity {{to be able to}} maintain a state of <b>torpor</b> for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} {{energy and water}} in their highly seasonal environment, mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of dormancy where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, when food and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged <b>torpor</b> during the dry season. Daily <b>torpor</b> constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged <b>torpor</b> averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing <b>torpor</b> that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known to hibernate for six to eight months every year, particularly {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|To {{conserve}} energy, heterothermic bats during long migrations may {{go into a}} torpid state while roosting in the daytime, {{and flying}} at night. Unlike migratory birds which fly {{during the day and}} feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between traveling and eating. Using <b>torpor,</b> bats can save around 90% of energy that they would have spent trying to keep their body temperature at a normal level; thereby reducing the need to feed. It also decreases the duration of migration, which may prevent them from spending too much time in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. Pregnant individuals of some species may not use <b>torpor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brown bats do {{not claim}} feeding areas like a territory, however {{individuals}} frequently {{return to the}} same feeding sites where they have previously made successful catches. When hunting swarms, brown bats usually select {{no more than two}} species. They feed on more species when they are scattered. If they do not catch any food, they will enter a <b>torpor</b> similar to hibernation that day, awakening at night to hunt again.|$|E
5|$|Insect life-histories show {{adaptations to}} {{withstand}} cold and dry conditions. Some temperate region insects {{are capable of}} activity during winter, while some others migrate to a warmer climate or go {{into a state of}} <b>torpor.</b> Still other insects have evolved mechanisms of diapause that allow eggs or pupae to survive these conditions.|$|E
5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the <b>torpor</b> common to us all and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over {{what had once been}} her face.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs lack any shared {{traits that}} make them stand out from all other primates. Different types of lemurs have evolved unique {{combinations}} of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar's harsh, seasonal climate. These traits can include seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including <b>torpor</b> and hibernation), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and strict breeding seasons. Extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are also thought to {{have given rise to}} three other relatively common lemur traits: female social dominance, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism, such as sperm competition.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into <b>torpor</b> in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their echolocation, {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Angry at his {{treatment}} by the Byers enquiry, Scott sought {{other means of}} pursuing his vendetta against Thorpe. In June 1971 he met Gordon Winter, a South African journalist who was also an agent for the South African intelligence agency BOSS. Scott provided details of his supposed seduction by Thorpe, a story which Winter assured his BOSS masters would destroy Thorpe and the Liberal Party. He found that no newspaper would print the story on largely uncorroborated and unreliable evidence. In March 1972 Scott's friend Gwen Parry-Jones died; Scott used the inquest to denounce Thorpe for ruining his life and driving Parry-Jones to her death. None of these accusations was published. Depressed, Scott retreated {{into a state of}} <b>torpor,</b> assisted by tranquilisers, and for a while presented no threat to Thorpe.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal <b>torpor.</b>|$|E
5|$|All lemurs {{experience}} some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation {{include the use}} of alarm calls and predator mobbing, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel, according to a study in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even <b>torpor</b> and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile {{in the absence of the}} parent.|$|E
5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} <b>torpor</b> and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are about}} three times larger than mouse lemurs, {{weighing}} approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within Cheirogaleidae, a family of small, nocturnal lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests {{during the day and}} forage alone at night for fruit, tree gum, insects, and small vertebrates. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of <b>torpor</b> during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form pair bonds. The northern species also has the largest testicle size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of seasonally. Home ranges often overlap, with related females living closely together while males disperse. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital scent gland.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of <b>torpor</b> accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have either}} {{presently}} or formerly filled the ecological niches normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, and grazing ungulates. With {{the diversity of}} adaptations for specific ecological niches, habitat selections among lemur families and some genera are often very distinct, thus minimizing competition. In nocturnal lemurs from the more seasonal forests in the west, up to five species can coexist during the wet season due to high food abundance. However, to endure the extreme dry season, {{three of the five}} species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse lemur and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of <b>torpor,</b> while the fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely. Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in substrate preferences, forest strata used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches. A classic example involves resource partitioning between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur, and the eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus). Each utilizes either different species of bamboo, different parts of the plant, or different layers in the forest. Nutrient and toxin content (such as cyanide) help regulate food selection, though seasonal food preferences are also known to play a role.|$|E
25|$|Species {{breeding}} in temperate region migrate {{during the}} winter when their insect prey populations collapse. Species breeding in more tropical areas are often more sedentary, although several tropical species are partial migrants or make shorter migrations. In antiquity {{it was thought that}} swallows hibernated in a state of <b>torpor,</b> even that they withdrew for the winter under water. Aristotle ascribed hibernation not only to swallows, but also to storks and kites. Hibernation of swallows was considered a possibility even by as acute an observer as Rev. Gilbert White, in his The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789, based on decades of observations). This idea may have been supported by the habit of some species to roost in some numbers in dovecotes, nests and other forms of shelter during harsh weather, and some species even entering <b>torpor.</b> There were several reports of suspected <b>torpor</b> in swallows from 1947, such as a 1970 report that white-backed swallows in Australia may conserve energy this way, but the first confirmed study that they or any passerine entered <b>torpor</b> was a 1988 study on house martins.|$|E
25|$|They hunt {{their prey}} using scent, passive hearing, and echolocation. Their main calls {{have a wide}} {{bandwidth}} and are multiharmonic, with a peak amplitude of 27 to 28kHz. They also make shorter pulsed, frequency modulated calls. The bats enter <b>torpor</b> in cold weather and stay in their roosts for up to 10 {{days at a time}} before emerging to feed. They may also enter daily <b>torpor</b> when roosting alone. However, they are capable of remaining active even in subzero temperatures when necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} yellow bat (Lasiurus intermedius) is a non-migratory bat in {{the family}} Vespertilionidae, typically active year-round except during abnormally frigid winter weather, during which they will induce <b>torpor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the numbat finds termite mounds {{primarily}} using scent, it has {{the highest}} visual acuity of any marsupial, and, unusually for marsupials, has {{a high proportion of}} cone cells in the retina. These are both likely adaptations for its diurnal habits, and vision does appear to be the primary sense used to detect potential predators. Numbats regularly enter a state of <b>torpor,</b> which may last up to fifteen hours a day during the winter months.|$|E
25|$|Heine's mode was satirical attack: {{against the}} Kings of Bavaria and Prussia (he never {{for one moment}} shared the belief that Frederick William IV might be more liberal); against the {{political}} <b>torpor</b> of the German people; and against the greed and cruelty of the ruling class. The most popular of Heine's political poems was his least typical, Die schlesischen Weber ("The Silesian Weavers"), based on the uprising of weavers in Peterswaldau in 1844.|$|E
25|$|Animals that {{hibernate}} {{are in a}} {{state of}} <b>torpor,</b> differing from sleep. Hibernation markedly reduces the need for sleep, but does not remove it. Some hibernating animals end their hibernation a couple of times during the winter so that they can sleep. Hibernating animals waking up from hibernation often go into rebound sleep because of lack of sleep during the hibernation period. They are definitely well-rested and are conserving energy during hibernation, but need sleep for something else.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{process known}} as {{hibernation}} occurs naturally in many mammals and also in toads, but not in mice. (Mice can fall into a state called clinical <b>torpor</b> when food shortage occurs). If the -induced hibernation {{can be made to}} work in humans, it could be useful in the emergency management of severely injured patients, and in the conservation of donated organs. In 2008, hypothermia induced by hydrogen sulfide for 48 hours was shown to reduce the extent of brain damage caused by experimental stroke in rats.|$|E
25|$|Very {{little is}} known about the biology of the species, since it was not {{recognized}} as a separate species until after it is believed to have become extinct. Edgar Stead visited Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island in 1936 and made several observations. He described the species as flying no more than “ten feet above the ground” and always after dusk. At one point he found seven bats roosting in a tree cavity in a state of <b>torpor.</b> After capturing a few and putting them in a cage they crawled around on the floor, much like New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats are known to do. As well as roosting in tree cavities, it is known that they roosted in granite caves on Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island and Rerewhakaupoko/Solomon Island.|$|E
25|$|Like all New Zealand passerines, the New Zealand wrens are sedentary, and are {{not thought}} to {{undertake}} any migrations. It is not known if the extinct species migrated, but it is considered highly unlikely, as three of the extinct species were flightless. The situation with the rock wren is an ornithological mystery, as they are thought to live above the snow line where obtaining food during the winter would be extremely difficult. Searches have {{found no evidence that}} they move altitudinally during the winter, but they are also absent from their normal territories. They may enter a state of <b>torpor</b> (like the hummingbirds of the Americas or a number of Australian passerines) during {{at least part of the}} winter, but this has not yet been proved.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August 1991, the House of Love {{performed}} three London concerts on {{the same}} night – the first at the University of London Union in Bloomsbury, the second at the Town & Country Club in Kentish Town and the third at The Boston Arms in Tufnell Park. Despite the publicity stunt nature of the evening, the band received good reviews and it was considered that their challenge had paid off. However (and considering their level of action) the band was about to enter a fairly long phase of creative <b>torpor.</b> Exhausted by touring, Chadwick and the band kept a low profile for the closing months of 1990 and for most of 1991. While Chadwick rested, Evans, Walker and Groothuizen took advantage of the time off to return to My White Bedroom, which released its lone album in 1991 after two years of delay.|$|E
500|$|Also, hypometabolism. An energy-conserving {{strategy}} used by {{some small}} (under [...] ) birds in which they become inactive and unreactive to external stimuli, and reduce their metabolism causing decreases in body temperature {{by an average of}} [...] below their normal respiration and heart rate. [...] Two types of <b>torpor</b> are recognized. In one type, such as in hummingbirds, <b>torpor</b> may be entered on a daily basis and last only a few hours; other behaviours, such as foraging, continue during non-torpor periods. For other species, <b>torpor</b> may only be entered during cold conditions or when food becomes limited, but may persist for weeks or even months. The extent of unresponsiveness during <b>torpor</b> can be pronounced. A hummingbird in deep <b>torpor,</b> for example, with a body temperature of , will not respond to a variety of external stimuli such as attempts to push it from a perch; only the locking reﬂex of the feet stops the bird from falling. [...] <b>Torpor</b> has been reported in eight orders of birds.|$|E
500|$|While {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{is found in}} both primary and {{secondary}} deciduous forests, they have lower population densities in secondary forests. This is because variations in gray mouse lemur abundance are linked to their capacity to enter <b>torpor</b> during the dry season, especially for females, which tend to hibernate longer than males. In primary forests, they can maintain daily <b>torpor</b> or hibernation {{as long as their}} body temperatures remain below , but in secondary forests that have fewer large trees, temperatures are higher and inhibit the gray mouse lemur's ability to maintain <b>torpor</b> for prolonged periods of time. [...] In addition, the gray mouse lemur in secondary forests tend to have a lower body mass than those in primary forests, as well as lower survival rates. This is likely because those with lower body mass are less likely to enter <b>torpor,</b> and therefore expend around 40% more energy than those that do maintain <b>torpor.</b>|$|E
500|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} is unique among the mouse lemurs studied so far {{because it is}} the only species to exhibit {{prolonged}} seasonal <b>torpor,</b> but this behavior has only been observed to occur in one locality. [...] Activity patterns can differ noticeably between sexes as well as populations. [...] At the Ampijoroa Forestry Station in Ankarafantsika National Park, males and females exhibit daily, rather than seasonal <b>torpor.</b> [...] At Kirindy Forest, both sexes share the same daily <b>torpor,</b> yet during the dry season (April/May through September/October), females become completely inactive for several weeks or up to five months to conserve energy and reduce predation. However, males rarely remain inactive {{for more than a few}} days and become extremely active before the females revive from <b>torpor,</b> allowing them to establish hierarchies and territories for the breeding season. [...] The use of alternative energy-saving strategies under the same environmental conditions was observed directly in 2008, providing the first physiological confirmation from the field. [...] This pattern of seasonal versus daily <b>torpor</b> may relate to the seasonality of the region, since Kirindy is the only location west of the eastern mountain rainforests that experiences very low temperatures at night during the winter months. [...] By entering extended <b>torpor,</b> sometimes referred to as hibernation, this would reduce the thermoregulatory stress in females, whereas males remain more active in preparation for the upcoming mating season. [...] No difference in mortality has been shown between hibernating females and active males.|$|E
500|$|<b>Torpor</b> is {{especially}} useful for microbats, as {{they use a}} large amount of energy while active, depend upon an unreliable food source, and have a limited ability to store fat. They generally drop their body temperature in this state to , and they may reduce their energy expenditure by 50 to 99%. Around 97% of all microbats use <b>torpor,</b> including tropical bats which may use <b>torpor</b> to avoid predation. Megabats were generally believed to be only homeothermic, however three species of small megabats, with a body mass of about , have been known to use torpor: [...] the common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis), the long-tongued nectar bat (Macroglossus minimus), and the eastern tube-nosed bat (Nyctimene robinsoni). Torpid states last longer in the summer for megabats than in the winter.|$|E
500|$|During <b>torpor,</b> {{the gray}} mouse lemur's {{metabolic}} rate slows and its body temperature {{drops to the}} ambient temperature, as low as [...] [...] During the cooler months of May though August, the species selects tree holes closer to ground level, where ambient temperatures remain more stable. [...] This allows them to remain in <b>torpor</b> longer, and to conserve metabolic resources. One study showed that during the breeding season, {{both males and females}} reduced their energy expenditure by 20% when they nested in pairs, and a maximal energetic benefit of 40% was achieved when three mouse lemurs nested together. Even during the nonbreeding season, maximal energetic gain was observed two or more animals nested together, because resting metabolic rate was already decreased.|$|E
500|$|Although {{threatened}} by deforestation, habitat degradation, and live capture for the pet trade, {{it is considered}} one of Madagascar's most abundant small native mammals. [...] It can tolerate moderate food shortages by experiencing daily <b>torpor</b> to conserve energy, but extended food shortages due to climate change may pose a significant risk to the species.|$|E
500|$|As {{with all}} members of the mouse lemur genus, the gray mouse lemur is known to enter short states of daily <b>torpor,</b> {{particularly}} during the cool, dry Southern Hemisphere winter. [...] This rare trait in primates, coupled with the ease of observing the species within its wide geographic distribution and its good representation in captivity, makes it a popular subject for research as a model organism.|$|E
500|$|Like all mouse lemurs, {{this species}} is nocturnal and arboreal. It is very active, {{and though it}} forages alone, groups {{of males and females}} form {{sleeping}} groups and share tree holes during the day. [...] It exhibits a form of dormancy called <b>torpor</b> during the cool, dry winter months, and in some cases undergoes seasonal <b>torpor</b> (or hibernation), which is unusual for primates. [...] The gray mouse lemur can be found in several types of forest throughout western and southern Madagascar. [...] Its diet consists primarily of fruit, insects, flowers, and nectar. [...] In the wild, its natural predators include owls, snakes, and endemic mammalian predators. [...] Predation pressure is higher for this species than among any other primate species, with one out of four individuals taken by a predator each year. [...] This is counterbalanced by its high reproductive rate. [...] Breeding is seasonal, and distinct vocalizations are used to prevent hybridization with species that overlap its range. [...] Gestation lasts approximately 60days, and typically two young are born. [...] The offspring are usually independent in two months, and can reproduce after one year. [...] The gray mouse lemur has a reproductive lifespan of five years, although captive individuals have been reported to live up to 15years.|$|E
500|$|Female home ranges overlap {{less than}} those of males, {{although}} localized concentrations, or [...] "population nuclei", tend to form in some areas, where the sex ratio favors females to males by three or four to one at the nucleus core. [...] Genetic studies indicate that females arrange themselves spatially in clusters ("population nuclei") of related individuals, while males tend to emigrate from their natal group. [...] Research has shown that females in this species may maintain smaller ranges and associate more closely with other females than in some other mouse lemur species due to a more opportunistic feeding niche and, {{in the case of}} populations at Kirindy, the use of extended, seasonal <b>torpor.</b>|$|E
500|$|Small {{vertebrates}} {{are active}} beneath the snow. Among vertebrates, alpine salamanders {{are active in}} snow at temperatures as low as they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds. Among mammals, those that remain active are typically smaller than [...] Omnivores {{are more likely to}} enter a <b>torpor</b> or be hibernators, whereas herbivores are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow. Voles store up to [...] of food and pikas up to [...] Voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another's warmth. On the surface, wolves, coyotes, foxes, lynx, and weasels rely on these subsurface dwellers for food and often dive into the snowpack to find them.|$|E
500|$|So the {{pamphlet}} could be published {{as soon as}} she finished writing it, Wollstonecraft wrote frantically while her publisher Joseph Johnson printed the pages. In fact, Godwin's Memoirs of Wollstonecraft tells that the sheets of manuscript were delivered to the press as they were written. Halfway through the work, however, she ceased writing. One biographer describes it as a [...] "loss of nerve"; Godwin, in his Memoirs, describes it as [...] "a temporary fit of <b>torpor</b> and indolence". Johnson, perhaps canny enough at this point in their friendship to know how to encourage her, agreed to dispose of the book and told her not to worry about it. Ashamed, she rushed to finish.|$|E
