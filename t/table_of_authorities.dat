40|$|The Coalition Government in England has {{recently}} undertaken a radical review of adoption services. Informed by business and managerial principles, the government strategy, ‘An Action Plan for Adoption: Tackling Delay’ (DfE, 2012 a), {{is designed to}} increase the number of adoptions, widen the pool of adoptive applicants and reduce the costs occurred by keeping children unnecessarily in the looked after system of care. The new strategy has been opposed by many in the social work profession who fear that a speeding up of the adoption process will erode social work values and practice. Previous governments have attempted to bring about radical change in adoption practices across England, but with little success. The paper reviews some of the dilemmas raised by the new adoption proposals, such as the opportunity to bring about success and to change the outcomes for children needing adoption as supported by the body of research into the potential positive effects of adoption on children’s outcome. However the paper is questioning whether managerialist tools such as league <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> local <b>authority</b> performance have any place in child-centred adoption practice...|$|R

40|$|This book portrays {{evidence}} and {{gathering of evidence}} under the current Croatian regulation relating to {{evidence and}} in practice. In this context, the author first analyses the fundamental principles of Croatian civil procedure and law of evidence. Then, the general principles of evidence and gathering of evidence are discussed, {{as well as the}} general rule on the burden of proof. The question of gathering of evidence through modern technology (videoconferencing, etc.) in the Croatian law and practice is also discussed. Separate parts of this book contain the analysis of means of proof regulated by the Croatian Civil Procedure Act: inspection of object ('view'), documents, witness testimony, expert testimony, and party testimony. The rules on costs caused by gathering of evidence, including the costs for translation are analysed, as well as the rules on language. The concepts of illegally obtained evidence and illegal evidence in the Croatian law and practice are discussed. This volume contains the report about the Council Regulation (EC) No 1206 / 2001 and the multilateral and bilateral legal assistance treaties to which Croatia is a party. There are several appendices to this book: a <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> according to the Regulation No 1206 / 2001, and relevant sources of Croatian civil procedure, table of case law on evidence, table portraying a ordinary/common civil procedure timeline, table referring to legal interpretation in the Croatian legal system, and comparative tables focusing on functional differences between national regulation, bilateral legal assistance treaties, multilateral treaties, and Council Regulation (EC) No 1206 / 2001 on taking of evidence by hearing of witnesses.

They were originally based on Sanhuri’s codes to varying degrees. Yet, common law principles derived either from English common law or Islamic customary usages are unidentified and thus ignored. Here, this lacuna is rectified through a comparative analysis of the primary data (eg, cases, statutes and arbitral award decisions), adding common law and uncodified Islamic custom to MENA law codes. The purpose of this comparative analysis is to allow common legal principles found at civil, common and Islamic law to be distilled {{in the service of}} creating a new harmonised international commercial arbitration law code (HICALC) or uniform Arab arbitration law (UAAL) for adoption in the MENA. 1 These principles already form part or all of the legal systems in the MENA. They can be readily assimilated into a harmonised or uniform code. Would this new harmonised code lead to higher arbitral award enforcement in the MENA? According to the evidence the answer is yes. The author understands that at the present time the HICALC articles are ambitious and as such they are a beginning point and can initially be taken as a harmonised international commercial arbitration common rule (HICACR). A brief overview of the history of harmonisation is given. An assessment of the status of the laws and traditions of the MENA was carried out. A comparative analysis of the relevant differences and similarities of the case study countries (Egypt and the United Arab Emirates) was carried out to show the gaps in the laws and areas requiring reform. An analysis of enforcement of arbitral awards was carried out. The unique problems that ICA and IIA encounter in the MENA as derived from an analysis of cases and the laws therein are expounded in consideration of matters pertaining to enforcement. A comparative analysis of universal principles which must be included in a new code, including custom, was carried out. An analysis of the unique features and unique needs of the MENA was carried out in order to inform the Draft Article Provisions. An analysis of important international legal instruments dealing specifically with international arbitration and the gaps therein is given. The draft articles for a HICALC or uniform Arab arbitration law were derived {{as a result of these}} multiple layers of analysis. The matters of compétence de la compétence, expropriation, interest, public policy and sovereign immunity are highlighted as the most important areas requiring urgent reform. The results of this research are suggested Draft Article Provisions for a model Harmonised International Commercial Arbitration Law Code (HICALC) or a uniform Arab arbitration law. Future drafters may refer to and revise these articles for implementation. The synthesis of theory and practice addresses doctrinal matters that arise in international investment arbitrations and international commercial arbitration, with a focus on investor–State arbitrations. This synthesis provides a new theoretical conception of the jurisprudence of international arbitration, particularly in regard to the matters of res iudicata, precedent and expansion of arbitral tribunal powers and jurisdiction.
