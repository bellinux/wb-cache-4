50|$|Cars can be {{equipped}} with a trailer tow hitch with a removable <b>tow</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{trailer tongue}} (North America) or {{coupling}} (outside North America) slips over a <b>tow</b> <b>ball</b> attached to or integral with the hitch.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} tow safely the correct {{combination}} of vehicle and trailer must {{be combined with}} correct loading horizontally and vertically on the <b>tow</b> <b>ball.</b> Advice should be taken (see references) to avoid problems.|$|E
50|$|Across Europe around 25% of {{vehicles}} have <b>tow</b> <b>balls</b> fitted—but there are distinct regional variations, being {{more common in}} Benelux and Scandinavia. In Sweden, around 2.2 million cars of around 4.3 million (just over 50%) have <b>tow</b> <b>balls.</b> In the United Kingdom the popularity of caravans is responsible for a high percentage number of 4x4 (SUV) type vehicles being fitted with tow hitches.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tow</b> <b>balls</b> come {{in various}} sizes {{depending}} on the load they carry and the country of operation: ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Three-point linkage on a Ferguson 35 tractor.The tractor and linkage {{are painted}} gold. The grey bars are a {{separate}} implement (a <b>towing</b> <b>ball</b> hitch) {{attached to the}} linkage.|$|R
50|$|The ISO {{standard}} <b>tow</b> <b>ball</b> is 50 mm {{in diameter}} and conforms to a standard BS AU 113b (replaced by BS ISO 1103:2007). The ISO standard has been adopted {{in most of the}} world outside North America.|$|E
50|$|A {{jockey wheel}} is a {{retractable}} adjustable-height wheel {{used on the}} front of trailers with either a single axle (two running wheels) or more close-coupled axles at or near the centre of gravity whereby without additional support, the trailer would not remain 'level'. The jockey wheel is situated close to the towing hitch and has a built-in screw jack to enable the trailer nose to be lifted over the <b>tow</b> <b>ball</b> of a car or other powered vehicle. The screw jack can then be used to gently lower the trailer nose onto the <b>tow</b> <b>ball.</b> Once securely attached to the towing vehicle, the jockey wheel's jacking action is fully retracted for stowage. The jockey wheel is also unclamped and lifted as far as possible to give the greatest ground clearance before reclamping prior to a journey being made.|$|E
50|$|Outside North America, {{the vehicle}} {{mounting}} for the <b>tow</b> <b>ball</b> {{is called the}} tow bracket. The mounting points for all recent passenger vehicles are defined by the vehicle manufacturer and the tow-bracket manufacturer must use these mount points and prove the efficacy of their bracket for each vehicle by a full rig-based fatigue test.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, many {{pickup trucks}} come {{equipped}} with {{one to three}} mounting holes placed in the center area of the rear bumper to accommodate the mounting of trailer <b>tow</b> <b>balls.</b> The ones on the extreme left or right are often used by drivers in rural areas who tow wide farm equipment on two-lane roads. The far side mounting allows for the item (trailer, etc.) being towed to be further away from {{the opposite side of}} the road (oncoming traffic, etc.). Caution must be taken when using the bumper of a pickup truck for towing rather than using a frame mounted receiver hitch, as the bumper does not provide for as much strength and therefore is generally used to tow lighter loads. Weight ratings for both bumper-mounted and frame-mounted receiver hitches can be found on bumper of pickup trucks (for bumper-mounted <b>tow</b> <b>balls)</b> and on the receiver hitch (for frame-mounted receiver hitches). Many pickup trucks without frame-mounted receiver hitches often use the rear bumper, especially if the pickup truck is a light duty (not full size) pickup truck.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the construction of}} a ball connection structure with ball hitch to Huddig AB Backhoe, 1260. As will be used to pull heavy trailers at work. The reason for the project is that people often tend to make their own solutions to this problem, which is often made using modifications of the rear frame, where laws and regulations are unclear on what is legal and what is not. In this report. The laws and regulations will be examined, to see what actually comes to the construction of towing devices for backhoe loaders. These laws will then be the basis for the construction. A prototype construction will be made in SolidWorks and then calculate the strength through finite element analysis to ensure that the construction has good strength. As well as a choice of ball hitch from other manufacturers will be investigated. The construction is made to withstand 15 ton traction and 3 tons vertical load on the <b>towing</b> <b>ball.</b> The structure must use existing anchor points on the machine where normally the train set is mounted on the "rail" models, and where a tow hook is mounted on the standard models. This report addresses only the construction and not the prototype manufacturing process. The idea is that it will later be included a hydraulic design to open and close the ball connector...|$|R
60|$|The cannon {{suspended}} {{over the}} stern of the Adamant was also again brought into play, and shot after shot was driven down upon the <b>towing</b> crab. Every <b>ball</b> rebounded from the spring armour, but the officer in charge of the crab became convinced that after a time this constant pounding, almost in the same place, would injure his vessel, and he signalled the repeller to that effect.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of ISO tow ball: the flange fitting and the swan-neck which has an extended neck fitting into the tow-bracket. Swan-neck tow balls are often removable to avoid the inconvenience of a <b>tow</b> <b>ball</b> protruding from the vehicle when not required. Some manufacturers are introducing retractable tow balls as an option.|$|E
50|$|A {{tow hitch}} (or tow bar) is a device {{attached}} to the chassis of a vehicle for towing, or a towbar to an aircraft nose gear. It can {{take the form of}} a <b>tow</b> <b>ball</b> to allow swiveling and articulation of a trailer, or a tow pin, or a tow hook with a trailer loop, often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows similar movements. Another category is the towing pintle used on military vehicles worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|In 1790, Ball {{received}} a command {{and from then}} on he was continuously employed. In May 1798, Ball commanded the [...] in the Mediterranean. Once when Nelson's [...] had lost her fore- and topmasts, <b>Ball</b> <b>towed</b> Vanguard to Sardinia. [...] Under Nelson’s command, Ball took part in the Battle of the Nile, and his ship, the Alexander, was the second British ship to fire on the French Admiral's flagship, L’Orient, which later blew up during the battle.|$|R
50|$|Three {{interesting}} {{aspects of}} Rocket Ball are {{the presence of}} referees, tether cables, and the shortened cable duration. Referees are jockeys which tend to run around the arena after you on foot. They never mount a rocket but will sometimes try to kick you or another jockey around the field. They can be treated {{exactly the same as}} other jockeys. Tether cables connect all jockeys, including the player, to their rockets. In this way, if a jockey falls off of his sled, or are cabled off, they will remain attached to their sled by a short cable until {{a certain amount of time}} passes. This allows a jockey to land nearby their rocket, even if they were to be cabled by an opponent. Shorter cable durations are also used, which shortens the amount of time a cable may be attached to a jockey or ball to only a few seconds. This increases the complexity of the game, generally forcing the player to make shots at a net, rather than <b>towing</b> in the <b>ball,</b> as well as making it harder to disable the opponent. The rules of Rocket War still apply in Rocket Ball: taking out your opponents can sometimes be a good strategy to gain some breathing room while trying to catch up in goals. Completing a match is dependent on the amount of goals you have versus your rivals. Winning on a stolen sled will also unlock it in this mode.|$|R
