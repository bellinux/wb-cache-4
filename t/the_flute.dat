5|$|A {{traditional}} {{musical instrument}} of the Toraja is a bamboo flute called a Pa'suling (suling is an Indonesian word for flute). This six-holed flute (not unique to the Toraja) is played at many dances, such as the thanksgiving dance Ma'bondensan, where <b>the</b> <b>flute</b> accompanies a group of shirtless, dancing men with long fingernails. The Toraja have indigenous musical instruments, such as the Pa'pelle (made from palm leaves) and the Pa'karombi (the Torajan version of a jaw harp). The Pa'pelle is played during harvest time and at house inauguration ceremonies.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> bamboo <b>flute</b> is an {{important}} instrument in Indian classical music, and developed independently of <b>the</b> Western <b>flute.</b> <b>The</b> Hindu God Lord Krishna is traditionally considered a master of <b>the</b> bamboo <b>flute.</b> <b>The</b> Indian <b>flutes</b> are very simple compared to the Western counterparts; they are made of bamboo and are keyless.|$|R

If <b>the</b> <b>flutes</b> were straight, <b>the</b> whole tooth would impact the {{material}} at once, causing vibration and reducing accuracy and surface quality. Setting <b>the</b> <b>flutes</b> at an angle allows the tooth to enter the material gradually, reducing vibration. Typically, finishing cutters have a higher rake angle (tighter helix) to give a better finish.|$|R
5|$|The opera {{was first}} given in January 1957 at La Scala in Italian translation. Between then and the French premiere Poulenc {{introduced}} {{one of his}} most popular late works, <b>the</b> <b>Flute</b> Sonata, which he and Jean-Pierre Rampal performed in June at the Strasbourg Festival. Three days later, on 21 June, came the Paris premiere of Dialogues des Carmélites at the Opéra. It was a tremendous success, to the composer's considerable relief. At around this time Poulenc began his last romantic relationship, with Louis Gautier, a former soldier; they remained partners to the end of Poulenc's life.|$|E
5|$|When in 1952 Messiaen {{was asked}} to provide a test piece for flautists at the Paris Conservatoire, he {{composed}} the piece Le merle noir for flute and piano. While he had long been fascinated by birdsong, and birds had made appearances in several of his earlier works (for example La Nativité, Quatuor and Vingt regards), <b>the</b> <b>flute</b> piece was based entirely on {{the song of the}} blackbird.|$|E
5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only <b>the</b> <b>flute</b> was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the above}} {{instruments}} has its own range. The piccolo reads music in C (like <b>the</b> standard <b>flute),</b> but sounds one octave higher. <b>The</b> alto <b>flute</b> is in <b>the</b> key ofG, and the low register extends to the G below middleC; its highest note is a highG (4ledger lines above the treble staff). <b>The</b> bass <b>flute</b> is an octave lower than <b>the</b> concert <b>flute,</b> and <b>the</b> contrabass <b>flute</b> is an octave lower than <b>the</b> bass <b>flute.</b>|$|R

50|$|The oldest phase at Jiahu only {{contains}} two flutes, which are tetratonic and pentatonic; the middle phase at Jiahu contains several flutes, including an interesting pair of hexatonic <b>flutes.</b> One of <b>the</b> <b>flutes</b> was broken, and <b>the</b> other <b>flute</b> {{seems to be}} a replica of <b>the</b> first <b>flute,</b> as it shows evidence of adjustments made to match the pitch of the first. Innovations in the last phase include the use of heptatonic <b>flutes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>flutes</b> were cut, smoothed at the ends, polished and finally drilled with a row of holes on one side. One of <b>the</b> broken <b>flutes</b> was repaired by drilling fourteen tiny holes along the breakage lines and then tying the sections together with hemp string.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in {{the seventeenth}} century, composers began {{creating}} works of a more emotional style. They felt that a monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice. As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm. Bowed instruments such as the violin, viola, baryton, and various lutes dominated popular music. Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions {{in favor of the}} rising popularity of the guitar. As the prevalence of string orchestras rose, wind instruments such as <b>the</b> <b>flute,</b> oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{was brought}} up in Dartmouth Park Road. His cultured mother exposed her family to art, music and poetry, and young Carte studied the violin and then <b>the</b> <b>flute</b> at an early age. The family spoke French at home two days a week, and his parents often took their {{children}} to the theatre. He was educated at University College School, which he left in 1860. In 1861, he achieved First Class level in the matriculation examination and then attended University College, London. However, he left later that year to work in his father's business, along with his brother, Henry. He studied music during this time and composed some pieces, which he dedicated to the actress Kate Terry. He also acted in amateur theatricals.|$|E
5|$|Nag Nathaiya {{is celebrated}} {{on the fourth}} lunar day of the dark {{fortnight}} of the Hindu month of Kartik (October–November). It commemorates the victory of Krishna over the serpent Kaliya. On this occasion, a large Kadamba tree (Neolamarckia cadamba) branch is planted {{on the banks of}} the Ganges so that a boy, playing the role of Krishna, can jump into the river on to the effigy representing Kaliya. He stands over the effigy in a dancing pose playing <b>the</b> <b>flute,</b> while an audience watches from the banks of the river or from boats. Bharat Milap celebrates the meeting of Rama and his younger brother Bharata after the return of the former after 14 years of exile. It is celebrated during October–November, a day after the festival of Vijayadashami. Kashi Naresh attends this festival in his regal attire. The festival attracts a large number of devotees.|$|E

5|$|The Native Americans {{played the}} first folk music {{in what is}} now the United States, using a wide variety of styles and techniques. Some commonalities are near {{universal}} among Native American traditional music, however, especially the lack of harmony and polyphony, and the use of vocables and descending melodic figures. Traditional instrumentations use <b>the</b> <b>flute</b> and many kinds of percussion instruments, like drums, rattles, and shakers. Since European and African contact was established, Native American folk music has grown in new directions, into fusions with disparate styles like European folk dances and Tejano music. Modern Native American music may be best known for pow wows, pan-tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and music are performed.|$|E

5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, and played <b>the</b> <b>flute</b> music {{featured in the}} game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E
5|$|Following David and Shaw's exodus for the Engineer home world, {{they arrive}} at a temple {{surrounded}} by scores of Engineers. David carpet bombs them with the mutagen, resulting in the extinction of all non-floral life on the planet, as well as mutations in the flora that can infect and impregnate organisms with Neomorphs. The Engineer ship crashes afterwards and Shaw dies from unknown means, though David preserves and utilizes her body in his eugenics experiments. Ten years later, a team from the colony ship Covenant is attacked by two Neomorphs that burst from two of their bodies. David intervenes by frightening them away with a flare gun. He urges the survivors to follow him to the temple, where he has established his laboratory. Sporting overgrown hair, David introduces himself and offers them shelter, while learning about the 2,000 colonists and hundreds of embryos in stasis aboard Covenant. He takes {{a special interest in}} the successor model from his own synthetic line, Walter, and tells him that Shaw died when the Engineer ship crashed. David claims to have loved Shaw and compares it to Walter's attachment to the terraforming expert Daniels, which Walter dismisses as being impossible. David attempts to bond with Walter by teaching him to play <b>the</b> <b>flute.</b> They recognize that while Walter is more advanced, he has been inhibited from creating, due to disturbances caused by David models with that feature.|$|E
