5|$|Courtship {{begins with}} a noisy flight by <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> {{followed}} by a graceful, circular glide with outstretched wings and head down. After landing, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> will approach the female with a puffed-out breast, bobbing head, and loud calls. Mated pairs will often preen each other's feathers.|$|E
5|$|Female Carolina wrens possess song control {{regions that}} {{would appear to}} make them capable of singing with {{repertoires}} like <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> Due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> {{it has been suggested}} that song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance.|$|E
5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> and female begin to circle each other. If <b>the</b> <b>male</b> has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite <b>the</b> <b>male</b> while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause <b>the</b> <b>male</b> to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>males</b> {{are roughly}} 20% {{smaller than the}} females, but they are morphologically very similar. However, as in all {{mosquito}} species, the antennae of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> {{in comparison to the}} females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect the characteristic whine of the female. The maxillary palps of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> are also longer than their proboscis, whereas the females’ maxillary palps are much shorter. (This is typical for <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of <b>the</b> Culicinae.) In addition, the tarsus of the hind legs of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> is more silvery. Tarsomere IV is roughly 75% silver in <b>the</b> <b>males</b> whereas <b>the</b> females’ is only about 60% silver.|$|R
50|$|The {{females are}} usually bigger than <b>the</b> <b>males</b> and have shorter wings, while in <b>the</b> <b>males</b> wings cover {{at least the}} whole abdomen.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>males</b> {{are usually}} thinner than females but are more colorful, {{ranging from a}} reddish shade or bright {{chestnut}} brown, to a shiny bronze color. The females are usually dull-colored, and more stout-bodied than <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> It is also observed that females of this species {{tend to be less}} active than <b>the</b> <b>males.</b>|$|R
5|$|Finally <b>the</b> <b>male</b> mounts and copulates {{with the}} female. Afterward, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> {{generally}} dismounts {{and the two}} pair usually run away from each other. However, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> sometimes chases the female and tries to copulate again.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially in <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> is larger than the female.|$|E
5|$|Males {{initiate}} copulation by mounting {{the female}} and tilting her hear back 90 degrees. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> then secures his position by biting and pulling {{back on the}} hairs {{at the base of}} the female’s skull. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> then uses his thumbs to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals have been noted to be very quiet during the copulation process. Once the process is over <b>the</b> <b>male</b> dismounts the female and flies away to find another mate.|$|E
50|$|The {{species are}} 1.5 mm long, with <b>the</b> <b>males</b> being {{slightly}} smaller. Both sexes have different antennae size, with <b>males</b> having <b>the</b> longest. Another {{way to tell}} {{a difference between the}} sexes is by looking at their abdomen. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> have distal claspers on its abdomen. They mate in mid air. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> feed on mango trees early morning.|$|R
50|$|When {{the bees}} emerge from their cocoons, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> exit first. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> {{typically}} remain near the nests {{waiting for the}} females, and some are known to actively extract females from their cocoons. When the females emerge, they mate with one or several <b>males.</b> <b>The</b> <b>males</b> soon die, {{and within a few}} days the females begin provisioning their nests.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} manakins, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> cluster in a leks to attract females. After mating, the females rear the chicks on {{without the help}} of <b>the</b> <b>males.</b>|$|R
5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> <b>The</b> <b>male</b> displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and <b>the</b> <b>male</b> mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E
5|$|The African crake is {{territorial}} on {{both the}} breeding and non-breeding grounds; <b>the</b> <b>male</b> threat display involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the flanks and belly like a fan to show the barred underparts. He may march towards the intruder, or walk {{side by side with}} another displaying male. The female may accompany <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> but with feathers less widely fanned. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves <b>the</b> <b>male</b> birds jumping at each other and pecking. Paired females will attack other females in the territory, especially if <b>the</b> <b>male</b> has shown an interest in them.|$|E
5|$|The close {{relationship}} between the katipo and redback is shown when mating, <b>The</b> <b>male</b> redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> katipo can not mate with the female redback as <b>the</b> <b>male</b> katipo is heavier than <b>the</b> <b>male</b> redback and when it approaches the web it triggers a predatory response in the female leading to the katipo being eaten before mating occurs. There is evidence of interbreeding between katipo and redbacks in the wild.|$|E
50|$|Generally <b>the</b> <b>males</b> are {{heavier and}} more {{colorful}} than <b>the</b> females. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> also are larger with longer fins, while the females become plumper when ripe with eggs.|$|R
5|$|Unlike other whales (and {{most other}} mammals), the females {{are larger than}} <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> Sexual {{dimorphism}} is usually reversed, with <b>the</b> <b>males</b> being larger, but the females of all baleen whales are usually five percent larger than males. Sexual dimorphism is also displayed through whale song, notably in humpback whales where <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of <b>the</b> species sing elaborate songs. Male right whales have bigger callosities than female right whales. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> are generally more scarred than females which {{is thought to be}} because of aggression during mating season.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} sexually dimorphic, with females larger than <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> <b>The</b> females reach {{a length of}} 80 to 85 {{millimeters}} and a weight of about five grams. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> are leaner and significantly smaller at 50 to 56 millimeters in length.|$|R
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{rituals of}} the American goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> {{is able to}} signal his quality and fitness, both {{in the short term}} (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts <b>the</b> <b>male</b> as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as <b>the</b> <b>male</b> warbles throughout the flight.|$|E
5|$|The female is plumaged like <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> but is duller {{and has a}} grey {{head with}} a {{different}} pattern from <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> though it bears {{a hint of the}} pale head markings of <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> The juvenile is like the female, but young males have black markings on the head from an early age.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>male</b> then {{leads the}} female to {{potential}} nest sites, {{and the female}} will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> will fly about, gather material, {{and bring it to}} her. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> will stand on the female's back and give the material to the female, who then builds it into the nest. The nest is constructed of twigs, conifer needles, or grass blades, and is of flimsy construction. Mourning doves will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other mourning doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as squirrels.|$|E
50|$|Threefin {{blennies}} are diurnal and territorial; {{many species}} exhibit sexual dichromatism, with the females drab compared to <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> <b>The</b> second dorsal fin is also extended in <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of some species. Small invertebrates comprise {{the bulk of}} the threefin blenny diet.|$|R

50|$|Sexually dimorphic, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> have {{enlarged}} mandibles and {{are larger}} than the females. Although <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> mandibles seem threatening, they are too weak to be harmful. Nevertheless, females can inflict a painful bite. The resemblance of <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> mandibles to <b>the</b> horns of a stag, and their use in combat between males, much like with deer, gives the species its scientific and common names.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>male</b> wanders as {{an adult}} and in August or September goes looking for the females' webs to mate. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> will enter the female's web and vibrate the silk as he {{approaches}} her. The female is usually aggressive at first and will chase <b>the</b> <b>male</b> from the web. The Courtship process consists of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> bobbing, plucking and tweaking the web along with periods of cautious approach and being chased by the female. Eventually, when she becomes docile and allows him to approach, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> will then approach the female as she hangs quietly upside down in the web. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> moves onto her ventral abdomen, tapping her rapidly until she moves to align his abdomen above hers. He then inserts his palps one at a time, leaving the female between each insertion. Copulation occurs over 10 to 30 minutes. After mating, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> retreats to groom, which is performed by running his palps and legs through his fangs and wiping them over his body. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> is not eaten by the female unlike some other widow spiders.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of slope posture, a pre-copulatory one and an {{ordinary}} one. The pre-copulatory behavior of scaly-breasted munia includes a sequence of actions. The first involves either <b>the</b> <b>male</b> or female playing with nest-material. As soon as a bird has arranged the nest material in its bill, it begins to fly around in a zig-zag path. Once a bird lands close to its partner, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> bends towards the female and wipes its bill. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus <b>the</b> <b>male</b> concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by <b>the</b> <b>male</b> at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>males</b> {{can reach}} 90mm (3.5 inches) from snout to vent (SVL), the females smaller at about 74mm (3 inches) SVL. There {{is a strong}} {{colouration}} difference between <b>the</b> <b>males</b> and females (dichromatism).|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of inheritance, it is made very clear that all {{property}} belongs to <b>the</b> <b>males</b> in <b>the</b> family. This also means that all debt also belongs to <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of <b>the</b> family.|$|R
5|$|A female P. labiata {{that sees}} a male may {{approach}} slowly or wait. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> then walks with erect and displaying by waving {{his legs and}} palps. If the female does not run away, she gives a propulsive display first. If <b>the</b> <b>male</b> stands his ground and she does not ran away or repeat the propulsive display, he approaches and, if she is mature, they copulate. If the female is sub-adult (one moult from maturity), a male may cohabit in the female's capture web. Portias usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by the female. P. labiata typically copulates for about 100seconds, while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: <b>the</b> <b>male</b> redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> katipo is too heavy to mate with the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles are quite {{different}} in appearance to the female. They are smaller in size, being about one sixth {{the size of an}} adult female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with a predominantly white abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed <b>the</b> <b>male</b> to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as <b>the</b> <b>male</b> Latrodectus katipo.|$|E
50|$|The female pale-flecked garden sunskink has a yellowish, almost orange tinge to her underside, however <b>the</b> <b>males</b> have a {{light grey}} tinge to their underside. Females are often bigger than <b>the</b> <b>males</b> in size.|$|R

60|$|To {{return to}} our more {{immediate}} subject. The case stands thus: female fishes, as far as I can learn, never willingly spawn except {{in the presence of}} the males; and <b>the</b> <b>males</b> never fertilise <b>the</b> ova except in the presence of <b>the</b> females. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> fight for <b>the</b> possession of the females. In many species, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> whilst young resemble the females in colour; but when adult become much more brilliant, and retain their colours throughout life. In other species <b>the</b> <b>males</b> become brighter than the females and otherwise more highly ornamented, only during the season of love. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> sedulously court <b>the</b> females, and in one case, as we have seen, take pains in displaying their beauty before them. Can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during their courtship? And this would be the case, unless the females exert some choice and select those males which please or excite them most. If the female exerts such choice, all the above facts on the ornamentation of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> become at once intelligible by the aid of sexual selection.|$|R
