5|$|Controversy {{occurred}} at York Park when, {{in a game}} between St Kilda and Fremantle, the final siren was <b>too</b> <b>quiet</b> to be heard {{by any of the}} umpires; play was restarted in error, and in the subsequent confusion St Kilda levelled the scores. After a protest, the AFL Commission convened and overturned the result, awarding Fremantle the victory. The stadium's sirens have since been replaced, and the old ones will be put on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is <b>too</b> <b>quiet.</b> This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E

2500|$|The Guardian responded {{well to the}} episode, {{labelling}} Capaldi's {{performance as}} [...] "intimidating, bold and unsettling", and praising Ben Wheatley's direction in the episode's tenser moments, calling it [...] "the stuff of true terror and wonderment". Matt Smith's cameo as the Eleventh Doctor was criticised by The Mirror. However, it ultimately labelled the episode [...] "impeccable" [...] and stating that Capaldi [...] "has all the hallmarks of a great Doctor". Michael Hogan while writing for the Telegraph, praised Moffat's writing for second guessing viewers opinions about the new Doctor and for stating clearly {{that there would be}} no flirting for this face. Hogan notes that [...] "the tone seemed different, <b>too,</b> <b>quieter</b> and more thoughtful – less about running down corridors holding hands, more about self-discovery and redemption." [...] Hogan also stated that the script was similar to Sherlock, that Moffat also writes for, and was a bit slow in places, but still combined behind the sofa action with humorous comments about ITV and the Scottish Referendum.|$|R

25|$|The character's {{overseas}} debut, now as Edna Everage, was in {{the early}} 1960s at comedian Peter Cook's nightclub, The Establishment, in London's West End, where she received a poor review from Bamber Gascoigne, then the drama critic for The Spectator. Barry Humphries cites Cook as being instrumental in launching Edna's UK career. While her first appearances at the Establishment Club was a flop, the mousy Edna being <b>too</b> <b>quiet</b> to please that raucous crowd, a 2016 interviewer William Cook saw the early failure as a blessing, so that Humphries spent the sixties as a jobbing actor rather than as a pampered star.|$|E

500|$|... "Falling Over Me" [...] was co-written by Lovato and Jon McLaughlin and {{produced}} by Fields. The song features a [...] "hypnotic" [...] bassline and lyrics about Lovato praying that her crush will notice her affection: [...] "I'm hoping, I'm waiting, I'm praying {{you are the}} one". According to Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times, Lovato's vocals in the song balance [...] "delicacy and force". On the fifth track, [...] "Quiet", Lovato longs for a [...] "communication breakthrough" [...] in an awkward relationship, complaining that [...] "It's <b>too</b> <b>quiet</b> in here". [...] "Catch Me" [...] is an acoustic ballad with a stripped-down production, written by Lovato herself. The song speaks of an unhealthy love connection, with Lovato going on even though she knows [...] "how badly this will hurt me". The seventh track, [...] "Every Time You Lie", is a song with jazz influences and a [...] "jaunty '70s vibe". Kerri Mason of Billboard commented that the song [...] "swings like Maroon 5's brand of radio soul". The song tells about self-respect and not putting up with lies in a relationship. [...] "Got Dynamite" [...] was written by Gary Clark, E. Kidd Bogart and Victoria Horn {{and produced}} by Clark. The song features [...] "ricocheting" [...] synthesizers and a scattering pop punk riff. The lyrics use [...] "violent metaphors" [...] as invitations for a boy to [...] "blow up" [...] Lovato's defenses, with lines such as [...] "Log {{in and try to}} hack me" [...] and [...] "Kick senseless, my defenses".|$|E

[...] "Everyone was <b>too</b> <b>quiet,</b> too compassionate towards children. Then Robert Englund auditioned.

2500|$|There were doubts {{over the}} future of the band when Prior {{announced}} her departure in 1997, but Steeleye continued in a more productive vein than for many years, with Woods as lead singer, releasing Horkstow Grange (1998), and then Bedlam Born (2000). [...] Fans of Steeleye's [...] "rock" [...] element felt that Horkstow Grange was <b>too</b> <b>quiet</b> and folk-oriented, while fans of the band's [...] "folk" [...] element complained that Bedlam Born was too rock-heavy. Woods received considerable criticism from fans, many of whom did not realise that {{she was one of the}} founding members and who compared her singing style unfavourably to Prior's. [...] There was also disagreement among the band about what material to perform; Woods advocated performing old favourites such as [...] "All Around My Hat" [...] and [...] "Alison Gross", while Johnson favoured a set that emphasised their newer material.|$|E
2500|$|Duncan Black {{has shown}} {{that if there is}} only one {{dimension}} on which every individual has a [...] "single-peaked" [...] preference, then all of Arrow's conditions are met by majority rule. Suppose that there is some predetermined linear ordering of the alternative set. An individual's preference is single-peaked with respect to this ordering if he has some special place that he likes best along that line, and his dislike for an alternative grows larger as the alternative goes further away from that spot (i.e., the graph of his utility function has a single peak if alternatives are placed according to the linear ordering on the horizontal axis). [...] For example, if voters were voting on where to set the volume for music, it would be reasonable to assume that each voter had their own ideal volume preference and that as the volume got progressively too loud or <b>too</b> <b>quiet</b> they would be increasingly dissatisfied.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly {{was to be}} hanged on 11 November 1880 at the Melbourne Gaol. Earlier that day, Mr. Castieau, the {{governor}} of the gaol, informed the condemned man that the hour of execution had been fixed at ten o'clock. Kelly's leg-irons were removed, and after a short time he was marched out. He was submissive on the way, and when passing the gaol's flower beds, he remarked [...] "what a nice little garden", but said nothing further until reaching the Press room, where he remained until the arrival of chaplain Dean Donaghy. Accounts differ about Kelly's last words. Some newspaper reporters wrote that his last words were [...] "Such is life", while other newspapers recorded that this was his response when the warden told him of the intended hour of his execution, earlier that day. The Argus wrote that Kelly's last words were, [...] "Ah, well, I suppose it has come to this", as the rope was placed round his neck. According to another account, Kelly intended to make a speech, but [...] "made no audible sound." [...] The warden later wrote that Kelly, when prompted to say his last words, mumbled something that was <b>too</b> <b>quiet</b> to discern.|$|E
2500|$|The England fast bowler John Snow rescued the England first innings {{when he came}} in at 183/7 {{and made}} 73 to hoist the total up to 304. This was Snow's highest Test and equal highest First Class score, but he was {{disappointed}} not to realise his boyhood dream of a century at Lord's when he was caught off a Chandrasekhar googly. India needed 183 to win in the fourth innings when Snow had the opener Ashok Mankad caught by Knott for 8 and India were 21–2 when Sunil Gavaskar was called for a quick single after hitting the ball to mid-wicket. Snow went for the ball and knocked him over, [...] "I could imagine the horror on the faces of everybody watching the game from the committee room at Lord's". They were both uninjured and continued with the game, and Snow tossed Gavaskar's bat back to him. A similar incident had happened in Georgetown in 1967–68 with Clive Lloyd, but the 5'4" [...] Indian received far more sympathy than the 6'4" [...] West Indian who knocked Snow to the ground. From afar the incident had looked much worse and was replayed repeatedly on slow-motion television. A media furore ensued and with press demanding disciplinary action. The replay {{can be seen in the}} Indian episode of the BBC documentary Empire of Cricket and it certainly appears that Snow recklessly barged into the Gavaskar. Many were more angry about the throwing of the bat back than the knocking him over in the first place. At lunch Snow returned to the dressing room and apologised to the chairman of selectors Alec Bedser and promised to do so to Gavaskar when an enraged Mike Griffith charged in and shouted [...] "That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen on the field". Illingworth took him out and Snow waited until he had calmed down before apologising to Gavaskar after lunch. When he later saw the replay he said [...] "Oh well, the scene's been far <b>too</b> <b>quiet</b> without me anyway" [...] and realised he could not avoid being dropped for the Second Test. The game was rained off with India needed 38 runs to win, but England wanting only two wickets for victory.|$|E
2500|$|Snow was {{exhausted}} {{after the long}} tour of Australia and apart from his broken finger he suffered from a strained back and shoulder. He was dropped from the Sussex County team because his [...] "bowling performances, and more especially his fielding have been so lacking in effort that the selection committee had no alternative". However, instead of playing for the Sussex Second XI Snow was declared unfit by his doctor and missed {{the first half of}} the season and the Test series against Pakistan. He recovered to take 4/45 & 7/73 against Essex and was picked for the First Test against India at Lord's.

Snow returned for the Third Test at The Oval and tore off Gavaskar's chain and medallion with a bouncer that zipped under his chin and made him fall over. He bowled the Indian for 6 in the first innings and had him lbw for a duck in the second, but this was not enough to prevent India winning the Test by four wickets and the series with it. It was only the second Test defeat Snow had seen since he had become an England regular in 1966 and ended England's run of 27 Tests without loss.|$|E
