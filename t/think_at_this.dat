500|$|According to biographer Jerry Oppenheimer, her {{ubiquitous}} sunglasses {{are actually}} corrective lenses, since she suffers from deteriorating vision {{as her father}} did. A former colleague he interviewed recalls trying on her Wayfarers in her absence and getting dizzy. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point they've become, you know, really armour," [...] Wintour herself told 60 Minutes correspondent Morley Safer, explaining that they allow her to keep her reactions to a show private. As she rebounded {{from the end of}} her marriage and the turnover in the magazine's editorial staff, a fellow editor and friend noted that [...] "she's not hiding behind her glasses anymore. Now she's having fun again." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on 13 November, Angus Young stated that the band had experienced problems with Rudd {{earlier in the year}} when recording Rock or Bust, and that his situation had taken the band by surprise. Rudd had also missed video and photo shoots, and with reference to Rudd's future in the band, Young added, [...] "So, at this stage, it's a pretty tough call for us." [...] He also said the band would continue: [...] "He's got to sort himself out I <b>think...</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point it's kind of a question mark. But if we're touring, there will be a drummer in place, put it that way." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} lyrically {{consumed}} with sorrow and {{uncertainty about the}} world. Entertainment Weekly {{described it as a}} concept album based on a dying relationship, a [...] "self-meditation on romantic decay." [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point in our career, we are better musicians and we've evolved our way of thinking as far as songwriting", DeLonge told Billboard in reference to the more mature lyricism. Hoppus, in his interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, described the lyrics as the most personal he had written to that point. While past recordings tended to meditate on feelings from high school, the band felt it was akin to a safety net and desired to write about [...] "what's going on [...] right now." [...] Lyrics continued to be autobiographical, but the band took more time than usual on their writing. DeLonge would routinely rewrite his sections upwards of four times.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his primary defeat, Mfume was {{believed}} to be considering running for mayor of Baltimore in 2007, though he had not publicly expressed interest in such a run. On November 13, 2006, Mfume told a Baltimore-area radio station that [...] "I don't have any plans to run for mayor. She 's worked for and deserves an opportunity to lead. ... I want her to succeed. I want the city to be united. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point we owe her at least the opportunity to try to lead it." [...] In late 2010, he was again rumored to be considering a run in the Baltimore mayoral election, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{interview}} with AfterBuzz TV following the Top 5 elimination show, Caleb Johnson made offensive remarks about his fans who tweet him song suggestions. [...] " [...] gives access {{to a bunch of}} retards to talk to me," [...] Caleb said. [...] "I don't really enjoy having to see somebody telling me what song I have to sing. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point of the competition, I can pick and choose my own songs and represent me. I don't need 10,000 people saying, 'You should sing this, you should sing that. Listen to me!' Fortunately, guys, I'm going to listen to myself, {{whether you like it or}} not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amos' {{brother died}} in a car crash in 2005 and it is widely {{believed}} that the song that closes the album, Our New Year, deals with her own thoughts and feelings behind his tragic demise. However, when asked, Amos chose to keep the meaning of the song private, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time of year you think of people that might not be in your life anymore or who’ve left the planet. I get really nostalgic at Christmas, and memories of other times with other people who you might not have heard from in a long time can cross your mind." [...] Finally, when asked pointedly if she had anyone in mind when writing the song, Amos responded definitively, [...] "I did. But, we’ll leave it there." [...] "People get nostalgic and you have to acknowledge that there are people that aren’t with you anymore, so there’s a song that does that. But," [...] Amos insisted, [...] "for the most part, for a Tori record, it’s pretty upbeat." ...|$|E
500|$|The closing chorus {{employs the}} third stanza of the chorale, [...] "" [...] (<b>Think,</b> Lord, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time on Your office), as a cantus firmus in the soprano.

50|$|UK Jive is the twenty-third studio album by the English rock group, the Kinks, {{released}} in 1989.

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the government's {{response}} to the incident, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the U.S. government has been [...] "very consistently critical {{of the human rights}} situation in Uzbekistan, we're very concerned about the outbreak of violence in Andijan, in particular the escape of prisoners, including possibly members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, an organization we consider a terrorist organization. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point we're looking to all the parties involved to exercise restraint to avoid any unnecessary loss of life." [...] At another point Boucher said, [...] "It's becoming increasingly clear that very large numbers of civilians were killed by the indiscriminate use of force by Uzbek forces. There needs to be a credible and a transparent accounting to establish the facts of the matter of what occurred in Andijon. At the same time I think {{it is clear that the}} episode began by an armed attack on the prison and on other government facilities. There are reports of hostage-taking and other claims that should be investigated. Nothing justified such acts of violence." [...] Craig Murray, the ambassador of the United Kingdom to Uzbekistan, criticized the US government's position, calling it a [...] "sickening response." [...] George Soros, chairman of the Open Society Institute which actively promoted the color revolutions, called the Andijan massacre [...] "one of the worst political crimes committed in the 21st century." ...|$|E

'Only reflect for one moment,' said Nicholas; 'granting, for an instant, that it's {{likely he}} {{is alive and}} {{wandering}} about a lonely place like this, so {{far removed from the}} public road, do you <b>think</b> that <b>at</b> <b>this</b> distance of time you could possibly know that man again?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Memorandum, “Will.” Now, my dear,’ said Mr. Grewgious, {{referring}} to his notes, disposing of ‘Marriage’ with his pencil, and taking a paper from his pocket; ‘although. I have before possessed you with the contents of your father’s will, I <b>think</b> it right <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time to leave a certified copy of it in your hands.

6000|$|... "I {{should be}} so glad!" [...] said Rose. [...] "What a lovely little thing she is! I hope she'll like it. I wanted to get up {{something}} pretty for her. I <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time of the year, lawn teas are a little variety." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, words rather fail me," [...] {{answered}} Father Brown. [...] "I cannot <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> {{moment of}} {{anything in this}} world that would interest me less.

60|$|I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> moment {{poor old}} Tuppy must {{have got a}} sudden touch of cramp.

6000|$|... "I've {{just been}} telling him," [...] said Sally, {{welcoming}} this ally, [...] "I <b>think</b> it's absurd <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage {{of things for}} him to put on an enormous revue..." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very kind of her! Well, dearest Myra, you and Lord Roehampton {{have much}} to <b>think</b> of <b>at</b> <b>this</b> anxious moment. Let this matter drop.

When I {{took the}} deck again at eight, I asked that serang {{whether there was}} {{anything}} about; and I understood him to say {{there was no more}} as when I went below at six.

6000|$|... "She is charming," [...] the Prince declared. [...] "I {{am looking}} forward to my visit immensely. I think I am a little weary of London. A visit to the country seems to me most delightful. They tell me, too, that your spring gardens are wonderful. What London suffers from, I <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time of the year, is a lack of flowers. We want {{something}} to remind us that the spring is coming, besides these occasional gleams of blue sky and very occasional bursts of sunshine." ...|$|E
6000|$|But I <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time especially, {{there is}} so much to be {{considered}} in the necessity the country will be under of having money, and the necessity of justice it is always under, to consider the physical and moral wants of the poor man's home, as to justify a man in saying: [...] "I must wait a little, all taxes are more or less objectionable, and so no doubt are these, but we must have some; and I have not made up my mind that all these things that are mixed up together are taxes on knowledge in reality." ...|$|E

6000|$|For {{the next}} forty minutes, with never {{a glance at}} the book, King paid out the glorious hexameters (and King could read Latin as though it were alive), Winton hauling them in and coiling them away behind him as {{trimmers}} in a telegraph-ship's hold coil away deep-sea cable. King broke from the Aeneid to the Georgics and back again, pausing now and then to translate some specially loved line or to dwell on the treble-shot texture of the ancient fabric. He did not allude to the coming interview with Mullins except at the last, when he said, 'I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> juncture, Pater, I need not ask you for the precise significance of atqui sciebat quae sibi barbarus tortor.' ...|$|E
60|$|The soul of Miss Calthea Rose was now {{filled with}} one burning purpose, {{and that was}} to banish from the Squirrel Inn that {{obtrusive}} and utterly obnoxious collegiate nurse-maid who had so shamelessly admitted a desire for surgical research in connection with the care of an infant. It was of no use for Miss Calthea to <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> moment of her plans in regard to Mr. Tippengray, nor indeed of anything but this one absorbing object. Until she had rid herself of Ida Mayberry she could expect to do nothing that she wished to do. Leaving Mr. Tippengray to the quiet enjoyment of his agitations, Miss Calthea and Mrs. Petter immediately set off to find Mrs. Cristie.|$|E
60|$|April 4.--Wrote {{two pages}} in the morning. Then went to Ashestiel in the sociable, with Colonel Ferguson. Found my cousin Russell settled kindly to his {{gardening}} and his projects. He seems to have brought home with him the enviable talent of being interested and happy in his own place. Ashestiel looks worst, I <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> period of the year; but is a beautiful place in summer, where I passed nine happy years. Did I ever pass unhappy years anywhere? None that I remember, save those at the High School, which I thoroughly detested {{on account of the}} confinement. I disliked serving in my father's office, too, from the same hatred to restraint. In other respects, I have had unhappy days--unhappy weeks--even, on one or two occasions, unhappy months; but Fortune's finger has never been able to play a dirge on me for a quarter of a year together.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{memorial}} for Bramble, Captain Harvey Crombie {{said of the}} crew: [...] "They had braved difficulties and perils probably unparalleled {{in the annals of}} the British Navy, and calls upon their courage and endurance were constant, but they never failed.
