5|$|The next day, Gawain {{leaves for}} the Green Chapel with the girdle wound twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight {{sharpening}} an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds {{the full force of}} his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.|$|E

Nearly one-third of the 1300 assembled delegates signed a petition calling for Debs that Stedman circulated. His effort was short-circuited by a <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supporters of William Jennings Bryan, however, when the gas lights were shut out on the convention. The following day a statement by Debs was read to the convention indicating that he had no desire to run for president and the bid was over, leaving Stedman to support Bryan in the 1896 campaign.|$|E

500|$|A <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail was {{released}} in February 1976 and was a commercial and critical success for the band. The album reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. The title track {{was released}} as a single, though it did not chart. In June, the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Institute for selling over 100,000 copies which helped the band clear the £400,000 of debt (equivalent to £ in [...] ). they owed when Gabriel left. For {{the first time in}} their career Genesis filmed promotional videos for their songs, including [...] "A <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail" [...] and [...] "Robbery, Assault and Battery". Before the upcoming tour, Collins sought a drummer he felt comfortable about playing drums while he sang; he chose Bill Bruford who offered to do the job. From March to July 1976, Genesis performed across North America and Europe with the A <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail tour, to enthusiastic crowds. Collins adopted a more humorous rapport with the audience, unlike Gabriel's theatrical approach, which was successful. The shows in Glasgow and Stafford were filmed for their concert film , released in cinemas in February 1977 as a double bill with White Rock.|$|E
500|$|Members of the {{original}} line-up were exposed to classical and church music as well as rock artists of the 1960s, particularly the Beatles. Gabriel's vocal style was influenced by Otis Redding and other Stax artists. In their early years, Genesis' music combined elements of the pop, folk, and psychedelic genres. Several songs developed during Phillips' time in the band originated on 12-string guitars, often with unconventional tunings. By the 1970s, the group began to include fantasy and surreal elements in their lyrics, such as [...] "The Musical Box". Nursery Cryme {{marks the first time}} electric instruments were used more extensively. A <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail marked a return to the band's roots with acoustic passages and songs inspired by fantasy.|$|E

500|$|In May 1977 Genesis {{released}} Spot the Pigeon, {{an extended}} play of three tracks left off Wind & Wuthering. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. It {{was the final}} Genesis release before Hackett left the group. He had been writing more material {{on his own and}} found it increasingly difficult to contribute more of his ideas within a group context. He wished to embark on a solo career and [...] "take the risk in order to find out just how good I was on my own". News of Hackett's departure coincided with the band's double live album Seconds Out, recorded in Paris on the A <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail and Wind & Wuthering tours and released in October 1977. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US.|$|E
500|$|Ward {{does not}} believe this a <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye {{resulting}} from loss of perspective towards the high reaches of the panel. Instead he {{sees it as a}} subtle reference to the iconography and mythology of the Book of Genesis' Tree of life, which he describes here as [...] "reborn in Christ's death". He does acknowledge the subtlety of the illusion, and the fact that neither of the two well known near copies include the motif. The idea of flowers shown as if sprouting {{from the top of the}} cross may have been borrowed from Masaccio's c.1426 Crucifixion, where flowers are placed on the upper portion of the vertical beam of the cross. Ward concludes than van Eyck took the idea even further by showing the flowers emanating from another source, and sought to depict the actual moment where the tree of life is reborn and [...] "the cross comes to life and sprouts flowers as one watches".|$|E
500|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} {{search for a}} replacement, Collins took over as lead singer, while the group gained popularity in the UK and the US. Following A <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail and Wind & Wuthering (both 1976), Hackett left the band, reducing it to a core of Banks, Rutherford, and Collins. Genesis had their first UK top ten and US top 30 single in 1978 with [...] "Follow You Follow Me" [...] and the group continued to gain commercial success with Duke (1980), Abacab (1981), and Genesis (1983), reaching a peak with Invisible Touch (1986), which featured five US top five singles. Its title track reached No. 1 in the US. After the follow up, We Can't Dance (1991) and related tour, Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career. Banks and Rutherford recruited Ray Wilson for Calling All Stations (1997), but a lack of success in the US led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the [...] in 2007, and together with Gabriel and Hackett were interviewed for the BBC documentary [...] in 2014.|$|E

500|$|Following the Lamb tour, Hackett {{recorded}} his first solo album Voyage of the Acolyte {{as he felt}} unsure that Genesis would survive following Gabriel's departure. He reconvened with the remaining group members in London in July 1975. Collins' idea of continuing as an instrumental group was quickly rejected by the group as {{they thought it would}} become boring. Rehearsals for A <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail took place in Acton where material was quickly written and with little effort; most of [...] "Dance on a Volcano" [...] and [...] "Squonk" [...] was put together in the first three days. Recording began in October 1975 at Trident Studios with Hentschel as producer. As a replacement singer had not been found, the band decided to record the album without vocals and audition singers as they went. They placed an anonymous advertisement in Melody Maker for [...] "a singer for a Genesis-type group" [...] which received around 400 replies. Collins proceeded to teach selected applicants the songs; Mick Strickland was invited into the studio to sing, but the backing tracks were in a key outside of his natural range and the band decided not to work with him. Having failed to find a suitable vocalist, Collins went in the studio and attempted to sing [...] "Squonk". His performance was well received by the band, and they decided that he should be their new lead vocalist. Collins then sang on the remaining tracks.|$|E
500|$|In September 1976, Genesis {{relocated}} to Relight Studios in Hilvarenbeek, The Netherlands with Hentschel to record Wind & Wuthering. It {{was put together}} in {{a short amount of}} time and a considerable amount of material was written beforehand, of which the most suitable songs were picked for development. Rutherford spoke of the band's conscious effort to distance themselves from songs inspired by fantasy, something that their past albums [...] "were full of". The band spent roughly six weeks writing the album with a basic form of each track put down in twelve days. Additional recording and production work was done at Trident Studios that October. Hackett, having already released a solo album, enjoyed the greater amount of control over the recording process that working within a group could not provide. He felt his songs, including [...] "Please Don't Touch" [...] which he later released on his second album Please Don't Touch!, were rejected from the final track order in favour of material that Banks, in particular, had put forward. Collins spoke of the situation, [...] "We just wanted to use what we agreed was the strongest material, irrespective of who wrote it". Wind & Wuthering was released in December 1976 and reached No. 6 the UK and No. 26 in the US. Rutherford's track, [...] "Your Own Special Way", became its sole single and went to No. 43 in the UK. Its B-side is [...] "It's Yourself", originally intended for A <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail.|$|E
500|$|The 2010–11 season marked an {{expanded}} focus on Kesler's offensive role. He began the season {{playing on the}} power play with the Sedins, {{as part of an}} effort by the Canucks coaching staff to [...] "load up" [...] their first power play unit. Switching from being the primary puck-controller on the second unit, he moved to the front of the net, screening the goalie and tipping pucks in. The off-season acquisition of defensive specialist Manny Malhotra also liberated Kesler from a large portion of his defensive duties, such as playing against opposing team's top forwards in a shutdown role. Two months into the campaign, Kesler notched his 100th career NHL goal in a 4–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche on November 24, 2010. He later earned his first NHL career hat-trick, scoring all three of the Canucks' goals in a 3–2 overtime win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on December 15. Nearly a month later, he recorded a second hat trick against the Edmonton Oilers in a 6–1 win. On January 11, 2011, Kesler was named to his first NHL All-Star Game; he was one of three Canucks along with Daniel and Henrik Sedin. Kesler was chosen to be an alternate captain alongside Washington Capitals defenseman Mike Green representing Eric Staal's team; he went without a point as Team Staal was defeated by Team Nicklas Lidstrom 11–10. Prior to the Canucks' final home game of the regular season on April 7, 2011, Kesler was presented with the team's Most Exciting Player Award, as voted by the fans. Playing the Minnesota Wild that night, he went on to record his third hat <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season, reaching the 40-goal plateau, as the Canucks won 5–0.|$|E
