50|$|In late 2012, the I‑495 HOT (high {{occupancy}} toll) lanes in Virginia {{started to}} support E‑ZPass Flex transponders. These work similarly to regular transponders, but let the driver switch between HOV and toll-paying modes. When a transponder is switched to HOV mode (with {{three or more}} passengers in the vehicle), it is read by the HOT lane's <b>toll</b> <b>equipment</b> but no toll is charged. E-ZPass Flex also works like a standard E-ZPass on all other toll roads where E-ZPass is accepted, regardless {{of the position of}} the switch.|$|E
50|$|Backing up {{in front}} of a toll station, backing out of a toll lane, and leaving the vehicle in the {{vicinity}} of a toll station are offences punishable by fines of up to EUR 6.000, driving-license suspension for up to two years, and confiscation of the vehicle for up to three months. In case a driver has selected an incorrect lane in a toll station (for instance, a Telepass-only lane if the vehicle is not equipped with a Telepass OBU), or if the <b>toll</b> <b>equipment</b> malfunctions, the driver must call for assistance using the red Assistenza button.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the Portuguese {{motorways}} are tolled, {{although there}} are also some non-tolled highways, mostly in urban areas, like those of Greater Lisbon and Greater Oporto. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Government of Portugal created seven shadow toll concessions, the SCUT toll ( [...] , no costs for the user). In those concessions it were included more than 900 km of motorways and highways, some of them already built, others which were built in the following years. However, due to economical and political reasons, the shadow toll concept was abolished between 2010 and 2011, with electronic <b>toll</b> <b>equipment</b> being installed in these motorways, to charge their users. Having only electronic tolls, former SCUT motorways can now only be used by vehicles equipped with electronic payment devices or vehicles registered in the system.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade much {{progress}} has been made in defining & measuring the external costs of transport. As the cost of <b>tolling</b> <b>equipment</b> falls, the set of realistic policy options to internalise these externalities will continue to grow. This will determine the research and policy agenda. We make three points. Firstly, empirical work is still necessary to better identify marginal external costs, including congestion, accident and environmental costs. Secondly, any assessment of policy options should treat externalities simultaneously. The use of pricing instruments and emissions standards are discussed within this framework. Thirdly, we emphasise the role of government. Designing the optimal road-pricing institutions requires consideration of horizontal and vertical tax competition, while double-dividend arguments are central to the question of securing public support.

50|$|Many {{other cities}} could {{not yet be}} {{included}} as they {{did not yet have}} the necessary <b>toll</b> switching <b>equipment</b> to handle incoming calls automatically on their circuits. Other cities still had either a mixture of local number lengths or were all still six-digit numbers; Montreal, Quebec and Toronto, Ontario in Canada, for example, had a mix of six- and seven-digit numbers from 1951 to 1957, and did not have DDD until 1958. Whitehorse, Yukon, had seven-digit numbers from 1965, but the necessary switching equipment was not in place locally until 1972.|$|R
50|$|The Southwestern Bell Telephone Company {{constructed}} a two-story building in 1924. The structure, which encompassed 18726 sq ft, was {{to house the}} main dial equipment for the new automatic dial equipment {{that the company had}} introduced to Tulsa in November 1924. The architecture of the building was Gothic Style. In 1930, the company added four floors {{to the top of the}} 1924 structure to house its divisional offices and <b>toll</b> terminal <b>equipment</b> needed for the underground cable that connected Tulsa with Oklahoma City.

50|$|SunPass {{portable}} (hard case) transponders can {{be transferred}} between vehicles without damaging the transponder. The original transponders operate on battery power to communicate with <b>toll</b> barrier <b>equipment</b> and to operate audible and visual indications of toll paid, toll low, battery low, and so forth. The Type IIe transponder, {{an updated version of}} the SunPass portable, requires no batteries, but does not have indicator lights or audible beeps. SunPass portable transponders are sold for $19.99 to customers who prefer the portability offered by the transponder. Customers must establish a minimum opening account of $10.00 to fund their tolls. Unused toll fees are only refunded if the user closes the account or takes advantage of a money-back guarantee.|$|R
50|$|The OGS system {{involves}} the fixing of the tag {{on the inside}} of the vehicle's windshield, mostly behind the rear-view mirror. However, at some car brands, the tag has to be attached on the windshield's inside bottom. At the toll plaza, the vehicle has to drive to a toll booth on the OGS-only assigned lane. OGS lanes are always leftmost passing lanes, and they are designated at some distance before the toll plaza. However, there are also additional OGS booths on the right side of toll plazas dedicated to heavy vehicles. The booth is marked with OGS-sign at the top. A flashing green light at the top signals its usability. The battery-driven tag communicates with the reader device built into the <b>toll</b> collection <b>equipment</b> at the <b>toll</b> booth as the vehicle passes through. It is not needed that the vehicle stops. However, a speed limit of 30 km/h is recommended to avoid accidents before the booth.|$|R
50|$|In August 1992, the RMA {{closed the}} bridge for 18 months to {{complete}} extensive renovation work, which included widening the existing lanes, installing new <b>toll</b> booths and <b>equipment</b> {{on the north}} end of the bridge, and improving safe access for bicycles and pedestrians. The bridge reopened in October 1993. The toll was increased again in 1998 to 25 cents. In 2008, the RMA increased the tolls on all of its roads, bringing the Boulevard Bridge to its current rate of 35 cents. Despite the renovation work in the early 1990s, weight restrictions on the bridge limit vehicles to under 7,500 lbs.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, ISTHA made a {{strategic}} decision {{to expand and}} improve the tollway system instead of converting the roads to freeways. It adopted a $6.3 billion Congestion Relief Program. Under the program, the main toll plazas were rebuilt to have open road tolling, so that drivers with transponders would drive at normal speeds under <b>toll</b> collecting <b>equipment</b> instead of stopping to pay tolls. The toll plazas were relocated {{to the side of}} the road to handle vehicles without transponders. The plan also included rebuilding and widening many of the toll roads, including most of the original portion of I-88 and the northern and southern sections of I-294. I-355 was extended south of I-55 to connect to I-80 in New Lenox, a distance of , in order to serve fast-growing areas of Will County. The project also includes adding an interchange between the Tri-State Tollway and I-57. These improvements were financed by long-term revenue bonds that require the system to remain as toll roads until the bonds are repaid in 2034.|$|R

50|$|Toll {{roads in}} some form have existed since antiquity, {{collecting}} their fees from passing travellers on foot, wagon or horseback; but their prominence increased {{with the rise of}} the automobile, and many modern tollways charge fees for motor vehicles exclusively. The amount of the toll usually varies by vehicle type, weight, or number of axles, with freight trucks often charged higher rates than cars. Tolls are collected at points known as toll booths, toll houses, plazas, stations, bars, or gates. Some toll collection points are unmanned and the user deposits money in a machine which opens the gate once the correct toll has been paid. To cut costs and minimise time delay many tolls today are collected by some form of automatic or electronic <b>toll</b> collection <b>equipment</b> which communicates electronically with a toll payer's transponder. Some electronic toll roads also maintain a system of toll booths so people without transponders can still pay the toll, but many newer roads now use automatic number plate recognition to bill drivers who use the road without a transponder, and some older toll roads are being upgraded with such systems.|$|R

The Army has also taken steps to restructure its forces before implementing its longer term transformation to the Future Combat System. To support ongoing operations and prepare for the future, the Army has embarked on four key initiatives: (1) restructuring from a division-based force to a modular brigade-based force, (2) expanding the Army by adding about 74, 000 people and creating new units, (3) repairing, replacing, and recapitalizing new equipment through its reset program, and (4) replacing equipment borrowed from its pre-positioned equipment sets around the world. Since 2004, Congress has provided {{billions of dollars to}} support the Army's equipping needs. GAO has issued many reports on the Army's efforts to equip modular units, expand the Army, reset equipment, and manage and replace prepositioned equipment. This statement, which draws largely on these reports, will address (1) the equipment-related cost of these initiatives, and (2) the management challenges facing the Army and the actions needed to improve its implementation of these initiatives.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} MASTER (MAnaging Speeds of Traffic on European Roads) was to produce {{information}} that can be cited in the preparation of national and EU decisions concerning speed management and speed control equipment standards. For this purpose, the project looked for answers to three key questions: 1) What are acceptable ranges of speeds? 2) What are the key factors influencing drivers’ choice of speed? 3) What are the best speed management tools and strategies? The results of the project are documented in 26 reports: 12 deliverables and 14 working papers. The objective of the this report is to present recommendations for speed management strategies and policies. Recommendations for Speed Management Measures, Tools and Policy 1. Speed limits on roads of similar classification in different European countries should be harmonised so that road users’ expectations are consistent with respect to correct choice of speed irrespective of previous driving experiences in their home country. These speed limits should reflect the socially desirable speeds determined for example {{with the help of the}} MASTER framework. 2. European guidelines are needed for application of speed management measures and tools on residential and main roads in urban areas and on rural mixed-traffic roads. This would promote consistent and cost-effective speed management both on urban roads, where a wider range of potential alternatives is available and on rural roads where the possibilities for using low-cost physical measures are more limited. 3. Preparations for the introduction of compulsory adaptive speed limiters should be started. Adaptive speed limiters automatically prevent speeding by adjusting speeds according to the prevailing speed limit. The first step could be large scale field experiments in urban areas in different countries. Urban roads are the best choice for the first application because on such roads their public acceptability is highest and potential negative effects e. g. in the form of behavioural adaptation are smallest. 4. Redesign of European roads according to the principles of self-explaining roads should include hierarchical categorisation into a limited number of categories so that each level has a distinct set of characteristics that is clearly different from that of other levels. A reduced and simplified road hierarchy would promote the correct choice of speed for each road type and have other positive effects on road safety by assisting correct anticipation of behaviour of other road users. 5. Automated speed enforcement should be developed further and taken into wider use. In some countries legislative changes are needed so that the owner of the vehicle can be held responsible for speeding offences. In addition, a common standard could be developed for identification of vehicles by an electronic device. Speeding vehicles are currently identified from photographs which often requires laborious manual work. Electronic identification devices could be used also for collection of parking fees and road <b>tolls.</b> Furthermore, <b>equipment</b> that is currently used only for traffic monitoring could be used for enforcement purposes (e. g. induction loops and data transfer equipment). 6. The difference between the effects of speed on social costs and on private costs should be reduced, for example by internalising external costs (e. g. accident costs and environmental costs). This would encourage drivers to choose speeds that are preferable not only from their private standpoint but also from society’s point of view. 7. Information and publicity campaigns regarding the impacts of speed are needed, with the purpose of giving neutral and objective information about all impacts of speed, with due attention to the difference between private and social costs. Such information could increase the public acceptance of speed restrictions that are justified from society’s viewpoint, but decision-makers will still need to recognise that popularity is not necessarily a good criterion for speed management policies. 8. The highest possible speed of vehicles should be limited to the highest speed limit on motorways and speed limits on motorways should be harmonised across Europe...|$|R
