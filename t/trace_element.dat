30|$|The {{geological}} {{setting of}} Heidaigou mine {{has been reported}} (Dai et al. 2006 c). Production samples were used to study the coal’s mineral composition. The distributions, occurrence and removability of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> from No. 6 coal were determined using float-sink experiments, petrological and statistical methods in this study. Correlation analysis was conducted to study the relationship among the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> and between the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> and the maceral groups, the ash content and the sulfur content. The theoretical content of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in the macerals and minerals were then calculated using linear equations and the organic affinities of the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> are discussed. The removabilities of the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> were determined to provide guidance for the clean and environmentally-friendly use of Heidaigou coal.|$|R
30|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in tooth enamel was determined for 38 extracted human teeth using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The following <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> were detected: Al, K, Mg, S, Na, Zn, Si, B, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se and Ti. Simple and stepwise multiple regression {{was used to}} identify the correlations between <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> concentration in enamel and its crystallographic structure, hardness, resistance to crack propagation, shade lightness and carbonate content. The presence of some <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in enamel was correlated with the size (Pb, Ti, Mn) and lattice parameters (Se, Cr, Ni) of apatite nanocrystals. Some <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> such as Ti was significantly correlated with tooth crystallographic structure and consequently with hardness and shade lightness. We conclude {{that the presence of}} <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in enamel could influence its physical properties.|$|R

40|$|Coal {{preparation}} {{is widely regarded}} as a cost effective method for reducing the amounts of potentially hazardous air pollutant precursors (HAPPs) that occur as <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in the run-of-mine coals. Unfortunately, many existing coal preparation plants are inefficient in removing <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> because of poor circuit design and inadequate liberation of coal and mineral matter. These problems are often difficult to correct in the absence of characterization data regarding the mineralogical association and washability of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in run-of-mine coals. Therefore, the first step in removing the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> through coal {{preparation is}} to characterize the modes of association for <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in a coal seam. The purpose of this project was to link the occurrence of specific <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> to the mineralogy and washability characteristics of different eastern U. S. coal seams.

In humans, selenium is a <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the trek}} found archaeological {{artifacts}} related to 19th-century Europeans and undisturbed disarticulated human remains, Beattie {{was disappointed that}} more remains were not found. Examining the bones of Franklin crewmen, he noted areas of pitting and scaling often found in cases of Vitamin C deficiency, the cause of scurvy. After returning to Edmonton, he compared notes from the survey with James Savelle, an Arctic archaeologist, and noticed skeletal patterns suggesting cannibalism. Seeking information about the Franklin crew's health and diet, he sent bone samples to the Alberta Soil and Feed Testing Laboratory for <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> analysis and assembled another team to visit King William Island. The analysis would find an unexpected level of 226parts per million (ppm) of lead in the crewman's bones, which was 10times higher than the control samples, taken from Inuit skeletons from the same geographic area, of 26–36ppm.|$|E

The modes of occurrence of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> were discussed by correlation analysis and the inferred concentrations of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in organic matters and minerals were then calculated based on linear regression.

5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential <b>trace</b> <b>element,</b> although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E
5|$|Although {{selenium}} is {{an essential}} <b>trace</b> <b>element,</b> it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis. This 400µg Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous shale) have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded.|$|E
5|$|Copper is an {{essential}} <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper {{at a level of}} about 1.4 to 2.1mg per kg of body mass. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5mg a day, vs. about 1mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.|$|E

We then consider the solubility (as a surrogate for bioavailability) of the various elements. We consider briefly the sources, atmospheric transport and transformations of these elements and how this results in strong spatial deposition gradients. Solubility of the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> also varies systematically between elements, reflecting their sources and cycling, and for some <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> there are also systematic gradients in solubility related to dust loading.

30|$|The {{geochemistry}} of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in coals is {{an important}} part of coal science. The scientific evaluations of concentrations of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in coals are the solid foundations of evaluation the environmental impacts on harmful elements and the utilization of valuable elements for industry (Reed et al. 2001; Bai 2003; Dai et al. 2005, 2012). The modes of occurrence of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> include two aspects: one is concerned with the concentration and distribution of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in minerals and macerals, which may in turn influence the behavior of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in coal preparation; the other is concerned with how the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> occur within their carriers (e.g. organically-bonded, micro-fine minerals, occurrence in an adsorbed state), which may of importance of the behavior of the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in coal conversion and utilization processes. Identification of the modes of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in coal is limited by the heterogeneity of the mineral and organic components, and only broad interpretations can usually be made. Indirect analytical techniques,such as float-sink methods, single component analysis, sequential chemical extraction (SCEE), low temperature ashing combined with XRD (LTA-XRD), and various statistical methods, do not really provide direct evidence of the distribution of <b>trace</b> <b>elements.</b> Other techniques, such as microprobe (electron probe, ion probe and X-ray probe) and spectroscopy methods (e.g. X-ray absorption fine structure spectrum (XAFS)) are time consuming for quantitative analysis of the samples as a whole. The results from different analytical methods may also contradict each other and even so the understanding developed may have low confidence levels (Finkelman 1994). The macerals and minerals in coal, however, combine to host the various <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in coal, and thus it may be possible to identify the distributions of particular elements and discuss the possible combinations involved.|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact {{resulting from the}} release of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> during coal combustion {{is an important issue}} for the coal-fired electric utility industry. <b>Trace</b> <b>elements</b> exit the combustor by partitioning between the flue gas and the fly ash particles. A comprehensive study has been conducted to investigate the mechanisms governing the partitioning of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> during pulverized coal combustion. The behavior of seven <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> (arsenic, selenium, antimony, cobalt, cesium, thorium, and cerium) in six pulverized coals were studied under commercially relevant conditions in a well-described laboratory combustion environment. The partitioning of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> is governed by the extent of volatilization during combustion, the form of occurrence in the flue gas, and the mechanisms controlling vapor-to-solid phase transformation to fly ash particle surfaces. The most common vapor-to-solid phase partitioning mechanism for semi-volatile <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> is reaction with active fly ash surfaces. <b>Trace</b> <b>elements</b> that form oxy-anions upon volatilization (e. g. arsenic, selenium, antimony) will react with active calcium and iron cation fly ash surface sites. <b>Trace</b> <b>elements</b> that form simple oxides upon volatilization (e. g. cobalt, cesium) will react with active aluminum oxy-anion fly ash surface sites. The maximum combustion temperature affects the availability of active calcium and iron surface sites but not aluminum sites. Sulfur inhibits the reactivity of oxy-anions with iron surface sites. For coals with high sulfur contents (> 1 wt % as SO₂), volatilized <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> that form oxy-anions will partition by reaction with calcium surface sites if sufficient sites are available. For coals with low sulfur contents, volatilized <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> that form oxy-anions, will partition by reaction with iron surface sites. Volatilized <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> that form oxy-anions will not partition by reaction if the coal sulfur content is high and the calcium content is low (< 3 wt% as CaO). Transition metals (e. g. cobalt) may form simple oxides, oxy-anions or both upon volatilization. An appreciable fraction of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> with limited volatility (e. g. cobalt, thorium, cerium, cesium) will volatilize. These will partition back to the solid phase by homogeneous nucleation or surface reaction depending upon the post-combustion conditions present...|$|R
