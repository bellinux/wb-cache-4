The {{main objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the impact of using GIS and 2. 5 D modelling in automating the process of determining view factors for CAMA modelling.

The two terrain surfaces are assessed for accuracy by using the <b>Town</b> <b>Survey</b> Marks (TSM) height data...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1850s the Archer brothers, William and Charles, {{were the first}} to exploit the {{pastoral}} prospects of the Rockhampton region following favourable reports from the explorers Ludwig Leichhardt and Thomas Mitchell a decade earlier.

The buildings in the area are also subject to storms and other climatic extremes.|$|R
