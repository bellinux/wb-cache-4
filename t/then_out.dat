Short appealed to Masterson, who contacted Earp. On May 31, 1883, Earp and Josephine went with Bat Masterson, Johnny Millsap, Shotgun John Collins, Texas Jack Vermillion, and Johnny Green to Dodge City to help Short.|$|E
5|$|Most comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies with {{elongated}} elliptical orbits that take them {{close to the}} Sun for {{a part of their}} orbit and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder. Comets are often classified according to the length of their orbital periods: The longer the period the more elongated the ellipse.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} weir and {{sluice gate}} servicing the paper mill was built about 1852. The tunnel excavated {{from the third}} chamber to the ninth chamber and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> to daylight was dug in 1974–1975 by ex-coal miners from the Radstock area. The show cave was further extended in 2015 by excavating a tunnel from the ninth chamber to the 20th chamber.|$|E

5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the evolution of the tetrapod limb from fins in lobe-finned fishes is related to expression of the HOXD13 gene or the loss of the proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2, which are involved in fish fin development. Robot simulations suggest that the necessary nervous circuitry for walking evolved from the nerves governing swimming, utilizing the sideways oscillation of the body with the limbs primarily functioning as anchoring points and providing limited thrust. This type of movement, as well as changes to the pectoral girdle are similar to those seen in the fossil record can be induced in bichirs by raising <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of water.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match against South Africa, Healy was {{elevated}} two positions to No. 7. Coming in upon {{the fall of}} Cameron, her partner Sarah Elliott was then run out without further addition to the score. Healy hit one boundary and was <b>then</b> <b>out</b> for 8 from 6 balls at 7/151. Her dismissal {{was part of a}} sudden collapse as Australia lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. Healy did not make a dismissal as Australia completed a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Healy came in at 6/111 and hit 12 from 8 balls, before being caught from the final ball of the innings as Australia finished on 7/133. She had put on 22 runs in 16 balls with Sthalekar. She caught Deandra Dottin from the bowling of Perry for a golden duck as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten {{at the top of their}} quartet.|$|E

She was <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of service until 2 August when she sailed from Sunderland, County Durham on a voyage {{that would take}} her to Freetown, Cape Town, Durban, Aden, Suez, Port Said, Alexandria, Beirut and Haifa, which was reached on 20 December. Hopestar {{returned}} to the United Kingdom via Port Said, Suez, Aden, Mauritius, Durban and Freetown. She arrived at Southend-on-Sea on 20 April 1942. She sailed a week later on a voyage that would take her to New York, Key West, Trinidad, Cape Town, Durban and Bombay, India, where she arrived on 28 October 1942.|$|E

25|$|In close/narrow-angle, the iridocorneal {{angle is}} {{completely}} closed because of forward {{displacement of the}} final roll and root of the iris against the cornea, resulting in {{the inability of the}} aqueous fluid to flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the trabecular network. This accumulation of aqueous humor causes an acute increase in pressure and pain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{incoming}} Conservative government in 1970, despite failing to be elected to the shadow cabinet, Castle remained as the Labour shadow spokesperson on Employment. The new Government introduced many of her policy suggestions as part of their Industrial Relations Act. When she was attacking the Conservative bill, the government simply pointed to her own white paper, following which Wilson reshuffled her first to the health portfolio and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the shadow cabinet.|$|E

25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} are {{a type of}} {{outrigger trawler}} (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks {{at the end of}} the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> to the towing blocks on the booms.|$|E
25|$|Like other {{right whale}} species, the North Pacific right whale feeds by {{skimming}} water continuously while swimming, {{in contrast to}} balaenopterid whales such as the blue and humpback whales which engulf prey in rapid lunges. Right whales do not have pleated throats. Instead they have very large heads and mouths {{that allows them to}} swim with their mouths open, the water with the copepods flowing in, then flowing sideways through the right whale's very long, very fine baleen trapping the copepods, and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> over their large lower lips.|$|E
25|$|Hill was <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the {{first-class}} {{game for}} several years, returning in 1926 for one unproductive match (no wickets; no runs) for the Army against Oxford University. The {{main part of}} his cricketing career commenced the next year, {{when he began to}} play for Worcestershire. His County Championship debut, versus Kent in early May 1927, brought him a first-innings haul of 4-139, though Worcestershire lost the game by an innings. A fortnight later he recorded a career-best return of 6-59 against Northamptonshire, hitting 31 from number eleven for good measure, though again his county were defeated.|$|E

25|$|Bob Jones, Jr. was a {{connoisseur}} of European art and began collecting after World War II on about $30,000 a year {{authorized by the}} University Board of Directors. Jones first concentrated on the Italian Baroque, a style <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of favor and relatively inexpensive {{in the years immediately}} following the war. Fifty years after the opening of the gallery, the BJU collection included more than 400 European paintings from the 14th to through the 19th centuries (mostly pre-19th century), period furniture, and a notable collection of Russian icons. The museum also includes a variety of Holy Land antiquities collected in the early 20th century by missionaries Frank and Barbara Bowen.|$|E
25|$|The 2003 Cricket World Cup {{came and}} Waugh's desire {{to return for}} a fifth World Cup was denied. A chance for a last minute reprieve came when all rounder Shane Watson was injured before the tournament. Waugh had been using his {{newspaper}} column to promote his bowling abilities and had been increasingly using himself as a bowler {{in an attempt to}} strengthen his case for a recall. However, his successor Ricky Ponting publicly called for the inclusion of <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of form Andrew Symonds. Ponting got his wish, and although the selection was regarded as being highly controversial at the time, Symonds established himself at international level with a series of match winnings innings.|$|E
25|$|Paynter was <b>then</b> <b>out</b> of the England {{side for}} a time, but in 1937 his county form – 2,904 runs and a five-hour triple century against Sussex {{brought him a}} recall against New Zealand, as well as Wisden Cricketer of the Year {{recognition}} in the next year's Almanack. In 1938 Paynter had another outstanding series against Australia, averaging 101.75 and hitting 216 not out at Nottingham, {{at the time a}} record for Ashes Tests in England. He also filled in very competently as wicket-keeper for Les Ames when the latter was injured at Lord's. Paynter was again very successful the following winter against South Africa, scoring three centuries and two fifties in eight innings, including 243 at Durban, to average 81.62.|$|E
