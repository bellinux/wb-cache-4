A Simple Plan marked the second on-screen collaboration between Paxton and Thornton after One False Move (1992). Thornton recalled, [...] "I {{got a call from}} one of my agents who said, 'John Boorman wants you to do a script that I sent you a year ago and you never read,' I said, 'Send it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> and this time I'll really read it.' Within the first two pages, I knew I wanted to do it." ...|$|E

[...] When Schembechler won the Big Ten championship in 1969, he said, [...] "I made certain I let everyone know I won with Bump's kids. [...] Bump was a man of great class and he showed it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> and again in that first year, never getting in the way, always trying to be helpful, always trying to encourage me." [...] After Michigan won the 1969 Ohio State game, the team presented the game ball to Elliott, and Schembechler noted that [...] "I don’t remember when I felt happier about anything in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Back in London, Fleming had his manuscript—which he {{described}} as his [...] "dreadful oafish opus"—retyped by Joan Howe, his red-haired secretary at The Times on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partly based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, {{or at least to}} do so under a pseudonym. During the book's final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend, and later editor, William Plomer to see a copy, and remarked [...] "I really am thoroughly ashamed of it... after rifling through this muck you will probably never speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> but I have got to take that chance." [...] Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first they were unenthusiastic, but were persuaded to publish on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother, Peter, an established travel writer whose books they managed.|$|E

500|$|A player's {{baseball}} statistics {{can increase}} or reduce the leverage which {{he may have}} in future contract negotiations. Many players also have monetary incentives written in their contracts {{which are based on}} statistical measurements, and official scorers have the option to reverse a scoring decision within 24 hours of the conclusion of a game. Because of this, baseball writer-scorers were often subject to pressure from the players they were covering in their newspaper. After a game in 1962, infielder Jerry Adair asked for a meeting with local writer Neal Eskridge after learning that he was the scorer for the game. Angry about an error he had received in the game, Jerry [...] "cursed [...] thoroughly and imaginatively, and told him, 'Never talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> They reportedly did not speak to each other for almost four years. In the early days of baseball, a disagreement over a scoring decision occasionally led to physical altercations between the player and the writer. Confrontational incidents decreased after 1974 following a warning from MLB.|$|E

After a remark from Klein, Philippoussis was quoted as saying, [...] "You say that <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> and you're in trouble; you're not playing juniors any more." [...] He came out the victor in straight sets, 6–3, 7–5, and thus began his comeback in good form. Philippoussis then lost his second match to Sam Groth, 4-6, 3-6, but due to other players' injuries, he advanced to the quarterfinals, where he was to play Rameez Junaid. However, due to another knee injury requiring surgery, Philippoussis was unable to play.|$|E

2500|$|Still {{believing he}} would be rewarded, Guiteau arrived in Washington on March 5, 1881, the day after Garfield's inauguration. [...] He {{obtained}} entrance to the White House and saw the President on March 8, 1881, dropping off {{a copy of his}} speech as a reminder of the campaign work he had supposedly done on Garfield's behalf. He spent the next two months roaming around Washington, staying at rooming houses and sneaking away without paying, shuffling {{back and forth between the}} State Department and the White House, and approaching various Cabinet members and other prominent Republicans to press his claim, all without success. Guiteau was destitute and increasingly slovenly because he was wearing the same clothes every day. On May 13, 1881, he was banned from the White House waiting room. On May 14, 1881 he encountered Secretary of State James G. Blaine, who told him to [...] "Never speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> of the Paris consulship as long as you live." ...|$|E

My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
