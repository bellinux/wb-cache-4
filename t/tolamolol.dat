50|$|The {{synthesis}} of Toliprolol & <b>Tolamolol.</b>|$|E
40|$|Forty-two {{patients}} with angina pectoris have completed a randomized, double-blind trial comparing <b>tolamolol</b> 100 mg and 200 mg with propranolol 80 mg, practolol 100 mg, and placebo, all given {{three times a}} day. <b>Tolamolol</b> 200 mg thrice daily {{was found to be}} equivalent to propranolol 80 mg thrice daily in anti-anginal efficacy. Anginal attack rates and trinitrin consumption were significantly reduced by all active treatments as compared with the placebo but <b>tolamolol</b> and propranolol were the most effective. <b>Tolamolol</b> 200 mg thrice daily was most effective in reducing blood pressure, while propranolol was most effective in reducing the resting heart rate. All treatments except the placebo significantly increased the amount of exercise which could be performed before angina appeared (exercise work), while <b>tolamolol</b> 200 mg thrice daily significantly reduced Robinson's index when compared with all other active agents. The degree of S-T segment depression induced by exercise was significantly lessened by both <b>tolamolol</b> and propranolol but not by practolol or placebo. There was no difference in patient preference between <b>tolamolol</b> and propranolol but <b>tolamolol</b> at both dose levels was preferred to practolol. Both <b>tolamolol</b> and propranolol are potent adrenergic beta-receptor antagonists and equal in anti-anginal efficacy but <b>tolamolol</b> has the advantage of being cardioselective. It is superior to practolol...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacokinetic and {{physiological}} variables were measured in six healthy subjects after intravenous and oral administration of <b>tolamolol.</b> 2. After intravenous injection of <b>tolamolol</b> (20 mg), {{there was a}} biphasic decline both in plasma concentration and attenuation of maximum exercise tachycardia. First and second phase half-lives of plasma concentration were 7 min and 2. 5 h respectively. WReduction of maximum exercise tachycardia declined from 32 beats/min at 2 h to 19 beats/min at 8 hours. Clearance of <b>tolamolol</b> from blood ranged from 0. 8 - 1. 41 min- 1. 3. After the oral administration of <b>tolamolol</b> (100 mg), the average volume of distribution was 220. 1 and plasma concentration half-life 1. 8 hours. After ten eight-hourly doses of 100 mg there was no accumulation of <b>tolamolol</b> and the half-life of plasma clearance was unchanged. 4. Hydroxytolamolol was detected in plasma in two of six subjects after oral <b>tolamolol.</b> 5. There was a significant positive correlation between reduction in maximum exercise heart rate and logarithm of plasma concentration of <b>tolamolol</b> after both oral and intravenous administration...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} oral and {{intravenous}} <b>tolamolol</b> on exercise tolerance was assessed in 11 patients with angina pectoris. Patients were selected {{on the basis}} of an absence of placebo response and the reliable reproducibility of anginal pain and electrocardiographic changes with exercise on a constant load Schönander-Elema bicycle ergometer. The effect of <b>tolamolol</b> on exercise time and heart rate was compared with that of propranolol. <b>Tolamolol</b> was shown to increase exercise tolerance and the effect was comparable to that of propranolol. <b>Tolamolol</b> did not produce a significant increase in airways resistance nor were any untoward side effects noted...|$|E
40|$|ARNSDORF, MORTON F. AND IRA FRIEDLANDER: The {{electrophysiological}} {{effects of}} <b>tolamolol</b> (UK- 6558 - 01) on the passive membrane properties of mammalian cardiac Purkinje fibers. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 199 : 601 - 610, 1976. <b>Tolamolol</b> (UK- 6558 - 01) {{is a relatively}} cardioselective beta receptor antagonist which is effective clinically {{in the treatment of}} supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Animal studies suggest <b>tolamolol</b> may have significant antifibrillatory properties. The effect of <b>tolamolol</b> on the passive membrane properties of sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers was studied using multiple microelectrode techniques. In sodium-deficient Tyrode’s solution, we measured the resting transmembrane voltage (Vr) at differing external potassium concentrations (K J investigated current-voltage relationships and per-formed cable analysis. <b>Tolamolol</b> was found to hyperpolarize the membrane {{in the presence of a}} large driving force [i. e., when (Vr VK) was significantly greater than zero, where VK is the potassium equilibrium voltage]; to hyperpolarize fibers with a Vr decreased due to stretch at [K 10 = 4. 0 mM; to increase membrane chord and slop...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>tolamolol,</b> {{propranolol}} and practolol on both isoprenaline- and exercise-induced tachycardia {{have been studied}} in conscious dogs. <b>Tolamolol</b> was approximately equipotent to propranolol and 50 times more potent than practolol in antagonizing exercise-induced tachycardias, but was approximately 12 times less potent than propranolol and 8 times more potent than practolol in blocking isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. It is suggested that antagonism of the tachycardia induced by exercise affords a more meaningful assessment of the possible therapeutic potential of β-adrenoceptor blocking drugs than does that induced by isoprenaline...|$|E
40|$|Tlie anti-anginal {{activity}} {{of a new}} beta-blocking agent, <b>tolamolol,</b> was investigated in an open sttidy. Seventeen patients (fourteen males, three females) from two centres were given <b>tolamolol</b> in doses varying from 150 mg to 800 mg daily for periods of between one and thirty-four weeks. Records were made {{of the number of}} attacks of angina and of the consumption of sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored together with possible side-effects and the residts of routine laboratory tests. There was an over-all redttction in anginal attack rates and the number of GTN tablets used, although these did not reach statistical significance in the small numbers concerned. Heart rate and blood pressure were similarly reduced. Side-effects were of mild severity and were tolerated or disappeared with continued treatment. I n t r o d u c t i o n Propranolol has been used successfully {{for a number of years}} in the treatment of angina pectoris (Gillam & Pritchard 1965, Keelan 1965) and more recently other beta-blocking agents have become well established, for example Oxprenolol (Wilson et al 1969, Bauer & Mitchell 1970) and practolol (George...|$|E
