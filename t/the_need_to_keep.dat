5|$|<b>The</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and would not have been informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{ceremony was}} held for the victims on July 31, 1944, at Port Chicago. Admiral Carleton H. Wright, Commander, 12th Naval District, spoke of the unfortunate deaths and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the base operating {{during a time of}} war. He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a revetment near the pier. The remains of 44 of the victims were interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The {{superclass}} Tetrapoda {{is divided}} into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs. Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, {{some of which are}} impervious. Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage. They are not found in the sea {{with the exception of one}} or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps. On land, amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their skin damp.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the station}} was {{complicated}} by <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the line open: trains ferrying materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to switch from one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets from the station the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming {{that many of those}} first day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost £2,000.|$|E
5|$|Nights: Journey of Dreams {{was first}} conceptualised in November 2005 {{after the release}} of Sonic Team's Shadow the Hedgehog. Game design was {{primarily}} prepared by Takashi Iizuka and took around six months to reach the development process. Iizuka wanted to ensure that the next Nights game would stay faithful to the original, and felt <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the game's concept fundamentally the same while incorporating a variety of new mechanics. Despite the cancellation of Air Nights, Iizuka stressed that he had always wanted to make a sequel and asserted that Sega's exit from hardware manufacturing had no effect on the delay. Iizuka felt that it was the appropriate time to release a Nights game—he felt that the industry was dominated by violence and was keen to release a more family-friendly title. The team realised that Nintendo's upcoming Wii was marketed as a family-orientated console, and factored in its online features and user-friendly design.|$|E
5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to Genealogy of the Holy War. Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff felt <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going and create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties with keeping the game within the world of Genealogy of the Holy War, with Kaga commenting {{that it would have}} been simpler to create a completely original title if they had known how big the project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of Genealogy of the Holy War had suffered due to the goal of creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by giving each map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E

5|$|On announcing {{its plans}} for Steam Direct, Valve {{suggested}} the fee {{would be in}} the range of $100–5,000, meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and weed out poor quality titles that are treated as shovelware, improving the discovery pipeline to Steam's customers. Smaller developers raised concerns about the Direct fee harming them, and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam marketplace. Valve opted to set the Direct fee at $100 after reviewing concerns from the community, recognizing <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this at a low amount for small developers, and outlining plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement to help these. Valve then refunds the fee should the game exceed $1,000 in sales. In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to Direct, Valve mass-approved most of the 3,400 remaining titles that were still in Greenlight, though the company noted that not all of these were at a state to be published. Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with Direct in place. Some groups, such as publisher Raw Fury Games and crowd funding/investment site Fig, have offered to pay the Direct fee for indie developers who can not afford it.|$|E
5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended {{to reach out}} to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> and display records.|$|E
5|$|Women {{were not}} {{explicitly}} banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as the working-class areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction, but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of pithead baths, led to unpaid women's employment as <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little {{could be further from the}} truth in a society controlled by men.|$|E

25|$|Prior to World War II, in May 1924, an Air Raid Precautions Committee {{was set up}} in the United Kingdom.

In February 1936 the Home Secretary appointed a technical Committee on Structural Precautions against Air Attack.|$|E
25|$|Work on the Carfin {{version of}} the Lourdes Grotto {{began in the early}} 1920s. The shrine was built, by hand, by local parishioners on a site {{opposite}} the St. Frances Xavier's parish Church. Many of the builders were coal miners from Carfin and neighbouring villages out of work during the 1921 Coal Miners' Strike. It is said that Fr.

25|$|Russian Air Force Su-25s {{employed}} the Kh-25 in its two Chechen campaigns for attacks on fixed positions, such as mortars and bunkers. However, their usage wasn't extensive {{in relation to}} those of unguided bombs and rockets. The use of precision-guided munitions allowed air support in areas too dangerous for attack helicopters.

25|$|The grand {{strategy}} favoured at Dublin, of attacking by {{land and sea}} simultaneously, was probably impossible with English resources, given the rumours of a fresh Armada from Spain and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> warships in southern waters. The amphibious expedition to establish a northern base at Lough Foyle was abandoned, and the Dublin Council switched from an immediate attack on O'Neill and his confederate, Hugh Roe O'Donnell, {{when it became clear}} the strategy would fail through want of forage, cattle, and draught-horses. But this advice was declined by the Privy Council at London, which settled on a straight attack north into Ulster.|$|E

25|$|The Athenian {{fleet of}} 180 ships {{caught up with}} Lysander shortly after he had taken Lampsacus, and {{established}} a base at Sestos. However, perhaps because of <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a close watch on Lysander, they set up camp on a beach much nearer to Lampsacus. The location was less than ideal {{because of the lack}} of a harbor and the difficulty of supplying the fleet, but proximity seems to have been the primary concern in the minds of the Athenian generals. Every day, the fleet sailed out to Lampsacus in battle formation, and waited outside the harbor; when Lysander refused to emerge, they returned home.|$|E
25|$|Several routes were {{considered}} for the Loenga–Alnabru Line. <b>The</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the gradient at bay meant that the tracks were placed at a lower elevation than the Trunk Line, with the two not reaching the same height until Bryn Station. At {{the same time the}} company needed {{to stay away from the}} Alna River. Meanwhile, the Gjøvik Line was built with a branch, the Alna Line, which connected to Alnabru. Just northeast of the Trunk Line was placed in a culvert under the Trunk Line so it would meet up with the Alna Line. The Loenga–Alnabru Line was completed between Bryn and Alnabru in May 1904. with this work being carried out at the same time as the doubling of the Trunk Line. The section from Loenga to Bryn opened on 1 May 1907.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{historian}} Tuan-Hwee Sng {{has argued}} that the large size of the Chinese state contributed to its relative decline in the 19th century:The vast size of the Chinese empire created a severe principal-agent problem and constrained how the country was governed. In particular, taxes had to be kept low due to the emperor's weak oversight of his agents and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> corruption in check. The Chinese state's fiscal weaknesses were long masked by its huge tax base. However, economic and demographic expansion in the eighteenth century exacerbated the problems of administrative control. This put a further squeeze on the nation's finances and left China ill-prepared for the challenges of the nineteenth century.One reason why Japan was able to modernize and adopt the technologies of the West was due to its much smaller size relative to China.|$|E
