5000|$|... 18 July: Representatives from American, Japanese and Australian {{telecommunications}} organisations met at {{an international}} telephone conference to herald implementation of the new CCITT No 6 <b>telephone</b> <b>signalling</b> process. This process had been 15 years in the making, through international research and cooperation.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of EKA2 was {{its ability to}} run full <b>telephone</b> <b>signalling</b> stacks. Previously, on Symbian phones, these had to run on a separate CPU. Such signalling stacks are extremely complex and rewriting them to work natively on Symbian OS is typically not an option. EKA2 therefore allows [...] "personality layers" [...] to emulate the basic primitives of other operating systems, thus allowing existing signalling stacks to run largely unchanged.|$|E

5000|$|DTMF is {{a system}} that is widely used for <b>telephone</b> <b>signalling</b> and is almost universally used for touch tone dialing for {{landline}} telephones today. It uses set pairs of tones that are used to carry the information. The eight frequencies used are 697, 770, 852, 941 Hz which are termed the [...] "low tones" [...] and 1,209; 1,336; 1,477; and 1,633 Hz which are [...] "high tones". One high and one low tone is used together and the various combinations are used to represent different numbers and symbols.|$|E
50|$|The {{telephone}} switching in the ISCs was then typically crossbar or electronic controlled cross-points such as reed relays. The transmission media {{was likely to}} be satellite or lengthy terrestrial submarine cable channels. In some cases these were advantaged or multiplied with TASI (Time-Assignment Speech Interpolation) or DCME (Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment). These transmission methods were not suited to Line or Inter-Register signalling. Taking the signalling function away from the traffic channel could cut costs, and would later lead to Common Channel Signalling. There would be no need for filtering signalling away from speech, and the duty cycle of the costly trunk for each revenue earning call would be better. Signalling time in call set up and clear down would be significantly shorter than with C4 and C5. With <b>telephone</b> <b>signalling</b> not transmitted over the line, the opportunities for fraud were reduced.|$|E
40|$|Signalling System 7 (SS 7) {{is widely}} used for <b>telephone</b> <b>signalling.</b> Service {{providers}} need to frequently test their Signalling Transfer Points (STPs), which switch SS 7 messages, for both protocol conformance and interoperability. This paper describes a system that automatically analyzes the data collected during STP tests. It consists of files that describe how the STPs are expected to behave during the test, and Perl code that translates this Expected Behavior into a program that can search the data collected during the test for the expected events, and report on whether the system passed the test. The system readily processed over 30, 000 events for each test run, and identified abnormal behavior that could interfere with interoperability and protocol conformance...|$|E

40|$|In modern days, as {{a result}} of {{advances}} in technology, human beings are interested to remotely control different systems and applications. In this work, <b>telephone</b> <b>signalling</b> technique using Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signalling, is used to control switching of electrical loads such as agricultural pumps located in remote areas. A DTMF tone command sent from a transmitting fixed or mobile phone terminal will be used to SWITCH ON/OFF the motors used to pump water for agricultural fields. A processing electronic system at the receiving side is designed to interpret the tone commands and sends an appropriate signal to the motor driving circuit to complete the pump switching states. In the design methodology, it is possible to control several water pumps distributed in a certain agricultural site, however, in this work we considered four pumps and the paper presents the complete electronic design and simulation results at the different stages of the design. The electronic design is based on discrete passive and active electronic components and the system is tested and simulated using Multism program. The results of the simulation show that the design is capable of controlling the switching state of the motors. For a certain DTMF command, it is possible to switch ON/OFF a specific motor pump or all of the four motors...|$|E

50|$|The first {{focus was}} on anti-induction {{telephone}}s. In the 1930s, the telephone infrastructure in Japan was primarily used by the railroad industry, the police, the utility industry and the mining industry. The telecommunications infrastructure was so poor {{that it had to}} rely on power lines and railway cables—upon which <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> were superimposed. Because the <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> were susceptible to inductive interference and noise and the defective wiring in the long lines caused too much <b>signal</b> loss, normal <b>telephone</b> conversations were difficult. Iwasaki Kogyo set out to develop an anti-induction telephone to solve this problem, whilst running the cable manufacturing operations. Similarly, Iwasaki Kogyo focused on secure, anti-tapping telephones.|$|R
