5|$|After King Francis I {{commissioned}} Jacques Cartier {{to search}} out an eastern route <b>to</b> <b>Asia,</b> the city of Port Royal was founded on 27 July 1605 in what is today Nova Scotia.

Some regions were lost to the Spanish or British Crowns through conflict and treaties, and those that were still possessions of the French king on 21 December 1792 came under republican rule when the French monarchy was abolished on that day.|$|E
