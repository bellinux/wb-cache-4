5|$|Nurkse {{stressed}} productivity as {{the primary}} determinant {{of the size of}} the market. An increase in productivity (defined as the output per unit input) increases the flow of goods and services in the economy. As a response, consumption also rises. Hence, underdeveloped economies should aim <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> productivity levels in all sectors of the economy, in particular agriculture and industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandate and}} the limits on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay insuring themselves until they get sick.

5|$|In 1963, Henson and {{his wife}} moved to New York City, where the newly formed Muppets, Inc., would reside for some time. Jane quit {{performing}} <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> children. Henson hired writer Jerry Juhl in 1961 and puppet performer Frank Oz in 1963 to replace her. Henson later credited both with developing much of the humor and character of his Muppets. Henson and Oz developed a close friendship and a performing partnership that lasted 27 years; their teamwork is particularly evident in their portrayals of the characters of Bert and Ernie, Kermit and Miss Piggy, and Kermit and Fozzie Bear.|$|E

Rejected by her boyfriend when he refused <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> child, Claire decides {{to go to an}} {{adoption}} agency out of a belief that she will struggle to raise it alone. Claire visits a psychic (Nick Jameson) who warns her of a dangerous future for her unborn child if she does not raise it.

In response, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) decides to start a census of all of the survivors.|$|E
5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E

5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> young.|$|E
5|$|Parents can {{be either}} the {{biological}} mother or biological father, or the legal guardian for adopted children. Traditionally, mothers were responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing financially for the family. The age group for parents ranges from teenage parents to grandparents who have decided <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> grandchildren, with teenage pregnancies fluctuating based on race and culture. Older parents are financially established and generally have fewer problems raising children compared to their teenage counterparts.|$|E

Four days earlier BSkyB and ITV made their formal presentations to the chairmen; Chisholm hinted to his audience that BSkyB would increase their offer. This concerned Dyke, who on the weekend before the vote arranged an urgent meeting with East. They both telephoned the ITV companies to convince them <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> collective bid. It came {{to a total of}} £262 million – £155 million of which spread out over five years, for 30 live games per season. East presented their new offer to the chairmen and Parry.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{occupation}} in 1940 {{led to the}} closing of the church. During World War II, services were continued, but in the spring of 1944 hooligans broke into the church and destroyed the altar with the altarpiece, the organ, the chairs and the windows. In 1946, the congregation asked the Soviet government to list the Cathedral as a protected historical monument, but it failed <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> interest. The church was empty for years; for some time it was used for storing grain, even plans for turning it into a swimming-pool were made.|$|E
5|$|The company's men, {{a mixture}} of former French paratroopers, ex-Foreign Legionnaires and young adventurers, had trouble from the start {{integrating}} with the Rhodesian forces, and became unsettled by the respective ranks they were given in the Rhodesian Army. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> morale and create a strong esprit de corps, the Army issued them beret insignias backed with the French tricolour and allowed them to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia each morning. Apparently {{under the impression that}} they had signed up as highly paid mercenaries, many of the French troopers returned home after their first bush trip, unhappy to have received no more money than a regular Rhodesian soldier.|$|E

The decision to use Alex Puccinelli instead of Steve Downes, the previous voice artist of Master Chief, was approved by Microsoft. The actors playing the cadets attended a boot camp before shooting <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> fitness and accustom them to assault courses and rifle drills in their armour costumes. Cast members drove themselves to overexertion in the training, causing some to vomit, which they saw as a bonding experience.|$|E

5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust bathing and water bathing. Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E
5|$|From birth, leopard sharks form large schools {{generally}} segregated {{by age and}} sex, {{which may}} intermingle with grey or brown smoothhounds (Mustelus californicus and M. henlei) or spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). These schools are apparently nomadic, often appearing suddenly in an area {{for a few hours}} and then vanishing just as quickly. In captivity, larger sharks have been observed establishing their dominance over smaller individuals via light nips to the pectoral fins. During summer days, large aggregations of mature females assemble in shallow bays and estuaries, dispersing at night. As these females follow the warmest patches of water, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> internal body temperatures by up to 3°C (5.4°F), they are speculated to be taking advantage of the heat to speed their growth and that of their gestating young. The membership of these aggregations is inconstant, with individual females periodically switching between different sites scattered over several kilometers.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Maggie Roswell {{was hired}} {{for the first}} season of The Simpsons. She played a few minor {{characters}} until she became a regular cast member {{with the introduction of}} Maude Flanders in the second season. In 1994, Roswell and her husband Hal Rayle moved from Los Angeles to Denver <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> daughter. Together they established the Roswell 'n' Rayle Company, creating and voicing advertisements for companies. Because of her move to Denver, Roswell had to travel to Los Angeles twice a week to tape The Simpsons. This ultimately led to her requesting a pay raise in 1999; however, Fox refused to offer her the amount she wanted so she quit the show. Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal to record her lines from her Denver home.|$|E
