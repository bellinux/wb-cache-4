50|$|SLP {{shotguns}} {{are shipped}} with a locking device and keys, a Standard Invector improved cylinder and modified choke tubes, a choke <b>tube</b> <b>wrench,</b> two active valve pistons (one for heavy loads {{and one for}} light loads), three interchangeable cheekpieces (with Tactical model only), three interchangeable recoil pads (with Tactical model only), and an owner's manual.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the core}} tube {{is removed from}} the hole, the core sample is then removed from the core tube and catalogued. The Driller's {{assistant}} unscrews the backend off the core <b>tube</b> using <b>tube</b> <b>wrenches,</b> then each part of the tube is taken and the core is shaken out into core trays. The core is washed, measured and broken into smaller pieces using a hammer or sawn through to make it fit into the sample trays. Once catalogued, the core trays are retrieved by geologists who then analyse the core and determine if the drill site is a good location to expand future mining operations.|$|R
50|$|Nanza {{comprises}} numerous earth lodge sites {{encircled by}} a protective wall perhaps six feet high. Today the fortification is still visible. Archeological excavations have determined there was originally a ditch three feet deep and ten feet wide surrounding the berm. An earth embankment supporting a post palisade was discovered inside the ditch. Guns, hatchets, knives, beads, kettles, cloth and other European goods {{have been recovered}} from Ponca Fort, {{and serve as a}} testimony to the village's important position in the local fur trade. There is also evidence of extensive trade with other tribes. Pottery, stone mauls, meeling slabs and maulers, bone knives, hoes, <b>tubes,</b> shaft <b>wrenches</b> and picks, and strip bark in rolls {{from as far away as}} the Southeastern United States.|$|R
50|$|Another Dr. Merritt {{design was}} the 'Slimline' torque wrench mechanism. Prior to the 'Slimline', all Norbar torque {{wrenches}} used an external, break-back mechanism. The 'Slimline' {{was the first}} Norbar design to completely contain the mechanism within the body <b>tube</b> of the <b>wrench,</b> hence the 'Slim' reference. The 'Slimline' torque wrench was launched in 1963 and some models remain in production today. Variations in this mechanism underpin most of Norbar's current torque wrenches.|$|R
