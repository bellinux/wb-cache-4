5|$|In 1374 {{control of}} Gibraltar was {{transferred}} from Marinid Morocco to Nasrid Granada. In 1410, however, the Moorish garrison revolted and declared <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to Morocco, {{leading to the}} sixth siege in 1411 when the Granadan Nasrids stormed the city with assistance from sympathisers within the walls.|$|E
5|$|Privy {{counsellors}} {{can choose}} to affirm <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> in similar terms should they prefer not to take a religious oath. At the induction ceremony, the order of precedence places Anglicans (being those of the established church) before others.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} fought {{three weeks after}} the Austrian {{capitulation}} at Ulm and three weeks before the Russo-Austrian defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz. After Austerlitz, Austria withdrew from the war. The French demanded a high indemnity, and Francis II abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor, releasing the German states from <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
50|$|Samurai {{could choose}} their own nanori, and {{frequently}} changed their names to reflect <b>their</b> <b>allegiances.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Wybergh's {{transferred}} <b>their</b> <b>allegiances</b> {{from the}} Stuart's to the House of Hanover. During the rising of 1715, Thomas Wybergh {{a prisoner of}} the Jacobites was exchanged for Alan Ayacough, who had supported the Pretender. His son, also called Thomas was later involved in the 1745 Uprising.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{versions}} in {{many other}} languages were created and the song was popular among soldiers, regardless of <b>their</b> <b>allegiances.</b> It was claimed many times that the song {{was written in the}} country where it had just become a hit. Its actual composer was not widely known until after the war.|$|R
5|$|After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 against the Seljuk Turks and the {{overthrow}} of Romanos IV Diogenes (r. 1068–71), the Byzantine Empire experienced a decade of near-continuous internal turmoil and rebellions. The constant warfare depleted the Empire's armies, devastated Asia Minor and left it defenceless against the increasing encroachment of the Turks. In the Balkans, invasions by the Pechenegs and the Cumans devastated Bulgaria, and the Serbian princes renounced <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 1405, Owain Glyndŵr {{captured}} Carmarthen Castle {{and several}} other strongholds in the neighbourhood. However, when his support dwindled, the principal men of the county returned <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to King Henry V. During the English Civil War, Parliamentary forces under Colonel Roland Laugharne besieged and captured Carmarthen Castle but later abandoned the cause, and joined the Royalists. In 1648, Carmarthen Castle was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, and Oliver Cromwell ordered it to be slighted.|$|E
5|$|In Rome, Domitian {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} by Vitellius, as a {{safeguard}} against Flavian aggression. Support for the old emperor waned as more legions around the empire pledged <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to Vespasian. On 24 October 69, the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian (under Marcus Antonius Primus) met at the Second Battle of Bedriacum, which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius.|$|E
50|$|The Guelphs and Ghibellines were rival factions that {{nominally}} {{took the}} parts of the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire, respectively, in Italy in the 12th and 13th centuries; in practice, <b>their</b> <b>allegiances</b> often {{had more to do with}} competing local interests than with the contesting claims of the papacy and the Empire.|$|R
50|$|Jefferson County {{dissolved}} its {{party committee}} in 2010. The nine committee members split <b>their</b> <b>allegiances</b> between the Anti-Prohibition Party and Taxpayers Party for the 2010 elections; neither achieved automatic ballot access. The Nassau County committee was forcibly dissolved in February 2011 after MacKay seized {{control over the}} party's operations from Bobby Kumar.|$|R
50|$|The {{policies}} of the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives (PCs) are very similar. The major differences are in <b>their</b> <b>allegiances</b> to federal parties and in personalities. The PC Party began as the Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island, and changed its name in 1942 to reflect {{the development of the}} federal Progressive Conservative Party.|$|R
5|$|Lumumba's {{appeal for}} Soviet support split the {{government}} and led to mounting pressure from Western countries to remove him from power. In addition, both Tshombe and Kalonji appealed to Kasa-Vubu, who they believed to be both a moderate and federalist, to move against Lumumba's centralism and resolve the secession issue. Meanwhile, Mobutu took effective control of the army, routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure <b>their</b> <b>allegiance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Costly {{religious}} rituals such as male circumcision, {{food and}} water deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly signalling could explain this. All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious group. In this way, group members increase <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the group by signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.|$|E
5|$|Marischal {{then joined}} with the Engager faction, who had {{made a deal with}} the king, and led a troop of horse to the Battle of Preston (1648) in support of the royalists. Following the {{execution}} of Charles I in 1649, the Engagers gave <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to his son and heir: Charles II was proclaimed king, arriving in Scotland in June 1650. He visited Dunnottar in July 1650, but his presence in Scotland prompted Oliver Cromwell to lead a force into Scotland, defeating the Scots at Dunbar in September 1650.|$|E
5000|$|The episode guest stars Nick Offerman guest {{stars as}} Agent Powers; he had {{previously}} appeared in the season opener [...] "Scary-oke" [...] and the episode [...] "Northwest Mansion Mystery". Hirsch described this character, in addition to Agent Trigger, as plot devices to divide the protagonists and have them face <b>their</b> <b>allegiances</b> to one another.|$|R
5000|$|Lucius Munatius Plancus (c. 87 BC in Tibur [...] - [...] c. 15 BC in Gaeta) was a Roman senator, consul in 42 BC, and censor in 22 BC with Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus. Along with Talleyrand {{eighteen}} centuries later, {{he is one}} of {{the classic}} historical examples of men who have managed to survive very dangerous circumstances by constantly shifting <b>their</b> <b>allegiances.</b>|$|R
25|$|War {{broke out}} in Hakkari in 1839 between Nurallah, brother of the former Emir, who governed from Bash Qal'a, and Suleyman his nephew whose capital was in Gullamerk. The Assyrians were also split in <b>their</b> <b>allegiances,</b> {{according}} to <b>their</b> distribution. Most of them, including the Patriarch of the Church of the East Shimun XVII Abraham, supported Suleyman as the rightful successor to his father.|$|R
5|$|Mírzá Yahyá's {{leadership}} was controversial. He generally absented {{himself from the}} Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he {{went so far as}} to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who started giving <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to other claimants. During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs. In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Tarim Basin oasis states {{switched}} <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> {{from the}} Tang Dynasty to the Western Turks. The oasis states Kashgar and Khotan {{surrendered to the}} Chinese in 632, as did the kingdom of Yarkand in 635. Tang military campaigns expanded further west against the remaining kingdoms of the Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang beginning in 640. The king of Gaochang refused {{to submit to the}} Tang Dynasty as a suzerain. In 638, Emperor Taizong ordered a campaign led by general Hou Junji to invade Gaochang. Tang troops arrived in 640 and annexed the kingdom. A Western Turk army, sent to support Gaochang, retreated as the Tang forces approached.|$|E
5|$|Some {{suggested}} that the non-Malays did not feel loyal to Malaya {{because they did not}} consider themselves to be of Malayan nationality and adhere strictly to their own ethnic cultural backgrounds. To counter this, in 1952 citizenship was granted to nearly all local-born non-Malays, and dual citizenship prohibited, forcing non-Malays to choose between their ancestral homeland and Malaya. In contrast to the Malay's hypothesis, a majority of the non-Malays remained, thus proving <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to Malaya. They are the ancestor of modern-day non-Malay Malaysian.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the death}} of the third rebbe of Chabad, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Shneerson, the Tzemach Tzedek, {{followers}} of the Chabad movement split <b>their</b> <b>allegiances</b> among the third rebbe's sons who had each become Rebbes in their own right. The sons were Rabbis Yehudah Leib of Kopys, Chaim Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Yisroel Noach of Nizhyn, Yosef Yitzchak of Ovruch and Shmuel Schneersohn of Lubavitch.|$|R
50|$|Luo {{served as}} head of state {{until his death in}} 1795. Afterwards, Lanfang {{citizens}} elected Jiang Wubo (江戊伯) as their next president. Lanfang citizens elected a total of twelve leaders, who helped improve agricultural techniques, expand mine production, develop cultural education, and organize military training. These measures allowed Lanfang to increase its wealth and power, which encouraged the non-Chinese indigenous population to pledge <b>their</b> <b>allegiances</b> to Lanfang.|$|R

5|$|The lavish banquet {{was certain}} to be an affront to those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> solely to the white cockade of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E
5|$|To besiege the fortress, Ferdinand {{brought more}} than 400 Fussvolk (foot soldiers) and five squadrons of mounted soldiers, plus {{a half dozen}} heavy caliber cannons, called culverins. His soldiers, among them Spanish and Italian mercenaries, took up {{quarters}} in neighboring villages, a process accompanied by pillage, arson, murder and rape. On 18 November, {{the first day of}} the siege, Ferdinand sent a trumpeter and formally asked the fortress to surrender; the defending garrison replied that they had sworn <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to Gebhard and would fight to the death for him.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of the Privy Council {{moved out of the}} Tower before switching <b>their</b> <b>allegiance.</b> Becoming aware of his colleagues' change of mind, Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, abandoned his command of the fortress and proclaimed Mary I on nearby Tower Hill. After he had left, his wife was told she could also go home, while Jane, Guildford, and the Duchess of Northumberland were not allowed to. Jane was later moved from the royal apartments to the Gentleman Gaoler's lodgings and Guildford was imprisoned in the Bell Tower. There he was soon joined by his brother, Robert. His remaining brothers were imprisoned in other towers, as was his father, who was for the moment the only prominent person to go to the scaffold; Mary was prepared to spare Jane's and Guildford's lives.|$|E

50|$|Campaigns in House of Representatives {{elections}} are usually conducted on a district-by-district basis; {{there is no}} nationwide campaign. The races are between local politicians in the districts, and <b>their</b> <b>allegiances</b> and parties may switch from their announcement on the intention to run, registering as a candidate, printing out of ballots, election day and from the convening of the 15th Congress. The sitting president's party usually controls the House of Representatives no matter the election result.|$|R
5|$|After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan {{fell to the}} Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hernán Cortés {{to declare}} <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K'iche' Maya of Q'umarkaj may also have sent a delegation. In 1522 Cortés sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met new {{delegations}} from Iximche and Q'umarkaj at Tuxpán; both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared their loyalty to the King of Spain. But Cortés' allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were harassing Spain's allies in the region. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Athens orchestrated the {{creation}} of an alliance with Euboea, Megara, Achaea, Corinth, Acarnania and other states in the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. To secure <b>their</b> <b>allegiance,</b> Demosthenes was sent, by Athens, to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a deputation, but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes's allegiance.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 284–285; H. Weil, Biography of Demosthenes, 41–42. Demosthenes' oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes's control of Boeotia was recognised, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.|$|E
5|$|Early Māori {{adapted the}} tropically based east Polynesian culture {{in line with}} the {{challenges}} associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, particularly with the introduction of Christianity. However, Māori still regard <b>their</b> <b>allegiance</b> to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples. More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.|$|E
