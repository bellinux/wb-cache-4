Design/methodology/approach: Data {{were collected from}} various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and <b>technical</b> strength <b>ratings,</b> while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and <b>technical</b> weakness <b>ratings.</b> Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit {{the generalizability of the}} findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. close...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM) was {{established}} to achieve the safe and compliant disposition of legacy wastes and facilities from defense nuclear applications. A large majority of these wastes and facilities are 'one-of-a-kind' and unique to DOE. Many of the programs to treat these wastes have been 'first-of-a-kind' and unprecedented in scope and complexity. This has meant {{that many of the}} technologies needed to successfully disposition these wastes were not yet developed or required significant re-engineering to be adapted for DOE-EM's needs. The DOE-EM program believes strongly in reducing the technical risk of its projects and has initiated several efforts to reduce those risks: (1) Technology Readiness Assessments to reduce the risks of deployment of new technologies; (2) External Technical Reviews as one of several steps to ensure the timely resolution of engineering and technology issues; and (3) <b>Technical</b> Risk <b>Ratings</b> as a means to monitor and communicate information about technical risks.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM) was {{established}} to achieve the safe and compliant disposition of legacy wastes and facilities from defense nuclear applications. The scope of work is diverse, with projects ranging from single acquisitions to collections of projects and operations that span several decades and costs from hundreds of millions to billions US$. The {{need to be able}} to manage and understand the technical risks from the project to senior management level has been recognized as an enabler to successfully completing the mission. In 2008, DOE-EM developed the Technical Risk Rating as a new method to assist in managing technical risk based on specific criteria. The Technical Risk Rating, and the criteria used to determine the rating, provides a mechanism to foster open, meaningful communication between the Federal Project Directors and DOE-EM management concerning project technical risks. Four indicators (technical maturity, risk urgency, handling difficulty and resolution path) are used to focus attention on the issues and key aspects related to the risks. Pressing risk issues are brought to the forefront, keeping DOE-EM management informed and engaged such that they fully understand risk impact. Use of the Technical Risk Rating and criteria during reviews provides the Federal Project Directors the opportunity to openly discuss the most significant risks and assists in the management of technical risks across the portfolio of DOE-EM projects. <b>Technical</b> Risk <b>Ratings</b> can be applied to all projects in government and private industry.

40|$|The {{traditional}} design-bid-build {{methods for}} designing, constructing, inspecting, and financing highway projects are rapidly changing. The traditional methods are being consolidated into {{a relatively new}} contracting method called design-bid (D-B) that offers more opportunities for innovation, value engineering, risk-sharing, efficient coordination, as well as economization of time and money. ^ A review of eight D-B projects from Texas, Minnesota, Washington State, and Utah (conducted under this research) revealed that bid evaluation methods are subjective and rely on simplistic averaging of cost and proposal quality (or <b>technical)</b> <b>ratings.</b> These practices {{are more prone to}} face legal challenges since they tend to be ambiguous and subjective. Additionally, these practices evaluate cost and proposal quality independently (i. e., cost is evaluated regardless of the proposed quality and visa versa). This might lead to reduced prices, {{but at the same time}} lower quality. A model for best bid identification was developed based on Game theory. The selection of best bid is modeled as a two-person cooperative game between quality and cost. In other words, the objective is to find the arbitration values of cost and quality. Apart from selecting the best bid, this model helps to identify best value for cost and quality, which are not necessary the values provided by any bidder. These best values for cost and quality might help for finalizing final contract with selected bidder. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the factors that}} influence the decision of first-term Naval Veterans (NAVETs), who are eligible for reenlistment, to choose to affiliate with the Selected Reserve (SELRES). A model of the determinants of affiliation is specified and estimated using data on active Navy separations and Navy Reserve accessions during the period between 1990 and 2002. The data set analyzed the affiliation decisions of 388, 637 NAVETs. Some of the features in the maximum likelihood logit model include the use of rating groups to determine differences in affiliation patterns by occupational categories, determining differences over various time periods, and looking at pay and unemployment rate elasticities across rating groups. Overall, NAVET affiliation in the SELRES is found to depend upon Reserve pay, unemployment rates, census region, gender, race, marital status, dependency status, age at time of separation from active duty, education, mental category, and Navy rating. More specifically, the findings indicate that <b>technical</b> <b>ratings</b> are more responsive to changes in pay than nontechnical ratings, while the unemployment elasticity indicates that affiliation increases with an increase in the unemployment rate. Various time periods were analyzed to determine if the drawdown years of the early 1990 s differed {{from the rest of the}} sample, and to determine if differences existed during and after the 'dot. com' boom of the late 1990 s. In both cases, models in the restricted period were found to be significantly different from the pooled period. Females, Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to affiliate, while those NAVETs who are married, have children, and are older are less likely to affiliate. Finally, there was a significant regional effect in the probability of affiliation...|$|E

This thesis examines {{the qualifications of}} women for nontraditional ratings over time using the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). The study focuses on sea-going, nontraditional ratings {{that are likely to}} be affected by changes in laws and policies that currently exclude women from combat. Using data from Navy accession files for the years 1981, 1983, 1986, 1989, and 1992, tables were created that compare qualification for four ASVAB composites by various demographic variables, including gender, racial/ethnic group, and Recruiting Area. The results indicate that, in general, women who join the Navy qualify at lower rates than men for nontraditional ratings. Further, no improvements have apparently occurred since 1981 in the qualification rates of women for <b>technical,</b> sea-going <b>ratings.</b> To improve the qualification rate of women for nontraditional occupations in the near term, Minimum requirements would need to be modified or alternative standards developed.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this work was to provide an intraindividual {{comparison}} of angiographic CT (ACT) and multisection CT (MSCT) in lumbar myelographic imaging and to evaluate possible benefits of ACT, which is a further development of rotational angiography providing image data of high spatial and CT-like contrast resolution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 26 patients with degenerative lumbar spine disease a lumbar ACT was performed in combination with conventional lumbar myelography and followed by postmyelographic MSCT. Conventional lumbar myelography and lumbar ACT were performed with a flat panel detector– equipped angiographic device. Postmyelographic MSCT was performed with a 16 -section CT scanner. Three experienced neuroradiologists rated anonymized sets of multiplanar reformatted CT and ACT images regarding diagnostic and <b>technical</b> parameters.

30|$|QFD is a {{methodology}} for translating customer requirements (CRs) into product design requirements (DRs). It helps to address customer requirements into engineering specifications {{for a product}} by prioritizing each product attribute while simultaneously assigning development goals for the same product. The house of quality (HOQ), for instance is an approved tool used by QFD wherein visually appealing graphical illustrations are used to define the relationships between customer desires and the product features (Smith 2011). Various optimization methods have been applied {{in the field of}} QFD for helping decision makers in product planning and improvement (Chen and Ko 2009, 2010; Lai et al. 2007; Delice and Güngör 2009; Bhattacharya et al. 2010; Chien et al. 2010; Hajji et al. 2011; Karipidis 2011). Moreover, several researchers have generated substantial attention on fuzzy QFD during the last decades. Zaim et al. (2014) synthesized renowned capabilities of ANP and Fuzzy Logic to better rank technical characteristics of a product (or a service) while implementing QFD. Raissi et al. (2012) prioritized engineering characteristic in QFD using fuzzy common set of weight. Bottani (2009) presented an approach aims at identifying the most appropriate enablers to be implemented by companies starting from competitive characteristics of the related market. The approach was based on QFD and in particular HOQ, in which the whole scaffold exploits fuzzy logic, to translate linguistics judgments required for relationships and correlations matrixes into numerical values. As one of the key issues in F-QFD is to derive the <b>technical</b> importance <b>ratings</b> of design requirements (DRs) in fuzzy environments and prioritize them, Wang and Chin (2011) investigated how the technical importance of DRs can be correctly rated in fuzzy environments. In this paper, F-QFD is adopted instead of crisp QFD model to determine the effect of lean attributes on competitive advantages. The distinctions between the F-QFD system and the traditional QFD methodology is that the QFD relevant data are symbolized as linguistic terms rather than crisp numbers, and the linguistic data is processed by algorithms embedded in the system’s internal environment (Mehrjerdi 2010).|$|R
40|$|As {{television}} viewers {{we are used}} to watching television as a flow of programs with varying content, and usually do not think about how the programs are created. Who decides what should be produced and what the programs should contain? What role do the TV producers play? Who are the producers? Have their working conditions changed due to changes in society? The aim {{of this study was to}} answer questions about the TV producer’s background and career, and about how ideas for TV productions developed into actual TV programs. The study resulted in more than 90 “cases” or descriptions in drama and journalism. The respondents were asked about the role that different levels of management, economic resources, <b>technical</b> equipment, audience <b>ratings</b> played in the production of television programs. They were also asked how they evaluated professionalism and competition and what changes had occurred during the periods of the study, 1992 - 1999 and 2006 - 07. The TV producers who were interviewed belonged to different “generations” and had  entered  the television industry on  different occasions, such as at the launch  of  television channels  (the first TV channel, TV 2, TV 4) or  new ventures like regional television or minority language programs. The drama producers often executed the ideas that had been decided on by higher management, even though some drama authors who participated in this study had great power over the story lines and content. The journalist producer’s independence and power over the content were greater than the drama producer’s, since they wrote their own “scripts” during the production of programs. In light of many “cases” of programs described it can be suggested that journalist producers’ choice of program ideas were  parallel and complementary or alternative institutional processes, that preceded, followed or coexisted with reports, investigations, trials etc.   One of the most obvious changes during the period studied from 1992 to 2007 was the change in overall technology from analog techniques to digital. Internet, intranets, e-mail and cell phones had made “the mobile office” a reality and the analog techniques in cameras and editing in TV production became digital during the period. ...|$|R
