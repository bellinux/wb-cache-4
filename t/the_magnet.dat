5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above <b>the</b> <b>magnet</b> and dipped into the mercury. <b>The</b> <b>magnet</b> exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around <b>the</b> <b>magnet</b> {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E

Analyzing the sand, he determined the presence of two metal oxides: iron oxide (explaining the attraction to <b>the</b> <b>magnet)</b> and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify. Realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known element, Gregor reported his findings to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and in the German science journal Crell's Annalen.|$|E
5000|$|One {{attempt to}} improve the reactor {{geometry}} was attempted by a class of designs known as the [...] "compact tokamak", typified by the Alcator C-Mod (operational since 1991), the Riggatron (conceptual, unbuilt) and IGNITOR (construction in progress as of 2016-02). The later two of these designs dispensed with the first wall and placed <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> {{in direct contact with}} the plasma; in a production design the blanket would be outside <b>the</b> <b>magnets.</b> This greatly simplifies the physical design as well, as the toroidal vacuum vessel can be replaced with a cylinder. The decreased distance between <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> and plasma leads to much higher betas, so conventional (non-superconducting) magnets could be used.The downside to this approach, one that was widely criticized in the field, is that it places <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> directly in <b>the</b> high-energy neutron flux of the fusion reactions. In operation <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> would be rapidly eroded, requiring the vacuum vessel to be opened and <b>the</b> entire <b>magnet</b> assembly replaced after a month or so of operation.|$|R

5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. <b>The</b> <b>magnet</b> was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E
5|$|Measuring the {{magnetic}} resonance of crystals first involved growing the crystals, a simple procedure often done by elementary school students. The crystals {{then had to}} be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had an orientation different from the internal structure of the crystal, and the response to a magnetic field had to be painstakingly measured. While his crystals were growing, Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which inspired an easier method. He lowered a crystal on a glass fiber attached to a torsion balance into a solution whose magnetic susceptibility could be varied between two magnetic poles. When it matched that of the crystal, <b>the</b> <b>magnet</b> could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal. The new method not only required much less work, it also produced a more accurate result. Rabi sent his thesis, entitled On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals, to Physical Review on 16 July 1926. He married Helen the next day. The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles, although it was read by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan, who used the method in his own investigations of crystals. Rabi concluded {{that he needed to}} promote his work as well as publish it.|$|E
5|$|The {{novelisation}} and the screenplay, {{although both}} written by Wood, are somewhat different. In the novelisation, SMERSH is still active and after James Bond. Their role begins during the pre-title. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for {{the whereabouts of}} the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts {{with a number of}} Bond stories, including the film The Living Daylights (1987), in which a character remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH {{is said to have been}} put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the novelisation include Amasova and her lover Sergei Borzov as well as Colonel-General Niktin, a character from Fleming's novel From Russia, with Love who has since become the head of SMERSH. In the book, Jaws remains attached to <b>the</b> <b>magnet</b> that Bond dips into the tank, as opposed to the film where Bond releases Jaws into the water.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} losses in <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> of a permanent-magnet {{synchronous}} machine (PMSM) with surface magnets caused by square voltage {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) waveforms. First, the conductivity of <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> is determined. Second, the effect of segmentation on the losses is calculated by a 3 -D time-harmonic finite element model for sinusoidal waveforms. More segmentation of <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> in axial and circumferential direction results in much lower losses in <b>the</b> <b>magnets,</b> but more losses in the massive rotor yoke. In a third step, the losses are simulated and measured on an experimental PMSM for square waveforms generated by PWM. Superposition of appropriate sinusoidal losses obtained by a time-harmonic FEM seems to be acceptable in order to predict losses in a PMSM for square voltage waveforms...|$|R

40|$|Transportation {{sector is}} {{consuming}} {{a large portion}} of the total energy used by the humans. Today, most of the commercial vehicles are driven by internal combustion engines. Replacing them with electrical machine could have a large impact in the environment. But there is still room for improvement in the electric machines in order to replace the internal combustion engines. The electrical machines that are used in the automotive industry use permanent magnets in their rotors. They have a number of advantages such as very good efficiency and high power density. On the other hand, sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> in high temperatures and their price is the major drawbacks of permanent <b>magnet</b> machines. <b>The</b> <b>magnets</b> cannot operate in high temperatures because they suffer from demagnetization. To deal with this problem, today, high temperature grade magnets with a lot of segments are used. In this thesis an oil spraying technique is used to cool <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> in a safe operating temperature, increase their performance and also reducing their manufacturing cost. The analysis is based on theoretical calculations and experimental results from a test rig that was designed and constructed within the thesis. The oil-spraying cooling system, was designed to spray oil on the inside of the rotor of the electrical machine. Due to the high rotational speed the oil forms a thin film that absorbs the heat generated by <b>the</b> <b>magnets.</b> In <b>the</b> thesis a cylinder with an external heat source that simulated the actual rotor was used for evaluation. The actual losses of <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> in an electrical machine was calculated for different operation points and segmentation of <b>the</b> <b>magnets.</b> Then <b>the</b> temperature of <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b> was calculated, by developing a thermal model, with and without oil spraying.

50|$|In the {{traditional}} tokamak design, <b>the</b> confinement <b>magnets</b> are normally arranged outside a {{toroidal vacuum chamber}} holding the plasma.
