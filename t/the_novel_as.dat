5|$|Stowe, a Connecticut-born {{teacher at}} the Hartford Female Seminary and an active abolitionist, wrote <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> a {{response}} to the passage, in 1850, of the second Fugitive Slave Act. Much of the book was composed in Brunswick, Maine, where her husband, Calvin Ellis Stowe, taught at his alma mater, Bowdoin College.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>novel</b> <b>As</b> Time Goes By, {{written by}} Michael Walsh and {{published}} in 1998, was authorized by Warner. The novel picks up where the film leaves off, and also tells of Rick's mysterious past in America. The book met with little success. David Thomson provided an unofficial sequel in his 1985 novel Suspects.|$|E
5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage {{is to be used}} for social mobility.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} actresses have portrayed Sadako in the {{numerous}} films and television adaptations of <b>the</b> <b>novels,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as in}} foreign adaptations.|$|R
5|$|Feminist {{theory can}} also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> a {{critique}} of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.|$|E
5|$|Gary uses <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> {{a vehicle}} to {{denounce}} both racism and the activists supporting African-American rights, including his own ex-wife and Marlon Brando. He also examines whether human responses to situations, including racism, are learned social behavior and whether they can be unlearned. In 1981, it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name, in which director Samuel Fuller made various changes to the novel's story {{to focus more on}} the dog and present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel. The film's American release after negative press from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led to concerns of boycotts.|$|E
5|$|More recently, giant spiders have {{featured}} in {{books such as}} the 1998 fantasy novel Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K. Rowling. This book was later followed by a motion picture of the same name, using the giant spider Aragog from <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> a supporting character and pet of grounds keeper, Hagrid. In Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a book about many of the creatures within the Harry Potter universe, these giant spiders are also known as Acromantulas.|$|E

50|$|This book {{series is}} {{considered}} {{separate from the}} novelizations, although they do acknowledge events from <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> <b>as</b> well as from other books within the series.|$|R
5|$|Scholars {{have also}} seen <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> expressing the values and ideas of the Free Will Movement. In this view, the {{character}} of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, while the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. In contrast to Ophelia is Dinah, who operates on passion. During {{the course of the}} novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the Republican Party (three years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, any gas giant {{could be}} {{enclosed}} in a solid shell; {{at a certain}} radius the surface gravity would be terrestrial, and energy {{could be provided by}} tapping the thermal energy of the planet. This concept is explored peripherally in the novel Accelerando (and the short story Curator, which is incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> a chapter) by Charles Stross, in which Saturn is converted into a human-habitable world.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} manuscript before {{an editor at}} the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers' opinions were mixed. Some praised <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> a powerful paean to individualism, while others thought it overlong and lacking sympathetic characters. Initial sales were slow, but the book gained a following by word of mouth and became a bestseller. More than 6.5million copies of The Fountainhead have been sold worldwide and it has been translated into more than 20 languages. The novel attracted a new following for Rand and has enjoyed a lasting influence, especially among architects and right-libertarians.|$|E
25|$|However {{studies show}} that overall, readers {{appreciated}} the mundane language, witty tone and aesthetic plot of <b>the</b> <b>novels,</b> <b>as</b> well as how it introduced Greek mythology to them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{advent of}} {{widespread}} text-messaging {{has resulted in}} <b>the</b> cell phone <b>novel,</b> <b>the</b> first literary genre {{to emerge from the}} cellular age, via text messaging to a website that collects <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> <b>as</b> a whole.|$|R

5|$|While he was {{a student}} at Vendôme, Balzac wrote an essay called Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"); it is {{described}} in <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> being written by Louis Lambert. The essay discusses the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although Balzac did not explore many of the metaphysical concepts until much later in his life. Ideas analyzed in the essay and elsewhere in the novel include the split between inward and outward existence; the presence of angels and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius and madness.|$|E
5|$|Goldsman took on {{the project}} as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man. A rewrite was done to {{distance}} the project from the other zombie films inspired by <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as from the}} recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks: production was given a green light, using Goldsman's script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion's film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema.|$|E
5|$|Much {{commentary}} {{has focused}} on the novel's depiction of njais, a subject common in contemporary Chinese Malay literature. Sumardjo describes <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> an ode to njais, citing Marsiti's loyalty to Aij Tjeng and her pureness of purpose; Marsiti is ultimately recognised for her devotion when her grave in Cikembang is moved to Batavia, with empty spaces on either side for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Sumardjo finds subtle criticism of the Dutch and Chinese men who kept njais, showing the women as often becoming victims of their lovers. He suggests that this was manifested in the character of Keng Djim's unnamed njai (Marsiti's mother), who is banished after rumours spread that she has been unfaithful. Sutedja-Liem likewise emphasises the role of the njai within the story, considering the novel to be an ode to the love and loyalty of the concubines.|$|E

5|$|Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe is Argaven Harge's cousin. Tibe {{becomes the}} prime {{minister}} of Karhide when Estraven is exiled {{at the beginning of the}} novel, and becomes the regent for a brief while when Argaven is pregnant. In contrast to Estraven, he seems intent on starting a war with Orgoreyn over the Sinnoth Valley dispute; as well as taking aggressive actions at the border, he regularly makes belligerent speeches on the radio. He is strongly opposed to Ai's mission. He orders Estraven to be killed at the border at the end of <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>as</b> a last act of defiance, knowing that Estraven and Ai's presence in Karhide means his own downfall; he resigns immediately after Estraven's death.|$|E
5|$|The novel centres on the {{character}} of Katinka Bai, a quiet, sensitive young woman married to a boisterous and somewhat vulgar station master, Bai. The marriage is barren, and she remains isolated. Almost subconsciously, she passionately longs after something undefinable. Even after the arrival of Huus, a neighbour with whom she begins to establish a promising relationship, she is unable to fulfill her passion, although {{for the first time in}} her life she falls in love. In the small provincial community where they live, neither she nor Huus dares to break the conventions they know, sad as it all may be. When they realize they cannot take their attachment any further, they decide to separate and Huus leaves the country. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>as</b> at the beginning, Katinka stands by the wayside, observing life glide by.|$|E
5|$|This film {{marks the}} second {{adaptation}} of Shūsaku Endō's novel, which was previously adapted by Masahiro Shinoda into the 1971 {{film of the}} same name. Scorsese penned the initial screenplay in 1991 with co-writer and longtime collaborator Jay Cocks. However, they were unsatisfied with the script and conducted rewrites for an additional 15 years. Later, Endō's official translator, Van C. Gessel, who has translated eight of his novels, assisted as a consultant on the film. The screenplay as finally filmed was assessed in critical review as an accurate depiction of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> <b>as</b> written by Endo. Religious historian Haruko Nawata Ward has indicated that {{the inclusion of the}} small crucifix in the deceased priest's hand {{at the end of the}} film was an auteur decision made by Scorsese not included in Endo's original book.|$|E
