50|$|Telephone <b>tapping</b> (also <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> or {{wiretapping}} in American English) is {{the monitoring}} of telephone and Internet conversations {{by a third}} party, often by covert means. The <b>wire</b> <b>tap</b> received its name because, historically, the monitoring connection was an actual electrical tap on the telephone line. Legal wiretapping by a government agency is also called lawful interception. Passive wiretapping monitors or records the traffic, while active wiretapping alters or otherwise affects it.|$|R

50|$|Coupling to the {{resonator}} can {{be achieved}} with a <b>tap</b> <b>wire</b> soldered to the helix at {{some distance from the}} shorted end. Input impedance varies with distance from the shorted end by impedance transformer action. The tap point is chosen to achieve an impedance match with the connected circuit. Tuning of the resonator may be achieved by inserting a screw into the central axis of the helix (Weston, 2001, p. 660). Other means of input and output coupling used are a wire loop coupling to the magnetic field near the shorted end, or a probe capacitively coupling near the open end. Coupling between resonators in a multi-resonator filter is often simply achieved with apertures in the shielding between them (Whittaker, 2000, p. 227).|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} applications of superconductivity is high field magnet. Mechanical disturbance such as abrupt conductor motion {{is one of the main}} origin of premature quench (transition from superconducting state to the normal resistive state) in high current density superconducting coils. The wire motion occurs when electromagnetic force to conductor exceeds constrain force including frictional force on the surface of conductor. Behavior of superconducting wire motion depends on the electromagnetic force acting on it, frictional property of the insulating material and thrust force applied to the superconducting wire. 　　　The experiments for superconducting wire motion in magnetic field was carried out using small coil wound on stainless steel (SUS) bobbin using Polyimide film as an insulating material and high strength polyethylene fiber (Dyneema: DF) reinforced plastic (DFRP) bobbin [1]. The Dyneema fiber has negative thermal expansion [2] and low coefficient of friction [3]. It was found that voltage spikes generated due to sudden wire motion in case of DFRP bobbin are a few and small in amplitude. The speculations are; the negative thermal expansion of the DFRP bobbin restrains the wire motion and low coefficient of friction between superconducting wire and DFRP bobbin reduces sudden motion. 　　　In order to study the effect of frictional coefficient of insulating material on superconducting wire motion under the influence of electromagnetic force, a special experimental setup was designed and fabricated. The main distinctiveness of the experimental setup is that the tension of the superconducting wire can be changed during the experiments. The experimental set up consists of a cryostat, superconducting solenoid magnet, sample holder, tensional unit to apply tension to the superconducting wire, power supplies and pen recorder or a 16 -bit data recorder to measure the voltage tap signal. The sample holder consists of two parts, a semi- circular head and a body part. Experiments were conducted at 4. 2 K by varying the experimental conditions such as the tension to the superconducting wire, superconducting wire current ramp rate and different insulating materials at the interface of the superconducting wire and semi-circular head. 　　　Voltage taps to measure the signal generated due to the superconducting wire motion are connected at the end of the semi-circular head. To reduce the voltage tap loop area, a groove was incorporated in the semi-circular head and the voltage <b>tap</b> <b>wire</b> was passed through it. The voltage tap signal is measured by a pen recorder or a 16 -bit data recorder with a sampling rate of 1 MS/s. Sudden wire motion was indicated by observing the voltage spikes. 　　　In order to examine the effect of the current ramp rate on the superconducting wire motion, ramp rate was changed from 0. 4 A/s to 1. 69 A/s. The superconducting wire tension was varied from 7. 1 N to 35. 8 N to study the effect of tension on the superconducting wire motion. During all experiments, a constant magnetic field of 6 T was applied by superconducting solenoid magnet. 　　　In the thesis work, different types of insulating material were used to study superconducting wire motion under electromagnetic force. They are Polyimide film, cloth / sheet material fabricated using Dyneema fiber, Zylon fiber and Teflon. The Dyneema / Zylon fiber has negative thermal expansion and a low coefficient of friction. 　　　We have verified the effectiveness of this system. We could measure the pattern of voltage spikes. The time duration of voltage spikes are of the same order for all the samples. The peak voltage tap signal amplitude, velocity of wire motion, distance moved by wire and energy dissipated due to wire motion in case of Polyimide film is more than 2 order of magnitude larger than Dyneema based insulating materials and Zylon cloth. Hence use of Dyneema / Zylon based materials as an interface material between layers of superconducting wire may reduce the frictional heat generated due to wire motion and could make superconducting magnet performance more reliable...|$|E
