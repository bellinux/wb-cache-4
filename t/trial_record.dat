25|$|Thirty {{defendants}} appealed. In June 1914, the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed {{and ordered}} new trials for {{five of the}} convictions, including that of Olaf Tveitmoe. In the case of Tveitmoe, {{the court ruled that}} evidence implicating him in the Los Angeles Times bombing was irrelevant to the federal charges, because that incident did not involve interstate transportation of dynamite. Citing abundant evidence in the <b>trial</b> <b>record,</b> the court upheld the remaining 25 convictions. The following month, the US district attorney announced that, in light of the court of appeals ruling, that the government would not retry the five defendants whose convictions were reversed; the five were released.|$|E
25|$|At {{times when}} a death {{sentence}} is affirmed on direct review, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, {{the first step in}} collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state. Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review. Most often, these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original <b>trial</b> <b>record,</b> something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after taking}} the bench Sloan drew the anger of Governor Lewis Wolfley when the new judge {{appointed}} a personal enemy of the governor, Brewster Cameron, as his court clerk. [...] The governor complained that Sloan was ineligible to become a judge under federal law as {{he was a member}} of the territorial legislature. [...] This complaint was technically correct as Sloan's term in the legislature did not officially end until December 31, 1890. [...] The governor's ire was further provoked when Sloan dismissed his appeal of Wolfley v. Gila River Irrigation Company (1890), 3 Arizona 176 by pointing out that the appeal failed to claim any legal errors in the <b>trial</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The defense appealed Thayer's {{denial of}} their motions to the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), {{the highest level}} of the state's {{judicial}} system. Both sides presented arguments to its five judges on January 11–13, 1926. The SJC returned a unanimous ruling on May 12, 1926 upholding Judge Thayer's decisions. The Court did not have the authority to review the <b>trial</b> <b>record</b> as a whole or to judge the fairness of the case. Instead, the judges considered only whether Thayer had abused his discretion {{in the course of the}} trial. Thayer later claimed that the SJC had [...] "approved" [...] the verdicts, which advocates for the defendants protested as a misinterpretation of the Court's ruling, which only found [...] "no error" [...] in his individual rulings.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prosecution}} removed three {{blacks from}} serving as jurors in Williams' trial. Williams' lawyers {{claimed that he}} was convicted by a jury that had no blacks, one Latino, one Filipino-American, and 10 caucasians. The District Attorney provided proof, however, {{in the form of}} a death certificate and the affidavit of another juror, that juror #12, William James McLurkin, was black. [...] The defense responded that, contrary to the affidavit, McLurkin did not appear black. They maintain that the <b>trial</b> <b>record</b> indicates that none of the lawyers—and particularly the prosecutor—thought McLurkin was black. McLurkin's driver license photo and the fact that both he and his mother were born in the Philippines was presented as additional evidence in a November 2005 petition for clemency. [...] The defense, however, has neither stated whether or not his mother was actually Filipina, nor refuted the evidence that McLurkin was black.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Quoting Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. at 367–368, the Court {{held that}} [...] "The verdict against the {{appellant}} {{was a general}} one. It did not specify the ground upon which it rested. ... t is impossible to say under which clause of the statute the conviction was obtained. If {{any one of these}} clauses ... was invalid, it cannot [...] be determined upon this record that the appellant was not convicted under that clause. ... It follows that ... the conviction cannot be upheld." [...] That is, when a defendant is convicted of violating a law only part of which is unconstitutional, and the <b>trial</b> <b>record</b> does not sufficiently demonstrate that he was convicted solely of violating that part of the law that is constitutional, then the Court will reverse the conviction. Thus, the case was remanded to the state courts of New York for further proceedings.|$|E
2500|$|For instance, Sgt. Dale Ellington, a gunner on a B-17 bomber {{based in}} England, {{was shot at}} by German {{anti-aircraft}} fire in April 1944. The airplane was shot at again by Swiss fighters and anti-aircraft batteries after crossing the Swiss border and then landed at Dübendorf airfield. Initially interned in Adelboden, Ellington remained there until September when the American forces were approaching the France–Switzerland border. On 17 September 1944 Ellington slipped out by using his passable German to purchase train tickets for himself and three other internees. Dressed in civilian clothes, the group traveled unaccosted to a city near France, but they were questioned and arrested by an observant Swiss soldier. They were first confined in the Basel city jail {{for three days and}} then transferred to Wauwilermoos where Ellington recalled [...] "barbed wire, straw bunks, and guard dogs". After nearly one month in Wauwilermoos, Ellington and his fellows were transported to Bern to appear at the Swiss military tribunal. Each defendant was given a copy of the poorly translated charges, and had [...] "methodically listed the identities of the defendants, the charges against them, a catalog of evidence, and the names of their tribunal jurors”, in fact the only <b>trial</b> <b>record</b> they received.|$|E

2500|$|In {{their earlier}} appeals, {{the defense was}} limited to the <b>trial</b> <b>record.</b> The Governor's Committee, however, was not a {{judicial}} proceeding, so Judge Thayer's comments outside the courtroom could be used to demonstrate his bias. Once Thayer told reporters that [...] "No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!" [...] According to the affidavits of eyewitnesses, Thayer also lectured members of his clubs, calling Sacco and Vanzetti [...] "Bolsheviki!" [...] and saying he would [...] "get them good and proper". During the Dedham trial's first week, Thayer said to reporters: [...] "Did you ever see a case in which so many leaflets and circulars have been spread...saying people couldn't get a fair trial in Massachusetts? You wait till I give my charge to the jury, I'll show them!" [...] In 1924, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer at Dartmouth, his alma mater, and said: [...] "Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day. I guess that will hold them for a while.... Let them go to the Supreme Court now and see what they can get out of them." [...] The Committee knew that, following the verdict, Boston Globe reporter Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer's blatant bias. Thayer's behavior both inside the courtroom and outside of it had become a public issue, with the New York World attacking Thayer as [...] "an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case." ...|$|E
50|$|The trial {{typically}} {{goes through}} stages of: initial registration, ongoing record updates, and basic summary result submission. Each <b>trial</b> <b>record</b> {{is administered by}} <b>trial</b> <b>record</b> manager. A <b>trial</b> <b>record</b> manager typically provides initial trial registration prior the study enrolls the first participant. This also facilitates informing potential participants that the trial is no longer recruiting participants. Once all participants were recruited, the <b>trial</b> <b>record</b> may be updated to indicate that is closed to recruitment. Once all measurements are collected (the trial formally completes), the trial status is updated to 'complete'. If the trial terminates for some reason (e.g., lack of enrollment, evidence of initial adverse outcomes), the status may be updated to 'terminated'. Once final trial results are known or legal deadlines are met, the <b>trial</b> <b>record</b> manager may upload basic summary results to the registry either by filling a complex web-based form or submitting a compliant XML file.|$|E
