25|$|Aside from a {{contract}} that creates a security interest to back repayment of a debt, creditors to a company, and particularly trade creditors may deploy two main equivalents security. The effect is to produce proprietary rights which place them ahead of the general body of creditors. First, a trade creditor who sells goods to a company (which may go into insolvency) can contract for a retention of title clause. This means {{that even though the}} seller of goods may have passed possession to a buyer, until the price of sale is paid, the seller has never passed property. The company and creditor agree that title to the property is retained by the seller until the date of payment. In the leading case, Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd a Dutch company making aluminium foil stipulated in its contract with Romalpa Aluminium Ltd that when it supplied the foil, ownership would only passed once the price had been paid, and that any products made by Romalpa would be held by them as bailees. When Romalpa went insolvent, another creditor claimed that its floating charge covered the foil and products. The Court of Appeal held, however, that property in the foil had never become part of Romalpa's estate, and so could not be covered by the charge. Furthermore, the clause was not void for want to registration because only assets belonging to the company and then charged needed to be registered. In later cases, the courts have held that if property is mixed during a manufacturing process so that it is no longer identifiable, or if it is sold onto a buyer, then the retention of title clause ceases to have effect. If the property is something that can be mixed (such as oil) and the clause prohibits this, then the seller may retain a percentage share of the mixture as a <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> But if the clause purports to retain title over no more than a part of the property, Re Bond Worth Ltd held that the clause must take effect in equity, and so requires registration. The present requirements in the Companies Act 2006 section 860 continue not to explicitly cover retention of title clauses, in contrast to the registration requirements in the US Uniform Commercial Code article 9. This requires that anything with the same effect as a security interest requires registration, and so covers retention of title provision.|$|E

60|$|Sect. 26. God, who hath {{given the}} world to men in common, hath also given them reason {{to make use of}} it to the best {{advantage}} of life, and convenience. The earth, and all that is therein, is given to men for the support and comfort of their being. And tho' all the fruits it naturally produces, and beasts it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are produced by the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a private dominion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of men, there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some way or other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular man. The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure, and is still a <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.|$|E

40|$|The term 2 ̆ 2 {{partnership}} estates 2 ̆ 2 is used {{to designate}} a certain class of resulting trusts. These particular resulting trusts are classed with joint estates because, as a usual thing, the legal title is held by {{all the members of}} a partnership as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> and <b>in</b> equity, the partners are considered as joint tenants for the purpose of administering the trust. But the legal title is not necessarily held by all the members as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common; for it may be vested in one of the partners as <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> severalty; in which case there is not only the resulting partnership trust, but an additional subordinate resulting trust to the partners as equitable <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> The legal title may be in one or in several. As will be shown, the partners bear a two-fold relation to the beneficial interest in the property; for each has a separate and distinct lien on the property for any balance which may be found to be due him on an accounting; and as to this lien, his interest is purely potential: the balance on an accounting having been paid, the partners now own the residue of the beneficial interest as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>common...</b>|$|R

50|$|Estates may be held jointly as joint tenants {{with rights}} of {{survivorship}} or as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> The difference <b>in</b> {{these two types}} of joint ownership of an estate in land is basically the inheritability of the estate and the shares of interest that each tenant owns.|$|R

50|$|The modern law of {{landlord}} and <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> law jurisdictions {{retains the}} influence of the common law and, particularly, the laissez-faire philosophy that dominated the law of contract and property law in the 19th century. With the growth of consumerism, consumer protection legislation recognised that common law principles, which assume equal bargaining power between the contracting parties, create hardships when that assumption is inaccurate. Consequently, reformers have emphasised the need to assess residential tenancy laws in terms of protection they provide to tenants. Legislation to protect tenants is now common.|$|E

In 1897, this company was liquidated, and its interests were sold first to William Ansel Kinney, and then to Fred Wundenberg, all of Honolulu.
