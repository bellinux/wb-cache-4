North of the Swan River, the traffic volume gradually decreased to under 40,000 vehicles per weekday near the northern terminus, in 2007–08.

5|$|Once {{production}} began {{it became}} apparent that Part One and Part Two were under-running so more dialogue was written to fill in the time. It was originally intended that the character of Jackson would not reappear after the second episode, but during filming Saward became concerned that it appeared that he had been executed and so he and Clegg rewrote Part Three to include him. Part Three also looked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> running so scenes from Part Four were brought forward and the final scenes with the Guardians were extended to compensate.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing, {{agriculture}} {{and the loss}} of wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat for the African crake in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, it appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> no real threat.|$|E

5|$|According to the Constitution of 1831, the Belgian {{government}} {{was allowed to}} override {{the wishes of the}} King if he had been declared incompetent to reign. On 28 May 1940, under pressure from the French government, the Pierlot government in France declared the King <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> the power of the invaders and unfit to reign according to article 82, providing strong legal foundations and making itself the only official source of government. The government, however, refused to declare a republic. Although the King technically remained the only person able to receive diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able to do both during the war independently.|$|E

5|$|Both {{species may}} be {{affected}} by poor weather. Breeding colonies of Brazza's martins in river sandbars are liable to flooding, {{but this does not}} appear to be having a serious impact, and this species appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> no immediate threat. Its ability to use degraded habitats also aids its survival. Tropical cyclones present a threat to the Mascarene martin, particularly on the small islands inhabited by the nominate subspecies. The populations on Mauritius and Réunion were badly affected by a six-day cyclone in February 1861, taking many years to recover, but by about 1900 it was reported to be common but local, and in 1973–74 there were 200–400 pairs on Réunion and 70–75 pairs in Mauritius. More recent cyclones, like one in 1980, seem to have had less damaging effects than the 1861 storm. Several species have been lost from the Mascarene islands since human colonisation in the seventeenth century, but the martin and the Mascarene swiftlet occur on all the main islands, and are less vulnerable to the effects of human activities, especially since they can utilise houses for nest sites.|$|E
5|$|Brazza's martin may be hunted by humans, {{and both}} species may be {{infected}} {{with a variety}} of parasites. These swallows may be affected by poor weather when breeding, but neither appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> serious threat. The small islands which are the home of the Mascarene martin subspecies P. b. borbonica may be devastated by cyclones, which have the potential to cause severe temporary losses to the populations on Mauritius and Réunion. The legal protection afforded to the Phedina martins varies with jurisdiction, and ranges from none for Mascarene martins on Réunion to special protection for the same species on Madagascar. The Brazza's martin is not a protected species anywhere in its range.|$|E
