25|$|As Bryan being pinned led to {{the loss}} of the tag team titles, Bryan became obsessed about proving that he was not the weak link of Team Hell No and, as a result, Bryan became even more aggressive, but his overzealous {{behavior}} led to Team Hell No losing their rematch against Rollins and Reigns on the May 27 episode of Raw. When Kane <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> Bryan, he replied with harsh rebukes that alienated Kane from him and, as a result, Bryan was paired with Randy Orton despite their poor relationship to face a common enemy in The Shield. During this storyline, Bryan was praised as the best performer in WWE and having an unmatched connection with crowds by critics, peers and veterans of the professional wrestling industry.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} in time Jewish {{immigration}} to Mandatory Palestine continued, while to some opinions a similar, but less documented, immigration also took place in the Arab sector, bringing workers from Syria and other neighbouring areas. Palestinian Arabs saw this rapid influx of Jewish immigrants as a threat to their homeland and their identity as a people. Moreover, Jewish policies of purchasing land and prohibiting the employment of Arabs in Jewish-owned industries and farms greatly angered the Palestinian Arab communities. Demonstrations were held as early as 1920, protesting what the Arabs felt were unfair preferences for the Jewish immigrants set forth by the British mandate that governed Palestine at the time. This resentment led to outbreaks of violence later that year, as the al-Husseini incited riots broke out in Jerusalem. Winston Churchill's 1922 White Paper <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> the Arab population, denying that the creation of a Jewish state was the intention of the Balfour Declaration.|$|E

500|$|A comment he {{made during}} the debate became another {{campaign}} issue for Thompson. He again apologized for remarks, this time over an {{answer to a question}} in which he stated that he believed the decision to fire a gay worker based on the morals of the employer is something that should be [...] "left up to the individual business." [...] A few days following the debate, the candidate rescinded the comments, and blamed the gaffe on a malfunctioning hearing aid, stating that he [...] "didn't hear the question." [...] Thompson also said that he was sick during the debate, having been hospitalized three days earlier with the flu and bronchitis, and that all he could think about [...] "was getting off the stage." [...] Campaign adviser Steve Grubbs would later point to this episode as the moment Thompson's campaign became [...] "unrecoverable." [...] Thompson was harshly criticized for the remarks. Jason Stephany, the political director of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, rhetorically asked [...] "How many times is he going to say something that's completely offensive to the majority of Americans before people start to say, 'What's going on here?'" [...] Thompson <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> the public that there was [...] "nothing discriminatory about [...] at all." [...] Afterwards, he finished second in a poll of state convention members from Wisconsin, with 84 of the 306 members polled, trailing Fred Thompson who received 95 votes. He stood at 16% in an average of statewide polls for the state in May, and stood at 4.3% in Iowa, where he based his campaign.|$|E

Thereupon 60 ISS militants entered the town and captured it without further fighting, hoisting their flag on top of the police station and the building where Ali Fahiye Gedi had been imprisoned. Even though the jihadists <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> the local population by telling them [...] "don't panic, we will rule you according to the Islamic sharia (law)", Qandala's elders asked them to leave, to which the militants insisted that [...] "they are not going anywhere".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1966, Condon agreed to {{consider}} the Air Force's offer. He was among the best known and most distinguished scientists of his time. Condon's tenacious encounters with the House Unamerican Activities Committee and other government Loyalty Boards in the 1940s and 1950s made him [...] "almost legendary" [...] among fellow scientists. On Condon's behalf, Robert J. Low, an assistant dean of the university's graduate program, explored faculty reaction to the proposed project and found it mixed and wary. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> those who found the enterprise unworthy of scientific investigation. Low told the Denver Post that the project had met the University's acceptance threshold by the narrowest of margins and was accepted largely because {{it was difficult to}} say no to the Air Force. Some have suggested that finances were factor in Colorado's decision to accept the Air Force's offer of $313,000 for the project. Condon dismissed this suggestion, noting that $313,000 was a rather modest budget for an undertaking scheduled to last more than a year with a staff of over a dozen.|$|E

[...] Puyi commented that he felt at that moment utterly [...] "terrified" [...] at the death cult fanaticism of Bushido ("the way of the warrior") which reduced the value of human life down to nothing, as to die for the Emperor {{was the only thing that}} mattered; he observed that the Japanese infantrymen all had families and friends who cared for them, and had quite possibly been bullied by their officers into becoming [...] "human bullets". Yoshioka <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> Puyi by saying that the [...] "human bullets" [...] were crying [...] "manly Japanese tears" [...] as deep down they wanted to die for the Emperor, but Puyi later stated he was not convinced by this argument.|$|E
2500|$|The Ennahda Movement {{had long}} been banned in the {{political}} spectrum by former President Ben Ali, most notably in the 1989 elections where some of its members had to run independently due to government repression. Two years after the elections Ben Ali jailed nearly 25,000 of its activists with Ennahda militants responding by attacking the ruling party's headquarters killing one person and splashing acid on others. Following the revolution, it described itself to be a [...] "moderate Islamist" [...] party by advocating democracy and recognizing political pluralism and dialogue with the West. Its supporters back then regarded the party {{as an example of}} how a balance can be struck between modernity and Islamism while its critics viewed it as a threat to secularism in Tunisia, which was often regarded as the most secular Arab state. In addition, leading Ennahda figures have repeatedly <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> worrying Tunisians that it would protect civil rights and democracy. However, the movement was accused to have been shaped by Qutbism and is highly influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt and many of its secular opponents pointing out to acid attacks on female students in the 1980s for dressing [...] "indecently" [...] as a warning sign from Islamist repression. It is also believed that Rashid al-Ghannushi himself, the co-founder of the party had a long history of violent thinking. Following Ben Ali's ouster, the party was legalized and Ghannushi was welcomed by a crowd of 1,000 people upon his return to the country after 22 years of exile in Europe. Ghannushi later formed an alliance called the Troika with two secular political parties which are Moncef Marzouki's CPR and the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties.|$|E
