50|$|A Faraday cage is {{composed}} of a conductor that completely surrounds an area on all sides, top, and bottom. Electromagnetic radiation is blocked where the wavelength is longer than any gaps. For example, mobile <b>telephone</b> signals are <b>blocked</b> in windowless metal enclosures that approximate a Faraday cage, such as elevator cabins, and parts of trains, cars, and ships. The same problem can affect signals in buildings with extensive steel reinforcement.|$|R
50|$|Ipsos MORI's {{research}} is conducted via {{a wide range}} of methodologies, especially computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), as well as face-to-face and internet surveys. Telephone surveys use a method called random digit dialing (Ipsos MORI being exempt from the Telephone Preference Service as it only <b>blocks</b> <b>telephone</b> calls that involve selling). This system basically uses randomly generated, but area-specific, telephone numbers. This is the preferred method for telephone samples as ex-directory households are included thus not biasing the sample in any way. Ipsos MORI are able to lawfully use this technology as they use it for research purposes as opposed to sales and advertising.|$|R
25|$|Rough seas were {{reported}} mainly between Coatzacoalcos and Tampico; the ports {{of those two}} cities were closed during the passage of Diana, according to the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional. While passing through the Bay of Campeche and the southern Gulf of Mexico, Diana produced waves up to 12ft (3.6m) in height. On mainland Mexico, the states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, and Puebla were hardest hit, with over 75,000 people affected by the hurricane. In Poza Rica, high winds toppled trees and electricity poles, which cut off telephone services and electricity supply to the city. Fallen trees and <b>telephone</b> wires also <b>blocked</b> some streets in the area, but the major roads remained open.|$|R
50|$|Announcement of the 424 overlay {{created an}} uproar in Los Angeles's {{politically}} powerful Westside community, {{in part because}} the change would necessitate dialing 10 digits even when calling local numbers. Championed by Los Angeles Times columnist Robert Scheer in the paper's Santa Monica insert section, a protest movement arose in May 1999, focusing on the idea of telephone-number conservation. In a carry-over from the analog phone-system days, numbers were still being distributed to <b>telephone</b> companies in <b>blocks</b> of 10,000, leading to a huge volume of unused telephone numbers in each area code. Responding to the controversy, the California Assembly passed the Consumer Area Code Relief Act of 1999 on September 9, 1999, and the 424 overlay was tabled.|$|R

5000|$|According to {{a report}} in The Guardian:Such was the popular mood (remember the queues across the bridges near Westminster Abbey) that the words of the poem, so plain as {{scarcely}} to be poetic, seemed to strike a chord. Not since Audens Stop All the Clocks in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral had a piece of funerary verse made such an impression on the nation. In the days immediately after the service, there was frantic correspondence and speculation about the poems possible provenance. [...] "Systems crashed and <b>telephone</b> lines were <b>blocked</b> at the Times," [...] reported columnist Philip Howard, and the lines were attributed variously to Immanuel Kant, Joyce Grenfell and nameless Native Americans.

A <b>telephone</b> line <b>blocks</b> our way. We cut it and continue. A narrow path leads along the slope of a hill. The column marches forward in silence. Stop! A few rocks roll down the hill. I catch sight of a man surveying the silence. I cocked my rifle. Gibly crawls over to me, [...] "Har, for God's sake, a knife!!" [...] His clenched teeth glitter in the dark and his whole body is tight, his mind alert, [...] "For God's sake," ... I put my tommy down and unsheath my machete. We crawl towards the lone figure as he begins to sing a trilled Arab tune. Soon the singing will turn into a death moan. I am shaking, every muscle in my body is tense. This is my first experience with this type of weapon. Will I be able to do it?We draw closer. There he stands, only a few meters in front of us. We leap. Gibly grabs him and I plunge the knife deep into his back. The blood pours over his striped cotton shirt. With not a second to lose, I react instinctively and stab him again. The body groans, struggles and then becomes quiet and still.|$|R
5000|$|International relief teams {{arrived in}} the region within several days. Relief efforts were impeded by fallen <b>telephone</b> poles, which <b>blocked</b> the supplies.

He called for a rapid international response to the quake, and said he would keep its victims in his prayers. A Taiwanese rescue team was sent to help victims of the tremor, the first from the country to take part in rescue efforts aside from Asia. The United States donated US$ 25,000 instantly to relief organizations, Japan offering a grant of US$140,000 and Australia US$143,000 in addition to a two-person team of emergency relief examiners.|$|R
500|$|In {{preparations}} for Diana, {{there were several}} tropical storm watches and warning issued along the Yucatán Peninsula and several areas along the Gulf Coast of Mexico; hurricane watches and warnings were also put into effect. While crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, Diana produced near-tropical storm force winds, and heavy rainfall, but not damage or fatalities. However, the mainland of Mexico fared much worse, where torrential rainfall caused mudslides in the states of Hidalgo and Veracruz. As a result of heavy rainfall, [...] many houses were destroyed, and approximately 3,500 became homeless. Diana also produced high winds across Mexico, which toppled tree and fell electricity poles, leaving many without <b>telephone</b> service and <b>block</b> several roads. In addition, the remnants of Diana brought rainfall to the southwestern United States. Contemporary reports indicated that 139people had been killed, with an additional 25,000 people being injured. Damage {{as a result of}} Diana was estimated at $90.7 million (1990 USD, $ USD).|$|R
5000|$|In August 1968, Sayle {{was sent}} to Prague to cover the Warsaw Pact {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia. Fellow journalist Harold Jackson has written of Sayle's ingenuity in getting their stories out of the country. International <b>telephone</b> calls were <b>blocked,</b> and the Russians had seized the Prague telex exchange. Sayle and Jackson discovered {{that not all of}} the telex connections were blocked and spent 13 hours dialling [...] "the 10,000 possibilities" [...] to find a working telex code. After discovering several working exchanges, Jackson recalled that the enterprising Sayle sold the numbers to other journalists at [...] "$100 a pop." [...] Another obstacle facing the foreign press in Prague was a shortage of Czech crowns. Sayle took Jackson with him {{to the office of the}} Czech firm responsible for distribution of The Times in Czechoslovakia. Sayle claimed to be the publisher's personal representative and demanded that the man turn over funds that had not been remitted due to exchange restrictions. Jackson recalled, [...] "We left the building with huge packs of Czech crowns stashed in a linen bag rustled up from some cupboard. They kept the foreign press corps functioning for weeks, no doubt at a suitable rate of exchange." ...|$|R
