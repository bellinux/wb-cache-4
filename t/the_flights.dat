5|$|The {{airport was}} inaugurated on 15 May 2010 by then Chief Minister B. S. Yeddyurappa. Many {{airlines}} remained reluctant to begin flights, expecting poor passenger numbers and taking {{issue with the}} airport's inability to handle jet aircraft. Ultimately, Kingfisher Airlines announced it would introduce flights from Chennai via Bangalore in October, just {{before the start of}} Dasara. <b>The</b> <b>flights</b> were operated by Kingfisher Red. However, Kingfisher discontinued service to Mysore the following November. Although <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> had performed well during Dasara, occupancy declined thereafter. In addition, Kingfisher was dealing with financial problems and had decided to end Kingfisher Red operations.|$|E
5|$|After {{an hour on}} the ground, the {{helicopters}} left with the first 61 evacuees, including all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets on one of <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced {{the helicopters}} to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E
5|$|Jan Mayensfield's single {{regular service}} is the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules, which operate {{to the island}} eight times per year. The {{aircraft}} {{are part of the}} 335 Squadron, based at Gardermoen Air Station, although <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> from Jan Mayen operate from Bodø Main Air Station. The runway is not open for commercial traffic, although it can be used for research and search and rescue operations.|$|E
2500|$|The Navigation section {{changed the}} McMurdo {{waypoint}} co-ordinate {{stored in the}} ground computer system at approximately [...] {{on the morning of}} <b>the</b> <b>flight.</b> Crucially, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> crew of Flight 901 was not notified of <b>the</b> change. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> plan printout given to the crew on the morning of <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> which was subsequently entered by them into the aircraft's INS, differed from <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> plan presented at the 9 November briefing and from Captain Collins' map mark-ups which he had prepared the night before <b>the</b> fatal <b>flight.</b> <b>The</b> key difference was that <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> plan presented at the briefing corresponded to a track down McMurdo Sound, giving Mount Erebus a wide berth to the east, whereas <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> plan printed on the morning of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> corresponded to a track that coincided with Mount Erebus, which would result in a collision with Mount Erebus if this leg was flown at an altitude of less than [...]|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> number since <b>the</b> {{accident}} {{has been}} re-numbered to 319 for <b>the</b> outbound <b>flight</b> and 320 for <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> back to Bangkok.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> was {{operated}} by Cheremshanka Airlines, a regional airliner based at Krasnoyark Cheremshanka Airport. The Yakovlev Yak-40 was carrying 24 passengers and 4 crews, consisting of 21 adults and 3 children. The pilot of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> was Captain Danilov A. A and the co-pilot was First Officer Shcherbakov A. G. The {{rest of the}} crew were Shurpatov, <b>the</b> <b>flight's</b> mechanic and A. Krotov, <b>the</b> <b>flight's</b> flight attendant.|$|R
5|$|On 2 February 1954 {{the airline}} began {{international}} flights, carrying 18 passengers from Tokyo to San Francisco on a Douglas DC-6B City of Tokyo via Wake Island and Honolulu. <b>The</b> <b>flights</b> between Tokyo and San Francisco are still Flights 1 and 2, to commemorate its first international service. The early flights were advertised as being operated by American crews and serviced by United Air Lines in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights issued {{their own}} factual {{statement}} to the press in January. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> did not create public excitement—if people even knew about them—and the news soon faded. In Paris, however, Aero Club of France members, already stimulated by Chanute's reports of Wright gliding successes, took the news more seriously and increased their efforts {{to catch up to}} the brothers.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, the {{airfield}} {{was used by}} charter flights carrying foreign tourists and by flights transporting dignitaries to the city, such as Jawaharlal Nehru. The Indian Air Force operated training flights at the airport as well. In 1985, regional airline Vayudoot commenced thrice weekly flights from Bangalore using its Dornier Do 228 aircraft. The service was inaugurated by famous Indian writer R. K. Narayan. At the time, Mysore Airport consisted solely of a grass airstrip and a one-roomed terminal with one toilet. Because of low passenger loads, <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> ended in 1990.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> was a {{commercial}} cargo flight carrying at least 28, including a flight crew of five. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> manifest stated {{that there were}} 16 passengers aboard, but more boarded <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> shortly before takeoff.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Navy issues <b>the</b> <b>Flight</b> Nurse Badge in {{a single}} degree. None of the other {{military}} branches maintains an equivalent to <b>the</b> <b>Flight</b> Nurse Badge. <b>The</b> decoration is similar to <b>the</b> <b>Flight</b> Surgeon Badge.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> {{crew was}} five (two pilots, navigator, and radio {{operator}} with <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> engineer {{in a separate}} compartment behind <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck opposite crew rest berths) {{and there were two}} stewards to attend to the passengers.|$|R
5|$|From 1950, Braathens SAFE started flying charter {{services}} to Europe with Douglas DC-6, mainly to Copenhagen and Paris. DNL protested because Braathens SAFE was charging too low ticket prices, while DDL protested against <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> to Copenhagen. In September 1951, Braathens SAFE offered Danish authorities to fly all domestic routes without subsidies, {{but this was}} rejected because such a permit could only be issued to Danish airlines. After World War II, only Fornebu, Stavanger Airport, Sola and Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik were in use as land airport. A plan for construction was passed by parliament in 1952, that based the financing of airports as joint civilian and military airports, with funding from NATO.|$|E
5|$|From December 1978 to May 1980, Braniff International Airways leased 11 Concordes, five from Air France and six from British Airways. These {{were used}} on subsonic flights between Dallas-Fort Worth and Washington Dulles International Airport, flown by Braniff flight crews. Air France and British Airways crews then took {{over for the}} {{continuing}} supersonic flights to London and Paris. The aircraft were registered in both the United States and their home countries; the European registration was covered while being operated by Braniff, retaining full AF/BA liveries. <b>The</b> <b>flights</b> were not profitable and typically less than 50% booked, forcing Braniff to end its tenure as the only US Concorde operator in May 1980.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013 the {{investigation}} board was {{made aware of}} that two passengers had each their Mobira NMT-450 mobile telephone with them on <b>the</b> <b>flights.</b> As this had not been mentioned in the original report, AIBN conducted {{a review of the}} issue and especially if the telephones could have influenced the vertical navigation. They concluded in December that this was not the case, as there were no indications of interferences and that there are no instances where electromagnetic interference has been a contributing cause to an aviation accident.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> {{originated}} in Miami at 10:22 PM the previous evening, landed at Tampa at 11:00 PM, and departed for New Orleans at 11:22 PM. The last radio contact with <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> was at 12:44 AM, when <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> contacted company radio in New Orleans. Radar operators {{at a military}} station at Houma, Louisiana, picked up <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> at 12:46 AM.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> rock {{platform}} is situated {{on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> rock cage and has several levers built into it that allow the Stone Pilot to control the temperature with bellows and cooling rods. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> burners are flaming torches mounted near <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> rock and connected to it through metal pipes that provide the heat needed to control the sky ship's altitude.|$|R
50|$|The {{third row}} {{consisted}} of the PAO, PROCEDURES, and <b>the</b> FAO (<b>flight</b> activities officer), who coordinated with <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> schedule. <b>The</b> AFD (assistant <b>flight</b> director) and <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> director were also located on the third row.|$|R
5|$|Membership {{into the}} program is free. The program is divided into four tiers: Green, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. Infinity MileageLands {{privileges}} are additive by membership tier, with higher tiers including all benefits listed for prior tiers. The program accepts miles flown on partner airlines and Star Alliance partners such as All Nippon Airways and United Airlines, provided that <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> are booked and logged according to EVA Air frequent flier rules. Co-branded American Express, Citibank, and Diners Club cards can also earn miles. Qualification levels and general benefits are listed on the EVA Air website.|$|E
5|$|Mining ceased in Ny-Ålesund in 1929; it {{was taken}} up again in 1941, {{but because of the}} Second World War the town was {{evacuated}} the following year. From 1946, the Royal Norwegian Air Force started serving Ny-Ålesund with their Consolidated PBY Catalina amphibian aircraft. The aircraft were able to land if there was no ice on the fjord and lighting and weather permitted it. The first flight took place on 10 May and consisted of post drops. No further flights were carried out until 1949; one of <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> that year was an air ambulance operation. The service also dropped post at the other Norwegian settlements in Svalbard. In 1961, the Catalinas were replaced with Grumman HU-16B Albatross aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began running up and down <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> of stairs of the 29-story hotel.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} active volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc, Cleveland has erupted at least 22times in the last 230years. A VEI 3 {{eruption}} in 1944 produced the arc's only known volcanic fatality. Most recently Mount Cleveland has erupted three times in 2009, twice in 2010, once in 2011 and in 2016 and 2017. The volcano's remoteness limits opportunities for its study, and the Alaska Volcano Observatory relies heavily on satellites for monitoring. The volcano is primarily hazardous to aircraft; many of <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> over the north Pacific approach the vicinity of the volcano, and volcanic ash released from eruptions can damage sensitive electronic equipment and sensors.|$|E
5|$|Trans Polar A/S was a Norwegian {{charter airline}} which {{operated}} between June 1970 and May 1971. The airline operated {{a fleet of}} three Boeing 720s and had a close cooperation with Aer Lingus for maintenance. Trans Polar was established by Thor Tjøntveit, although he never held any management positions. The airline was headquartered in Oslo, although most of <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> operated out of Copenhagen, Denmark, which was the base of Spies Rejser, Trans Polar's largest customer. The airline held operating permission from Norway and Denmark, but not Sweden; nevertheless, they operated several illegal flights out of Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Widerøe {{operates}} all {{scheduled services}} out of Førde, connecting it to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Bergen Airport, Flesland {{with a combined}} seven daily flights. <b>The</b> <b>flights</b> are operated with Dash 8-100 aircraft and are subsidized {{as part of a}} public service obligation contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Førde Airport is the local airport for ten municipalities in Sunnfjord and outer Sogn. The airport had 82,356 passengers, 8,109 aircraft movements and 3 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Less than a fifth of the patronage travels to Bergen, and Førde even experiences some leakage by people driving to Bergen Airport directly.|$|E

5|$|With {{the closure}} of the rail terminus, Vauxhall Bridge's main source of revenue was {{visitors}} to the Vauxhall Gardens pleasure park. In addition to people visiting the Gardens themselves, Vauxhall Gardens were used as a launch point for hot air balloon flights, and large crowds would gather on the bridge and surrounding streets to watch <b>the</b> <b>flights.</b> A large crowd also assembled on the bridge in September 1844 to watch Mister Barry, a clown from Astley's Amphitheatre, sail from Vauxhall Bridge to Westminster Bridge in a washtub towed by geese.|$|E
5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but even then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E
5|$|Only 403 (45 percent) of {{the total}} number of sorties flown by Fighter Command were {{directed}} at the three major German raids. A further 56 (or just over 6 per cent) were standing patrols to protect shipping off the coast. Most of the remaining 427 sorties (nearly 50 per cent) were made to engage the reconnaissance aircraft. Usually several half-squadrons were committed. This was not excessive. But by sending more units to counter <b>the</b> <b>flights,</b> German aircraft were forced to fly higher and were denied the opportunity to drop to low altitude to take higher resolution photographs. This contributed to a lack of German intelligence which often failed to distinguish fighter, bomber and naval airfields from each other. Much of the time their strength was directed at non-fighter airfields on this date.|$|E
