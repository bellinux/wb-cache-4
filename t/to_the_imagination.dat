5|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century has often been called the Heroic Age of polar exploration.

5|$|Wollstonecraft {{promotes}} subjective experience, {{particularly in}} relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> than she had in previous works. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to {{the world with a}} commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.|$|E

25|$|During the 1930s, {{social issues}} dominated, and rural realism is {{reflected}} in the early subjects and gritty styles. Later work shows a more idealised landscape that owes more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> than the outdoor scenery. The work of the second generation of Hlebine School artists, such as Ivan Večenaj, and Mijo Kovačić date from the 1950s and 1960s, and include burlesque and grotesque figures, as well as works inspired by Biblical topics, with a strong use of colour.

25|$|The tiger's prey {{is beyond}} {{the edge of the}} canvas, so it is left <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> of the viewer to decide what the outcome will be, {{although}} Rousseau's original title Surprised! suggests the tiger has the upper hand. Rousseau later stated that the tiger was about to pounce on a group of explorers. Despite their apparent simplicity, Rousseau's jungle paintings were built up meticulously in layers, using a large number of green shades to capture the lush exuberance of the jungle. He also devised his own method for depicting the lashing rain by trailing strands of silver paint diagonally across the canvas, a technique inspired by the satin-like finishes of the paintings of William-Adolphe Bouguereau.|$|E
25|$|Las Meninas, {{in which}} Diego Velázquez {{depicted}} {{himself in a}} similar pose with brush and palette, is considered an important precedent for the Self-Portrait with Palette. There the painter stands almost {{in the background of}} his studio, while his models, the five-year-old Margarita Teresa of Spain and her servants, occupy the foreground. From here Manet appropriated the pose of the painter and his equipment, but as opposed to Velázquez, he makes himself the thematic center of the image. At the same time, however, he is working on a painting, but leaves its subject matter, as well as his surroundings, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> of the viewer. Manet himself between 1865 and 1870 portrayed Velázquez in a studio scene in which the Spanish painter is posed similarly to his self-portrait.|$|E
25|$|Attestations of Old Dutch {{sentences}} {{are extremely}} rare. The language is mostly recorded on fragmentary relics, and words have been reconstructed from Middle Dutch and loan words from Old Dutch in other languages. The oldest recorded {{is found in}} the Salic law. In this Frankish document written around 510 the oldest Dutch sentence has been identified: Maltho thi afrio lito ("I say to you, I free you, serf") used to free a serf. Another old fragment of Dutch is Visc flot aftar themo uuatare ("A fish was swimming in the water"). The oldest conserved larger Dutch text is the Utrecht baptismal vow (776–800) starting with Forsachistu diobolae... ec forsacho diabolae ("Do you forsake the devil?... I forsake the devil"). If only for its poetic content, the most famous Old Dutch sentence is probably Hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan, hinase hic enda tu, wat unbidan we nu ("All birds have started making nests, except me and you, what are we waiting for"), is dated to around the year 1100, written by a Flemish monk in a convent in Rochester, England. Since the sentence speaks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination,</b> it is often erroneously stated as the oldest Dutch sentence.|$|E

500|$|This is {{one play}} that Hazlitt felt cannot be {{properly}} represented on stage. Its beauties are primarily those of poetry: [...] "Poetry {{and the stage}} do not agree well together. The ideal can have no place upon the stage, which is a picture without perspective.

500|$|Although {{the first}} film was commended for leaving the shark <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> until {{two thirds of the}} way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as {{possible}} because the dramatic [...] "first image of it coming out of the water" [...] in {{the first film}} could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's Hitchcockian suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented {{that there was no way}} that they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.|$|E
40|$|In a {{democratic}} society where elections are held <b>to</b> decide <b>the</b> holders of political office or referendums formulated to get a majority vote on national issues, <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> most votes from eligible citizens remains a primary concern of politicians. I put forward the view that factual information alone {{is not enough to}} motivate voters. There is a need <b>to</b> consider <b>the</b> influence of <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> on voting behaviour. This thesis is first an attempt <b>to</b> locate <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> within <b>the</b> political sphere, and examine how political behaviour can be influenced through <b>the</b> <b>imagination.</b> <b>The</b> 2016 Brexit Referendum will be <b>the</b> example used <b>to</b> analyse how <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> plays an important part in politics. If one desires to have a good understanding on voting behaviour, a theory that includes <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> should be considered. Thus I argue for adopting the conceptual framework of David Hume over the standard rational choice theory in providing a framework of how imagination can influence voter behaviour, and at the same time, provide a framework towards my conception of <b>the</b> politics of <b>imagination...</b>|$|R

500|$|Gibbs {{published}} his first work in 1873. His {{papers on the}} geometric representation of thermodynamic quantities appeared in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy. These papers introduced the use of different type phase diagrams, which were his favorite aids <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> process when doing research, rather than the mechanical models, {{such as the ones}} that Maxwell used in constructing his electromagnetic theory, which might not completely represent their corresponding phenomena. [...] Although the journal had few readers capable of understanding Gibbs's work, he shared reprints with correspondents in Europe and received an enthusiastic response from James Clerk Maxwell at Cambridge. [...] Maxwell even made, with his own hands, a clay model illustrating Gibbs's construct. [...] He then produced two plaster casts of his model and mailed one to Gibbs. [...] That cast is on display at the Yale physics department.|$|E
500|$|The {{large sums}} of money being made and spent caused an upsurge in crime and illicit activity. This was {{exacerbated}} because police officers and state troopers resigned in large groups to become pipeline security guards at wages far in excess of those available in public-sector jobs. Fairbanks' Second Avenue became a notorious hangout for prostitutes, and dozens of bars operated throughout town. In 1975, the Fairbanks Police Department estimated between 40 and 175 prostitutes were working in the city of 15,000 people. In the frigid temperatures of the winter months throughout the 1970s it was common to see street-walking prostitutes in downtown Fairbanks, clad fully from head-to-toe in luxuriant fur coats (and leaving everything <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination).</b> Prostitutes brought pimps, who then engaged in [...] In 1976, police responded to a shootout between warring pimps who wielded automatic firearms.

500|$|Anne Carroll Moore, then {{in charge}} of the children's section at the New York Public Library, wrote an {{enthusiastic}} review in the Atlantic Monthly and invited Geisel to speak at the library.

[...] Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author Beatrix Potter, who wrote back, [...] "What an amusing picture book... I think it the cleverest book I have met with for many years. The swing and merriment of the pictures and the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions—and then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away. Dr. Seuss does it thoroughly!" [...] Geisel himself was later critical of the book, saying on its 25th anniversary, [...] "I think I was a little aloof, too outside there. It was written {{from the point of view}} of my mind, not the mind of a child." ...|$|E

500|$|Before the film's US {{television}} debut, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times {{was critical}} of the film's objectives: [...] "he trouble with The Girl is that it tries to psychoanalyze Hitchcock but fails by trying to know the man too much. It's a movie about Hitchcock that ignores his best advice: 'Suspense is like a woman. The more left <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination,</b> the more the excitement. Richard Brody of The New Yorker also gave the film a negative review, writing that, {{instead of being a}} drama, the film is an unoriginal work of criticism which [...] "points to what everyone ought already to have been talking about in the first place: not least, that it's no surprise to learn that a filmmaker whose art is devoted to pain, fear, control, and sexual obsession also experienced and inflicted them in life". On the day of its UK premiere, James Rampton of The Independent wrote that The Girl was [...] "no mere black-and-white hatchet job on Hitch. It does not seek to portray him as an unambiguous monster; rather, it highlights the profound psychological damage that plagued the director throughout his life". The Guardians Deborah Orr was generally positive about the film: [...] "here was only one thing wrong with The Girl. There was no Hitchcock in the director's chair to make it the utterly compelling psychological drama that it could have been." ...|$|E

[...] Kirby was complimentary of the artwork, writing that Carey [...] "sizzles" [...] on the cover and that the [...] "strapless frock leaves very little <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> as she smoulders for the camera." [...] A critic for the Belfast Telegraph also noted that Carey poses [...] "seductively" [...] for the shot. Robbie Daw for Idolator noted that it appeared as though the artwork had been photoshopped {{and that it is}} reminiscent of the cover art of Carey's tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005).

40|$|Abstract This article {{examines}} the use of film in the administrative ethics classroom, with special attention <b>to</b> energizing <b>the</b> moral <b>imagination</b> of professionals. Challenged by a shift in student demographics reflecting {{the emergence of the}} new public service, instructors must consider alternatives to pedagogies based on normative and applied ethics. Approaches designed <b>to</b> stimulate <b>the</b> moral <b>imagination</b> of students (based on contemporary metaethical perspectives) need to be considered. Using his experience with movies in the ethics classroom, the author argues that films are particularly effective in energizing <b>the</b> moral <b>imagination...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Wordsworth wrote, in {{reference}} to Lucy Gray, [...] "the {{way in which the}} incident was treated and the spiritualizing of the character might furnish hints for contrasting the imaginative influences which I have endeavoured to throw over common life with Crabbe's matter of fact style of treating subjects of the same kind". By this, Raymond Havens points out, Wordsworth is trying to pull away from realism into a state dominated by <b>the</b> <b>imagination.</b> <b>To</b> Wordsworth, <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> was connected <b>to</b> both ethics and aesthetics, and he sought <b>to</b> exalt <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> in Lucy Gray.
