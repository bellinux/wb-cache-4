5|$|The {{arrival of}} Protestant missionaries {{on a large}} scale {{beginning}} in 1814 was a primary contributor to the development of political awareness among Sri Lankan Tamils. Activities by missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and Methodist and Anglican churches led to a revival among Hindu Tamils who created their own social groups, built their own schools and temples, and published their own literature to counter the missionary activities. The success of this effort led to a new confidence for the Tamils, encouraging them <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> a community, and it paved the way for their emergence as a cultural, religious, and linguistic society in the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and {{while it is true that}} Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E
5|$|In the Padma Purana, {{the curse}} of the sages fails. In retribution, Shiva casts a curse on the sages so that they, like Bhikshatana, will become beggars with matted hair and be devoid of knowledge. Those who would still worship him would gain knowledge, wealth, and progeny, and be reborn into good families. In the Skanda Purana, the sages of the Deodar Forest are {{performing}} rituals and start <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> gods. To humble these arrogant sages, Shiva takes the form of Bhikshatana—an attractive young beggar—and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, the women wildly chase Shiva. When the sages regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger), and a dwarf, all of which attack Shiva, who overpowers them. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja, the Cosmic Dancer. The same legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some differences. This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja. The ceiling of the Shivakamasundari shrine in the Nataraja temple complex illustrates this legend in a series of frescos, where Bhikshatana is depicted as a white naked mendicant accompanied by a scantily-scad Mohini.|$|E

However around 83% of Muslims are proud to be a British citizen, compared to 79% of the general public, 77% of Muslims strongly identify with Britain while only 50% of the wider population do, 86.4% of Muslims feel they belong in Britain, slightly more than the 85.9% of Christians, 82% of Muslims want to live in diverse and mixed neighbourhoods compared to 63% of non-Muslim Britons. In polls taken across Europe 2006, British Muslims hold the most negative view of westerners out of all Muslims in Europe, whilst overall in Britain 63% of British hold the most favourable view of Muslims out of all the European countries (down from 67% the year before).|$|E

Five {{experiments}} confirmed this difference and explored the reasons for its occurrence. Asians, who are inclined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> in relation <b>to</b> others, {{are more likely}} than North Americans to invoke a reciprocity norm in exchanging gifts with casual acquaintances, and they refuse a gift {{in order to avoid the}} feeling of indebtedness they would experience if they cannot reciprocate. North Americans, however, who are inclined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> independently <b>of</b> others, are more likely to base their acceptance of the gift on its attractiveness without considering their obligation to reciprocate. These cultural differences are not evident when the gift is offered by a close friend with whom individuals have a communal relationship.

25|$|The {{process whereby}} the {{indigenous}} population of 'Wales' came <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Welsh is not clear. There is plenty of evidence {{of the use of}} the term Brythoniaid (Britons); by contrast, the earliest use of the word Kymry (referring not to the people but to the land—and possibly to northern Britain in addition to modern day territory of Wales) is found in a poem dated to about 633. The name of the region in northern England now known as Cumbria is derived from the same root. Only gradually did Cymru (the land) and Cymry (the people) come to supplant Brython. Although the Welsh language was certainly used at the time, Gwyn A. Williams argues that even at the time of the erection of Offa's Dyke, the people to its west saw themselves as Roman, citing the number of Latin inscriptions still being made into the 8th century. However, it is unclear whether such inscriptions reveal a general or normative use of Latin as a marker of identity or its selective use by the early Christian Church.|$|E
500|$|After 1707, a British {{national}} identity began to develop, {{though it was}} initially resisted, particularly by the English.

50|$|Reflected {{appraisal}} is a {{term used}} in psychology to describe a person's perception of how others see and evaluate him or her.

Forced to be ashamed of their African heritage, enslaved women were taught <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> and their culture as inferior. Specifically for enslaved mothers, singing songs and lullabies to their children proved to be an important resistance tactic as it allowed for traditions to be passed on in a somewhat discreet way.|$|R

500|$|Great Britain {{controlled}} the whole island by 1815, and unified the country administratively in 1833 with a legislative council that acted as {{advisor to the}} Governor. The council was composed of three Europeans and one representative each of the Sinhalese, the Sri Lankan Tamils, and the Burghers. But this situation changed in 1919 {{with the arrival of}} British Governor William Manning, who actively encouraged the idea of [...] "communal representation". He created the reformed legislative council in 1921 and its first election returned thirteen Sinhalese and three Tamils, a significant loss in representation for the Tamils when compared to the previous council based on direct appointment by the governor. Because of this, the Tamils began to develop a communal consciousness and <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> a minority community. They focused on communal representation in the council rather than national representation, and decided that their delegates should be leaders from their own community. [...] This new sense of community identity changed the direction of Tamil nationalism. Starting in the mid-1920s, [...] their developing national awareness transformed into a more active national consciousness, with a heightened determination to protect the interests of the Ceylon Tamil community. Influenced heavily by political history and, perhaps more importantly, Colombo-centered developments of the British administration, this emerging Tamil national consciousness led to the establishment of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress headed by Tamil politician, G. G. Ponnambalam.|$|E

2500|$|Bastard feudalism is a {{somewhat}} controversial term invented by modern historians {{to characterize the}} form feudalism took in the Late Middle Ages, primarily in England.

The model originates ultimately in the later Middle Ages, when the Germanic-speaking subjects of the Scottish king began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Scots, and began the ethnic and cultural disassociation of Scottish and Gaelic, previously two identical concepts, by calling their own brand of English Scottis and renaming Scottis as Erse.

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the first phase is to psychologically break down the recruit. At this point, {{civilian}} thoughts and habits are considered detrimental to training, so they are squashed during this period by intense physical training, unchanging routines, strict discipline and heavy instruction. The process is designed to enable recruits to learn to survive in combat situations and generally to adapt and overcome any unexpected situation. One of the principal ideals learned during this period is that recruits are not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> individuals—they {{are not permitted to}} use first person or second person pronouns. Instead, recruits are required to use third-person referrals, such as referring to themselves as [...] "This recruit" [...] and accomplish all tasks with teamwork. Any actions that put the benefit of an individual over the benefit of the other recruits are not permitted and recruits are expected to conform to a standard that does not tolerate personal deviance or eccentricities. Speed, intensity and volume when speaking are valued as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this article {{analyses}} the normative approach of the social economy. The social economy is developed in order to create an alternative economic and social space for the people excluded from life necessities and, furthermore, it is not a recent phenomenon; it relies on historical practices which have developed over several centuries in order to meet people’s needs. The social economy institutions from Romania and Greece are then presented. The purpose is to show that clear regulations contribute to the acceptance of the social economy as an alternative and complementary form of producing social welfare. In order to accomplish the normative purposes of meeting life’s necessities and of changing the existing social conditions, the social economy actors must start <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> not as individual agents, but as belonging to a large movement acting within the continuum between the market and state intervention for welfare production. </p...|$|R

30|$|Social {{survival}} {{requires the}} regulation of our impulses. But {{in many ways the}} corruption of the conscience (superego) is responsible for the extent of an individual’s anti-social behaviour. For instance, when a distorted sense of guilt is manifested from the conscience state, such as the case where the child is punished for holding hands with another child, the child may grow up <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> or their actions as evil. They may be physically or emotionally impotent, or, alternatively, they may try to achieve physical contact in any way possible (even violently) because of the internal conflict imposed by the distorted belief of the conscience. Freud’s analysis of the human personality demonstrates {{how hard it is to}} experience a sense of freedom when the unconscious mind is poised to punish. From a Yogic perspective the idea of liberation is closely aligned with using meditative practice to transcend such punitive psychical processesae.|$|R
