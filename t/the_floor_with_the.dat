5|$|The round ribbontail ray has a thick {{pectoral}} fin disc wider {{than it is}} long, with a smoothly rounded outer margin. The eyes are of medium size and are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin between the oval nostrils, with a finely fringed trailing margin. The mouth is wide and curved, with faint furrows at the corners. There is a row of seven papillae on <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 37–46 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 39–45 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small with a deep groove across the crown, and are arranged in a dense quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights on <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television.|$|E
25|$|En pointe dancers employ pointe {{technique}} to determine foot placement and body alignment. When exhibiting proper technique, a dancer's en pointe foot is placed {{so that the}} instep is fully stretched, with toes perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pointe shoe's platform (the flattened tip of the toe box) square to the floor so that {{a substantial part of}} its surface is contacting the floor.|$|E

30|$|From the Tables  1 and 3, it is {{seen that}} the {{responses}} of two adjacent structures, when they are connected at all <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same damping in all the dampers {{and when they are}} connected with 50 % of total dampers with different damping coefficient, are almost nearer. Hence, it leads to conclude that the reduction in the responses, when connected with 50 % of total dampers with different damping in LED is as much as when they are connected at all <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same damping in all the LED, reduces the cost of the dampers almost 50 %.|$|R

25|$|The primary work {{is between}} mother and therapist. It {{is based on the}} notion of the infant as {{initiator}} in infant–parent psychotherapy. For half the session the mother gets down on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> infant, observes it and interacts only on the infant's initiative. The idea is that it increases the mother's sensitivity and responsiveness by fostering an observational reflective stance, whilst also being physically accessible. Also the infant has the experience of negotiating their relationship with their mother. For the second half the mother discusses her observations and experiences.|$|E
25|$|Irish Setters {{are also}} widely used as therapy dogs {{in schools and}} hospitals. Therapy dogs are {{permitted}} in hospitals with special permission and can visit patients on the assigned floors. This is a venue where the therapy dogs are permitted in schools and then asked to sit with children as the students read to the Irish Setter. This process helps to enable the student {{the ability to read}} without being corrected or judged. Generally the Irish Setter will lie on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> student as the student continues to read, in this calming and relaxed setting.|$|E
25|$|The sanctum has two floors. The Sikh Scripture Guru Granth Sahib {{is seated}} on the lower square floor for about 20 hours everyday, and for 4 hours it is taken to its bedroom inside Akal Takht with {{elaborate}} ceremonies in a palki, for sukhasana and prakash. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> seated scripture is raised a few steps above the entrance causeway level. The upper floor in the sanctum is a gallery and connected by stairs. The ground floor is lined with white marble, as is the path surrounding the sanctum. The sanctum's exterior has gilded copper plates. The doors are gold foil covered copper sheets with nature motifs such as birds and flowers. The ceiling of the upper floor is gilded, embossed and decorated with jewels. The sanctum dome is semi-spherical with a pinnacle ornament. The sides are embellished with arched copings and small solid domes, the corners adorning cupolas, {{all of which are}} covered with gold foil covered gilded copper.|$|E

500|$|The estuary {{stingray}} has a diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc about {{as wide as}} long, with gently convex anterior margins and broadly rounded outer corners. The snout is wide and triangular, and tapers to a point. The small, widely spaced eyes are immediately followed by the spiracles. Between the long and narrow nostrils, there is a short and broad [...] "skirt" [...] of skin with a weakly fringed posterior margin. The small, bow-shaped mouth is surrounded by deep furrows and contains a row of five papillae across <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outermost pair tiny and set apart from the others. The teeth are small and arranged into pavement-like surfaces. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are relatively large.|$|E
500|$|When {{assessing}} Lady Rosebery's behaviour to {{her children}} {{it should be remembered}} that she lived in an era of plentiful nannies, wet nurses, nursemaids and governesses which the upper classes employed as the norm. These people were employed regardless of the mother's affection towards her children; it was inconceivable that a countess would nurse her own children, and to do so would have been breaking social conventions. Hence her seeming lack of attention {{to her children}} was not unusual– she was following the upper class conventions and [...] "stiff upper lip" [...] philosophies of her era. However, in spite of their prolonged absences from their children, the Roseberys do not appear to have been very distant or remote figures in the earliest stages of their children's lives. Margot Asquith records how Rosebery loved to play and romp on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> children.|$|E
500|$|When Lennon {{started a}} {{relationship}} with Ono in 1968, {{his wife and son}} moved into the flat on 21June1968, living there for three months, before returning to Kenwood, as Lennon and Ono preferred to live at Montagu Square, rather than in isolated Weybridge. The two lived in the Montagu Square flat for several months, as the White Album was being recorded. Visitors remembered that the flat {{was in a state of}} squalor, with dirty plates, cups, clothes, newspapers and magazines littering <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> couple living on [...] "a diet of champagne, caviar, and heroin". Lennon and Ono's experimental Two Virgins album had been recorded at Kenwood, but its notorious nude cover photos were taken at 34Montagu Square. An Apple employee, Tony Bramwell, set up the camera so Lennon could take the photograph after Bramwell had left. Ono was pregnant during their stay, and they were also in the throes of heroin addiction.|$|E

A dray crushes a playing boy while the drayman sleeps, {{oblivious to the}} boy's injury and the beer spilling from his barrels. Posters in the background advertise a cockfight and a boxing match as {{further evidence of the}} brutal entertainments favoured by the subjects of the image. The boxing match is to take place at Broughton's Amphitheatre, a notoriously tough venue established by the [...] "father of pugilism", Jack Broughton: a contemporary bill records that the contestants would fight with their left leg strapped to <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> one with the fewest bleeding wounds being adjudged the victor. One of the advertised participants in the boxing match is James Field, who was hanged two weeks before the prints were issued and features again in the final image of the series; the other participant is George [...] "the Barber" [...] Taylor, who had been champion of England but was defeated by Broughton and retired in 1750. On Taylor's death in 1757, Hogarth produced a number of sketches of him wrestling Death, probably for his tomb.|$|E
500|$|Mackendrick {{assumed that}} Odets would need {{only two or}} three weeks to polish the script, but he took four months. The {{director}} recalled, [...] "We started shooting with no final script at all, while Clifford reconstructed the thing from stem to stern". The plot was largely intact, but in Mackendrick's biography he is quoted from Notes on Sweet Smell of Success: [...] "What Clifford did, in effect, was dismantle the structure of every single sequence in order to rebuild situations and relationships that were much more complex, had much greater tension and more dramatic energy". This process took time, and the start date for the production could not be delayed. Odets had to accompany the production to Manhattan and continued rewriting while they shot there. Returning to the city that had shunned him for going to Hollywood made Odets very neurotic and obsessed with all kinds of rituals as he worked at a furious pace, with pages often going straight from his typewriter to being shot the same day. Mackendrick said, [...] "So we cut the script there on <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> actors, just cutting down lines, making them more spare – what Clifford would have done himself, really, had there been time".|$|E
2500|$|A handspring is an acrobatic move {{in which}} a person executes a {{complete}} revolution of the body by lunging headfirst from an upright position into an inverted vertical position and then pushing off (i.e., [...] "springing") from <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hands so as to leap back to an upright position.

2500|$|A handspring is an acrobatic move {{in which}} a person executes a {{complete}} revolution of the body by lunging headfirst from an upright position into an inverted vertical position and then pushing off (i.e., [...] "springing") from <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hands so as to leap back to an upright position. The direction of body rotation in a handspring may be either forward or backward, and either kind may be performed from a stationary standing position or while in motion. Body movement may be terminated upon completion of a handspring, or the performer's momentum may be leveraged so as to immediately perform another handspring or other rotational move.|$|E
2500|$|The Holocaust {{furnaces}} were {{supplied by}} a number of manufacturers, with the best known and most common being Topf and Sons as well as Kori Company of Berlin, whose ovens were elongated to accommodate two bodies, slid inside from the back side. The ashes were taken out from the front side. The furnaces were also unique, in that they were of a [...] "stand alone" [...] type, meaning that there was no visible duct work for the exhaust gases. These furnaces, based around a design commonly used for hospital incinerators, instead vented the gasses down through a series of ducts embedded in <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of a draft fan located {{at the far end of}} the structure. Once outside, the gasses then rose through a free standing chimney, most notable for the fact that it was not directly attached to the structure of the building itself, nor had a visible duct leading into it.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{exercises}} {{that can be done to}} strengthen the lower leg. For example, in order to activate plantar flexors in the deep plantar flexors one can sit on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hips flexed, the ankle neutral with knees fully extended as they alternate pushing their foot against a wall or platform. This kind of exercise is beneficial as it hardly causes any fatigue. [...] Another form of isometric exercise for the gastrocnemius would be seated calf raises which can be done with or without equipment. One can be seated at a table with their feet flat on the ground, and then plantar flex both ankles so that the heels are raised off the floor and the gastrocnemius flexed. An alternate movement could be heel drop exercises with the toes being propped on an elevated surface—as an opposing movement this would improve the range of motion. One-legged toe raises for the gastrocnemius muscle can be performed by holding one dumbbell in one hand while using the other for balance, and then standing with one foot on a plate. The next step would be to plantar flex and keep the knee joint straight or flexed slightly. The triceps surae is contracted during this exercise. Stabilization exercises like the BOSU ball squat are also important especially as they assist in the ankles having to adjust to the ball’s form in order to balance.|$|E
