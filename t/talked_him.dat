5|$|Mohandar {{tried to}} insist on only sending Nerazim to the sanctuary, but Selendis <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> into {{allowing}} {{a small number of}} templar warriors to accompany the expedition. He agreed, but only if there was no disrespect. Vartanil went along with them, and (much to Mohandar's annoyance) so did Dahl. Mohandar pointed out the protoss were still evaluating her, a terran female.|$|E
5|$|After Tucker {{is accused}} of murdering James Woods, he reveals that Woods <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of auditioning for the lead role in the 1984 hit horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street. The finger is then pointed at Mayor West, who tells the group of his hardships on the social {{networking}} service Twitter, after Woods stole his originally intended username. Diane Simmons also goes on to state that Woods had promised to introduce her to former CBS news anchor Dan Rather, but ultimately ended up introducing her to actor and comedian Danny Bonaduce instead.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} Princeton, the Americans {{began to}} loot the abandoned British supply wagons {{and the town}} itself. With news that Cornwallis was approaching, Washington {{knew he had to}} leave Princeton. Washington wanted to push onto New Brunswick and capture a British pay chest of 70,000 pounds but Major Generals Henry Knox and Nathanael Greene <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of it. Instead, Washington moved his army to Somerset Courthouse on the night of January 3, then marched to Pluckemin by January 5, and arrived at Morristown, by sunset the next day, for winter encampment. After the battle, Cornwallis abandoned many of his posts in New Jersey, and ordered his army to retreat to New Brunswick.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur's {{next move}} was the {{invasion}} of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of accompanying the invasion on Nashville. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck Nashville, killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikazes. During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his abrasiveness, over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian women on the GHQ staff would not {{be taken to the}} Philippines, but Sutherland had brought her along anyway.|$|E

25|$|Hershiser {{spent the}} next two seasons in AA with the San Antonio Dodgers of the Texas League. He worked {{primarily}} as a reliever at San Antonio. He was leading the league in saves at one point but then gave up 20 runs in seven innings on a road trip. He called this point the lowest of his career. He wanted to quit but the manager and pitching coach <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of it.|$|E

25|$|Roddick {{considered}} quitting competitive tennis {{at the age}} of 17, when he had {{a losing}} streak in the juniors. His coach, Tarik Benhabiles, <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> into giving tennis four more months of undivided attention. Roddick finished as the No. 6 junior in the U.S. in 1999, and as the No. 1 junior in the world in 2000. He won six world junior singles titles and seven world junior doubles titles, and won the US Open and Australian Open junior singles titles in 2000.|$|E
25|$|During {{a dinner}} meeting {{the evening of}} December 13, Burnside {{dramatically}} {{announced that he would}} personally lead his old IX Corps in one final attack on Marye's Heights, but his generals <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of it the following morning. The armies remained in position throughout the day on December 14. That afternoon, Burnside asked Lee for a truce to attend to his wounded, which the latter graciously granted. The next day the Federal forces retreated across the river, and the campaign came to an end.|$|E
25|$|Al-Zubayr, however, {{had lost}} the desire to fight. He said that Ali had <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of it during the {{negotiations}} {{on the grounds that}} they were cousins; but his son accused him of fearing Ali’s army. Al-Zubayr left the battle-field while Aisha continued to direct her troops. A man named Amr ibn Jurmuz decided to track his movements and followed him to a nearby field. It was time for prayer so, after each had asked the other what he was doing there, they agreed to pray. While Al-Zubayr was prostrating, Amr ibn Jurmuz stabbed him in the neck and killed him.|$|E

25|$|Van Dorn {{ordered a}} retreat first towards Pocahontas, where he {{proposed}} for the Confederate army to attack Corinth again from the south; both Price and Maury <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of it. The retreat continued westward, with Lovell's division serving as a rearguard against Rosecrans and Price's divisions in front. On the morning of October 6, Van Dorn learned that another Union force commanded by Stephen Hulbut was approaching from the west; he assigned Maury's division to hold the Davis Bridge over the Hatchie River until the army could reach another crossing six miles to the south. Maury formed a line {{on the west side}} of the creek but the line was overrun with the loss of 300 prisoners. Hulbut then crossed several regiments to the east bank, which suffered 570 casualties, mostly due to sharpshooters and artillery fire. Once a temporary bridge was built across the Hatchie, the Confederate army retreated to Holly Springs.|$|E
25|$|In February 1942, as Japanese forces {{tightened}} {{their grip}} on the Philippines, MacArthur was ordered by President Roosevelt to relocate to Australia. MacArthur discussed the idea with his staff that he resign his commission and fight on as a private soldier in the Philippine resistance but Sutherland <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of it. On the night of March 12, 1942, MacArthur and a select group (that included his wife Jean and son Arthur, as well as Sutherland, Akin, Casey, Marshall, Willoughby, Diller, and George) left Corregidor in four PT boats. MacArthur, his family and Sutherland traveled in PT 41, commanded by Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley. The others followed in PT 34, PT 35 and PT 32. MacArthur and his party reached Del Monte Airfield in Bukidnon province {{on the island of}} Mindanao two days later. General George Marshall sent three U.S. Navy B-17s to pick them up. Two of them arrived, and brought the entire group to Australia.|$|E
500|$|Assaults {{south of}} town were also mismanaged, which were {{supposed}} to be the main avenue of attack, and initial Union breakthroughs went unsupported. Burnside was upset by the failure of his plan and by the enormous casualties of his repeated, futile frontal assaults, and he declared that he would personally lead an assault of the IX corps. His corps commanders <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of it, but relations were strained between the commander and his subordinates. Accepting full blame, he offered to retire from the U.S. Army, but this was refused. Burnside's detractors labeled him the [...] "Butcher of Fredericksburg".|$|E

500|$|Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which {{released}} Roman Candle), {{said about}} this time in Smith's life, [...] "I <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of thinking {{that he wanted to}} kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him." [...] Pete Krebs also agreed: [...] "In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression...

500|$|Hunter Davies {{recalled}} that while {{working with the}} Beatles on their authorised biography in 1968, [...] "when the subject of Pete Best came up they seemed to cut off, {{as if he had}} never touched their lives.

500|$|Eventually {{injuries}} {{began to}} take their toll and {{at the conclusion of}} the 1954–55 season he considered retirement. Toe Blake, who had taken over as coach, <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> into playing one more season to assist the younger players. Bouchard recognized Blake's value as a [...] "player's coach" [...] and used his leadership as captain to ease the transition and encourage Blake's acceptance by the Canadiens players. Due to physical problems Bouchard was forced to miss the last half of the season and the playoffs. However, in the deciding game of the Stanley Cup final against Detroit, Blake dressed Bouchard. As the final seconds counted down, with Montreal up 3–1, Blake put Bouchard on the ice and he was able to end his career with one more Stanley Cup celebration.|$|E

500|$|Several {{people were}} interviewed for the part, {{including}} Tom Jones, Robert Goulet, and Jerry Vale. Meanwhile, Behr {{and a friend}} attended a memorabilia show at the Beverly Garland Hotel in North Hollywood, where James Darren was signing autographs. Darren had not wanted to attend the event, but had been convinced otherwise. Behr thought he was so charming {{that he wanted to}} talk to him about the role on the spot, but his friend <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of it as he felt that Darren would think he was insane. Surma got in touch with Darren at Behr's prompting. Darren initially rejected the role, having heard that the part was a singer. Darren's agent went back to him three times and eventually convinced him to read the script, which is when he fell in love with the character. He later called it a [...] "dream come true".|$|E
500|$|Over time, Nathaniel Fillmore {{became more}} {{successful}} in Sempronius, but during Millard Fillmore's formative years the family experienced severe poverty. [...] Eventually Nathaniel Fillmore became highly enough regarded that he was chosen to serve in local offices including justice of the peace. Hoping his oldest son would learn a trade, when Millard was 14 his father <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> out of attempting to enlist for the War of 1812 and apprenticed him to cloth maker Benjamin Hungerford in Sparta. Fillmore was relegated to menial labor; unhappy at not learning any skills, he left Hungerford's employ. [...] His father then placed him in the same trade at a mill in New Hope. [...] Seeking to better himself, Millard Fillmore bought a share in a circulating library, and read all the books he could. In 1819, he took advantage of a time of little work at the mill to enroll at a new academy in the town, where he met a classmate, Abigail Powers, {{and fell in love}} with her.|$|E
500|$|Shepard's next {{assignment}} was to VF-193, a night fighter squadron flying the Banshee, {{that was based}} at Naval Air Station Moffett Field, California. The squadron was part of Commander James D. [...] "Jig Dog" [...] Ramage's Air Group 19. Naval aviators with experience in jet aircraft were still relatively rare, and Ramage specifically requested Shepard's assignment {{on the advice of}} Elder, who commanded VF-193's sister squadron, VF-191. Ramage made Shepard his own wingman, a decision that would save Ramage's life in 1954, when his oxygen system failed and Shepard <b>talked</b> <b>him</b> through a landing. As squadron operations officer, Shepard's most important task was imparting his knowledge of flying jets to his fellow aviators to keep them alive. He served two tours on the aircraft carrier [...] in the western Pacific. It set out on a combat tour off Korea in 1953, during the Korean War, but the Korean Armistice Agreement ended the fighting in July 1953, and Shepard did not see combat.|$|E
