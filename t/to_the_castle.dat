5|$|A second access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> leads {{up from a}} rocky cove, the {{aperture}} to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E
5|$|After {{sharing a}} romantic {{dance with the}} Beast ("Beauty and the Beast"), Belle discovers her father's predicament using the magic mirror. The Beast {{releases}} her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. Back at the village, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by revealing the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston has her thrown into the basement with her father and rallies the villagers to follow him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> to kill the Beast ("The Mob Song"). With Chip's aid, Maurice and Belle escape and rush back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b>|$|E

5|$|King Philip VI of France (1293–1350) {{stayed at}} the castle in 1332. Due to the Anglo-French {{hostilities}} the castle was playing an increasingly important role. During the Hundred Years' War the English were given the castle from 1360 to 1385 by the Treaty of Brétigny. The castle was yielded reluctantly to Edward III of England's regent in France, John Chandos, on 25 October 1361. He had brought {{the brother of the}} keeper <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> and threatened to behead him unless there was an immediate capitulation. French troops commanded by the Duke of Bouillon and Geoffroy III of Rochefoucauld laid siege <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> in 1380, but it did not yield until five years later. The English later regained the castle, but in 1442 Charles VII of France (1403–61) finally captured it from the English.|$|E

5|$|A moat, {{approximately}} 190 metres (620 feet) to {{the south}} of the castle, was constructed in mediaeval times, likely {{around the time of the}} rebuilding in 1305. A Scheduled Ancient Monument in its own right, the moat encloses approximately an acre of land around the property. The moat may have been an enclosure surrounding farm buildings connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E
5|$|A town borough was {{formally}} created in 1201, {{and by the}} 1220s there was a settlement established outside the castle gates; some of those residents who had been {{moved out of the}} bailey may have resettled there. Richard built a stone wall around the new town, linking it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> defences, intending it both as a defensive measure and to impress visitors.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the {{architect}} A. G. Biggs carried out substantial additions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> between 1962 and 1968, including remodelling the western range {{to provide for}} more female accommodation, using stone from the second East Cowes Castle, an 18th and 19th-century stately home, which had been demolished the previous year. A prefabricated conservatory extension followed in 1988, and a new pavilion designed by Sir Thomas Croft was added in 2000.|$|E
5|$|An oratory, {{originally}} {{fitted to}} the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891, was decorated with twenty stained glass windows. Ten of these windows are displayed at Cardiff Castle, while the other ten are displayed on site; two missing windows having been returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> in 2011. Other rooms in the castle include Lady Margaret Bute's Bedroom, the servants' hall and the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{the castle}} was used as a refuge by Richard II from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. On 12August 1399, after {{returning}} from Ireland, Richard made his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> where he met Bolingbroke's emissary, Henry Percy, for negotiations. Percy swore in the chapel he would not harm the king. On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. The king was then taken to London and died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.|$|E

5|$|Circumstances changed {{suddenly}} when Henry died on 6 June 1217 {{after receiving}} a head wound from a tile which came loose while he was playing with other children at the palace of the Bishop of Palencia.

5000|$|The 16th Duke {{had planned}} <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Trust but {{following}} {{his death in}} 1975 the 17th Duke cancelled the plan.

5000|$|When German forces {{invaded the}} Soviet Union in 1941, they {{occupied}} <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> and converted it to a ghetto {{for the local}} Jewish population, prior to their liquidation.

5|$|Harlech Castle rests {{upon the}} spur of rock called the Harlech Dome; the land falls away sharply on the north and west, and a ditch cut into the rock protects the {{remaining}} approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> The castle has a concentric design, with one line of defences enclosed by another, forming an inner and outer ward; the outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today. Harlech is built from local grey-green sandstone, with large, regular blocks used for the towers and irregular material, possibly taken from the ditch, used for the walls. The main entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs.|$|E
5|$|In 1603 James VI of Scotland {{inherited}} {{the kingdom of}} England, uniting the two thrones, and Etal Castle lost its military value and soon passed into private ownership. In the 18th century it ceased {{to be used as}} a residence, and the ruins were painted in watercolour by Thomas Girtin in 1797, based upon his visit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> in the autumn of 1796.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th {{century the}} grounds were {{turned into a}} garden. The castle's defences were {{enhanced}} in the 1640s to prepare the castle for action in the English Civil War. Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, was a Parliamentarian, and Royalist forces laid siege <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> Warwick Castle withstood the siege and was later used to hold prisoners taken by the Parliamentarians.|$|E
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>castle's</b> most {{important}} defensive elements is the confusing maze of paths leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle's</b> keep. <b>The</b> gates, baileys, and outer {{walls of the}} complex are organized so as to confuse an approaching force, causing it to travel in a spiral pattern around the complex on its way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> keep. <b>The</b> <b>castle</b> complex originally contained 84 gates, 15 of which were named according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Japanese syllabary (I, Ro, Ha, Ni, Ho, He, To, etc.). At present, 21 gates from <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> complex remain intact, 13 of which are named according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Japanese syllabary.|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} of the palace was designed <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> <b>the</b> utmost security and ability {{to function as a}} stronghold. The central part of <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was built away from <b>the</b> outer walls. <b>To</b> further make <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> resistant <b>to</b> raids, <b>the</b> front walls of the towers, which rise 30 m, were kept devoid of openings, except the bay window in the western tower. This design was adopted <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> less susceptible <b>to</b> attacks.|$|R
50|$|Along with a {{large amount}} of ruins that remain largely {{undisturbed}} by development, a small part of <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> has been reconstructed, including some walls, a gate, and a building. A museum dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle's</b> history has also been erected.|$|R
