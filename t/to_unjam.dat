40|$|The {{canonical}} {{models for}} studying the unjamming scenario in systems of soft repulsive particles assume pairwise potentials with a sharp cut-off in the interaction range. The sharp cut-off renders the potential non-analytic, but {{makes it possible to}} describe many properties of the solid in terms of the coordination number $z$, which has an unambiguous definition in these cases. Pairwise potentials without a sharp cut-off in the interaction range have not been considered in this context, but are of interest for understanding the relevance of the <b>unjamming</b> phenomenology <b>to</b> systems in which such a cut-off cannot be assumed. In this work we explore two systems with such interactions: an inverse power law and an exponentially decaying pairwise potential, with the control parameters being the exponent (of the inverse power-law) for the former and the number density for the latter. Both systems are shown to exhibit the characteristic features of the unjamming transition, among which are the vanishing of the shear to bulk modulus ratio and the emergence of an excess of low-frequency vibrational modes. We establish a relation between the hydrostatic pressure to bulk modulus ratio and the distance <b>to</b> <b>unjamming</b> in each of our model systems. This allows us to predict the dependence of other key observables on the distance <b>to</b> <b>unjamming.</b> Our results provide the means for a quantitative estimation of the proximity of generic glass forming models <b>to</b> the <b>unjamming</b> transition {{in the absence of a}} clear-cut definition of the coordination number, and highlight the general irrelevance of nonaffine contributions to the bulk modulus.

40|$|By violating MAC-layer protocols, the jamming attack aims at {{blocking}} successful {{communication among}} wireless nodes. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are highly vulnerable to jamming because of reliance on shared wireless medium, constrained per-sensor resources, and {{high risk of}} sensor compromise. Moreover, base stations of WSNs are single points of failure and, thus, attractive jamming targets. To tackle base-station jamming, replication of base stations as well as jamming evasion, by relocation <b>to</b> <b>unjammed</b> locations, have been proposed. In this paper, we propose Honeybees, an energy-aware defense framework against base-station jamming attack in WSNs. Honeybees efficiently combines replication and evasion to allow WSNs to continue delivering data {{for a long time}} during a jamming attack. We present three defense strategies: reactive, proactive, and hybrid, in the context of multi-hop WSN deployment. Through simulation, we show the interaction of these strategies with different attack tactics as well as the effect of system and attack parameters. We found that our honeybees framework struck an energyefficient balance between replication and evasion that outperformed both separate mechanisms. Specifically, hybrid honeybees outperformed replication and evasion at low and intermediate number of attackers and gracefully degraded to high attack intensity. 1...|$|R

The nature of " hard-particle packings is a current subject of keen interest. We demonstrate that the response of jammed hard-particle packings to global deformations cannot be described by linear elasticity (even for small particle displacements) but involves a " nonlinear con-stitutive theory. It is the singular nature of the hard-particle potential that leads to the breakdown of linear elasticity. Interestingly, a nonlinear theory arises because the feasible particle displacements (leading <b>to</b> <b>unjamming)</b> depend critically on the local spatial arrangement of the particles, implying a directionality in the feasible strains that is absent in particle systems with soft potentials. Mathematically, the set of feasible strains has a conical structure, i. e., components of the imposed strain tensor generally obey linear inequalities.

40|$|Simple {{homogeneous}} shear {{flows of}} frictionless, deformable particles are studied by particle simulations at large shear rates and for differently soft, deformable particles. Particle stiffness sets a time-scale {{that can be}} used to scale the physical quantities; thus the dimensionless shear rate, i. e. the inertial number I (inversely proportional to pressure), can alternatively be expressed as inversely proportional to the square root of particle stiffness. Asymptotic scaling relations for the field variables pressure, shear stress and granular temperature are inferred from simulations in both fluid and solid regimes, corresponding <b>to</b> <b>unjammed</b> and jammed conditions. Then the limit cases are merged to unique constitutive relations that cover also the transition zone in the proximity of jamming. By exploiting the diverging behavior of the scaling laws at the jamming density, we arrive at continuous and differentiable phenomenological constitutive relations for stresses and granular temperature as functions of the volume fraction, shear rate, particle stiffness and distance from jamming. In contrast to steady shear flows of hard particles the (shear) stress ratio μ does not collapse as a function of the inertial number, indicating the need for an additional control parameter. In the range of particle stiffnesses investigated, in the solid regime, only pressure is rate independent, whereas shear stress exhibits a slight shear rate- and stiffness-dependency...|$|R

40|$|The {{stress-strain}} {{response of}} unfilled crosslinked elastomers subjected to loading/unloading deformation histories displays non-linear elastic and viscoelastic characteristics. In addition, filled elastomers exhibit {{a number of}} peculiar features {{referred to as the}} Mullins effect, including (i) a large stress-softening as the sample is deformed to the same strain in second and subsequent deformation cycles, (ii) a much larger hysteresis in the first deformation cycle as compared to an unfilled elastomer, (iii) a dramatic drop in stress {{at the point where the}} loading is reversed and, (iv) complete recovery of the virgin sample-like behavior when strain in second cycle exceeds the previous maximum strain. Developing a constitutive model to describe all of these effects has proven to be a major challenge. One important reason for this has been a dearth of experimental data performed on a single well-characterized unfilled and filled system where the potentially relevant parameters that control the mechanical behavior were systematically varied. ^ A comprehensive data set has been obtained for both linear and non-linear mechanical experiments, including non-linear constant strain rate uniaxial deformation and non-linear creep/recovery for a wide range of temperatures, extension rates and stretch ratios on a styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) cured with dicumyl peroxide. The data set was analyzed using a series of non-linear viscoelastic constitutive models that employs an additive combination of hyperelastic and quasi-linear viscoelastic contributions; surprisingly the standard theory is unable to describe the data. Specifically, the standard theory predicts stiffer than experimentally observed response in constant strain rate experiments and softer than observed response in creep experiments. This indicates towards additional physical processes occurring in the material not accounted for by the standard viscoelastic constitutive models. ^ The mechanical behavior of carbon black filled crosslinked SBR systems were studied in order to determine the effects of the amount, dispersion and properties, the particle size, surface area, structure, of the carbon black on the stress-strain response of filled elastomers (i. e. Mullins effect), at various stretch ratios, temperatures and deformation rates. The traditional model for Mullins effect advanced in the literature has been a 2 ̆ 2 damage 2 ̆ 2 mechanism, where the stress-softening is postulated to be a due to the breakage of either filler-rubber bonds or filler-filler contacts. The experimental data conclusively shows that damage models are inconsistent; specifically, they cannot account for the dramatic drop in stress occurring at load reversal. ^ In order to account for the stress drop on load reversal, a new physical mechanism is proposed for filled elastomers based on the idea that the material undergoes a jamming/unjamming transition in the course of deformation. From this perspective, the virgin material being pulled for the first time is in a jammed state, and the reversal of load leads <b>to</b> <b>unjamming</b> which persists until the previous maximum deformation is exceeded. All the experimental findings are consistent with this mechanism, including stress relaxation, cyclic deformation, dependence on carbon black properties and effect of the stretch ratio. A simple phenomenological model based on the jamming/ 2 ̆ 2 unjamming 2 ̆ 2 picture is developed. The jamming in the material is taken into account via introduction of two internal variables, one of them a structure variable which captures the memory of the deformation history. The evolution of the structure variable is governed by a relaxation equation which is highly asymmetric such that the rate of change of the structure variable depends on whether the system is being loaded or unloaded. This phenomenological model captures for the first time all the qualitative features of the Mullins effect. ...|$|R

These experiments first explore isotropic stress states near point J through measurements of the mean contact number per particle, Z, and the pressure, P as functions of the packing fraction,. In this case, the experiments show some but not all aspects of jamming, as expected on the basis of simulations and models that typically assume conservative, hence frictionless, forces between particles. Specifically, there is a rapid growth in Z, at a reasonable which we identify with as c. It is possible to fit Z and P, to power law expressions in - c above c, and to obtain exponents that are in agreement with simulations and models. However, the experiments differ from theory on several points, as typified by the rounding that is observed in Z and P near c. The application of shear to these same 2 D granular systems leads to phenomena that are qualitatively different from the standard picture of jamming. In particular, there is a range of packing fractions below c, where the application of shear strain at constant leads to jammed stress-anisotropic states, i. e. they have a non-zero shear stress, τ. The application of shear strain to an initially isotropically compressed (hence jammed) state, does not lead <b>to</b> an <b>unjammed</b> state per se. Rather, shear strain at constant first leads to an increase of both τ and P. Additional strain leads to a succession of jammed states interspersed with relatively localized failures of the force network leading to other stress-anisotropic states that are jammed at typically somewhat lower stress. The locus of jammed states requires a state space that involves not only and τ, but also P. P, τ, and Z are all hysteretic functions of shear strain for fixed. However, we find that both P and τ are roughly linear functions of Z for strains large enough to jam the system. This implies that these shear-jammed states satisfy a Coulomb like-relation, τ = μP. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{have focused}} on the jamming {{properties}} of systems composed of semi- 2 D elliptical shaped particles. In order to study these systems, we have performed three types of experiments: Couette shear, biaxial isotropic compression, and biaxial pure shear. In each experimental scheme, we take data for both systems of ellipses an bi-disperse disks, in order to probe the effect of broken spherical symmetry at the particle scale, on the global behavior. We use two synchronized cameras to capture the flow of particles and the local stress at the same time. In Couette experiments, we study the rheological properties, as well as the stress fluctuations for very large strains (up to 20 revolutions of the inner wheel). The system is sheared for densities below the isotropic jamming point (point J). From these studies we learn that over a small range of packing fractions, (0. 85 ≤ϕ≤ 0. 86), systems of ellipses demonstrate exceptionally slow dynamical evolution when they are sheared. For fixed density, and starting from an essentially unstressed state, the application of shear strain leads to first a growth of average particle displacements in the system through a Reynolds dilatancy effect, and then for very large strains, a steady decrease in particle displacements. In an intermediate range of shear strains, the system exists in effectively meta-stable states {{for a very long time}} before relaxing <b>to</b> an <b>unjammed</b> state, in which the flow of particles stops completely, and the stress fluctuations drop to zero. The strain scale for this relaxation depends on the global packing fraction. We characterize this slow dynamics by measuring the evolution of mean velocity, density, and orientational order throughout the experiments. In a similar set of experiments performed on disks, slow relaxation was observed as well. However, the increasing average displacement build-up before relaxation, which was observed in ellipses, did not occur for disks. This suggests that the slow relaxation towards an unjammed state in ellipses is associated with the possibility of small and slow changes in their orientations, which then allow a more efficient packing. In order to study the stress fluctuations, we implement photoelastic properties of the particles. We are able to track the g^ 2 (a measure of local stress) of each particle throughout the entire experiment. Unlike disks, the power spectra of g^ 2, P(ω), is not rate invariant for ellipses. In other words, all curves of R P(ω) vs. ω / R (where R is the shear rate) with different values of R, collapse to a single curve for disks, but not for ellipses. The rate invariance of spectra was previously studied for sheared spherical glass beads and semi- 2 D pentagonal particles. This is the first experimental work in which the fluctuations of granular systems composed of elongated particles is addressed. We have also studied the formation and destruction of stress avalanches during Couette shear in both systems of disks and ellipses. In particular, we introduce measures which characterize the size and shape of stress avalanches. Analysis of these measures shows that the build-up and release of stress in both systems of disks and ellipses have similar distributions which indicates that the deformation of particles in a Couette cell does not resemble stick-slip behavior. We also find that the build-up and release of stress is faster is larger avalanches. Cyclic isotropic compression is performed on semi- 2 D systems of bi-disperse disks and identical ellipses with aspect ratio 2, which are composed of photoelastic particles. In each compression cycle, the system is compressed with a total strain of 1. 6 % and then expanded to the initial state. After completion of each half cycle, the system is allowed to relax, then imaged by two synchronized cameras. The packing fraction, ϕ, of compressed states are chosen above the isotopic jamming point (point J). In both systems of disks and ellipses, we observed relaxation of global stress over long compression cycles. We find that the global stress drops with a power law over time (σ∼ C t^-A). The exponent of decay, A, drops linearly with increasing ϕ, and hits zero at ϕ≃ 0. 89 for disks, and ϕ≃ 0. 93 for ellipses. Above these packing fractions, the system is stable with respect to its global stress. In order to understand the origin of this slow stress dilation, we have studied the structural changes of the system, including Falk-Langer measures of affine and non-affine deformations, as well as average contact per particle.
