5|$|A {{distinct}} format {{was used}} for the 1999 and 2003 World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the Super 6. The Super 6 teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried <b>their</b> <b>points</b> forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages. The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.|$|E
5|$|According to the Kennel Club {{studbook}}, Old Jock was bred at {{some point}} during 1859 either by Captain Percy Williams in his Rufford Kennels, or by Jack Morgan who at the time was a huntsman with the Grove Kennels. He was bred from Jock and Grove Pepper, both huntman's terriers. Jock was owned by Captain Williams, while Grove Pepper was owned by Morgan. It was claimed in W.D. Drury's 1903 work British Dogs, <b>Their</b> <b>Points,</b> Selection, And Show Preparation that Old Jock was in fact bred from Quorn Kennels and that the listing in the Kennel Club studbook was incorrect.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Nico Rosberg {{cemented}} his position {{at the top of the}} Drivers' Championship, having taken the maximum number of 100 points available from the first four rounds. Lewis Hamilton followed in second with 57 points, while Kimi Räikkönen moved up to third with 43 points. Vettel's retirement dropped him to fifth in the standings, behind Daniel Ricciardo. In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes increased <b>their</b> <b>points</b> tally to 157, now 81 points clear of second-placed Ferrari. Red Bull's poor performance saw their advantage over fourth placed Williams reduced to just six points.|$|E

5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight cats are {{placed in front of}} a bowl of cat food. The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining cats are each then recorded in seven different situations. The owners wager points on what their cat will do before each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of <b>their</b> <b>points</b> on the first two questions. For the remainder, they may wager any or all of <b>their</b> <b>points.</b> The cat and owner with the highest score win $25,000, and a chance to play the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E

The race took three hours, twenty-five minutes and twenty-two seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.378 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The team {{started their}} SEC {{schedule}} back {{up with a}} trip to South Carolina. The Gamecocks were not much of an opponent, as the ladies more than doubled <b>their</b> <b>points</b> at the half (53–26), and finished the game 94–52. This game was followed up with another highly ranked opponent, the twelfth-ranked Gators. Once again, the Vols ran a talented team into the ground, as they only allowed 18 first half points, ultimately winning by a score of 99–60.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Webber's third-place finish allowed him to increase his lead in the World Drivers' Championship. Alonso's victory allowed him to move up into second place, eleven points behind Webber. Hamilton's retirement meant that he slipped to third place, nine points behind Alonso. Vettel's second-place finish resulted in him moving into fourth place ahead of Button. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull's strong finish allowed them to draw further ahead of McLaren who were now twenty-four points behind. Ferrari remained in third on 319 points, forty points behind McLaren. Mercedes increased <b>their</b> <b>points</b> advantage over Renault to thirty-five with four races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend <b>their</b> <b>points</b> of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E

5|$|Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle {{manager in}} February 2006, Bruce was again {{linked with the}} job, which {{ultimately}} went to Glenn Roeder. By {{this stage of the}} 2005–06 season, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} nearly six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match <b>their</b> <b>points</b> total and therefore relegated.|$|E
5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of {{the cast and crew}} {{that he would have to}} defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant <b>their</b> <b>points</b> were worth half of the assumed value.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from <b>their</b> <b>points</b> of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Frenchman’s Creek {{took place}} during the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States {{in the early hours of}} November 28, 1812, in the Crown Colony of Upper Canada, near the Niagara River. The {{operation}} was conceived as a raid to prepare the ground for a larger American invasion. The Americans succeeded in crossing the Niagara and landing at both of <b>their</b> <b>points</b> of attack. They achieved one of their two objectives before withdrawing but the invasion was subsequently called off, rendering useless what had been accomplished. The engagement was named, “the Battle of Frenchman’s Creek” by the Canadians, after the location of some of the severest fighting. To contemporary Americans, it was known as, “the Affair opposite Black Rock”.|$|E
5|$|The Senators would {{defeat the}} {{eventual}} Stanley Cup champion Canadiens 5–3 that night, {{but it would}} turn out to be their only highlight of the season for the Senators. The club would tie with the San Jose Sharks for the worst record in the League that year, winning just ten games with 70 losses and four ties (24 points) in the 1992–93 season. The Senators still hold the NHL record for least road wins for their record that season, with one. <b>Their</b> <b>points</b> total for the season was one point better than the NHL record for least points in a season ever. The Senators had aimed low. Firestone had set beating the old record the Senators' goal for the season, as the team planned to finish low in the standings for its first few years in order to receive high draft picks.|$|E
5|$|The format {{used in the}} 2007 World Cup {{involved}} 16 teams allocated {{into four}} groups of four. Within each group, the teams played {{each other in a}} round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the Super 8 round. The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points {{in the same way as}} the group stage, but carried <b>their</b> <b>points</b> forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the Super 8 stage. The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of the tournament {{was similar to that}} of the 1999 World Cup. The 14 countries were separated into two groups of seven; each team played the others in its group once. The most successful three from each group qualified for the Super Sixes stage, a format which was introduced in the 1999 tournament. Each qualifier carried forward <b>their</b> <b>points</b> from the first stage and played one game against each of the three teams from the other group. The top four teams from the Super Sixes qualified for the semi-finals, and the winners of those matches contested the final. A total of 54 matches were played in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Bridenbaugh's first {{assistant}} {{coaching job}} {{was with the}} Oberlin Yeomen of Oberlin College under head coach T. Nelson Metcalf. He then spent two seasons at Kiski Preparatory School in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania and another two at Beaver Falls High School. In 1917 he became the ninth head coach of Geneva College's Golden Tornadoes in Beaver Falls. His record in this first season was 5–3–1, although the team allowed as many points as they scored (114). He went 4–2 in 1918, outscoring the opposition 67–36, and 4–2–2 in 1919, despite a negative point differential of 51–59 caused by a 2–33 loss to the University of Pittsburgh. In 1920 his record was 5–2–1, outscoring other institutions 125–61 despite a 0–47 loss to Pittsburgh. He was 5–3–1 in his final season, with a positive point differential of 106–49; half of <b>their</b> <b>points</b> scored during this year came in a 54–0 victory over Juniata College. Following his resignation, he was replaced by Robert Park, who {{was head of the}} history department, for the 1922 season, and then Tom Davies in 1923.|$|E
