5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Enron</b> scandal, publicized in October 2001, {{eventually}} led to the bankruptcy of <b>the</b> <b>Enron</b> Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the de facto dissolution of Arthur Andersen, {{which was one of the}} five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world. In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history at that time, Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure.|$|E
5|$|Portions of <b>the</b> <b>Enron</b> {{corporation}} {{began as}} Northern Natural Gas Company in Omaha. Northern currently provides three natural gas lines to Omaha. Enron formerly owned UtiliCorp United, Inc., which became Aquila, Inc..

5|$|Cheney was a {{prominent}} member of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), {{commonly known as the}} Energy Task Force, composed of energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives. After <b>the</b> <b>Enron</b> scandal, the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties. In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, when {{analysts were}} given a tour of <b>the</b> <b>Enron</b> Energy Services office, they were {{impressed}} with how the employees were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend to work hard) to create the appearance that the division was larger than it was. This ruse was used several times to fool analysts about the progress of different areas of Enron to help improve the stock price.|$|E
5|$|River Oaks {{has been}} the subject matter of {{scholarly}} studies, primarily because its significant contributions to Houston's history and development as an elite suburban community. The community was the site of the 1972 murder of Dr. John Hill (later described in Thomas Thompson's novel, Blood and Money). River Oaks was the home of Jeff Skilling before he began serving a 25-year prison sentence for his involvement in <b>the</b> <b>Enron</b> scandal.|$|E
5|$|The debt {{payments}} weighed {{heavily on}} the Senators. For several years, Bryden tried to reschedule the debt on the arena. There were various attempts at filing tax losses to write off the debt, all rejected by the federal government. In 2002, Ogden went bankrupt. It had re-invented itself as Covanta Energy and failed not long after <b>the</b> <b>Enron</b> scandal. This led to the Senators filing for bankruptcy on January 9, 2003, when it could not arrange financing to pay all it owed to Covanta, becoming due because of Covanta's bankruptcy.|$|E

5|$|Lay and Skilling went {{on trial}} for their part in <b>the</b> <b>Enron</b> scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.|$|E
5|$|Whitewing was {{the name}} of a special purpose entity used as a {{financing}} method by Enron. In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments. Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although the transactions were approved by <b>the</b> <b>Enron</b> board, the asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans.|$|E
5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed <b>the</b> <b>Enron</b> audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E
30|$|I {{am writing}} to you because of the appalling and the sorry state of {{business}} schools. I am outraged over what we as business educators have allowed to develop. At best, we are guilty of having provided an environment where <b>the</b> <b>Enrons</b> and <b>the</b> Andersens of the world could take root and flourish. At worst, we are guilty of being active accomplices and co-conspirators in their shoddy and criminal behavior. In either case, unless we finally own up to the underlying reasons for our actions, business schools will only continue to aid and to abet the wave of scandals that have engulfed American businesses within the last few years.|$|R

25|$|In the main, {{experience}} in the introduction of wholesale and retail competition has been mixed. Many regional markets have achieved some success and the ongoing trend continues to be towards deregulation and introduction of competition. However, in 2000/2001 major failures such as the California electricity crisis and <b>the</b> <b>Enron</b> debacle caused a slow down in {{the pace of change}} and in some regions an increase in market regulation and reduction in competition. However, this trend is widely regarded as a temporary one against the longer term trend towards more open and competitive markets.|$|E
