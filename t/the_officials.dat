5|$|The plant {{witnesses}} {{a drop in}} {{its revenue}} due to lower sales of pesticides, {{and in order to}} reduce the loss <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. <b>The</b> <b>officials</b> however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. <b>The</b> <b>officials</b> deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{officials}} learned al-Kuwaiti's real name, {{though they}} said they would disclose neither the name nor how they learned it. Pakistani officials in 2011 stated the courier's name was Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed, from Pakistan's Swat Valley. He and his brother Abrar and their families were living at bin Laden's compound, <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> said.|$|E

Despite Harris' offer to work for free, <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> declined and instead developed a broader campaign on the subject without Harris.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, the Court {{began to}} read the Fifteenth Amendment more broadly. In Guinn v. United States (1915), a {{unanimous}} Court struck down an Oklahoma grandfather clause that effectively exempted white voters from a literacy test, finding it to be discriminatory. The Court ruled in the related case Myers v. Anderson (1915), that <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> who enforced such a clause were liable for civil damages.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the members of the Ministerium {{intended}} for this to be a permanent break, or a temporary protest. Regardless, it became permanent when <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> at the next Gathering of the General Synod refused to admit the delegates from the Ministerium. Thus, the Ministerium found themselves on their own.|$|E

50|$|Benny Benson {{chose the}} {{background}} {{color of the}} flag to represent both the blue sky and the forget-me-not. The Legislature later named the forget-me-not as <b>the</b> <b>official</b> State flower. This provides another symbolic link, one between <b>the</b> <b>official</b> State flag, <b>the</b> <b>official</b> song and <b>the</b> <b>official</b> flower.|$|R
5|$|On June 7, {{just two}} days after {{entering}} the city, Dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepted to shave their forehead, wear a queue, and surrender, <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> would be allowed to stay at their post. He had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around Beijing, threatening Qing control over the capital region.|$|E
5|$|Seattle Seahawks linebacker Mike Curtis {{blocked a}} field goal that would have sent the game into overtime, guaranteeing a Seahawk victory in what was billed as the “expansion bowl” meeting between two winless, first-year teams. The Buccaneers outgained the Seahawks, 285 yards to 253, but <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> outgained both, with 310 yards in {{penalties}}. The 35 penalties (accepted, 41 were thrown by <b>the</b> <b>officials)</b> were two short of the 25-year-old league record. Each team was penalized for holding eight times. Defensive tackle Pat Toomay complained that “the officials made us look {{like a bunch of}} idiots”. Dan Ryczek was the only Buccaneer lineman not to be called for holding. Tampa Bay running back Louis Carter, stuffed at the goal line, threw the ball to Morris Owens, who dived into the end zone for the first Buccaneer passing touchdown. A tackle by Seahawk punter Rick Engles prevented a touchdown return by Danny Reece that would have won the game for the Buccaneers. An earlier field goal try was blocked by Lyle Blackwood. The game ended with Dave Brown being helped from the field after being hit in the eye by the final penalty flag.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{introduced}} a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials {{who had received}} Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous, since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, and most of <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself.|$|E

A standing army was always ready for {{war in a}} cantonment (Sthirabhuta Kataka) in the regal capital of Manyakheta. Large armies were also maintained by the feudatory kings who were expected {{to contribute to the}} defense of the empire in case of war. Chieftains and all <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> also served as commanders whose postings were transferable if the need arose.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} provinces, whose {{official}} title was changed from Inspector to Governor {{and vice versa}} several times during Han, were responsible for inspecting several commandery-level and kingdom-level administrations. On {{the basis of their}} reports, <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> in these local administrations would be promoted, demoted, dismissed or prosecuted by the imperial court.|$|E
5|$|The two {{starting}} quarterbacks {{combined for}} 31 incomplete passes, with the clock stopping on each incompletion, and <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> called 19 penalties, leading to more clock stoppages. Each team used {{all six of}} its allocated timeouts, and the many scores led to additional commercial breaks. At halftime, Connal called Cline, and without urgency discussed {{the fact that the}} game seemed to be running longer than expected.|$|E

5|$|With these reforms, kings {{were reduced}} to being nominal heads of their fiefs, gaining a {{personal}} income from {{only a portion of}} the taxes collected in their kingdom. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> in the administrative staff of a full marquess's fief were appointed by the central government. A marquess's Chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a county Prefect. Like a king, the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income.|$|E
5|$|A first {{opening of}} the bridge {{took place in the}} same day with the ceremonies for the {{national}} day on July 14, 1897, in the presence of governor Chabié. The ribbon for the access zone was cut by the governor's wife, then <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> walked a short distance to the mobile deck, which was opened to allow the passage of the military ship L'Ardent. 21 cannon shots were fired at dusk and dawn to commemorate the construction of the bridge and on that day there were organised ceremonies including horse races and donkey races. The second opening was on October 19, 1897, in the presence of André Lebon, the prime minister of the French colonies.|$|E

5|$|A peasant soldier named Li Zicheng mutinied {{with his}} fellow {{soldiers}} in western Shaanxi in the early 1630s after the Ming government failed to ship much-needed supplies there. In 1634 he was captured by a Ming general and released only on the terms that he return to service. The agreement soon broke down when a local magistrate had thirty-six of his fellow rebels executed; Li's troops retaliated by killing <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> and continued to lead a rebellion based in Rongyang, central Henan province by 1635. By the 1640s, an ex-soldier and rival to Li – Zhang Xianzhong (1606–47) – had created a firm rebel base in Chengdu, Sichuan, while Li's center of power was in Hubei with extended influence over Shaanxi and Henan.|$|E
