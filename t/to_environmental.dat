5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> {{stress is}} measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress response <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} systems <b>to</b> manage <b>environmental</b> aspects on environmental performance at individual polluting facilities. Regulated polluting facilities are increasingly embracing pollution minimization strategies that involve the adoption of broadly defined systems <b>to</b> manage <b>environmental</b> aspects. Despite a meaningful empirical literature, {{whether or not these}} systems lead <b>to</b> better <b>environmental</b> performance remains an open question. This study seeks to assess the possible connection between systems <b>to</b> manage <b>environmental</b> aspects and improved environmental performance. It also seeks to identify the factors determining the extent of the adopted system of management and the factors’ direct effects on environmental performance. For this empirical analysis, the study examines the extent of systems <b>to</b> manage <b>environmental</b> aspects employed by and the level of wastewater discharged by U. S. chemical manufacturing facilities during 2001...|$|R
5|$|A population's genetic {{variation}} can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> changes requires sufficient {{genetic variation}} in the population for natural selection to take place.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} groups ranging from {{government}} institutions <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson's {{life and work}} since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17¢ Great Americans series postage stamp was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued Carson postage as well.|$|E
5|$|As large {{consumers}} of fossil fuels, First World countries drew attention <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty {{that is based}} on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E

5|$|DNA damage, due <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> {{factors and}} normal {{metabolic}} processes inside the cell, occurs {{at a rate}} of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene bromide was an {{additive}} in gasolines {{containing lead}} anti-engine knocking agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted from the engine. This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> regulations (see below).|$|E
5|$|Human ecology {{deals with}} {{interdisciplinary}} {{study of the}} relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. In addition <b>to</b> <b>Environmental</b> sociology, this field overlaps with architectural sociology, urban sociology, and to some extent visual sociology. In turn, visual sociology—which is concerned with all visual dimensions of social life—overlaps with media studies in that it uses photography, film and other technologies of media.|$|E

The US$10 million fund is dedicated to finding practical solutions <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> problems. The fund concentrates its activities in six areas that were important to Prince Sadruddin: environmental education; natural resource management in fragile zones; nature parks and wildlife reserves; environmentally and culturally appropriate tourism infrastructure; environmental health; and research.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to obvious dangers such as rodenticides, insecticides, and herbicides, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians, because their livers are less effective at {{some forms of}} detoxification than those of many other animals, including humans and dogs. Some {{of the most common}} causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits. Cats may be particularly sensitive <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> pollutants. When a cat has a sudden or prolonged serious illness without any obvious cause, it has possibly been exposed to a toxin.|$|E

5|$|Mercury {{was used}} inside wobbler lures. Its heavy, liquid form made it useful since the lures made an {{attractive}} irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug.

5|$|Millepora alcicornis {{is not a}} true coral {{in class}} Anthozoa but is in class Hydrozoa, and is {{more closely related to}} {{jellyfish}} than stony corals. Because of the variability in growth habit that this coral exhibits, it {{has been the subject of}} much confusion as to its taxonomy, being described under a number of different names from different localities. In 1898, Hickson decided that the variations in morphology were due <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> factors and that Millepora alcicornis was the valid name for all these species. This conclusion has since been questioned.|$|E

5|$|Polonium-210 may be {{quantified}} in biological specimens by alpha particle spectrometry to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. The baseline urinary excretion of polonium-210 in healthy persons due to routine exposure <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> sources is normally {{in a range of}} 5–15 mBq/day. Levels in excess of 30 mBq/day are suggestive of excessive exposure to the radionuclide.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{control their}} use of these {{electron}} donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.|$|E
5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital {{emergency}} situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft {{is extremely difficult to}} perform due <b>to</b> <b>environmental</b> factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.|$|E
