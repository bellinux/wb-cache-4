40|$|The notion <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> {{has long}} been the {{operative}} tool through which healthcare coverage determinations in the United States have been rendered and justified. Now, for most people, decisions about coverage translate into decisions about healthcare since few people can afford to pay for their own healthcare. The notion <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> constitutes a necessary component of any healthcare system that is committed to providing high-quality healthcare at a sustainable cost. In practice, however, reliance on <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> to determine healthcare coverage is only as productive as the larger health care system within which <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations occur. Definitions of both “medical” and “necessity” are flexible and interpretations are varied. As a result, the value <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations depends on the character of a nation’s healthcare delivery and payment structure and on the identity <b>of</b> those rendering <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations. The article examines shifts in the notion <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> through four periods – beginning with a pre- and early-twentieth century world in which medicine was essentially a cottage industry, and continuing through the promulgation and implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The article analyzes relevant legal changes during each period (including the promulgation of Medicare, HIPAA, and the Affordable Care Act) and delineates the social, economic, and political shifts each brought to U. S. healthcare and correlatively, to uses of the notion <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> for determining healthcare coverage. The Article concludes with two sets of suggestions for redesigning the system through which <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations occur. The first set assumes the viability of the Affordable Care Act. The second assumes the possibility of more far-reaching healthcare reform...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} emergence, {{evolution}} and dominance of four predominant mean-ings {{of the concept}} <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> {{that have been used}} in past and current health policy debates about the appropriate level of service coverage under Canada’s health insurance pro-gram. Data for this study derived from a historical analysis of reports and policy or position papers prepared by provincial governments and national health care associations in response to federal legislative and policy reviews of Canada’s evolving health insurance program from 1957 to 1984. More current reports focussing explicitly on <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> were also reviewed. Our analysis revealed four predominant meanings <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity.</b> These are: “what doctors and hospitals do”, “the maximum we can afford”, “what is scientifically justified”, and “what is consistently funded across all provinces”. The paper explores how each of these meanings has evolved and been used by different stakeholder associations and governments to achieve different policy objectives at different points in time. Limitations of using the concept <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> as a policy tool to determine health service coverage under public programs are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|President Clinton's Health Security Act entitles {{individuals}} not to unlimited health care, but to {{a package}} of defined insurance benefits with specific exclusions and limitations. Like virtually all reform proposals, it would limit covered benefits to services that are medically necessary. If health reform is to control costs, not all medically necessary care can be covered. In {{the absence of a}} generally accepted definition <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity,</b> many services will not be guaranteed to all patients unless they are explicitly covered in the federal legislation or regulations. Without a federal definition <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> or regulations listing covered services, health insurance plans will retain the primary authority to decide what is medically necessary for their patient subscribers...|$|R
40|$|The {{policy debate}} in Oregon has {{primarily}} {{focused on the}} Prioritized List of Services. However, little information is available on how defined coverage benefits and managed care affect the role <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> in determining care for Medicaid patients. This issue is important because <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations are currently used by many states to limit extraneous health care costs but require resource-intensive oversight, are open to wide variance, and frequently prompt litigation challenging interpretations of what is necessary and what is not. The qualitative study described here addressed whether <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> remains a salient and useful concept in the Oregon Health Plan. Our results indicate that defined coverage benefits, as described by the funded portion of the Prioritized List <b>of</b> Services, supplant <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations for coverage, while managed care incentives limit the need for <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations at the provider level. Clinical choices are, for the most part, guided by providers' judgment within the financial constraints of capitation and by targeted use management techniques. The combination of capitated care and Oregon's defined coverage benefits package has marginalized the use <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity,</b> albeit with consequences for state oversight of Medicaid services...|$|R

50|$|The Ninth Circuit reversed. It {{held that}} <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> was a legally cognizable defense to charges under the Controlled Substances Act.

5000|$|In 2001, the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative claimed [...] "medical necessity" [...] {{as their}} legal {{justification}} {{for violating the}} federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA).

50|$|In Altham (2006) EWCA Crim 7 the {{defendant}} used cannabis for pain relief following injury in a road accident. He {{was charged with}} possession under s5(2) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The judge at first instance refused to leave the defence <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> to the jury so {{the defendant}} changed his plea to guilty. The Court of Appeal held that Article 3 ECHR not to subject a person to inhuman or degrading treatment does apply to the State. The defendant argued that using cannabis {{was the only way}} in which his symptoms could be alleviated and that he could not do so without committing a criminal offence. Thus, the State, by prosecuting him, subjected him to degrading treatment. The Court said that the State, by refusing cannabis, neither did nor refrained from doing anything that would subject the defendant to degrading treatment. The State had done nothing to change the defendant's condition for better or worse, and there was nothing to require the Court to read the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 as subject to a defence <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>necessity.</b> The Court applied Quayle where the focus was on Article 8, and the defence of necessity was denied because it would be in conflict with the purpose and effect of the legislative scheme.|$|R
