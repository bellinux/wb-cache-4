5|$|Confident {{that the}} results of the 1795 {{election}} would be reversed, Benjamin Logan was the first to declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former U.S. Representative Christopher Greenup also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills. Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a pardon for Field, who was convicted of murdering his wife with an ax. After examining <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue outside influence, but the charge was raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's defense of his refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.|$|E

25|$|Australian {{architectural}} historian John James, {{who made}} a detailed study of the cathedral, has estimated that there were about 300 men working on the site at any one time, although {{it has to be}} acknowledged that current knowledge of working practices at this time is somewhat limited. Normally medieval churches were built from east to west so that the choir could be completed first and put into use (with a temporary wall sealing off the west end) while the crossing and nave were completed. Canon Delaporte argued that building work started at the crossing and proceeded outwards from there, but <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stonework itself is unequivocal, especially within the level of the triforium: the nave was at all times more advanced than ambulatory bays of the choir, and this has been confirmed by dendrochronology.|$|E

[...] The court ordered Brownlee to pay $10,000 in damages to MacMillan, plus trial costs.

500|$|Not {{long after}} the Goode case came the sensational trial of Professor John White Webster {{in the murder of}} George Parkman, a crime that took place at the Harvard Medical School in November 1849. [...] The trial {{received}} nationwide coverage, and the prosecution case was based on evidence that was either circumstantial (complicated by the fact that a complete corpse was not found), or founded on new types of evidence (forensic dentistry was used {{for the first time in}} this trial). [...] Furthermore, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw was widely criticized for bias in the instructions he gave to the jury. [...] Briggs was petitioned to commute Webster's sentence by death penalty opponents, and even threatened with physical harm if he did not.

500|$|An {{effect of}} the Civil War and {{resulting}} Commonwealth of England, particularly the [...] "liberal" [...] values and feelings it stirred up, was the continuous modernisation and improvement of the common law courts, something that reduced the interference of the Lord Chancellor in common law matters, except in areas where they had wildly divergent principles and law. Under Charles II, for the first time, there was a type of common law appeal where the nature of <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial trial was taken into account, which reduced the {{need to go to}} the Court of Chancery. As a result, the nature of the Court of Chancery changed; rather than being a major corrective system for the common law, it became primarily concerned with the administration and protection of rights, as opposed to the common law courts, which were mainly concerned with the remedy and retribution of problems. This was further enforced by the Statute of Frauds, which confirmed Chancery principles across the board, allowing people to receive the same treatment in the common law courts as they did in the Chancery.|$|E

Action on Rights for Children said that the proposals invaded a child's right to privacy given by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while the Joint Committee on Human Rights said that the 'serious interference' with the rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – the right to respect for private life – seemed to be 'difficult to justify'.

500|$|The plaintiffs appealed and {{the case}} went before the Alberta Supreme Court appeals {{division}} in January 1935. [...] On February2, by a 3–2 decision, the court upheld Ives' ruling. [...] The majority ruling by Chief Justice Horace Harvey cast serious doubts on MacMillan's credibility, calling her story [...] "quite unsupported by other evidence" [...] and noting that she [...] "showed a readiness {{to admit that she}} may have been mistaken as regards very positive statements previously made when by the questions it appeared there may be independent evidence she was wrong". [...] In addition to agreeing with Ives on the points of law, he felt that the jury had not based its finding of fact on <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case. [...] Justices Mitchell and Ford concurred. [...] Justice Clarke, in dissent, agreed that MacMillan's story was unlikely, but expressed a willingness to defer to the jury on questions of fact. [...] On the legal questions, he cited a precedent written by Justice Harvey himself in which the chief justice had argued that the inclusion of seduced women as potential plaintiffs under the Seduction Act proved that its framers intended a broader definition of damage than financial damage. [...] Justice Lunney concurred. [...] The court was unanimous in upholding Ives' dismissal of Allan MacMillan's action, and he did not appeal further.|$|E
500|$|The five doctors {{examined}} Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Terri herself. Drs. Cranford, Greer, and Bambakidis {{testified that}} Terri Schiavo {{was in a}} persistent vegetative state. Drs. Maxfield and Hammesfahr testified {{that she was in}} a minimally conscious state. As part of the court-ordered medical exam, six hours of video of Terri Schiavo were taped and filed at the Pinellas County courthouse. The tape included Terri Schiavo with her mother and neurologist William Hammesfahr. The entire tape was viewed by Judge Greer, who wrote, Terri [...] "clearly does not consistently respond to her mother". From that six hours of video, the Schindlers and their supporters produced six clips showing reactions and emotions, totaling less than six minutes, and released those clips to public websites. Judge Greer ruled that Terri Schiavo was in a PVS, and was beyond hope of significant improvement. The trial court order was particularly critical of Hammesfahr's testimony, which claimed positive results in similar cases by use of vasodilation therapy, the success of which is unsupported in the medical literature. This ruling was later affirmed by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, which stated that [...] "this court has closely examined all of <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> record," [...] and [...] "we have... carefully observed the video tapes in their entirety." [...] The court concluded that [...] "...if we were called upon to review the guardianship court's decision de novo, we would still affirm it."

500|$|As a Superior Court judge, George {{presided over}} the trial of Hillside Strangler Angelo Buono in 1981–1983. George also {{presided over the}} trial of Marvin Gay, Sr. for the slaying of Gay's son, the singer Marvin Gaye. George was lauded for his {{extremely}} unusual decision to deny the motion by Los Angeles County District Attorney's office to dismiss all 10 counts of murder against Buono. [...] However, his unusual decision was speculated to {{be a result of}} his earlier decision to separate crucial counts of rape and sodomy, which in themselves would serve as evidence against the defendant, from the murder charges. The prosecutors felt the evidence against Buono was so weak that it did not justify even an attempt to win at trial. [...] Judges rarely second-guess the prosecutors' judgment on such a matter (and George stated that he was [...] "loath" [...] to do so). [...] However, George's review of <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case caused him to feel so strongly that the prosecutors were in error that he did exactly that. [...] George reassigned the case to the California Attorney General's office, and that office successfully convicted Buono on nine of the 10 counts. Thus, it was recognized that the judge, through his action to deny the earlier motion to dismiss, had ultimately prevented a serial killer from going free. [...] Oddly, Los Angeles County District Attorney John Van de Kamp had been elected California Attorney General {{in the middle of the}} lengthy trial, so a Van de Kamp-led District Attorney's office attempted to dismiss the unwinnable case only to have a Van de Kamp-led Attorney General's office win nine convictions in the case.|$|E
