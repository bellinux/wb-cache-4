The aim of the thesis is mainly to define an investment intermediary, {{its role in the}} capital market and to analyze some of the duties connected with its activities. The first chapter of the general part of this thesis is devoted to the concepts of the capital market, the services provider in the capital market and the investment service and ancillary service. The current legislation regulating provision of the investment services and activities is outlined. The second chapter conceptually defines investment intermediary and puts it into the context of the capital market. Some problematic issues related to the conceptual characteristics of the investment intermediary are noticed in this part. Especially, the requirements related to the professional competence of the investment intermediary are analyzed in this part and the conclusion in an inappropriate setting of these requirements is presented to the readers. Chapter three analyzes a very frequent cooperation of an investment intermediary and another entity, the <b>tied</b> <b>agent.</b> Certain problematic aspects of this cooperation are noticed, as well as their negative impact [...] ...|$|E

40|$|My thesis {{consists}} of three main building blocks. The first {{of these is the}} relationship between incentives, allocation of effort, and task performance. Second, I will analyze how person variables, i. e., different forms of labor-market experience, influence the agent's performance. Finally, I discuss the effect of compensation on agent satisfaction, using a model of expectancies and reference-point dependent utility. The data is on German insurance <b>tied</b> <b>agents</b> and was collected {{in the first half of}} 2006. It is based on an online questionnaire among German insurance companies. A total of 9, 386 insurance <b>tied</b> <b>agents</b> from 10 large German insurance companies participated in the survey. The first part of my thesis focuses on the question of how incentives can influence agents' time allocation and whether they can lead to a change in performance. Many recent studies have suggested that incentives matter, and that piece-rates are the best way to endorse the desired behavior. Empirical evidence that supports this hypothesis, however, is scarce. Alongside the problem of if and how incentives increase the amount of effort exerted by the agent, there is also the question of how the effort is allocated. A common hypothesis among practitioners is that there is always a trade-off between acquiring new customers and caring for existing ones. I use the concept of a multi-task model to describe this trade-off between selling and customer care. First, I develop a two-period multi-task model and derive hypotheses regarding the influence of effort allocation on performance and how commission rates can be used to steer this allocation. Second, I test the hypotheses using data on auto insurance sales of three German insurance companies. I find a significant positive effect of the time spent on customer care activities both on the portfolio size and new business production. The new business commission rate has a positive effect on selling and a negative effect on customer care time. The results for the recurring commission rate are mixed. In the second part of my thesis, I turn towards the influence of individual characteristics of each worker. The human capital theory is well-known and seeks to explain the relationship between experience and pay, stating that more experience makes the employee more valuable and should thus lead to higher wages. Previous research has cast some doubts on this simple relationship and suggested that the type of experience needs to be differentiated from the total sum of experience. I differentiate three categories of experience: industry-specific, job-specific and general labor-market experience. Based on the standard wage model, I test the influence of experience using the data on <b>tied</b> <b>agents.</b> I find both the expected strong effect of tenure on pay due to the special structure of agent compensation in this industry, and that general- and industry-specific labor market experience also have positive effects. The latter deviate is dependent on the agent's tenure: it is strong for agents with low tenure, but becomes rather weak or even negative for high-tenure agents. A detailed look into the effects on different compensation components reveals a high degree of diversity in the size and direction of the experience-related influence on wage. By applying an instrumental variable (IV) approach and introducing proxy variables for the job- and industry-match, the chapter also contributes to the discussion regarding the omitted-variable bias that can arise from using simple OLS instead of IV. Finally, the third part of my thesis discusses the motivational aspects of compensation. Recent publications found that the expected wage acts as a reference-point and that performance drops after that target is met. One of the most often analyzed phenomena in the context of reference points is "loss aversion": people usually feel that a loss reduces their utility far more than a comparable gain would increase it. Based on this line of thought, I present empirical evidence for the existence of a reference-point for satisfaction with compensation. Information on the satisfaction (both with pay, and overall) of the <b>tied</b> <b>agents</b> is used to test the hypotheses. An ordered probit regression and a subsequent analysis of the marginal effects is applied to investigate the influence of compensation on the satisfaction score. I find a relationship between the agents' deviation from peer-group compensation and their satisfaction with pay. Surprisingly, the analysis shows a positive relation with satisfaction for deviations above the peer-group median but no statistically significant relation for deviations below the median. These results run contrary to the common notion of loss aversion presented in other publications. In line with previous work, no relation is found between compensation and overall satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt {{is common}} to define the {{structure}} of interactions among a population of agents using the social network metaphor.

40|$|Abstract. In the Hospitals/Residents (HR) problem, {{agents are}} {{partitioned}} into hospitals and residents. Each agent wishes to be matched to an agent (or agents) {{in the other}} set and has a strict preference over these potential matches. A matching is stable {{if there are no}} blocking pairs, i. e., no pair of agents that prefer each other to their assigned matches. Such a situation is undesirable as it could lead to a deviation in which the blocking pair form a private arrangement outside the matching. This however assumes that the blocking pair have social ties or communication channels to facilitate the deviation. Relaxing the stability definition to take account of the potential lack of social <b>ties</b> between <b>agents</b> can yield larger stable matchings.

40|$|I investigate how individuals’ {{identities and}} social {{networks}} shape {{not only their}} knowledge of the law, but their tendencies to obey or disobey it. Using elite amateur baseball players and their illicit relationships with agents as a case study, I reveal a complex social structure that <b>ties</b> <b>agent</b> use to elite status, {{while at the same time}} hiding the NCAA rules violations associated with it. I create a dialog between political heuristics (cue theory) and legal consciousness to examine the ways that cultural structures create the conditions for individual cognitive shortcuts to replicate their social world. 	Many players mimic rational behavior by elites despite differing incentive structures. This dissertation argues that players’ narrative identities shape who they think of as relative peers and encourage them to act in ways that replicate the norm of agent use despite a cost to those who perpetuate it. Baseball’s embedded practices of self-confidence and self-deception affect both the existence of cues and the ways those cues are taken. The cultural roles that players and coaches perform with each other abjure the business of baseball, forcing players into the pattern of agent use and hiding from them alternative ways of playing their social role. 	Legal consciousness and cue theory offer each other ways to enrich their inquiries. Cue theory gives legal consciousness a new, productive way to think about how people navigate social structures and act in ways that replicate them, while in return getting a way to think about how cues are constructed in the first place, and how identity and culture can shape how we take them. What happens in amateur baseball shines a light on the ways we all try to find our way through complex rule-bound systems, and on how those systems push us along predefined paths...|$|R
