5|$|In the mid- {{and late}} 1950s, {{the attitudes and}} {{institutions}} of McCarthyism slowly weakened. Changing public sentiments heavily contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of McCarthyism. Its decline may also be charted {{through a series of}} court decisions.|$|E
5|$|Similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> {{over time}} in wives as being portrayed solely as housekeepers, the {{portrayal}} of mothers as the primary physical care takers of children {{has been on the}} decline. Instead, there has been an increase in the portrayal of mothers as facilitating recreational activities with their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} iron {{ships in the}} late 19thcentury and the {{development}} of port facilities on the River Tees led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of smaller Yorkshire harbours. The Monks-haven launched in 1871 was the last wooden ship built Whitby and a year later the harbour was silted up.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} pubs {{have been based}} on Great Marlborough Street for centuries. The Coach and Horses at No.1 and the Marlborough Head at Nos.37–38 were both {{established}} in the 1730s. However, most of the 18th century buildings on Great Marlborough Street were later demolished, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of its reputation as a fashionable street.|$|E
5|$|Air Wonder Stories and Science Wonder Stories were merged in 1930 as Wonder Stories, and the {{quarterly}} was renamed Wonder Stories Quarterly. The magazines were not financially successful, and in 1936 Gernsback sold Wonder Stories to Ned Pines at Beacon Publications, where, retitled Thrilling Wonder Stories, it continued for nearly 20years. The last issue was dated Winter 1955, {{and the title}} was then merged with Startling Stories, another of Pines' science fiction magazines. Startling itself lasted only {{to the end of}} 1955 before finally succumbing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of the pulp magazine industry.|$|E
5|$|An Lushan (安祿山), a {{military}} leader of Sogdian (from his father's side) and Tūjué origin during the Tang dynasty in China; {{he rose to}} prominence by fighting (and losing) frontier wars between 741 and 755. Later, he precipitated the catastrophic An Lushan Rebellion, which lasted from 755 to 763 and led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of the Tang dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Another tragedy {{occurred}} {{on the morning of}} 16 May 1968 when Ronan Point, a 23-storey tower block in Newham, suffered a structural collapse due to a natural gas explosion. Four people were killed in the disaster and seventeen were injured, as an entire corner of the building slid away. The collapse caused major changes in UK building regulations and led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of further building of high rise council flats that had characterised 1960s public architecture.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are popular}} birds in aviculture, but their needs are {{difficult}} to meet. The cockatiel is the easiest cockatoo species to maintain and {{is by far the}} most frequently kept in captivity. White cockatoos are more commonly found in captivity than black cockatoos. Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of some cockatoo species in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great white sharks in the Pliocene, may have also contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> and extinction of megalodon. Fossil records indicate that the new whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures; but they also occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E

5|$|During and {{following}} the American Revolutionary War, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the westward thrust of Euro-American settlement led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of the Overhill towns. The Cherokee were forced to cede most of their lands in this area {{through a series of}} unfavorable treaties with the United States, and they migrated to the south and west away from settler pressure for a time.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of Mecca, Muhammad was alarmed by a {{military}} threat from the confederate tribes of Hawazin who were raising an army double the size of Muhammad's. The Banu Hawazin were old enemies of the Meccans. They were joined by the Banu Thaqif (inhabiting the city of Ta'if) who adopted an anti-Meccan policy due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of the prestige of Meccans. Muhammad defeated the Hawazin and Thaqif tribes in the Battle of Hunayn.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-20th century, {{imports of}} cheaper foreign goods led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of Ashton's heavy {{industries}} but {{the town has}} continued to thrive as a centre of commerce and Ashton Market {{is one of the}} largest outdoor markets in the United Kingdom. The , two-floored Ashton Arcades shopping centre opened in 1995 and an IKEA store in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Sabine Haenni, a {{professor}} at Cornell University, commented on the film: [...] "While Taxi Driver chronicles Travis's excessive response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> perceived <b>decline</b> of <b>the</b> city, perhaps more fundamentally, <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of <b>the</b> city seems <b>to</b> engender <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of <b>the</b> male hero—Travis's inability to function in individual, collective, and heteronormative terms." ...|$|R

5|$|Marine {{conservation}} {{has recently}} garnered support in Puerto Rico. The archipelago has an estimated 700miles (1,126.5km) of coastline and 1,300mi2 (3,370km2) of coral reef communities. The Department of Natural Resources of Puerto Rico maintains 25 areas with marine components {{but only two}} of these (11km2) are designated as no-take zones. All turtle species occurring in Puerto Rico's waters are classified as either endangered or threatened. Earthwatch-supported turtle conservation programs and U.S. federal programs have raised local awareness and have contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of egg-poaching and turtle meat consumption.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{published}} in November 2006 suggested that Education Secretary Alan Johnson was exploring ways {{to raise the}} school leaving age in England to 18, just over 40 years later than the last rise in 1972, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in unskilled jobs {{and the need for}} young people to be equipped for modern day employment.|$|E
5|$|The built {{environment}} around Coatbridge's town centre is characterised by its mixture of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century sandstone buildings and late twentieth-century precast concrete shops. The leafy Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation areas {{to the west}} and north of the town centre comprise detached, semi-detached and terraced sandstone residential buildings. The bulk of the remaining surrounding areas consist of various twentieth-century local authority housing buildings. Several high rise flats dominate the skyline. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of industries, several private housing estates have been built on reclaimed land.|$|E
50|$|Several stores {{closed in}} 2009 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> economy, {{including}} Old Navy, Foot Locker, Waldenbooks and the Dillard's anchor. The Old Navy space became a family entertainment center called Saturn 5 in 2010.|$|R
50|$|Enrollment {{steadily}} {{climbed to}} a high of 1094 students (326 black, 768 white) in 1977-78. The 1978-79 enrollment due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> birth rate of the early 1960s decreased to 954 (326 black, 661 white).|$|R

5|$|The feudalising of {{the society}} during the Angevin rule reduced royal wealth and treasury. The {{dependence}} of the Angevin on north Italian commerce and financing by Florentine bankers were the main factors which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of the Kingdom's economy. The continuation of the economic decline combined with the increased population and urbanization led to decrease of agrarian production.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who praised its {{artistic design}} and overall game direction in particular. Grim Fandango {{was selected for}} several gaming awards {{at the time of}} release, and is often listed {{as one of the greatest}} video games of all time. However, the game was considered a commercial failure and factored into LucasArts' termination of their adventure game development, contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> of the adventure game genre.|$|E
5|$|The renewed {{interest}} in residential schools in the early 1800s has been linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the War of 1812. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement. This perspective was further underscored by the transfer of affairs with Indigenous communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs and way of life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.|$|E
25|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> Japanese economy, by 2000 the Japanese {{presence}} in Westchester County had decreased, {{and as of}} 2002, <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> presence led <b>to</b> closures of businesses {{and the end of}} some activities. However, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2009-2013 American Community Survey, the number of Japanese had increased back to approximately 5,000 in Westchester County.|$|R
