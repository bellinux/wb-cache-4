50|$|This {{engine type}} {{was found on}} cars like Mercedes and Stutz and the last <b>T-head</b> engine in {{production}} for personal cars was manufactured by an American company, Locomobile. The Pierce-Arrow company introduced a production four-valve per cylinder <b>T-head</b> motor (Dual Valve Six) in 1918, one of the few, perhaps the only, multi-valve valve-in-block type engines produced. American LaFrance produced <b>T-head</b> engines for their fire engines until the 1950s, though they also built overhead-cam engines in the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the exhaust}} follows a lengthy path {{to leave the}} engine, there is a {{tendency}} for the engine to overheat. In a <b>T-head</b> engine, the sidevalve pairs have a crossflow configuration, so exhaust gases leave {{on the opposite side of}} the cylinder from the intake valve. American LaFrance powered their fire engines with <b>T-head</b> engines from the 1920s to the 1950s. The Cleveland Motorcycle Manufacturing Company produced a <b>T-head</b> four-cylinder in-line motorcycle engine in the 1920s, and early Stutz engines were T heads.|$|E

5000|$|The first bolts had square heads, {{formed by}} forging. These are still found, {{although}} {{much more common}} today is the hexagonal head. These are held and turned by a spanner or wrench, {{of which there are}} many forms. Most are held from the side, some from in-line with the bolt. Other bolts have <b>T-heads</b> and slotted heads.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{concrete}} structures for safety-related nuclear facilities {{is governed by}} demands calculated for load combinations involving the safe shutdown earthquake (SSE). Excessive amounts of longitudinal and transverse reinforcement (in excess of 2 % reinforcement ratio) are required to provide essentially elastic behavior for the SSE and to resist the design demands. Additionally, conventional single-leg tie reinforcement with 90 ° and 135 ° hooks at alternate ends are required at some locations for seismic detailing. All these requirements lead to rebar congestion, and make conventional single-leg ties difficult to install in reinforced concrete structures. T-headed bars are being considered to resolve this issue. These consist of deformed reinforcing bars with <b>T-heads</b> {{in the form of}} welded or threaded rebar terminators with bearing area {{greater than or equal to}} four times the reinforcing bar area. To investigate the effectiveness of T-headed bars for use as single-leg ties, this type of reinforcement was used as shear reinforcement in beam specimens to investigate the anchorage ability of the <b>T-heads</b> to develop the yield strength of the tie bars. These tests were needed because the experimental data regarding the shear strength of reinforced concrete structures with T-headed bars is lacking. ^ This study presents the results of an experimental investigation and numerical analysis conducted to evaluate the shear strength and behavior of reinforced concrete beams using T-headed bars as shear reinforcement, and to extrapolate from those results the suitability of T-headed bars for use as single-leg ties. The behavior of specimens with three different depths of 18 in., 24 in., and 36 in. and three different T-headed bar sizes (# 5, # 7, and # 9) are investigated and compared with the behavior of companion specimens with conventional stirrups. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{popularity}} of pleasure steamer services began to drop before World War II, due to {{competition from the}} cheaper motor bus. As a result, post-War there was some considerable deterioration to address, and with the decline in pleasure steamers, the decision was taken to demolish the <b>T-head</b> pontoon.|$|E
5000|$|The A.E.C. {{company was}} founded in April 1912 {{by a man named}} Walter A. Anger. He was {{described}} as [...] "a well-known auto tradesman". He had either <b>T-head</b> or L-head engines with either four or six cylinders. Most cars were built custom made. But in 1915, the company went under.|$|E
50|$|Early {{multi-valve}} {{engines in}} <b>T-head</b> configuration were the 1917 Stutz straight-4 and 1919 Pierce-Arrow straight-6 engines. The standard flathead engines {{of that day}} were not very efficient and designers tried to improve engine performance by using multiple valves. The Stutz Motor Company used a modified <b>T-head</b> with 16 valves, twin-spark ignition and aluminium pistons to produce 80 bhp (59 kW) at 2400 rpm from a 360.8 cid (5.8-liter) straight-4 (0.22 bhp per cubic inch). Over 2300 of these powerful early multi-valve engines were built. Stutz not only used them in their famous Bearcat sportscar but in their standard touring cars as well. In 1919 Pierce-Arrow introduced its 524.8 cid (8.6-liter) straight-6 with 24 valves. The engine produced 48.6 bhp (0.09 bhp per cubic inch) and ran very quietly, which was an asset to the bootleggers of that era.|$|E
50|$|One popular {{style is}} the star anchor — an anchor plate cast or wrought {{in the shape of}} a five-pointed star. Other names and styles of anchor plate include {{earthquake}} washer, triangular washer, S-iron, and <b>T-head.</b> In the United Kingdom, pattress plate is the term for circular restraints, tie bar being an alternate term for rectangular restraints.|$|E
5000|$|Chevrolet's first {{engine was}} a liquid-cooled 299-cubic-inch, six-cylinder {{cast-iron}} block cast in {{three groups of}} two, with a <b>T-head</b> configuration, that produced 40 horsepower. The <b>T-head</b> engine is a side valve engine that is distinguished from the much more common L-head engine by its placement of the valves. The intake valves are {{on one side of}} the engine block and the exhaust valves on the other, making dual camshafts necessary. Seen from the end of the crankshaft, in cutaway view, the cylinder and combustion chamber resembles a T - hence the name [...] "T-head". The 299 was a very large engine at that time and the only engine in the C Series. In 1913 the ignition was a Simms magneto with a compressed-air starter. For 1914 the ignition was now a Simms High Tension Magneto and the starter used was a Gray & Davis. This was the biggest Chevy engine until the 1958, 348 cid V-8.? ...|$|E

50|$|The Pierce-Arrow's engine {{displacement}} started at a massive 11.7 L and was increased later to 13.5 L, {{at the time}} making it {{by far the largest}} engine offered in any production automobile in the world. In 1910 Pierce dropped its other 4-cylinder models and focused exclusively on 6-cylinder cars. The model 6-36, 6-48, and 6-66 continued for the next decade. Starting in 1918, Pierce-Arrow adopted a four-valve per cylinder <b>T-head</b> inline-six engine (Dual Valve Six), one of the few, if only, multi-valve flathead design engines ever made.|$|E
5000|$|... 1907 was {{the last}} {{year in which the}} company offered but one single model. Again, it was a new one, and again, it was the largest and most {{powerful}} yet. The 30/60 rode on a 120-inch (3048 mm). It had a massive <b>T-head</b> four-cylinder engine with the cylinder block cast in pairs, displacing 536 c.i. (8783 cc) and delivering 60 HP. There were two body styles available: a Touring with either 5 or 7 seats for $4,500 each, and a 7-passenger Pullman at $4,759.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>T-head</b> {{engine is}} an early type of {{internal}} combustion engine that became obsolete after World War I.It is a sidevalve engine that is distinguished from the much more common L-head by its placement of the valves. The intake valves are {{on one side of}} the engine block and the exhaust valves on the other. Seen from the end of the crankshaft, in cutaway view, the cylinder and combustion chamber resembles a T - hence the name [...] "T-head". An L-head has all valves at the same side.|$|E
50|$|The <b>T-head</b> was {{rendered}} obsolete in {{the passenger}} car market {{by a combination of}} engine advances made in World War I and the introduction of effective anti-knock compounds such as tetraethyl lead in the early 1920s. When combined, these advances made flathead engines just as reliable as T-heads while also being more powerful, lighter, more fuel efficient, and cheaper to manufacture. The T-heads' incredible reliability did however keep them in service in heavy equipment, large trucks, and fire trucks until they were finally phased out of production in the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|The Packard Model 30 was {{a luxury}} car {{introduced}} for the 1907 model year. It replaced the Model S. It featured a touring body with {{right hand drive}} and a crank starter mounted to a four-cylinder <b>T-head</b> engine. The pricey 30 was marketed just above the Model 18 (literally a 9/10 scale model of the Model 30). In 1911 Packard introduced the Packard Six as a 1912 model and phased out the four-cylinder Model 30s. [...] The Model 30 {{was replaced by the}} Packard Twin Six as the top level car in May 1915.|$|E
5000|$|By 1912 Vermorel were {{offering}} cars with engine sizes of 2.2 and 3.3 litre capacity. The <b>T-head</b> engine configuration was by now already seen as rather old fashioned, and in 1913 the manufacturer introduced L-head engine designs for their [...] "8/10 CV" [...] and [...] "16/20 CV" [...] with engine capacities of respectively 1.5 and 2.8 litres. The similarly configured [...] "12/16 CV" [...] 2.3 litre engined version that appeared {{a year later}} was Vermorel's last new model before the war (and {{would be the first}} model to reappear when hostilities ended over four years later).|$|E
5000|$|In 1924, {{two years}} after buying out Reading-Standard, Cleveland {{replaced}} their two-stroke engine with a [...] four-stroke single-cylinder engine. In 1925 they released a motorcycle with a [...] <b>T-head</b> four-cylinder engine designed by L. E. Fowler. With a smaller engine than rival four-cylinder motorcycles by Henderson and Ace, Cleveland's first four-cylinder motorcycle did not sell well. In 1926, Cleveland replaced the Fowler engine with a new design by E. H. DeLong. The new engine had an inlet-over-exhaust valve configuration and a displacement of forty-five cubic inches. The displacement was increased to sixty-one cubic inches the following year.|$|E
5000|$|The {{result was}} one of the most admired sports cars of the decade; the 1910 Type-35R Raceabout, a stripped-down, two-seat speedster, {{designed}} to be [...] "safely and consistently" [...] driven at over 70 mph. It was capable of over 90 mi/h km/h. The Raceabout's inline 4-cylinder <b>T-head</b> engine displaced [...] and developed [...] at 1,650 revolutions per minute. It won five of the six 1911 races it was entered in, losing only the first Indianapolis 500. Hundreds of racing victories followed. The Raceabout became one of the premier racing thoroughbreds of the era- highly coveted for its quality construction and exceptional handling.|$|E
50|$|Previous Herbert Austin {{cars for}} Wolseley Motors, which Austin founded, kept {{horizontal}} engines after vertical engines became the norm. Herbert Austin allowed {{his refusal to}} specify vertical engines to become the contract-breaking component of his disagreements with the Wolseley directors. He would provide a list of very pressing reasons for giving preference to horizontal engines. This 25-30, the first car bearing his own name, had a vertical engine. Either Austin reviewed his stance and changed it or his backers made him change. This vertical straight 4-cylinder 318 cu in (5185 cc) <b>T-head</b> engine with 4½ in bore x 5 in stroke (114 mm x 127 mm) was automatically governed {{to a maximum of}} 900 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} years of the twentieth century France was the world's leading {{automobile}} producer and the years from 1908 to 1914 were boom years for the sector: by 1911 Vermorel was employing 800 people.The first production model, in 1908, owed less to Pilain than to a talented engineer called Claude Givaudan who had joined the company in the meantime and who designed the chassis. [...] The manufacturer's first production model used a 1.8-litre 4-cylinder <b>T-head</b> engine with a four speed transmission and three-quarter-elliptic rear suspension. [...] A proliferation of Givaudan designs followed, though some proved very ephemeral, and it is not till approximately 1911 that a relatively stable Vermorel automobile range can be identified.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the hotel}} stood almost on the bayshore (Water Street, on its east side, {{at that time}} ran along the water's edge) and thus {{convenient}} to one of Corpus Christi's main attractions. Until the present landfill and seawall were built Peoples Street extended out as a covered pier over the water, covered in deference to ladies' modesty, that ended in a pavilion. In 1922 this was replaced with the Pleasure Pier, a similar wooden wharf-like structure for fishing and mooring boats. When the seawall was finished the water was further from the building but still within easy walking distance. In 1940 Peoples Street reached to the <b>T-head,</b> a paved parking area shaped like a letter T extending {{out on the water}} for fishing and boat slips.|$|E
5000|$|A revised 15 hp {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1911 dropping the monobloc engine and reverting to Austin's usual individually cast cylinders side-valve <b>T-head</b> engine design but an increased stroke of 4.5 in gave a capacity of 2838 cc [...] With the same bore it remained rated at 19.6 hp. Austin manufactured 688 of these more powerful cars. It had a four-speed gearbox with cone clutch, shaft and bevel-drive back axle. Suspension was provided by semi-elliptic leaf springs at the front and Austin-patent full-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Brakes were by rear wheel drum and transmission brakes. The wheels were wooden artillery style wheels with Michelin detachable rims, 815 x 105 beaded-edge tyres. In 1913, a powered chassis with tyres was available for £350.|$|E
