5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>moon</b> occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and {{there will always be}} at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>moon</b> occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.|$|E
5|$|Other {{peculiar}} calendars include ancient Greek calendars. These were nominally lunar, {{starting with}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Moon.</b> In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates {{by both the}} civic calendar and ton theoi, by the moon. The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as games or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism {{may have been used}} as a politically neutral form of timekeeping. Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>moon,</b> salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.|$|E

2500|$|The days of {{the month}} are counted in two halves, waxing ( [...] ) and waning ( [...] ).

5|$|The Hamsa mendicants are {{constantly}} on the move, staying in villages for just one night, in towns {{no more than five}} nights, and in sacred places for no more than seven nights. The ascetic practice of Hamsa monks includes daily consumption of the urine and dung of a cow. The Hamsa monks practice the Chandrayana cycle in their food eating habit, wherein they vary the amount of food they eat with the lunar cycle. They eat a single mouthful of food on the day after the dark new moon night, increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases, and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night. Thereafter, they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day until they reach <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>moon</b> night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many stories to {{interpret}} the intercalation, a period of 22 or 23 days is always ¾ synodic month.

50|$|An ecclesiastical <b>new</b> <b>moon</b> is <b>the</b> {{first day}} of a lunar month (an ecclesiastical moon) in an ecclesiastical lunar calendar. Such months have a whole number of days, 29 or 30, whereas true synodic months can vary from about 29.27 to 29.83 days in length. Medieval authors equated <b>the</b> ecclesiastical <b>new</b> <b>moon</b> with a <b>new</b> {{crescent}} <b>moon,</b> {{but it is not}} a phase of the true moon.
