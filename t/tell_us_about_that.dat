NLP's creators claim {{there is a connection}} between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can [...] "model" [...] the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills. They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, GINA: [...] I have seen you demonstrate a technique that some people refer to as Dr. Bandler's Beauty treatment? Please <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> RICHARD : [...] Basically what happened is that I noticed that when I hypnotically regress people repeatedly they looked younger. So I started first thinking, well isn't there a way to maintain that. I noticed when I hypnotically regressed people to before the age of 5, who currently wore glasses, didn't need them to see. So I started leaving people's eyes young and growing the rest of them up to the present and it would change the prescription of their glasses radically {{to the point where they}} could see better. And done enough times, some of them could see without glasses. So I went a little step further, and did a DHE (Design Human Engineering™) treatment where we set up a mechanism in the back of their mind that repeatedly age regresses them hypnotically; when they sleep, when they blink, all kinds of things and in a state of time distortion. And it can take years off the way people look, it also ups their energy level and in some cases the bi product [...] has been they recovered spontaneously from very serious diseases. Because they were aged regressed to where before the disease started. Now I cannot prove that but I've seen it enough times that I'm impressed with it.}} allergy, common cold, and learning disorders.|$|E

The very next thing I heard of her, was in a newspaper--Emmeline Alliner, sixteen, had been {{committed}} for trial for causing the death of her illegitimate child by exposure. I was on the sick list in January, and went home to rest. I had not been there two days before I received a visit from a solicitor of our assize town, who came to ask me if I would give evidence at the girl's trial as to the nature of her home surroundings. I learned from him the details of the lugubrious business. It seems that she had slipped out one bitter afternoon in December, barely a fortnight after her confinement, carrying her baby. There was snow on the ground, and it was freezing hard, but the sun was bright, and it was that perhaps which tempted her. She must have gone up towards the Downs by the lane where I had twice met her; gone up, and stopped at the very gap in the bank where she had been sitting lost in that heavy dream when I saw her last. She appears to have subsided there in the snow, for there she was found by the postman just as it was getting dark, leaning over her knees as if stupefied, with her chin buried in her hands--and the baby stiff and dead in the snow beside her. When I told the lawyer how I had seen her there ten weeks before, and of the curious dazed state she had been in, he said at once: 'Ah! the exact spot. That's very important; it looks uncommonly as if it were there that she came by her misfortune. What do you think? It's almost evident that she'd lost sense of her surroundings, baby and all. I shall ask you to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> at the trial. She's a most peculiar child; I can't get anything out of her. I keep asking her for the name of the man, or some indication of how it came about, but all she says is: [...] "Nobody--nobody!" [...] Another case of immaculate conception! Poor little creature, she's very pathetic, and that's her best chance. Who could condemn a child like that?' ...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the transition from}} post-revolutionary Soviet culture (1917 - 1928) {{to the culture of}} the Stalinsist period, arguing for a crucial transformation in the status of agency, subjecthood, and authorship between these two historical and cultural frames. I contend that Soviet culture has much to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> momentous event of the twentieth century, the "death of author" or, more broadly, the "death of the subject"—an event that Western thought has illuminated from various perspectives (philosophy, psychoanalysis, linguistics, structural anthropology, political economy, etc.). The analysis proceeds from a consideration of prominent literary and aesthetic theories of the 1910 s and 1920 s—Formalism, the sociological criticism of the "Pereverzev school," the artistic platforms of left avant-garde, the ideological positions of RAPP, etc. —in an attempt to present these often divergent currents of thought and praxis as homologous, as participating in the same "act": the cultural act of modernism. Characteristic of this act, I argue, is the attempt to transcend the dimension of the individual subjective and, in this very transcendence, institute an impersonal, suprahuman objectivity. The symbolic price for reaching this state of superhuman truth is the "instrumentalization" of human agency. The concrete result of the modernist act is Stalinism: {{a world in which the}} very production of truth and reality is coterminous with the ritualistic surrender of agency and autonomy. In the thesis' second part, I discuss socialist realism as a concrete instance of this surrender, seeking to demonstrate to what extent the position of the so-called "representing subject" in socialist realism is antinomic with the notion of authorship...|$|E
5000|$|His approach, {{just like}} Rashevsky's latest {{theories}} of organismic sets, emphasizes biological organization over molecular structure {{in an attempt}} to bypass the structure-functionality relationships that are important to all experimental biologists, including physiologists.

40|$|Design Archeology {{combines}} communication {{design with}} archeological methods for evaluating material culture to produce {{new forms of}} graphic identity. It is a research methodology for examining cultural practices and activities of the moment {{in order to create}} a “snapshot” of a community’s identity from its material culture. Graphic Reconstructions of Kreuzberg Berlin is a graphic identity developed from ephemera (receipts, tickets, posters and flyers) collected from the streets of Kreuzberg, Berlin over a three-week period. The project examines the language of transactions and advertising and its impact on community identity. The final series of posters were installed back at the original site in Berlin. Surrounded by a plethora of advertisements, receipts, tickets, receipts, junk mail and more, this ephemera offers an immediate “snapshot” into a very specific moment in time. What if the information contained within could be captured, recorded, and interpreted? What would it <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> specific moment in time, identity, cultural patterns, and the relationship of language and media? These Graphic reconstructions manifest itself in the form of posters and receipts. The content used in the posters came from transaction-based ephemera, and the content used in the receipts came from advertising-based ephemera. The inversion of media was used to “make strange” and change the context in which these items are normally seen, in an effort to reexamine cultural patterns and information that normally go unseen. This was done as a tool to evaluate transaction language, consumption and selling patterns and the locality of Kreuzberg. While the outcome does not offer a cohesive identity, it reveals ethnic backgrounds, trends in purchases, travel patterns based on transaction, nightlife locations, and a globalized and “businessfied” culture.

40|$|This {{is a work}} in progress. It {{may look}} like a {{finished}} academic paper with its text bristling with citations and references, but that is an illusion—in Freud’s sense. It is a wish—a wish to be done with this terrible topic. Over the summer of 2001 a book of mine was completed titled Terror and Transformation: The Am-biguity of Religion in Psychoanalytic Perspective (Jones, 2002). Be-cause it had the word Terror in the title and came out a few months after 9 / 11, I have been swept up into a vortex of discus-sions about religion and terrorism, a topic I find extremely for-eign to my experience and very aversive. Also, like many in the New York metropolitan area, I find that 9 / 11 still casts a longer shadow over my life (in ways that I still find hard to talk about) than the World Trade Center towers ever cast when they stood erect over lower Manhattan. As much as I want to escape from these discussions, I have been unable to. I am writing as a clinical psychologist of religion, interested in the psychological dynamics involved in religion and especially in religiously motivated violence and what that might contribute to the psychology of religion. I am not proposing a general the-ory of terrorism but rather asking what a psychological, primar-ily psychodynamic, exploration of religious terrorism might <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> phenomenon and about the psychology of religion in general. Reading the literature on this topic I am struck by the paucity of discussion of both of these factors—the psychody-namics of religious terrorists and the religious aspect itself. In part that is because most of the mainstream, scholarly literature is written by social psychologists, not clinicians, and political sci-entists rather than by scholars of religion or psychologists of reli...|$|E

The excavated buildings included the original 1638 manor house, 1640 s and 1660 s outbuildings, and a circa 1720 replacement farmhouse. Historical records document another dwelling of the 1740 s. Architectural preservation at the excavated sites was unusually good and significantly increased our knowledge of Chesapeake construction. The evolution of these structures illustrates extensive environmental and social adaptation. What society produced these buildings? What do these buildings <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> society?^ Manorial lord and Provincial Secretary John Lewger established St. John 2 ̆ 7 s Freehold. Circa 1640, his household numbered twenty persons. By English standards, Lewger 2 ̆ 7 s dwelling was a modest center for such a household. By frontier standards, it was an unusually expensive one, as early Maryland carpenters commanded wages thrice those of their English peers. Subsequent owners of St. John 2 ̆ 7 s resorted to cheaper forms of construction. ^ During Maryland 2 ̆ 7 s first century, architecture evolved through four phases. The 1638 house was representative of the first [...] the importation of English prototypes. Few were functional in the Chesapeake. By circa 1650, carpenters were evolving a peculiarly Chesapeake architecture based on riven timber, post-in-the-ground framing, and tobacco house scaffolding. These buildings were cheap, but rotted down in 25 years. Circa 1675 - 1725, rapid evolution continued as carpenters developed a more enduring, inexpensive structure. Their product was the 2 ̆ 2 bastard 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 lap work 2 ̆ 2 building, a structure whose sills were raised off the ground on cedar or locust blocks, but whose walls and roofs were framed without expensive mortise and tenon joints. Following the 1713 improvement in tobacco prices, crude frontier construction increasingly was replaced with improved box-frame or brick buildings, but these new structures were thoroughly Chesapeake in design and bore {{little resemblance to the}} English structures that had been imported into the Chesapeake only a century earlier. ^ The rapid evolution of Chesapeake architecture establishes that seventeenth-century Englishmen were technologically innovative. This same evolution makes the study of architecture an effective way of monitoring cultural adaptation and social change. ...|$|E
