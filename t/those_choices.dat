Clara tells the Doctor she does not want to see him again, and takes comfort with Danny Pink, though Danny sees she is still not ready to forget the Doctor. Clara returns to her flat that evening and looks reflectively at the moon.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, writing {{that while there}} had been a [...] "self-congratulatory quality" [...] to Glee since its mid-season break, [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] was a return to [...] "the Glee [...] fell in tormented love with." [...] He graded the songs performed [...] "C−" [...] through to [...] "A−", commending what he deemed [...] "by far the greatest performance of [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] ever". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also felt the episode was a return to form. He praised the decision not to [...] "apply meaningless rules to their musical selections", writing: [...] "The freedom to not have to use songs by one artist let the storylines take priority, and not sticking to songs that share a common lyrical theme kept <b>those</b> <b>choices</b> from feeling too forced." [...] Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times recapped the episode positively, describing it as: [...] "pack more camp into an hour's worth of television than most kids will get all summer." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] "B+", writing that he: [...] "enjoyed the episode quite a bit, even as [...] found some of it rather messy." [...] Though VanDerWerff felt that not everything in the episode worked, he stated: [...] "the stuff that did reminded me that what I like about the show is its all-out embrace of a crazy mishmash of tones." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether kindergarten-age children showed traditional gender role behaviors in {{their choice of}} play activities. Participating {{in the study were}} 9 boys and 11 girls, all 5 or 6 years old and attending the same kindergarten class in a middle size, suburban elementary school. Data on student choice behavior were gathered during the daily 45 -minute choice time, based on observations and on interviews. It was hypothesized that a greater percentage of male participants than female participants would opt to play in <b>those</b> <b>choice</b> activities that had been determined as traditionally male (such as computers, blocks, Legos, and science table); that a greater percentage of female participants than male participants would opt to play in <b>those</b> <b>choice</b> activities that had been determined as traditionally female (such as art easel, art projects, playing with dolls, and cooking); and that similar percentages of males and females would opt to play in choice activities determined as neutral (such as listening center, library, and sand table). Findings for traditionally male activities that were consistent with the hypothesis were found for blocks, boy dress-up, and Legos. Choice patterns for all traditionally female and neutral activities were consistent with the hypotheses. (Contains 27 references.)

"Judge Wilhelm," [...] a pseudonymous {{author of}} Either/Or {{and the voice}} who defines the ethical consciousness, argues that the {{commitment}} {{to take responsibility for}} one's own choices must be made individually. To take responsibility for the various relationships in which an individual finds him- or herself is a possibility open to every human being, but it does not follow that every human being chooses to do so as a matter of course. The meaning of a person's life for Wilhelm depends on how he takes responsibility for his current and future choices, and how he takes ownership of <b>those</b> <b>choices</b> already made. For Wilhelm, the ethically governed person takes responsibility for past actions, some good and some bad, seeks consistency, and takes seriously the obligation to live in a passionate and devoted way.|$|E

2500|$|Humanity {{has lost}} meaning because the {{accepted}} criterion {{of reality and}} truth is ambiguous and subjective thought—that which cannot be proven with logic, historical research, or scientific analysis. Humans cannot think out choices in life, we must live them; and even <b>those</b> <b>choices</b> that we often think about become different once life itself enters into the picture. For Kierkegaard, the type of objectivity that a scientist or historian might use misses the point—humans are not motivated and do not find meaning in life through pure objectivity. Instead, they find it through passion, desire, and moral and religious commitment. These phenomena are not objectively provable—nor do they come about through any form of analysis of the external world; they come about through a direct relationship between one and the external world. Here Kierkegaard's emphasis is on relationship rather than analysis. This relationship {{is a way of}} looking at one’s life that evades objective scrutiny.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} music therapy techniques used with adolescents. The music therapy model is based on various theoretical backgrounds such as psychodynamic, behavioral, and humanistic approaches. Techniques can be classified as active vs. receptive and improvisational vs. structured. The most common techniques in use with adolescents are musical improvisation, the use of precomposed songs or music, receptive listening to music, verbal discussion about the music, and incorporating creative media outlets into the therapy. Research also showed that improvisation {{and the use of}} other media were the two techniques most often used by the music therapists. The overall research showed that adolescents in music therapy [...] "change more when discipline-specific music therapy techniques, such as improvisation and verbal reflection of the music, are used". The results of this study showed that music therapists should put careful thought into their choice of technique with each individual client. In the end, <b>those</b> <b>choices</b> can affect the outcome of the treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{argument}} for incompatibilism {{is that of}} the [...] "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in [...] "voluntary" [...] behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the [...] "ultimate" [...] or [...] "originating" [...] cause of his actions. He must be causa sui, in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of <b>those</b> <b>choices,</b> where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will. This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.|$|E

2500|$|Subjectivity is {{that which}} the individual—and no one else—has. But {{what does it mean}} to have {{something}} like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now <b>those</b> <b>choices</b> can be his, his parents', society’s, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: ...|$|E

The New York Times said season 2 [...] "erupted in fantastic and bizarre fits and starts" [...] because of the characters' unmatched personalities, and lauded the writers for not playing up the will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. By emphasing how the characters got together, the show [...] "made for hilarious setups [...] to high-level Abbott and Costello slapstick. They have a modern love. [...] Together, they are fully functional. They make each other human." [...] The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan was unconcerned about getting Jess and Nick together, as because of immaturity [...] "they're bound to keep on {{making a lot of}} amusing and painful mistakes, sometimes with each other. <b>Those</b> <b>choices</b> can be both hilarious and sad, and New Girl has gotten a lot of mileage out of both those areas." [...] The continued Nick–Jess relationship was criticized in season 3 for dropping the characters' personalities, lack of tension, and for neglecting the show's female friendship between Jess and Cece. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt that {{during the first half of}} season 3 that [...] "bringing them together caused that [...] spark [...] to diminish", while Hitfix Alan Sepinwall and The A.V.

The key elements of the model are related to the characteristics of the owner-managers, thereby exploring the decision units' evaluations of the hedging services provided by futures exchanges. Using structural equation models and data from 467 owner-managers, obtained by means of computer- assisted personal interviews, we find that the elements "exercising entrepreneurial freedom," "perceived performance," and the "owner-manager's reference price" determine their attitude toward using futures. These elements are related to innovativeness, risk attitude, and level of understanding of futures markets...|$|R

The use of implied choice and the escape clause to achieve these ends constitutes a legitimate practice that does not frustrate the aims of the EU choice of law regime...|$|R
