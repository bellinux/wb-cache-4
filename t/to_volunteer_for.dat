5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> {{essential}} war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange {{the comforts of home}} and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{to what extent}} religious context influences giving <b>to,</b> and <b>volunteering</b> <b>for,</b> religious causes—both directly and through increased attendance at religious services—and whether it has unintended spillover effects on giving and <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> secular purposes. Results from individuals living {{in a sample of}} counties in the United States indicate that a high level of religious pluralism is not associated with an increase in the probability that individuals will attend religious services regularly. Religious pluralism is, however, directly and positively associated with religious volunteering, while the association is not statistically significant for giving. Increases in religious volunteering associated {{with a high level of}} religious pluralism do not displace secular volunteering. There is no minority effect: individuals are equally likely to give <b>to,</b> and <b>volunteer</b> <b>for,</b> religious and secular causes whether they live in counties where their religious group represents the majority or the minority of the total population of religious adherents. As the proportion of the population in a county who is religious increases, so does the probability that any one individual will give <b>to,</b> and <b>volunteer</b> <b>for,</b> religious causes. I do not, however, find a relationship between the devoutness of a religious community and an individual’s propensity to give <b>to,</b> and <b>volunteer</b> <b>for,</b> secular causes...|$|R
5|$|During the All Black tour of Australia, in {{the game}} against Metropolitan Union in Sydney on 5 August 1914, the news was posted on the {{scoreboard}} that the British Empire – and therefore New Zealand and Australia – had declared war.

Three of them were killed, including Downing at Gallipoli, Bobby Black at the Somme and Jim McNeece at Messines.|$|E
5|$|In late 1913 Burgess {{was sent}} to Tasmania on {{exchange}} with the Australian Military Forces. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, he joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) rather than returning to New Zealand <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. He embarked for the Middle East with the 3rd Australian Field Artillery Brigade on 20 October 1914 aboard the P liner Geelong.|$|E

5|$|When war was {{declared}} in August 1914, the Liverpool Scottish mobilised {{and moved to}} Scotland {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-Colonel William Nicholl. Duplicate battalions were formed in Liverpool from personnel unable <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> overseas service. The second-line battalion, designated as the 2/10th to distinguish it from the original, was organised in October, the third-line in May 1915. They became responsible for the training of recruits and provision of drafts for overseas service. The 2/10th, raised and organised by Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Adam Fairrie, was committed to the Western Front in 1917. The third-line remained in Britain {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force on 26 May 1915, and was posted to the 4th Light Horse Brigade as a private. He {{departed}} for Egypt aboard the transport A29 Suevic on 13 June. Serving as a driver first in the Middle East {{and then on the}} Western Front, his mechanical ability and sense of adventure led him <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in December 1916. After qualifying as a pilot in England, he was commissioned a lieutenant and posted to No.2 Squadron. Commanded by Major Oswald Watt, No.2 Squadron's personnel included many former Lighthorsemen, as well as mechanics from the AFC's first combat formation, the Mesopotamian Half Flight. The force trained extensively in England commencing in January 1917, before deploying to the Western Front that September. Holden was involved in the AFC's first day of combat in France; just after noon on 2 October, in the vicinity of Saint-Quentin, he and his wingman engaged a German two-seater that managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Godley {{attended}} Staff College at Camberley but, {{following the}} outbreak of the Boer War in 1899, ended his studies early <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> service in Africa. Along with other officers of the Special Service Battalion, he helped to raise irregular mounted regiments. Godley was later adjutant to Colonel Robert Baden-Powell and was present during the Siege of Mafeking. He was also chief staff officer to Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Plumer and later commanded the Rhodesian Brigade. In 1900, Godley transferred to the Irish Guards before being appointed to the staff at Aldershot as commander of the Mounted Infantry. Three years later he transferred to Longmoor Military Camp, commanding the Mounted Infantry there until 1906.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, Hart's brother Walter {{travelled}} to South Africa {{for service}} with the Fourth Contingent in the Second Boer War. This inspired Hart <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the Eighth New Zealand South African Contingent, but his application was declined. However, he, {{along with another}} brother, George, successfully enlisted for the Ninth Contingent. The minimum age for volunteers was 20 and he falsified his age to enlist. By {{the time he reached}} South Africa in April 1902, the war was effectively over. He was discharged in July 1902 with the rank of lance sergeant but travelled to England instead of returning to New Zealand {{with the rest of the}} contingent.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Waldmann {{applied for}} a career as {{an officer in the}} Luftwaffe for the first time. Travelling to Berlin, he was deemed {{suitable}} but at the age of 16 was too young <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> military service. After the outbreak of World War II, while still at school, Waldmann and his fellow students were forced into compulsory labour service (Reichsarbeitsdienst). Waldmann was assigned to the Brunswick Mechanical Engineering Institute. Since Waldmann had intended to study aircraft construction after his military service, he was reassigned to the Institute of Aeronautical Metrology and Flight Meteorology at the Braunschweig-Waggum airfield under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Heinrich Koppe.|$|E
5|$|In Halifax he {{was sent}} to Wellington Barracks, the city's peacetime barracks, where he {{wrestled}} freight onto large army vehicles and dug ditches. Tired of the work, Babcock took the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the Royal Canadian Regiment when fifty recruits were called on, claiming that his age was 18. Officials quickly discovered that he was only 16, however, and they placed him in a reserve battalion known as the Boys (or Young Soldiers) Battalion in August 1917. Babcock then undertook an ocean voyage to England and, in Liverpool, he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to Bexhill-on-Sea where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of whom were veterans from battles in France.|$|E

50|$|Brain {{was educated}} at Mill Hill School and New College, Oxford, where {{he began to}} read history, but disliked it. The First World War having begun in 1914, the {{following}} year he joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> combat, and was sent to York, moving later to the King George Hospital in London, attached to the X-ray department. On the introduction of conscription in 1916 his work enabled him to be exempted as a conscientious objector.|$|R
5|$|Montgomery's troops liberated Tailly, {{allowing}} Leclerc {{to return}} home to see Thérèse and the children again on 6 September 1944. His oldest sons, Henri and Hubert, now 18 and 17 years old respectively, lied about their ages <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> service with 2e DB. Henri went on to serve with the RMT, while Hubert became a Sherman tank gunner with the 12e RCA. Other relatives also served with the division, including two nephews. The fighting in Paris cost 2e DB 97 killed and 238 wounded; nearly twice that number {{were lost in the}} fighting in surrounding areas. These were replaced by men and women who, like Leclerc's sons, offered themselves at a recruitment office the 2e DB established near the Bois de Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{initially}} {{began their}} wartime operations {{by focusing on}} the activities of immigrants and carrying out border security, but quickly widened their operations. Unlike during the Boer War, the mounted police at first were forbidden <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> military duty abroad, {{and the size of the}} force was instead temporarily increased to 1,200 men. The force investigated rumours of conspiracies associated with the Central Powers, but, since most mounted police did not have links within the relevant ethnic communities, they instead used secret agents and informants to gather intelligence, supported by a few undercover officers. Meanwhile, tensions grew between temperance campaigners and soldiers over the implementation of the liquor laws. The police barracks in Calgary were attacked in October 1916 by a crowd of over two hundred soldiers and civilians, who were trying to release six soldiers arrested for alcohol offences. The building was destroyed, one police officer was shot and several more injured.|$|E
5|$|When the United States entered World War II, the {{military}} {{was in need of}} nurses. Hispanic female nurses wanted <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> service, however they were not accepted into the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many women went to work in the factories which produced military equipment. As more Hispanic men joined the armed forces, a need for bilingual nurses became apparent and the Army started to recruit Hispanic nurses. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) decided to accept Puerto Rican nurses. Thirteen women submitted applications, were interviewed, underwent physical examinations, and were accepted into the ANC. Eight of these nurses were assigned to the Army Post at San Juan, Puerto Rico where they were valued for their bilingual abilities. Five nurses were assigned to work at the hospital at Camp Tortuguero in Puerto Rico. One of these nurses was Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler.|$|E

5|$|The mission, codenamed Operation Barras, was {{undertaken}} by D Squadron of 22 Special Air Service Regiment, who assaulted {{the village of}} Gberi Bana to extract the soldiers, while a company group formed around A Company, 1 PARA, assaulted Magbeni, {{on the opposite side}} of Rokel Creek. The operation was successful and all the British captives were extracted, along with their SLA liaison and 22 Sierra Leonean civilians, while the WSB were defeated as a military force. A British soldier and at least 25 West Side Boys were killed in the operation. Many other West Side Boys fled and later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371—including 57 children—had surrendered within a fortnight. Some of those who surrendered went on <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the new Sierra Leone Army, and those who were accepted went into the British-run training programme at Benguema. Following Operation Barras, two SLA battalions—graduates of the British short-term training programme—swept the area surrounding the West Side Boys' camp to clear it of any remaining gang members.|$|E
5|$|While the cutters {{were being}} shipped to Subic Bay, crew members started {{reporting}} to Coast Guard Training Center Alameda, California on 17 May 1965 for overseas processing and training. The cutter crews received one week of small arms training at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado and Camp Pendleton while Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) training was received at Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center, near Coleville, California, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Washington. Returning to Alameda, they underwent refresher firefighting and damage control training from the Navy at Treasure Island Naval Base. Additional weapons qualifications and live fire exercises {{were held at}} Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, along with refresher training in radar navigation, radio procedures and visual signaling. Gun crews received mortar and machine gun training at Camp Pendleton. Of the 245 personnel assigned to the unit only 131 were present at the squadron commissioning ceremony held at Alameda on 27 May with {{the remainder of the}} crews in the process of completing training elsewhere. For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the normal crew complement of eight to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea. All officers assigned to command cutters were required to be lieutenants and to have previously commanded a Cape-class cutter and had <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the assignment. The executive officer was either a lieutenant junior grade or ensign.|$|E
