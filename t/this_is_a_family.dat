500|$|Allen's {{show with}} Presley had, {{for the first}} time, beaten CBS's Ed Sullivan Show in the ratings. Sullivan, despite his June pronouncement, booked the singer for three {{appearances}} for an unprecedented $50,000. The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television audience. Actor Charles Laughton hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan recuperated from a car accident. Presley appeared in two segments that night from CBS Television City in Los Angeles, during which he was shot from only the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows with his producer, Sullivan said that Presley [...] "got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants–so when he moves his legs back and forth {{you can see the}} outline of his cock.... I think it's a Coke bottle.... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> show!" [...] Sullivan publicly told TV Guide, [...] "As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots." [...] In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe in the first and second shows. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted in customary style: screaming. Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad [...] "Love Me Tender", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders. More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show that made Presley a national celebrity.|$|E

With a lighter line-up, the band then took some time off from touring and recorded an EP featuring symphonic renditions of some of their songs. The EP was titled Symphonies, and was released on May 3, 2011. Barnes performs both the clean and unclean vocals on the release. [...] Before its surfacing, the band once more changed its line-up.

However Naxos had a resolution problem that limited its ability to distinguish individual aircraft. This allowed the night fighter to locate the bomber stream but not usually individual bombers. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> not usually <b>an</b> issue with the maritime based system (primarily U boats) as there was usually only one aircraft detected at a time.

60|$|But {{indifference}} {{will not}} guide nations through civilization {{to the establishment}} of the perfect city of God. An indifferent statesman is a contradiction in terms; and a statesman who is indifferent on principle, a Laisser-faire or Muddle-Through doctrinaire, plays the deuce with us in the long run. Our statesmen must get a religion by hook or crook; and as we are committed to Adult Suffrage it must be a religion capable of vulgarization. The thought first put into words by the Mills when they said 'There is no God; but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> secret,' and long held unspoken by aristocratic statesmen and diplomatists, will not serve now; for the revival of civilization after the war cannot be effected by artificial breathing: the driving force of an undeluded popular consent is indispensable, and will be impossible until the statesman can appeal to the vital instincts of the people in terms of a common religion. The success of the Hang the Kaiser cry at the last General Election shews us very terrifyingly how a common irreligion can be used by myopic demagogy; and common irreligion will destroy civilization unless it is countered by common religion.|$|E
