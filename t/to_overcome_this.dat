5|$|In {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> compartmentalization, Andrews {{bypassed}} {{the chain of}} command on 8 January 1938, in a memorandum of his own regarding a minor joint air exercise held in November 1937 off the Virginia Capes. There four B-17s had found and successfully bombed Navy target vessels. Andrews sent a memo directly to Roosevelt's military aide, Col. Edwin M. Watson, that included confidential Navy memoranda confirming the accuracy of the Army's bombing.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{from the}} second act, players can journey between field screen {{locations}} via the world map, a downsized representation of Final Fantasy VIIs world. Players can freely navigate the world map screen unless restricted by geographical obstacles, such as water or mountains. <b>To</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this,</b> players can ride emu-like chocobos and various vehicles available to them, though usage is limited. As in other Final Fantasy-related games, travel across the world map screen and hostile areas is frequently interrupted by random enemy encounters.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} {{was often}} the weakest part in a circuit of defences. <b>To</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this,</b> the gatehouse was developed, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot and <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this,</b> projecting towers were added {{on each side of}} the gate in a style similar to that developed by the Romans. The gatehouse contained a series of defences to make a direct assault more difficult than battering down a simple gate. Typically, there were one or more portcullises– a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage– and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry the enemy. The passage through the gatehouse was lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant had to spend under fire in a confined space and unable to retaliate.|$|E

50|$|The {{main goal}} of the new AML was to {{encourage}} experimenters and inventors to manufacture horseless carriages. They had two obstacles <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>to</b> accomplish <b>this.</b>|$|R
5|$|While Old Coast Road's dual {{carriageway}} was advancing north from Bunbury, and Kwinana Freeway was progressively being extended south from Perth, the alignment through Mandurah was constrained by existing development. Keeping the existing alignment {{would result in}} a traffic bottleneck through Mandurah. <b>To</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> problem, Main Roads began planning for a new route east of the Peel Inlet in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Although such megastructures may be {{theoretically}} possible, all {{plans to}} build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. However, parts of the technology, like orbiting satellites and solar sails, have already been developed. Deployment of spacecraft and satellites using photovoltaics might be seen as the first small steps towards building a Dyson swarm. However, the number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. George Dvorsky has advocated use of self-replicating robots <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> limitation in the relatively near term. Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around white dwarfs and even pulsars.|$|E
5|$|In the Sikh {{religious}} text the Guru Granth Sahib, religious {{language is}} used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that the experiences they have while meditating are ineffable, incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous– {{this means that}} there is no object of their experience that can be conceptualised. <b>To</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this,</b> the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.|$|E

5|$|The online mode of the game, {{which is}} only {{available}} in the Japanese version, also introduces {{a group called the}} Restrictors, the former leaders of Deepground before Weiss took over. The Restrictors' leader had implanted microchips into the brainstems of all Deepground soldiers so as to ensure they never turn against the group. However, Weiss was able <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> control method, and the Tsviets wrenched control from the Restrictors. Although Weiss was successful in overthrowing the Restrictors, however, the leader of the Restrictors was able to implant a virus into Weiss' bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E
5|$|This highway {{served the}} low traffic {{volumes of the}} day, but {{as the number of}} {{vehicles}} increased over {{the first half of the}} 20thcentury, issues arose with the numerous private driveways along the route. <b>To</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> issue of abutting properties long-established on the old Highway16 corridor, the DHO began purchasing a new right-of-way between Highway401 and Century Road by late 1967 for a two-lane bypass of the original alignment, avoiding all the built-up areas that the original Highway16 encountered. This route was designed to easily accommodate the eventual upgrade to a freeway when traffic volumes necessitated.|$|E

5|$|Vampyr was {{challenging}} for Dreyer {{to make as}} {{it was his first}} sound film and had to be recorded in three languages. <b>To</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this,</b> very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with silent film-styled title cards. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The audio editing was done in Berlin where the character's voices, sound effects, and score were added to the film.|$|E
5|$|Most fungi lack an {{efficient}} {{system for the}} long-distance transport of water and nutrients, such as the xylem and phloem in many plants. <b>To</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> limitation, some fungi, such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar {{to the roots of}} plants. As eukaryotes, fungi possess a biosynthetic pathway for producing terpenes that uses mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have an additional terpene biosynthesis pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure fungi and animals do not have. Fungi produce several secondary metabolites that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants. Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other in sequence and other characteristics, which indicates separate origins and convergent evolution of these enzymes in the fungi and plants.|$|E
5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force (AEAF) {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible. Members of Combined Operations Pilotage Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings. At Gold, frogmen discovered the shore between Asnelles and La Rivière was soft and could not support the weight of tanks. Twelve Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVREs) were fitted with bobbins <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface. The material would then be left in place to create a route for more conventional tanks.|$|E
