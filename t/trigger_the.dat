5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> maturation of the reproductive organs {{and the production}} of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the same size and thus age.|$|E

50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> {{is created}} {{on a table}} or view, then <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> event is {{composed}} of DML statements, and <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> is called a DML <b>trigger.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> is created on a schema or the database, then <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> event is composed of either DDL or database operation statements, and <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> is called a system trigger.|$|R

5|$|Significant Minoan remains {{have been}} found above the Late Minoan I era Thera ash layer and tsunami level, and {{it is unclear whether}} the effects were enough to <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> {{downfall}} of the Minoan civilization. Some sites were abandoned or settlement systems significantly interrupted {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the eruption. As the Minoans were a sea power and depended on ships for their livelihood, the Thera eruption likely caused significant economic hardship to the Minoans. Whether the effects were enough to <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> downfall of the civilization is intensely debated. The Mycenaean conquest of the Minoans occurred in Late Minoan II period. The Mycenaeans were a military civilization. Using their functional navy and a well-equipped army, they were capable of an invasion. Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete. That demonstrates Mycenaean military influence not many years after the eruption. Many archaeologists speculate that the eruption caused a crisis in Minoan civilization, making them vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans.|$|E
5|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that many factors helped <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> Cambrian explosion, {{but there is}} no generally accepted consensus about the combination and the Cambrian explosion continues to be an area of controversy and research over why so rapid, why at the phylum level, why so many phyla then and none since, and even if the apparent fossil record is accurate.|$|E
5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E

50|$|A {{contingent}} {{convertible bond}} is defined with two elements: <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> and <b>the</b> conversion rate. While <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> is <b>the</b> pre-specified event causing the conversion process, the conversion rate {{is the actual}} rate at which debt is swapped for equity. <b>The</b> <b>trigger,</b> which can be bank specific, systemic, or dual, has to be defined in a way ensuring automatic and inviolable conversion. A possibility of a dynamic sequence exists—conversion occurs at different pre-specified thresholds of <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> event. Since <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> can be subject to accounting or market manipulation, a commonly used measure has been the market’s measure of bank’s solvency. The design of <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> and <b>the</b> conversion rate are critical in the instrument’s effectiveness.|$|R

5|$|A weather {{phenomenon}} known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all {{times of the year}} and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity {{to the north of the}} Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> best effect.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, astronomers using {{computer}} simulations speculated {{that even if}} Betelgeuse is not rotating it might exhibit large-scale magnetic activity in its extended atmosphere, a factor where even moderately strong fields could have a meaningful influence over the star's dust, wind and mass-loss properties. A series of spectropolarimetric observations obtained in 2010 with the Bernard Lyot Telescope at Pic du Midi Observatory revealed {{the presence of a}} weak magnetic field at the surface of Betelgeuse, suggesting that the giant convective motions of supergiant stars are able to <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> onset of a small-scale dynamo effect.|$|E

5000|$|Bump firing is the act {{of using}} the recoil of a {{semi-automatic}} firearm to fire shots in rapid succession, which simulates {{the feeling of a}} fully automatic firearm. This process involves bracing the rifle with the non-trigger hand, releasing the grip on the firing hand (leaving <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> finger in its normal position in front of <b>the</b> <b>trigger),</b> pushing <b>the</b> rifle forward in order to apply pressure on <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> from <b>the</b> finger, and keeping <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> finger stationary. During a shot, the firearm will recoil ("bump" [...] back) and <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> will reset as it normally does; then the non-trigger hand pulls the firearm away from the body and back to the original position, pressing <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> against <b>the</b> stationary finger again, thereby firing another round when <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> is pushed back.|$|R

When Squall and his team travel to Galbadia Garden after fleeing Timber, Martine orders them to carry out the mission. He hopes that using Balamb Garden's SeeDs would deflect responsibility for the plot onto NORG. His actions <b>trigger</b> <b>the</b> conflict within Balamb Garden when Garden Master NORG tries to kill Headmaster Cid to appease Sorceress Edea after the mission fails.
