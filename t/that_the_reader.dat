5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, {{he did not}} believe that performance was vital to the plays, nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E

25|$|To be proved, a theorem must be expressible as a precise, formal statement.

25|$|In {{the text}} of the Torah, many words are left {{undefined}} and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions. Such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition, illustrating the assumption <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is already familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral, sources.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{illustration}} of architecture throughout the scroll is very realistic, {{the images of}} the faces are very unrealistic. This is said to be because the dominant figures in the novel The Tale of Genji were not a part of everyday life and were unfamiliar to <b>the</b> <b>readers.</b> They were instead figures of one’s imagination from the past or a make believe world. It was intended for <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> to portray their own image of the figures while reading the novel. If the artists had created realistic portraits of the figures it would have interfered with <b>the</b> images <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> had. Therefore, <b>the</b> artist chose to use the unrealistic technique of hikime kagibana so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> individual image of the figures could be preserved.|$|R
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of poems into couplets encouraged {{the use of}} parallelism: where for two lines of a poem it would be expected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> would compare and contrast the meaning of two lines, which would be specifically marked by the poet by using the same parts of speech in each position, or in certain key positions in each line, or else within one line.|$|E

25|$|While the {{decisions}} of the earlier epochs had been so lucid <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> could easily follow them, the responsa of this period had changed completely, for the pilpulistic methods, which had been in vogue since the middle of the fifteenth century {{in the study of the}} Talmud. The halakic works forced their way into responsa literature as well. The responsa are remarkable for the hair-splitting dialectics that characterizes them, and often robs them of lucidity.|$|E

When Charlie eventually throws Peter out and marries a woman to protect his reputation, every reader, straight or gay, can detest his duplicity and weakness, but must also empathize with the situation that Charlie has had forced upon him by an intolerant society.|$|E

25|$|Heisenberg’s paper {{establishing}} {{quantum mechanics}} has puzzled physicists and historians. His methods assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> {{is familiar with}} Kramers-Heisenberg transition probability calculations. The main new idea, noncommuting matrices, is justified only by a rejection of unobservable quantities. It introduces the non-commutative multiplication of matrices by physical reasoning, based on the correspondence principle, {{despite the fact that}} Heisenberg was not then familiar with the mathematical theory of matrices. The path leading to these results has been reconstructed in MacKinnon, 1977, and the detailed calculations are worked out in Aitchison et al.|$|E

25|$|Many {{events in}} the book are {{repeatedly}} described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about each event from each iteration, with the new information often completing a joke, the setup of which was told several chapters previously. The narrative's events are out of sequence, but events {{are referred to as}} if the reader is already familiar with them so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> must ultimately piece together a timeline of events. Specific words, phrases, and questions are also repeated frequently, generally to comic effect.|$|E

In each Gospel these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative.
