Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs {{to be taken into account}} by adding 20% <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> reserve, but it does not make the grid unmanageable. The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.|$|E

For Windows RT devices, the update also adds Outlook to the included Office RT suite. The update was temporarily recalled by Microsoft shortly after its release, following reports that some Surface users had encountered a rare bug which corrupted their device's Boot Configuration Data during installation, resulting in an error on startup. On October 21, 2013, Microsoft released recovery media and instructions {{which could be used}} to repair the device, and restored access to Windows 8.1 the next day.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, {{building}} costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million. The municipalities had co-signed {{for a foreign}} loan, and were forced to pay NOK 3.5 million annually just in interest, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> cost of the airport; these were aggravated by not only {{the loss of the}} sole scheduled service, but also considerably less charter traffic than estimated. In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county. However, by 1991, passenger numbers were above 20,000, three quarters coming from charter traffic. On 1January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put {{under the control of the}} Norwegian Airport Authority (now Avinor). Following the closure of Geilo Airport, Dagali in 2003, Fagernes experienced an increase in charter traffic.|$|E

25|$|The {{continuation}} of the Pacific Patrol Boat Program through a second generation of ships has been considered likely throughout the years, due to the benefits and capabilities provided <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> nations, along with the work provided to the Australian shipbuilding industry. During the early 2000s, variants of the RAN's Armidale class or the RNZN's Protector class were considered appropriate, although there were concerns that such complex vessels would be too challenging and financially restrictive to maintain {{by some of the}} smaller participating nations. A 2008 report also suggested discontinuing the program, due to rising operational costs being imposed on Australia (over double the expected annual cost of A$12 million two years in a row), poor operating rates (averaging 36 days at sea per ship per year) linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> nations' difficulties in crewing and maintaining the ships, and a lack of support from the other nations with interests in the Pacific.|$|E
25|$|In April 2013, Porter {{announced}} expansion {{plans to}} serve new destinations in Western Canada, California and Florida. To support the expansion, Porter reached a provisional agreement to purchase 12 107-seat Bombardier CS100 jets, with a future {{option to purchase}} up to 18 more. Porter's plans required regulatory and facility changes to its Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport hub. Porter asked for modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> agreement of the airport to allow jets and extensions to the runway to support the new aircraft. Changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> agreement require the unanimous agreement of the Toronto Port Authority (TPA), the City of Toronto and the Government of Canada. The TPA stated {{that it had no}} position on the expansion and would await a decision from Toronto City Council.
