He writes that he listened to The John and Ken Show on KFI, and that their discussion of Scientology allowed him <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> critically during his time at the compound. He says that viewing Conan O'Brien make fun of Scientology celebrities changed his views on individuals that the organization had only spoken of internally with reverence.|$|E

Examples of new and emerging practice areas would include therapists working with refugees, children experiencing obesity, and people experiencing homelessness.|$|E

25|$|There {{is not so}} much {{a protest}} song trend in France, but rather of a {{permanent}} background of criticism and contestation, and individuals who personify it. World War II and its horrors forced French singers <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> critically about war in general, forcing them to question their governments and the powers who ruled their society.|$|E
25|$|Brad Miles: Molly's 14-year-old brother. Brad {{is crazy}} about {{baseball}} {{and hopes to}} play as a career one day. He enjoys taunting Molly about her resemblance to Zoey, continually pointing out that they both have red hair. However, {{there are signs that}} he's starting <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> maturely after having a meaningful talk with his sister about how he felt when she was a baby, but he has much more to learn.|$|E
25|$|Still more pacifists {{would argue}} that a nonviolent {{reaction}} may not save lives immediately but would in the long run. The acceptance of violence for any reason {{makes it easier to}} use in other situations. Learning and committing to pacifism helps to send a message that violence is, in fact, not the most effective way. It can also help people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.|$|E

25|$|In 1925, then 37-year-old Belaney met 19-year-old Gertrude Bernard (aka Anahareo, or Pony), a Mohawk Iroquois {{woman who}} was to be very {{influential}} in his life. She encouraged him to stop trapping and to publish his writing about the wilderness. They had a passionate eight-year affair, beginning with their Anishinaabe wedding ceremony. Through her influence, he began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> deeply about conservation. Anahareo encouraged his writing and influenced him by saving and raising a pair of beaver kits.|$|E
25|$|According to Mary Guy, Public {{administration}} does not only {{focus on the}} business side of administration but also on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> practically and with more reason.|$|E
25|$|Heffer worked {{together}} with Benn {{to try to}} establish the National Enterprise Board, which would provide industry with investment funding and {{have the ability to}} take failing firms into public ownership. On 15 August 1974 the plans were unveiled in a White paper and preparations began for the Industry Bill which would enact it. While this policy had been agreed by Wilson in opposition and then appeared in the Labour manifesto, in government he began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> critically. Drafting of the Bill was delayed over the winter and it was not introduced until January 1975.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have found}} that females tend <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> about their body shape and endorse thinner figures than men even into old age. When female {{undergraduates}} were exposed to depictions of thin women their body satisfaction decreased, but rose when exposed to larger models. In addition, many women engage in fat talk (speaking negatively about the weight-related size/shape of one's body), a behavior that {{has been associated with}} weight dissatisfaction, body surveillance, and body shame. In addition, women who overhear others using fat talk may also experience an increase in body dissatisfaction and guilt. As a result, women may experience concerns related to body image {{in a number of different}} ways and from a variety of sources.|$|E
25|$|In 1894â€“95 Gilman {{served as}} editor of the {{magazine}} The Impress, a literary weekly that was published by the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association (formerly the Bulletin). For the twenty weeks the magazine was printed, she was consumed in the satisfying accomplishment of contributing its poems, editorials, and other articles. The short-lived paper's printing came to an end {{as a result of a}} social bias against her lifestyle which included being an unconventional mother and a woman who had divorced a man. After a four-month-long lecture tour that ended in April 1897, Gilman began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> deeply about sexual relationships and economics in American life, eventually completing the first draft of Women and Economics (1898). This book discussed the role of women in the home, arguing for changes in the practices of child-raising and housekeeping to alleviate pressures from women and potentially allow them to expand their work to the public sphere. The book was published in the following year, and propelled Gilman into the international spotlight. In 1903, she addressed the International Congress of Women in Berlin, and, the next year, toured in England, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.|$|E
25|$|Many artists {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s {{opposed the war}} and used their {{creativity}} and careers to visibly oppose the war. Writers and poets opposed to involvement in the war included Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Robert Duncan, and Robert Bly. Their pieces often incorporated imagery based on the tragic events of the war {{as well as the}} disparity between life in Vietnam and life in the United States. Visual artists Ronald Haeberle, Peter Saul, and Nancy Spero, among others, used war equipment, like guns and helicopters, in their works while incorporating important political and war figures, portraying to the nation exactly who was responsible for the violence. Filmmakers such as Lenny Lipton, Jerry Abrams, Peter Gessner, and David Ringo created documentary-style movies featuring actual footage from the antiwar marches to raise awareness about the war and the diverse opposition movement. Playwrights like Frank O'Hara, Sam Shepard, Robert Lowell, Megan Terry, Grant Duay, and Kenneth Bernard used theater as a vehicle for portraying their thoughts about the Vietnam War, often satirizing the role of America in the world and juxtaposing the horrific effects of war with normal scenes of life. Regardless of medium, antiwar artists ranged from pacifists to violent radicals and caused Americans <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> critically about the war. Art as war opposition was quite popular {{in the early years of}} the war, but soon faded as political activism became the more common and most visible way of opposing the war.|$|E

500|$|Side two {{contains}} a 16-minute medley of eight short songs, recorded over July and August and blended into a suite by McCartney and Martin. Some songs were written (and originally recorded in demo form) during sessions for the White Album and Get Back/ Let It Be, which later appeared on Anthology 3. While {{the idea for}} the medley was McCartney's, Martin claims credit for some structure, adding he [...] "wanted to get John and Paul <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> seriously about their music".|$|E
500|$|Booth {{embarked}} {{on his first}} national tour as a leading actor after finishing the 1859â€“1860 theatre season in Richmond, Virginia. He engaged Philadelphia attorney Matthew Canning to serve as his agent. By mid-1860, he was playing in such cities as New York, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, Columbus, Georgia, Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans. Poet and journalist Walt Whitman said of Booth's acting, [...] "He would have flashes, passages, I thought of real genius." [...] The Philadelphia Press drama critic said, [...] "Without having [...] Edwin's culture and grace, Mr. Booth has far more action, more life, and, we are inclined <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> <b>more</b> natural genius." ...|$|E
500|$|Meyer, a Mormon, {{acknowledges}} that her faith has influenced her work. In particular, {{she says that}} her characters [...] "tend <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> about where they came from, {{and where they are}} going, than might be typical." [...] Meyer also steers her work from subjects such as sex, despite the romantic nature of the novels. Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be Mormon-influenced, or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, [...] "I don't think my books are going to be really graphic or dark, because of who I am. There's {{always going to be a}} lot of light in my stories." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco {{participated in}} a panel {{discussion}} with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in Architecture Boston. She remarked that teachers bring high school art students to MOBA, then to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Sacco observes, [...] "Somehow MOBA frees kids to laugh and point, {{to have their own}} opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly... frees us." [...] Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and it forces people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> deeply about what is wrong or misplaced. She connects this rigid judgment of what does not conform to beauty with intolerance for physical imperfections in people, noting that such rigidity sometimes causes parents to [...] "fix" [...] the perceived flaws in their children's faces to keep them from suffering later.|$|E
500|$|Whitney had {{no further}} {{involvement}} with Star Trek until 1976, when {{she happened to}} meet DeForest Kelley at an unemployment office in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. He informed her about a Star Trek convention coming up that was organised by Bjo and John Trimble called Equicon. She received such a reception upon making an appearance there that she was inspired <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> about the series and wanted to appear at more events. In 1977, after reading the back cover of the book Letters to Star Trek by Susan Sackett and finding that [...] "Whatever happened to Grace Lee Whitney?" [...] {{was one of the}} ten most frequently asked queries, Whitney got in touch with Sackett and was invited to meet at Roddenberry's office at Paramount. When he entered, he was happy and excited to see her and immediately offered to bring back Rand for the new television series [...] Roddenberry told her that removing Rand was the biggest mistake he'd made, saying that the character should have stayed so that [...] "when Captain Kirk came back from having affairs with all these other women on all these other planets â€“ he'd have to deal with [...] What a great plot-thickener that would have been!" [...] Instead, he blamed the decision on executives at NBC, but apologized for it to Whitney.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naÃ¯ve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end is a little bit of growing up, starting <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>more</b> seriously about your life and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, Iâ€™d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E
