500|$|Burnham, Ingram and Gooding {{reached the}} Shangani about 08:00, but quickly {{saw that the}} water had risen far too high for Forbes to provide any assistance. Realising the {{futility}} of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty. They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on. On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> {{say that we are}} the sole survivors of that party," [...] he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, {{the patrol}} found {{the king and}} Wilson sent a message back to the laager {{requesting}} reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, {{under the command of}} Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson's patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning; however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson's patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other men, Pearl [...] "Pete" [...] Ingram (a Montana cowboy) and William Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> say that we are the sole survivors of that party." [...] Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed.|$|E
500|$|Of Locke's major {{claims in}} the Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Some Thoughts Concerning Education, two played a {{defining}} role in eighteenth-century educational theory. The first is that education makes the man; as Locke writes {{at the opening of}} his treatise, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education." [...] In making this claim, Locke was arguing against both the Augustinian view of man, which grounds its conception of humanity in original sin, and the Cartesian position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions. In his Essay Locke posits an [...] "empty" [...] mind—a tabula rasa—that is [...] "filled" [...] by experience. In describing the mind in these terms, Locke was drawing on Plato's Theatetus, which suggests that the mind is like a [...] "wax tablet". Although Locke argued strenuously for the tabula rasa theory of mind, he nevertheless did believe in innate talents and interests. For example, he advises parents to watch their children carefully to discover their [...] "aptitudes," [...] and to nurture their children's own interests rather than force them to participate in activities which they dislike—"he, therefore, that is about children should well study their natures and aptitudes and see, by often trials, what turn they easily take and what becomes them, observe what their native stock is, how it may be improved, and what it is fit for." ...|$|E

2500|$|After his surrender, Pemberton was {{exchanged}} as {{a prisoner}} on October 13, 1863, and he returned to Richmond. There he spent some eight months without an assignment. At first Gen. Braxton Bragg thought he could use Pemberton, but after conferring with his own ranking officers he advised Davis that taking on the discredited lieutenant general [...] "would not be advisable." [...] Pemberton finally wrote Davis directly, asking he be returned to duty [...] "in any capacity in which you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> be useful."

2500|$|Australian Major General Jim Molan (retired), {{who served}} as chief of {{operations}} of the Iraq multinational force in 2004–05, stated that [...] "The Goldstone report is an opinion by one group of people putting forward their judgments, with limited access to the facts, and reflecting their own prejudices. The difference in tone and attitude in the report when discussing Israeli and Hamas actions is surprising." ... "as a soldier who has run a war against an opponent not dissimilar to Hamas, facing problems perhaps similar to those faced by Israeli commanders, my sympathies tend to lie with the Israelis." ... "But having stated my prejudice, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> be more honest than Goldstone, who seems to pass off his prejudices in a report that cannot be based on fact, and uses judicial language and credibility to do so. It comes down to equality of scepticism: if you refuse to believe anything the Israelis say, then {{you have no right}} to unquestioningly accept what Hamas says." ...|$|E

2500|$|Finberg says [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> {{take this}} {{opportunity}} to protest once again against the prevalent habit of calling this artist Janssens. In spite of Walpole's unfortunate remark that this is the correct form of the name, there is no excuse for using it. While in England the artist invariably spelt his name Cornelius Johnson, and when he left England he changed the form to Jonson. The usual form of his signature when the name is given in full is invariably, in all the pictures painted after 1643 which I have seen : ' Cornelius Jonson van Ceulen.' He appears never to have adopted the form of Janson, Jansen, or Janssens. But so long as auctioneers are born with an ingrained conviction that a foreign-looking name gives greater value to a picture than an English name, so long may we expect to find Cornelius Johnson or Jonson masquerading in catalogues as Cornelius Janssens." ...|$|E
