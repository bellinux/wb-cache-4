Ice caverns producer Jaffe had scouted partially melted before filming; with only two-and-a-third days of time to film, the crew had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> they could.

At 03:00 Ambassador Martin ordered Major Kean to move all the remaining evacuees {{into the parking lot}} LZ which was the Marines' final perimeter. At 03:27 President Gerald Ford ordered that no more than 19 additional lifts would be allowed to complete the evacuation. At 04:30 with the 19 lift limit already exceeded, Major Kean went to the rooftop LZ and spoke over a helicopter radio with General Carey who advised that President Ford had ordered that the airlift be limited to US personnel. Major Kean was then ordered to withdraw his men into the Chancery building and withdraw to the rooftop LZ for evacuation.|$|E

40|$|CHDS State/LocalThis {{research}} compares {{federal and}} state approaches to managing disaster medical surge. The comparison identifies the varieties of regulations, assets and response methods available for {{federal and state}} responses to mass casualty incidents from which local communities can develop plans and acquire resources to create a seamless disaster medical care system. Following a disaster, survivors self-evacuate or are transported by EMS to a nearby hospital. Arrival of disaster survivors, combined with an often high daily number of non-disaster patients leaves the facility overwhelmed {{both in terms of}} medical resources and personnel. The lack of local resources to manage the incident may require state and federal assets to be deployed. The time it takes for the additional resources to arrive from outside the area leaves the facility unable to respond effectively for hours and even days. A whole community approach to medical surge management organized by a collaborative regional healthcare coalition may provide a solution. Such a coalition can engage stakeholders to assess and manage resources (space, staff, and stuff) and develop surge response plans that will integrate with state and federal resources when needed.
