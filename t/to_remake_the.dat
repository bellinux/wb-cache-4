5|$|Sivaji Ganesan wanted A. V. Meiyappan {{to produce}} his 125thfilm, which {{eventually}} became Uyarndha Manithan. Meiyappan then asked the director duo Krishnan–Panju {{to search for}} a good script. One of Meiyappan's friends, V. A. P. Iyer, suggested Meiyappan <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> Bengali film Uttar Purush (1966). After watching the film, Meiyappan was impressed with it and made a decision with Krishnan-Panju and Javar Seetharaman <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> film with a few alterations.|$|E
5|$|Farhan Akhtar {{conceived}} the idea <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> iconic 1978 {{film of the}} same name after listening to a remixed version of a song from the original film. In early 2005, media started reporting that Akhtar was planning <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> film, but rather than confirming the news, he revealed that though he was writing the screenplay based on the film, he would take the final decision after completing the script. The director co-wrote the film with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original film with Salim Khan.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the Indian media {{reported}} that Mahesh Bhatt and Bhushan Kumar were keen <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> 1990 musical blockbuster Aashiqui. Kumar approached Bhatt {{for a possible}} sequel, although it was Shagufta Rafique's melodramatic romantic script which persuaded him that the film had potential as a sequel and decided {{to proceed with the}} project. Given Aashiqui 's status in Hindi cinematic history as one of the finest Indian musicals of all time, many expressed concerns towards the decision <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> film, dubious that the producers could come up with a soundtrack on par with the quality of the 1990 film. Bhatt stated that they completely resisted the temptation to use the soundtrack of the earlier film, and promised that Aashiqui 2 would revive the era of melodious film music, as Aashiqui had done 22 years ago.|$|E

5|$|Plans <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} game in high-definition {{first began}} to form when Ed Fear, a writer and creative producer at game developer Mediatonic, contacted Hato Moa {{about the possibility of}} translating any projects she was involved in to English. According to the remake's creative director Jeff Tanton, the decision was made <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> game following several e-mail conversations between Fear and Hato, with Fear's positive experience with the Japanese version of the game and the incompatibility of FamousWriter-made games with newer operating systems—which had rendered the original game effectively unplayable on newer PCs—being major factors in the decision. An international remake of Hatoful developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital made using the Unity game engine—allowing the game to be fully compatible with computers that run Windows Vista, Windows 7 or OS X 10.6, and playable {{for the first time on}} those that run Linux or OS X 10.7 or newer—was first revealed to be in development on 6 June 2014, with a formal announcement coming shortly afterwards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014.|$|E
5|$|After its rediscovery, {{observers}} often {{assumed that}} the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder. Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 20th century, the {{building}} underwent three major renovations. In the first, from 1905 to 1907, Frank Lloyd Wright was retained <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> interior spaces. In keeping with contemporary tastes, Wright's design covered Root's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved Carrara marble surfaces. Wright was highly regarded by the public at this point, and his changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery {{one of the most}} sought after buildings of Chicago. Some of Wright's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding his trademark style planters and light fixtures.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in 2003 with the {{original}} intention of releasing the game for the PlayStation 2. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio to develop a launch title for the PlayStation Portable. Due to time constraints, the Cambridge studio was given only a year to develop the game, thus they decided <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> original MediEvil. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release, with critics mainly praising the game's humor, voice talent and graphics but was criticized for lack of innovation and cumbersome camera controls.|$|E
5|$|Nocturne {{follows the}} Protagonist, {{a high school}} student in modern-day Tokyo, as he is {{transformed}} into a half-demon after the world undergoes Conception, an apocalyptic event triggered by a sinister cult to trigger the world's rebirth in a new form. With Tokyo transformed into a Vortex World filled with demons, the Protagonist becomes instrumental to the schemes of the Reasons, beings who seek <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> world in their image, and Lucifer, the lord of demons. The gameplay uses a turn-based battle system based on exploiting weaknesses, and a Demon recruitment system allowing the player to recruit demons found in the Vortex World to fight alongside them.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} released in Japan on April 27, 1990. It {{had not been}} released outside Japan until a remake was developed by Matrix Software for the Nintendo DS on August 24, 2006. At that time, {{it was the only}} Final Fantasy game not previously released in North America or Europe. There had been earlier plans <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> game for Bandai's WonderSwan Color handheld, as had been done with the first, second, and fourth installments of the series, but the game faced several delays and was eventually canceled after the premature cancellation of the platform. The Nintendo DS version of the game was positively received, selling over one million copies in Japan.|$|E

5|$|B. Nagi Reddy of Vijaya Vauhini Studios helped B. Vittalacharya in the {{production}} of Mane Thumbida Hennu (1958), the latter's directorial debut in Kannada cinema. As an act of gratitude, Vittalacharya sold the remake rights to Nagi Reddy. Mane Thumbida Hennu revolves around the life of a rich woman whose brother marries off her daughter to a criminal when she chooses a mentally challenged person as her step-daughter's life partner. Nagi Reddy chose <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> film in Telugu and discussed it with D. V. Narasa Raju; {{it was the first time}} Vijaya Vauhini Studios decided to remake a film. After the script was ready, Nagi Reddy approached C. Pullaiah to direct the remake after considering Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy. Pullaiah was not appreciative of Narasa Raju's treatment of the script and Nagi Reddy met his partner Aluri Chakrapani to develop the script further.|$|E
5|$|Castlevania was rebooted {{due to the}} team's {{concern over}} the poor sales in their latest Castlevania games. The team wished to expand the franchise's fanbase with this game. A number of prototypes in {{parallel}} development competed {{to become the next}} Castlevania title. Konami told MercurySteam the game would be an original intellectual property (IP) when it was first greenlit as a Castlevania title. Konami eventually asked them to cease work on Lords of Shadow while it was still in its early stages, until David Cox showed the Japanese senior management the game and was offered help by video game designer Hideo Kojima. Konami then chose the pitch for it as the next Castlevania entry. The original concept for the game was <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> first Castlevania starring Simon Belmont, but it was later decided to make a reboot of the franchise. Lords of Shadow still drew inspiration from earlier titles in the series, most notably Castlevania for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Castlevania IV.|$|E
5|$|David Mirkin (born September 18, 1955) is an American {{feature film}} and {{television}} director, writer and producer. Mirkin grew up in Philadelphia and intended to become an electrical engineer, but abandoned this career path in favor of studying film at Loyola Marymount University. After graduating, he became a stand-up comedian, and then moved into television writing. He wrote for the sitcoms Three's Company, It's Garry Shandling's Show and The Larry Sanders Show and served as showrunner on the series Newhart. After an unsuccessful attempt <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> British series The Young Ones, Mirkin created Get a Life in 1990. The series starred comedian Chris Elliott and ran for two seasons, {{despite a lack of}} support from many Fox network executives, who disliked the show's dark and surreal humor. He moved on to create the sketch show The Edge starring his then-partner, actress Julie Brown.|$|E
5|$|After a fortnight, Kumar met Balachander in Chennai {{and watched}} Uyarndha Manithan {{again for a}} second time to study his character. This time, however, Kumar hesitated to portray Ganesan's role and {{requested}} Balachander <b>to</b> direct <b>the</b> <b>remake</b> of Babu (1971). Balachander showed concern with Kumar's change of heart and refused the offer, leading <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> <b>remakes</b> of Uyarndha Manithan and Babu being shelved.|$|R

5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was {{developed}} as a partnership between development studios 343 Industries, Saber Interactive, and Certain Affinity. 343 Industries, the Halo series' franchise overseers, approached Saber Interactive to develop a remake of the original Halo in time for its tenth anniversary. After considering whether <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> game entirely or to adapt and add features to the existing PC version, Saber decided to use its game engine for reproducing the original's appearance and the original Halos engine for gameplay. A development tool for toggling between {{the old and new}} visuals became a game feature. Anniversarys enhancements include a complete high-definition visual overhaul, support for cooperative and multiplayer gameplay via the Xbox Live online service, new and remastered sound effects and music, and extras such as achievements and hidden in-game collectibles. The game is the first in the series to include Kinect support.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{creative}} staff at Pixar were not happy with how the sequel was turning out. Lasseter, upon returning from the European promotion of A Bug's Life, watched the development reels and {{agreed that it was}} not working. Pixar met with Disney, telling them that the film would have to be redone. Disney disagreed, and noted that Pixar did not have enough time <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> film before its established release date. Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state, and asked Lasseter to take over the production. Lasseter agreed, and recruited the first film's creative team to redevelop the story. To meet Disney's deadline, Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting and}} events of Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne {{take place in}} a {{separate}} continuity {{to the rest of the}} Megami Tensei series. Nocturne is set in modern-day Tokyo before and after an event called the Conception, in which the normal world is destroyed through the actions of a cult to prevent the world's stagnation and ultimate demise, as dictated by the Great Will governing existence. Tokyo is transformed into a wasteland on the inside of a sphere inhabited by the spirits of humans who died in the Conception; demons who wage war with each other; and Reasons, deity-like beings formed from the gathering of Magatsuhi by people with a deity or demon sponsor. Those who possess Reasons seek <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> world in their image by presenting themselves to Kagutsuchi, a semi-sentient manifestation of the Great Will's power which exists to perpetuate the destruction and rebirth of worlds through Conception, and proving their worth. Another realm mentioned in the story is the Shadow Vortex, a limbo where dead worlds and the beings who created them linger.|$|E
50|$|Prior to release, Visu (the {{writer for}} the {{original}} Thillu Mullu) filed a civil suit against Vendhar Movies, restraining them from releasing <b>the</b> <b>remake.</b> According <b>to</b> him, <b>the</b> <b>remake</b> had <b>the</b> same screenplay and dialogues as the original version, and the producers did not seek permission <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> his film. However, the court dismissed the case, concluding that <b>the</b> <b>remake</b> {{did not have the}} same screenplay as the original version, allowing it to release on 14 June.|$|R
5000|$|The Hewitt House is {{a privately}} owned, six bedroom working farm house. It {{was built in}} Austin, Texas in the 1850s where the University of Texas at Austin now stands. The house was then moved by train to 901 County Road 336 Granger, Texas in the 1930s, and restored. This house was {{featured}} in <b>the</b> 2003 <b>remake</b> <b>The</b> Texas Chainsaw Massacre, {{as well as in}} the 2006 prequel <b>to</b> said <b>remake,</b> <b>The</b> Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning.|$|R

5|$|Belichick, {{who came}} to the Browns after 12 years mostly with the Giants under Bill Parcells, quickly made his mark by restricting media access to the team. He acted gruff or bored at press conferences, shrugging, rolling his eyes and often giving short answers to long questions. This bred the {{perception}} that the new coach was not a good communicator and lacked a vision for the team. Behind the scenes, however, he was trying <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> Browns. He reformed Cleveland's scouting methods and, in conjunction with player personnel director Mike Lombardi, tried to form a coherent identity: a big and strong cold-weather team. Belichick's new way forward, however, did not immediately translate to on-field success. Cleveland's record only improved slightly in 1991 to 6–10 as the offense struggled to produce scoring drives and the defense was plagued by injuries. Kosar was a rare bright spot, passing for almost 3,500yards and 18 touchdowns. Bridging the end of the 1990 season and the beginning of 1991, the quarterback threw a then-record 307 straight passes without an interception. Kosar broke his ankle twice and sat out for most of the 1992 season, leaving quarterback Mike Tomczak under center. The team finished with a 7–9 record and did not make the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> {{game for the}} WonderSwan Color, and Square's merger with former {{competitor}} Enix to form Square Enix in , the company posted assurance that the game's promised remake would not be completely forgotten, and there was speculation that it might find its way to Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Game Boy Advance as its predecessors had. Square Enix considered porting the game to the PlayStation 2, but was eventually convinced by Nintendo to develop the title for their new handheld system, the Nintendo DS, a decision that would later be positively reinforced by the commercial success of the Nintendo DS. The Final Fantasy III remake was first announced on October 24, 2004, but detailed information did not emerge for a year. Hiromichi Tanaka headed the project as both the executive producer and director. His guidance and supervision were needed because the remake was not a mere graphical update as Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy IIs remakes were, but a total overhaul using the Nintendo DS's 3D capabilities. Along with 3D graphics, a full motion video opening scene was produced for the game, {{similar to those found}} in the ports of the 2D Final Fantasy games for the PlayStation. Programming was handled by developer Matrix Software.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} the Protagonist {{arriving}} in Tokyo {{to meet up with}} Chiaki and Isamu to visit Takao in a hospital. While in the city, the player learns of a confrontation between two cults which resulted in several deaths, and learns details of it from Hijiri when he meets them in the park where the event took place. Finding the hospital deserted apart from Chiaki and Isamu, the Protagonist searches it, is briefly accosted by Lucifer in his child form, and is almost killed by Hikawa. Saved from Hikawa by Takao, the Protagonist is taken by her to the hospital roof and witnesses the Conception, with Takao saying the resulting Vortex World will remain until the next creation is triggered. In the immediate aftermath, Lucifer contacts the Protagonist again and infuses him with a Magatama, wishing to see whether he can lead his armies against the Great Will. This turns the Protagonist into the Demi-fiend, a being with the powers of a demon and the heart of a human. After escaping from the hospital, the Demi-fiend begins exploring the Vortex World with help from Hijiri. He learns of two cults who seek <b>to</b> <b>remake</b> <b>the</b> world in their image: Hikawa's Assembly of Nihilo, and a separate organization called the Mantra Army. Hikawa manages to destroy the Mantra Army, with Takao acting as his assistant.|$|E
