We study {{extensions}} of first-order logic over <b>the</b> <b>reals</b> with {{different types of}} transitive-closure operators as query languages for constraint databases that can be described by Boolean combinations of polynomial inequalities over <b>the</b> <b>reals.</b> We are in particular interested in deciding the termination of the evaluation of queries expressible in these transitive-closure logics. It turns out that termination is undecidable in general. However, we show that the termination of the transitive closure of a continuous function graph in the two-dimensional plane, viewed as a binary relation over <b>the</b> <b>reals,</b> is decidable, and even expressible in first-order logic over <b>the</b> <b>reals.</b> Based on this result, we identify a particular transitive-closure logic for which termination of query evaluation is decidable and which is more expressive than first-order logic over <b>the</b> <b>reals.</b> Furthermore, we can define a guarded fragment in which exactly the terminating queries of this language are expressible. ...|$|R
