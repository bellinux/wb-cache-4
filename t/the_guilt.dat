5|$|As an anointed queen, Mary {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the power of any court to try her and refused to attend the inquiry at York personally (she sent representatives), but Elizabeth forbade her attendance anyway. As evidence against Mary, Moray presented the so-called casket letters—eight unsigned letters purportedly from Mary to Bothwell, two marriage contracts, and a love sonnet or sonnets {{said to have been}} found in a silver-gilt casket just less than one foot (30cm) long, decorated with the monogram of King Francis II. Mary denied writing them, arguing that her handwriting was not difficult to imitate, and insisted they were forgeries. They are widely believed to be crucial as to whether Mary shares <b>the</b> <b>guilt</b> for Darnley's murder. The chair of the commission of inquiry, the Duke of Norfolk, described them as horrible letters and diverse fond ballads, and sent copies to Elizabeth, saying that if they were genuine they might prove Mary's guilt.|$|E

5|$|In theses 67–80, Luther {{discusses}} {{further the}} problems with the way indulgences are being preached, as he had done in the letter to Archbishop Albert. The preachers have been promoting indulgences as the greatest of the graces available from the church, but they actually only promote greed. He points out that bishops have been commanded to offer reverence to indulgence preachers who enter their jurisdiction, but bishops are also charged with protecting their people from preachers who preach contrary to the pope's intention. He then attacks the belief allegedly propagated by the preachers that the indulgence could forgive one who had violated the Virgin Mary. Luther states that indulgences cannot take away <b>the</b> <b>guilt</b> of even the lightest of venial sins. He labels several other alleged statements of the indulgence preachers as blasphemy: that Saint Peter could not have granted a greater indulgence than the current one, and that the indulgence cross with the papal arms is as worthy as the cross of Christ.|$|E

5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} <b>the</b> <b>guilt</b> of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
5|$|Theses 30–34 {{deal with}} the false {{certainty}} Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since no one knows whether a person is truly repentant, a letter assuring a person of his forgiveness is dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} the truly repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. Truly repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty as well as <b>the</b> <b>guilt</b> of sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are not necessary for Christians to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God's punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.|$|E

Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due to a patient suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey.

5|$|Capitol Hill {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and most densely {{populated}} neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. It is bounded by F Street NE on the north and Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. The U.S. Capitol marks its western boundary, while the Anacostia River is its eastern limit. Although Capitol Hill has been home to many of the city's powerful, its hauntings appear to be few. One ghost, however, is said to haunt First Street NE. Joseph Holt was Judge Advocate General of the United States Army from 1862 to 1875. He presided over the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators. During the trials, accused conspirators Dr. Samuel Mudd (who treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg) and Mary Surratt (at whose downtown boarding house the conspirators met) were held at the Old Capitol Prison opposite the U.S. Capitol (the modern day United States Supreme Court Building stands on the site today). After Holt retired, he allegedly became a recluse in his Capitol Hill home. Although the Holt house no longer exists, local residents have told stories of Holt's ghost walking down First Street NE in a blue suit and cape, pondering <b>the</b> <b>guilt</b> of Mudd and Surrat as he heads for the site of the Old Capitol Prison.|$|E

Another of his movies, Paramount Pictures's road movie <b>The</b> <b>Guilt</b> Trip, also starring Barbra Streisand, was released in cinemas in 2012. The film was about an inventor (Rogen) who invites his mother (Streisand) on a road trip, as he attempts to sell his new product while also reuniting her with a lost love. In 2013, Rogen along with screenwriting collaborator Evan Goldberg made their directorial debut with This Is the End, a comedy movie featuring Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride playing fictional versions of themselves facing a global apocalypse. The film received positive reviews and was number two in the box office on its opening weekend.|$|E
5|$|In 1593 and 1594, {{when the}} theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare {{published}} two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, the poems show <b>the</b> <b>guilt</b> and moral confusion {{that result from}} uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in {{the first edition of}} the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.|$|E

5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with <b>the</b> <b>guilt</b> his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1517, Luther sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose {{authority}} the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. He assumes that Albert is unaware of what is being preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern that the people are being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring shame to Albert's name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that <b>the</b> <b>guilt</b> as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so that he could see the uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.|$|E
5|$|In 1163 Henry {{returned}} to England, intent on reforming {{the role of}} the royal courts. He cracked down on crime, seizing the belongings of thieves and fugitives, and travelling justices were dispatched to the north and the Midlands. After 1166, Henry's exchequer court in Westminster, which had previously only heard cases connected with royal revenues, began to take wider civil cases on behalf of the king. The reforms continued and Henry created the General Eyre, probably in 1176, which involved dispatching a group of royal justices to visit all the counties in England over a given period of time, with authority to cover both civil and criminal cases. Local juries were used occasionally in previous reigns, but Henry made much wider use of them. Juries were introduced in petty assizes from around 1176, where they were used to establish the answers to particular pre-established questions, and in grand assizes from 1179, where they were used to determine <b>the</b> <b>guilt</b> of a defendant. Other methods of trial continued, however, including trial by combat and trial by ordeal. After the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, royal justice was extended into new areas through the use of new forms of assizes, in particular novel disseisin, mort d'ancestor and dower unde nichil habet, which dealt with the wrongful dispossession of land, inheritance rights and the rights of widows respectively. In making these reforms Henry both challenged the traditional rights of barons in dispensing justice and reinforced key feudal principles, but over time they greatly increased royal power in England.|$|E

40|$|Guilt is {{a complex}} and {{distressing}} emotion that can be experienced in different situations. The majority of psychoanalytic authors focused on the intrapsychic origins of guilt, connecting it with perverse desires and unconscious wishes to hurt others. On the contrary, according to Control-Mastery Theory (CMT), guilt is interpersonal in its origin, its aim is pro-social and its function is adaptive. Guilt, however, can be pathogenic when it derives from pathogenic beliefs, is generalized and leads to distress and symptoms (O'Connor et al. 1997). Both evolutionary and moral psychology researches support the hypothesis of the pro-social origin of guilt and its adaptive function for individual and group evolution (Wilson, Wilson, 2008; Haidt, 2012; Tomasello 2016). The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate 1) <b>the</b> relation between <b>guilt,</b> assessed with <b>the</b> Interpersonal <b>Guilt</b> Questionnaire- 67 (IGQ- 67; O'Connor et al. 1997) and <b>the</b> Interpersonal <b>Guilt</b> Rating Scale 15 self (IGRS- 15 -s; Gazzillo et al. 2017) and motivational systems assessed with the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scale (ANPS; Davis, Panksepp, 2003) and 2) <b>the</b> relation between <b>guilt</b> and well-being assessed with Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI; Grossi et al. 2002) in a sample of 600 subjects. The first step of the study is the Italian validation of IGQ- 67 and IGRS- 15 -s, where the factor structure differentiates interpersonal guilt (survivor, separation and omnipotent) from self-hate <b>guilt.</b> <b>The</b> second step investigates <b>the</b> relation between <b>guilt</b> and <b>the</b> motivational systems. The third step investigates <b>the</b> relation between <b>guilt</b> and well-being. Preliminary analysis show a positive and significant relation between interpersonal guilt and care and attachment system, as well as between self-hate guilt and panic-grief system and a negative and significant relation between guilt and well-being.
