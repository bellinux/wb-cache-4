At one point she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at some princess fair or something and said, 'This is worse than working the psych [...] at the hospital.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Suddenly {{she sat up}} in her bed {{and looked}} {{from one to the}} other of us with wide, frightened eyes," [...] wrote Eagar. [...] "She cried out suddenly, 'I'm dying! I'm dying!' She was coaxed to lie down again, but {{remained}} agitated. [...] "The child <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'" [...] Eagar promised it would be done. [...] "She added, 'immediately.' ... We continued to fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie and I brought the wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her for a moment, and Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took the baby out of the room." [...] Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.|$|E

500|$|The Golden Age of Grotesque is {{the final}} studio album to feature {{longtime}} keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy and guitarist John 5, who would both acrimoniously quit the group over the following years. John 5's relationship with Manson had soured {{over the course of}} the Grotesk Burlesk Tour. According to John, Manson spoke to him only once during the entire tour: [...] "It was on my birthday and he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Happy birthday, faggot'—then walked away." [...] Manson also displayed hostility towards the guitarist on stage. During a performance of [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] at the 2003 Rock am Ring festival, Manson kicked and then shoved John, who responded in anger by throwing his guitar to the ground and raising his fists to Manson, before resuming the song. Gacy, who was also the band's last remaining original member – excluding Manson – quit shortly before the recording of the band's next studio album, Eat Me, Drink Me (2007). He would later file a $20 million lawsuit against Marilyn Manson for unpaid [...] "partnership proceeds", accusing the vocalist of spending money earned by the band on [...] "sick and disturbing purchases of Nazi memorabilia and taxidermy, including the skeleton of a young Chinese girl." ...|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E

2500|$|On the Wednesday {{before the}} Stanford game, the #1-ranked Michigan team {{received}} {{a visit from}} President Gerald Ford. [...] Ford, who was {{the most valuable player}} of the 1934 Michigan Wolverines football team, spent time with team during a practice session and later ate with the team. [...] Ford noted, [...] "They're an awful lot bigger today. [...] Not only are they bigger but they're better." [...] Split end Curt Stephenson later recalled the dinner:"A tray appeared with a big New York steak in front of the President[...] [...] [...] What happened next is kind of a blur. [...] President Ford started to choke and the secret service started to circle the table. [...] I don't know why, but in one immediate action, I reached back and gave him a good whack on the back. A hunk of beef flew out and across the table. [...] The President <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Thanks'[...] [...] [...] From that point on, there were about six agents who were giving me eagle eyes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mahaffey {{also stated}} that after the murder of Virgil Starks, the police made the {{farmhouse}} off limits to everybody. [...] "Several nights later, I was holding forth in the Arkansas police station when a call came through that a neighbor had seen strange lights in the farmhouse. We sped to the scene and I hid behind a car while Police Chief Max Tackett and three other patrolmen approached the house. Chief Tackett yelled into the house that the place was surrounded and the Phantom might as well give up. Who do you suppose walked out? None other than Lone Wolf Gonzaullas of the Texas Rangers and a woman photographer from Life and Time magazines. Lone Wolf explained rather sheepishly {{that he had been}} re-enacting the crime and the young lady was taking pictures of him. Police Chief Tackett <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and shouted {{at the top of his}} voice, 'Mahaffey, you can quote me as saying that the Phantom Murders will never be solved until Texarkana gets rid of the big city press and the Texas Rangers.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Havins and Riegel {{described}} what went into taping the moment Bianca discovers that her child {{is alive and}} Babe's deception. [...] "It was crazy!" [...] said Riegel of the [...] "grueling" [...] day. [...] "It was insane, in fact. [...] and I were on the set from 9 a.m. to like 7:30 at night, {{just the two of}} us." [...] Havins agreed and relayed, [...] "It was so intense to tape. It was a long, long day, a 12-hour tape day." [...] They were warned by All My Children executives that the episode would be [...] "especially" [...] demanding. [...] "I don't think they've ever handed that much material to just two actresses before, so they wanted us to be prepared," [...] said Riegel. [...] "It was the most dialogue I've ever had in my entire life. To the point where several weeks before they gave me the script, our producer, Julie , sat us down and said to us, 'This is just so important.,'" [...] added Havins. [...] "And she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'We're almost nervous because it's so much material. If it's too much, let us know.' It was that dialogue-heavy." ...|$|E
