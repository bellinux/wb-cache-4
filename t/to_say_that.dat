5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. <b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> code is pythonic is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E

3000|$|By definition, (i) is {{equivalent}} <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> for any c ∈C and map f:π (c) → i' cocartesian over I, {{there exists a}} map f':c → c' that lifts f (that is, π (f')=f), and is cocartesian both over I' and over I. Existence of lifting maps f' cocartesian over I' {{is equivalent}} <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> f^* has a left-adjoint f_!. As in Lemma  4.2, the condition on the maps (4.2) is then equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> these maps f' are also cocartesian over I.|$|R

5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|Former President of the United States Barack Obama {{has said}} that The Wire is his {{favorite}} television series.

5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E

Thornton went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Canadian audiences were generally reserved {{and that the}} band was used to playing in places where people move around and throw things at each other. He then added, 'it's like mashed potatoes with no gravy.' This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada {{and around the world}} for the star's behavior.|$|E
5|$|Gregory {{was also}} one of the first Christian voices <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> slavery as an {{institution}} was inherently sinful. He believed that slavery violated mankind's inherent worth, and the nature of humanity to be free; a departure from classical, and Judeo-Christian precedent which he rooted in Genesis, arguing that man was given mastery of animals but not of mankind. Although aspects of the slave system had been criticized by Stoics such as Seneca, this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world.|$|E

The three stamps were first placed on sale in Washington, D.C. and in five Massachusetts cities and towns that played major roles in the Lexington and Concord story: Lexington, Concord, Boston, Cambridge, and Concord Junction (as West Concord was then known).

5|$|In Nikki Stafford's analysis, the {{reactions}} of Buffy, Dawn, Xander, Willow, Anya, and Tara represent stages of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross' five stages of grief in different parts.
