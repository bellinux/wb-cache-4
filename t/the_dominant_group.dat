5|$|As {{the first}} group of Chinese people to settle in large numbers, the Hokkien of {{southern}} Fujian became the dominant immigrant group until the middle of the 19th century. Their maritime-mercantile culture comes from their trade occupations whilst in Indonesia. Descendants of Hokkiens are <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>group</b> in eastern Indonesia, Central and East Java, and the western coast of Sumatra. Teochews, southern neighbors of the Hokkien, are found throughout the eastern coast of Sumatra, in the Riau Archipelago, and in western Borneo. They were preferred as plantation laborers in Sumatra, but have become traders in regions where the Hokkien are not well represented.|$|E
5|$|Banded sugar ants are <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>group</b> of nocturnal ants {{in their}} range. Workers are mostly {{encountered}} at dusk {{when they are}} foraging for food on marked trails or on Casuarina and Eucalyptus trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running, or simply leaving a pheromone trail to the source. Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running.|$|E

After the Bani Utbah gained control of Bahrain, the Al Bin Ali had a practically independent status there as a self-governing tribe. They used a flag with four red and three white stripes, called the Al-Sulami flag in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and the Eastern province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Later, different Arab family clans and tribes from Qatar moved to Bahrain to settle {{after the fall of}} Nasr Al-Madhkur of Bushehr.

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that there is a}} {{correlation}} between the size of the group {{and the size of the}} patch; however this correlation provides no implication that subordinate group members have less resources. More likely, it is the effects of the patch size on the group member that dominates interactions. An experiment was performed to study the mechanism responsible for the positive correlation between the group size and patch size. The scientists argued that the correlation between the group size and patch size is because of the indirect consequence of the positive relationship between <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>group</b> member’s length and the anemone size. The length of <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>group</b> member limits the group size because the length of <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>group</b> member prevents the group of the subordinate group members. This data shows that the patch size and group size correlation does not necessarily imply the decrease in resources of group members subordinate to <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>group</b> member.|$|E

500|$|Historically Kuala Lumpur was a {{predominantly}} Chinese city, with the Kuala Lumpur of 1872 beside the Klang River described by Frank Swettenham as a [...] "purely Chinese village", although a Malay stockade already existed at Bukit Nanas at that time.

Many Pahang Malays who fought in the Selangor Civil War in 1873 also chose to settle in Selangor after the war. The population of Kuala Lumpur was estimated to be around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor.
