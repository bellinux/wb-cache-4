For my part, I {{do not believe that}} the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment and <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E

25|$|As smoke {{began to}} escape the Zebra Room and drift {{down the hall toward}} other banquet rooms, patrons and {{employees}} in the rooms nearest to the Zebra Room smelled it. The employees began to verbally urge room occupants to leave the building; however, as the sprawling complex lacked an audible fire alarm, those in further-flung rooms had no way <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a fire in the building until an employee walked the length of the building alerting them. Fire investigators later estimated that, once through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, the fire took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. By the time busboy Walter Bailey arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around a thousand people to make their way through the room's small number of exits. As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those {{on the second floor of}} the building.|$|E
500|$|Hill did {{not want}} an {{extensive}} tour because of obligations to her family and the difficulties she experienced touring with the Fugees in 1996, which she found desensitizing and isolating. According to Hill biographer Chris Nickson in 1999, [...] "there was the possibility of more dates being added... but {{it was unlikely that}} Lauryn would be willing to make the tour more grueling and draining. She'd come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was much more to life than a career." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{definitely}} {{paved the}} way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a female audience that was really strong out there", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} to [...] "Ya Soshla S Uma" [...] {{was directed by}} Shapovalov, and was shot at the Khodynka Field in Moscow between 4–7 September 2000. Preparation for the visual consisted of both Volkova and Katina covering themselves in dark-tanning lotion and getting haircuts. Over 90 people were present on set, including extra actors, whilst some members had designed a large brick wall by painting abstract patterns and colors to it. According to Shapovalov, the wall itself cost approximately $3000 USD. After shooting {{the majority of the}} scenes in Khodynka Field, Shapovalov moved the wall and iron fence to Kutuzov Avenue, Moscow, in order to shot frames of traffic until the camera changed its focus on the girls again. Shapovalov stated that he wanted the viewers <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a [...] "world behind the crowd of people." [...] The video was broadcast in Russia and Europe in early December 2000 on MTV.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast on Knots Landing, Mills was {{predominantly}} known for playing [...] "damsel in distress" [...] roles, {{which is why}} the producers didn't initially consider her. Abby's storylines focused on business dealings, affairs and family troubles. Introduced as the sister of Sid Fairgate, she was initially portrayed as a friendly, warm-hearted woman with great love for her children. In due time, she evolved into the series' main antagonist, constantly causing mayhem in others' lives. According to series creator David Jacobs, the producers always intended Abby to be a J.R. Ewing-esque character. Jacobs said, [...] "When we were casting the role of Abby, we were looking for a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. It was our intention to have this nice person gain the trust of the other women and then cause trouble for them. We didn't want the other characters and the audience <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen." ...|$|E

500|$|Abby {{was always}} {{intended}} to be the show's promiscuous seductress. In an interview with Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune, Jacobs said: [...] "When we were casting the role of Abby, {{we were looking for}} a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. It was our intention to have this nice person gain the trust of the other women and then cause trouble for them. We didn't want the other characters and the audience <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen." [...] Author June L. May of Monsters and Critics said, [...] "In season two of Knots Landing, a catalyst moves into the neighborhood in the form of Sid’s sister, the drop dead gorgeous Abby Cunningham. [...] Whether Abby is directly involved, or simply in the neighborhood, she has a detrimental affect on the harmony of couples." [...] Almost immediately, Abby sank her claws into Richard Avery (John Pleshette), one of the neighborhood husbands. Though the affair was brief, it set the stage for what was to come.|$|E

[...] Schemel's girlfriend at the time acted as Courtney Love's personal assistant during Hole's 1994-1995 world tour, while promoting Live Through This. Also in the mid-1990s, according to an inside source, Patty was in a brief relationship with drummer Polly Johnson of 764-HERO.|$|R

That the label was co-owned by a woman reflected an openness to women's participation. Pedersen is quoted in Toby Vail's Riot Grrrl zine, Jigsaw, saying [...] "I think it's really important that people know there are women ... girls who ... do more than package up things. ... It's really important that people <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are girls out there making decisions and doing stuff.".|$|E
2500|$|Paulie (Raskopoulos), a {{young man}} of unknown Mediterranean heritage, dressed in a green-and-pink striped polo shirt, confronts various people to {{complain}} about what might be termed pedantic issues. For example, in his first appearance, he explains to a cashier at a store that gnocchi is actually made of potatoes, {{and should not be}} placed in the pasta aisle. Other complaints he made included wanting to change the nickname of the Australian soccer team because a [...] "socceroo" [...] isn't a real animal, and that George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is [...] "incorrect" [...] because its events did not occur in 1984. [...] In a more recent episode, Paulie confronts the owner of an Adult Sex shop telling him that the [...] "edible undies" [...] should have a nutritional value printed on the box, just in case a vegan is starving to death and needs <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no beef in them. At the end of each sketch Paulie recommends that the problem be solved by putting a sticker on the offending object, and assures the target of his complaint that [...] "I've got my eye on youse". Perhaps to prove a point, the scenarios are often shown later on in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|Burke's public {{coming out}} {{was met with}} wide support from the press and fans, with the ESPN {{interview}} garnering praise from the hockey world. He received hundreds of emails and letters of support from gay athletes from across the continent. [...] The news of his father's acceptance of his sexual orientation also earned Brian Burke praise from press and fans {{inside and outside the}} hockey world. The news further launched Brendan into advocacy, speaking about homophobia in hockey and encouraging discussion on the challenges faced by gay athletes in hockey and mainstream sports in general. In a later TSN interview, Burke stated that he hoped that telling his story would allow gay athletes and pro sports workers <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were supportive, safe environments for them and would encourage them to step forward as well. Toronto's Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) began using Burke's coming-out story as a teaching tool, stating that the story could [...] "change so many families across Canada, particularly because so many young boys are expected to grow up playing with a hockey stick and make their dads happy." [...] His coming-out story gained further attention from a large variety of news outlets in the days that followed. Interest in Brendan's story was attributed to both his relation to his father and [...] "hockey's sometimes homophobic culture." ...|$|E

2500|$|Historian Leonard Arrington {{attributes}} {{the stories of}} Danites in Utah to overzealous descriptions of the [...] "Minute Men," [...] a law enforcement organization created by Brigham Young to pursue marauding Indians and white criminals. [...] Arthur Conan Doyle and other authors had also popularized the idea of blood-thirsty Danites riding rough-shod through Utah in various fictional works. [...] At the same time, there is evidence that, purportedly in order to deter and punish crime in Utah Territory, Brigham Young occasionally authorized local church leaders to engage in vigilante actions on an ad hoc basis. For instance, in early 1857, Young ordered local authorities to monitor two recently released convicts {{who were on the}} trail to California. If they were caught stealing livestock along the way, he authorized their summary execution. Historian Ardis Parshall believes that this led to an attack on an unrelated party which wounded several individuals in a case of mistaken identity. Indeed, in the same sermon where he spoke of the Danites and Vigilance Committees in 1857, Young also stated: [...] "There have been men here who have had their plans to arrange for robbing; and I will take the liberty to say that, when we find them, 'judgement will be laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet.' [...] Those are my feelings, and I express them plainly, that the good and honest may be able to pass from the Eastern States to California, and back and forth, in [...] peace...I want the people in the States <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are a few poor curses here, and to know that we do not want gangs of highwaymen here. [...] And I say to such characteres...we will send you home quick, whenever we can catch and convict you." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{always loved}} that Korn's music helped kids let out aggression. But {{with my new}} music, I want kids <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> more out there.

Let's bounce back and forth and have fun.' — Brian Welch Welch wrote in his autobiography, Save Me from Myself, that ideas for lyrics and music often came from conversations with friends, {{including}} themes for [...] "Re-Bel" [...] and [...] "Washed by Blood". The music has [...] "a Christian, spiritual edge", while being an [...] "extension of the Korn family". [...] "I literally poured everything I had into Save Me from Myself," [...] Welch explained in June 2008, [...] "I know it's gonna inspire a lot of people." ...|$|R
