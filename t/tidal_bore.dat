5|$|Tourism is an {{important}} industry in Moncton and historically owes its origins {{to the presence of}} two natural attractions, the <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> of the Petitcodiac River (see above) and the optical illusion of Magnetic Hill. The <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> was the first phenomenon to become an attraction but the construction of the Petitcodiac causeway in the 1960s effectively extirpated the attraction. Magnetic Hill, on the city's northwest outskirts, is the city's most famous attraction. The Magnetic Hill area includes (in addition to the phenomenon itself), a golf course, major water park, zoo, and an outdoor concert facility. A $90 million casino/hotel/entertainment complex opened at Magnetic Hill in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Severn bore is a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> seen on {{the tidal}} reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way {{upstream}} {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E
5|$|The main valleys {{between the}} hills {{are filled with}} {{alluvial}} deposits from the hills or sea. The county has many small rivers, most of which flow into the Bristol Channel. Many of the latter rivers now have clysts (the local name for a sluice) on them to control the sea, but formerly they were tidal for some way inland. The main exception to this is the River Parrett, which still has a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore.</b> However the Chew and the Frome flow into the Avon which forms most of the northern county boundary with Gloucestershire. The Cale flows into Dorset through the Blackmore Vale, while the Exe flows into Devon. The (Dorset) Axe, the Culm and the Otter rise in Somerset but flow into Dorset.|$|E
50|$|Lakes with {{an ocean}} inlet can also exhibit <b>tidal</b> <b>bores.</b>|$|R
25|$|Similarly, kayakers and surfers {{have been}} known to ride <b>tidal</b> <b>bores</b> up rivers.|$|R

5|$|The River Brue {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels {{to the east of}} the Polden Hills. It rises in hills near the {{southern}} border of the county, flows through Bruton, where it is joined by the River Pitt, and on through Baltonsborough. The lower reaches have been diverted into a channel that joins the Parrett at Burnham-on-Sea in Bridgwater Bay. There is a raised bog in the central Brue valley and the surrounding area is a mosaic of swamps, meres and alder woodland. The River Parrett rises in the hills around Chedington in Dorset and flows northwestwards past Aller, Somerset, and through the Somerset Levels to Bridgwater, after which it becomes an estuary with its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea. The river has a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore,</b> similar to that in the River Severn. The Somerset Levels are only a few feet above sea level and liable to flooding. They are drained by ditches and channels that drain into the Parrett including the King's Sedgemoor Drain, just south of the Polden Hills.|$|E
25|$|A curious {{phenomenon}} {{associated with}} the lower reaches of the Severn is the <b>tidal</b> <b>bore,</b> which forms somewhat upstream of the port of Sharpness.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the better}} {{examples}} of a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> {{can be seen on}} the Shubenacadie River near the town of Truro and the village of Maitland, where local ecotourism operators offer the chance to experience rafting the bore upriver. Another good example of a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> may be viewed on the Salmon River in the town of Truro. The once-famous tidal bores on the Petitcodiac and Avon rivers have been severely disrupted as a result of causeway construction in the 1960s–1970s which have caused excessive siltation.|$|E
25|$|A <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> is a {{hydraulic}} jump which {{occurs when the}} incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travel up a river or narrow bay against {{the direction of the}} current. As is true for hydraulic jumps in general, bores take on various forms depending upon the difference in the waterlevel upstream and down, ranging from an undular wavefront to a shock-wave-like wall of water. Figure 3 shows a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> with the characteristics common to shallow upstream water – a large elevation difference is observed. Figure 4 shows a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> with the characteristics common to deep upstream water – a small elevation difference is observed and the wavefront undulates. In both cases the tidal wave moves at the speed characteristic of waves in water of the depth found immediately behind the wave front. A key feature of tidal bores and positive surges is the intense turbulent mixing induced by the passage of the bore front and by the following wave motion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> – {{a wall or}} undulating wave {{of water}} moves {{upstream}} against water flowing downstream as shown in Figures 3 and 4. If considered from a frame of reference which moves with the wave front, {{you can see that}} this case is physically similar to a stationary jump.|$|E
5000|$|Small <b>tidal</b> <b>bores,</b> only a {{few inches}} in height, have been {{observed}} advancing up tidal bayous on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.|$|R
50|$|In 1962 {{and again}} in 1976, large <b>tidal</b> <b>bores</b> reached Wedel. As protection, dikes were built in 1978 that turned the {{surrounding}} marshes into beautiful hiking paths.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tidal</b> <b>bores</b> may be {{dangerous}} and many bores {{have had a}} sinister reputation: the River Seine (France); the Petitcodiac River (Canada); and the Colorado River (Mexico), to name a few. In China, despite warning signs erected {{along the banks of}} the Qiantang River, a number of fatalities occur each year by people who take too much risk with the <b>bore.</b> The <b>tidal</b> <b>bores</b> affect the shipping and navigation in the estuarine zone, for example, in Papua New Guinea (Fly and Bamu Rivers), Malaysia (Benak at Batang Lupar), and India (Hoogly bore).|$|R
25|$|Currently {{the wings}} for the Airbus A380, {{which are made}} at Airbus's {{manufacturing}} factory in Broughton, are taken downriver by barge to the Port of Mostyn because they are too large to be shipped in an Airbus Beluga. However, the dredging of the river for the barge {{may be responsible for}} a weakening of the <b>tidal</b> <b>bore.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Petitcodiac River, Shepody River, Tantramar River, and Memramcook River empty into Chignecto Bay at {{the head}} of the Bay of Fundy. Like the Saint John River, the Bay of Fundy tides cause another {{upstream}} phenomenon, known as a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore.</b> The construction of a causeway on the river at Moncton, approximately 50 kilometres upstream, has lessened the tidal bore's effect and changed the river's ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|The first {{tide table}} in China was {{recorded}} in 1056 AD primarily for visitors wishing to see the famous <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> in the Qiantang River. The first known British tide table {{is thought to be}} that of John Wallingford, who died Abbot of St. Albans in 1213, based on high water occurring 48 minutes later each day, and three hours earlier at the Thames mouth than upriver at London.|$|E

50|$|Surfing in Canada is practised on its {{east and}} west coasts, as well as via lake surfing on the Great Lakes, and river surfing on {{standing}} waves and <b>tidal</b> <b>bores.</b>|$|R
25|$|King Canute {{may have}} {{performed}} his unsuccessful attempt {{to turn the}} tide back in the River Trent at Gainsborough. Historians believe {{he may have been}} demonstrating on the aegir, a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore.</b> He and his supporters may have known Gainsborough was the furthest reach of the aegir, and ideal for his demonstration. However the story was only written down a century later by Henry of Huntingdon, who gives no location, and may have been a myth or a fable.|$|E
25|$|Surfing is {{a surface}} water sport {{in which the}} wave rider, {{referred}} to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers {{in the form of a}} standing wave or <b>tidal</b> <b>bore.</b> However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.|$|E
25|$|The Indus {{is one of}} the few {{rivers in}} the world to exhibit a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore.</b> The Indus system is largely fed by the snows and glaciers of the Himalayas, Karakoram and the Hindu Kush ranges of Tibet, the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh and Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. The flow of the river is also {{determined}} by the seasons – it diminishes greatly in the winter, while flooding its banks in the monsoon months from July to September. There is also evidence of a steady shift in the course of the river since prehistoric times – it deviated westwards from flowing into the Rann of Kutch and adjoining Banni grasslands after the 1816 earthquake.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tidal</b> <b>bores</b> are backwards-moving {{waves that}} travel {{upstream}} over forward-moving downstream waves. They occur {{twice a day}} on the Petitcodiac River in the Bay of Fundy, driven up the river by the world's highest tides.|$|R
25|$|Natural calamities, such as floods, {{tropical}} cyclones, tornadoes, and <b>tidal</b> <b>bores</b> occur {{almost every}} year, {{combined with the}} effects of deforestation, soil degradation and erosion.

500|$|Below Imperial Dam, only a {{small portion}} of the Colorado River makes it beyond Yuma, Arizona, and the {{confluence}} with the intermittent Gila River – which carries runoff from western New Mexico and most of Arizona – before defining about [...] of the Mexico–United States border. At Morelos Dam, the entire remaining flow of the Colorado is diverted to irrigate the Mexicali Valley, among Mexico's most fertile agricultural lands. Below San Luis Río Colorado, the Colorado passes entirely into Mexico, defining the Baja California–Sonora border; in most years, the stretch of the Colorado between here and the Gulf of California is dry or a trickle formed by irrigation return flows. The Hardy River provides most of the flow into the Colorado River Delta, a vast alluvial floodplain covering about [...] of northwestern Mexico. A large estuary is formed here before the Colorado empties into the Gulf about [...] south of Yuma. Before 20th-century development dewatered the lower Colorado, a major <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> was present in the delta and estuary; the first historical record was made by the Croatian missionary in Spanish service Father Ferdinand Konščak on July18, 1746. During spring tide conditions, the <b>tidal</b> <b>bore</b> – locally called El Burro – formed in the estuary about Montague Island in Baja California and propagated upstream.|$|E
500|$|The lower Parrett has a fall of only [...] between Langport and Bridgwater. To the {{northeast}} of the River Parrett's mouth, the Bristol Channel becomes the Severn Estuary, which has a tidal range of [...] The rate and direction of flow of the Parrett is therefore dependent {{on the state of}} the tide on the River Severn. In common with the lower reaches of the River Severn, the Parrett experiences a <b>tidal</b> <b>bore.</b> Certain combinations of the tides funnel the rising water into a wave that travels upstream at about , against the river's current.|$|E
