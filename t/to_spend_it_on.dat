5|$|Kinman {{claimed to}} have {{migrated}} to California in 1849 during the great Gold Rush {{and worked as a}} prospector in Pierson B. Reading's party on the Trinity River near present day Douglas City. He then returned to Illinois for two years. In 1852, he travelled to California and explored the Humboldt Bay area, near present day Eureka, California. Humboldt Bay had been recently rediscovered by gold miners seeking a faster and cheaper route to transport supplies. An early settlement in the area was also named Uniontown, but is now known as Arcata. During this period, prospectors and their suppliers were often flush with gold, but had little <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
25|$|World War II {{would show}} the highest {{ridership}} {{on the line}} through history. With the rationing on petrol, soon only the electric trams operated. 1940 showed an increase to 884,000 passengers, {{and for the first}} time the company made a profit of NOK 56,200. After long negotiations, in 1941, NOK 1 million of the debt was covered by the municipality. At the same time, A/S Ugla–Lian was bought and merged, at 25% above par. Ridership continued to increase, with 1.2 million in 191, and up to 2.16 million in 1945. Also during the war, the increased amount of money and lack of things <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> <b>on,</b> caused most of the available lots owned by the company to be sold.|$|E
25|$|All large {{businesses}} incur {{administrative costs}} {{in the process of}} delivering revenue collected from customers to the suppliers of the goods or services being purchased. Taxation is no different; the resource collected from the public through taxation is always greater than the amount which can be used by the government. The difference is called the compliance cost and includes (for example) the labour cost and other expenses incurred in complying with tax laws and rules. The collection of a tax in order <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a specified purpose, for example collecting a tax on alcohol to pay directly for alcoholism-rehabilitation centres, is called hypothecation. Finance ministers often dislike this practice, since it reduces their freedom of action. Some economic theorists regard hypothecation as intellectually dishonest since, in reality, money is fungible. Furthermore, it often happens that taxes or excises initially levied to fund some specific government programs are then later diverted to the government general fund. In some cases, such taxes are collected in fundamentally inefficient ways, for example, though highway tolls.|$|E

50|$|Another {{result of}} the Newton Temperance Movement was the Newton Savings Bank, later to become the National Savings Bank, {{designed}} to help men save money as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>spending</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> liquor. William Jackson was its first president from its founding in 1848 until his death. William participated in {{a full range of}} town committees, meetings, and activities, especially education and religion. He was deeply religious at this point, although he had not been throughout his childhood, teens, and young adulthood. William ended up being active in the Sabbath Schools, Deacon of the First Church, and Deacon of the Eliot Church, which he helped to found, as an end to a full and prosperous career.|$|R

He eventually decides <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> people who are in need of money and holds interviews. In one of these interviews, Frink introduces Grampa to his latest invention, the Death Ray, claiming that [...] "it is just a prototype. With proper funding I’m confident this little baby could destroy {{an area the size of}} New York City!" [...] Grampa responds with [...] "But I want to help people, not kill ‘em!", to which Frink replies [...] "Oh. Well, to be honest, the ray only has evil applications.

2500|$|Keynes {{suggested}} that traditional balancing mechanisms should be supplemented {{by the threat}} of confiscation of a portion of excess revenue if the surplus country did not choose <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> additional imports. However his ideas were not accepted by the Americans at the time. In 2008 and 2009, [...] American economist Paul Davidson [...] had been promoting his revamped form of Keynes's plan as a possible solution to global imbalances which in his opinion would expand growth all round without the downside risk of other rebalancing methods.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a severe}} period of {{national}} economic {{recession in the}} early 1890s, labor unrest was at its height. A volatile situation in Chicago in August 1893 caused the city’s then mayor, Carter Henry Harrison, to warn that the preponderance of the unemployed would lead to riots that would “shake the country” unless Congress interceded. In late August 1893, Gompers addressed 25,000 unemployed workers who had massed {{on the shore of}} Lake Michigan. [...] As reported in the Chicago Tribune on August 31, Gompers inveighed against the controllers of capital and the titans of industry and finance. “Why should the wealth of the country be stored in banks and elevators while the idle workman wanders homeless about the streets and the idle loafers who hoard the gold only <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> riotous living are rolling about in fine carriages from which they look out on peaceful meetings and call them riots?” ...|$|E
5000|$|From the {{macroeconomic}} perspective, {{the transformation}} of Germany's energy system demands a significant shift in cash flow, moving the cash spent on energy imports today <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> instead <b>on</b> new investments in systems, their operation and maintenance. In this respect a transformed energy system requires a large expenditure for local added value, a factor which also {{does not appear in}} the shown cost analysis.|$|R

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the Food Stamp Program as laid out in its {{implementation}} was to assist low-income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to Peter H. Rossi, a sociologist whose work involved evaluation of social programs, [...] "the program rests {{on the assumption that}} households with restricted incomes may skimp on food purchases and live on diets that are inadequate in quantity and quality, or, alternatively skimp on other necessities to maintain an adequate diet". Food stamps, as many like Rossi, MacDonald, and Eisinger contend, are used not only for increasing food but also as income maintenance. Income maintenance is money that households are able to spend on other things because they no longer have <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> food. According to various studies shown by Rossi, because of income maintenance only about $0.17–$0.47 more is being spent on food for every food stamp dollar than was spent prior to individuals receiving food stamps.|$|E
2500|$|There {{had never}} been an attack by highwaymen upon a {{paymaster}} within Arizona Territory prior to May 1889. [...] Despite this, there were several factors favoring such an attack. [...] The territory was remote and had only a small scattered population. [...] Many residents of Arizona Territory held the U.S. Federal government in low regard, feeling it ruled the territory from Washington with {{little interest in the}} territorial residents' well being. [...] Compounding this was the fact that most white residents of Arizona had been either Confederates or Confederate sympathizers. [...] Decades of hostilities between Washington and the Church of Latter-day Saints left hard feelings among the territory's Mormon population. [...] Recent efforts to enforce the Edmunds Act, which made polygamy a felony, had increased anger among this group. [...] Finally, strong racial biases were held by the white population against the black soldiers were exacerbated by Mormon teachings that placed blacks on a lower rung of society. [...] This led to a situation where some area residents could have easily rationalized that the payroll would have been better spent supporting the local communities instead of in the hands of black soldiers who were seen as likely <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> immoral pursuits.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin bequeathed £1,000 (about $4,400 at the time, {{or about}} $112,000 in 2011 dollars) each {{to the cities}} of Boston and Philadelphia, in trust to gather {{interest}} for 200 years. The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour, who admired Franklin greatly, wrote a friendly parody of Franklin's [...] "Poor Richard's Almanack" [...] called [...] "Fortunate Richard". The main character leaves a smallish {{amount of money in}} his will, five lots of 100 livres, to collect interest over one, two, three, four or five full centuries, with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects. Franklin, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia. By 1990, more than $2,000,000 had accumulated in Franklin's Philadelphia trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> scholarships for local high school students. Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; {{at the end of its}} first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a trade school that became the Franklin Institute of Boston, and the whole fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} this would be the {{comparison}} of $100 earned, and $100 found. If someone finds $100 they are more inclined <b>to</b> go <b>spend</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a whim, but if that $100 is part of a hard-earned paycheck, {{they are less likely to}} squander it away. Another way that effort heuristic can be considered is the amount of effort a person will put into an action depending on the goal. If the goal is of little importance, the amount of effort a person is willing to put into it is going to be lower.|$|R
