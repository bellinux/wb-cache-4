30|$|As seen in Table  5, the {{precision}} levels vary considerably between the 3 rotational migrations measured. <b>The</b> tantalum <b>markers</b> mounted on <b>the</b> implant define a polygon. Evaluating the scattering of <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> is vital {{in order to}} determine the migration of the implant (polygon) in relation to the rotational axes. The method is more sensitive to rotations when <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> are located far from the rotational axes. Good scattering of <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> improves <b>the</b> level of precision accordingly. This phenomenon is generally seen in RSA measurements of hip implants.|$|R

5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to design and {{implement}} an augmented user interface for widget management which uses a camera-projector system. Implement also includes a library of functions for semi-automatic calibration of this system. An interface to control <b>the</b> widgets using <b>markers</b> was designed. Various markers are arranged on the desktop (desk, wall or table). The camera captures these markers in a camera image. The position of <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> in space is then determined from the camera image. Widgets are projected on the desktop next to <b>the</b> <b>markers.</b> User can freely move those <b>markers</b> and <b>the</b> widgets will follow <b>the</b> <b>markers...</b>|$|R
50|$|If the {{temperature}} rises, <b>the</b> maximum scale <b>marker</b> will be pushed. If it falls, the moving mercury will push <b>the</b> minimum scale <b>marker.</b> As <b>the</b> temperature varies, <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> {{will remain in}} their positions unless {{the temperature}} becomes higher (for maximum) or lower (for minimum) than already recorded, in which case <b>the</b> relevant <b>marker</b> is pushed further. <b>The</b> <b>markers</b> thus record <b>the</b> furthest point reached by the mercury in each arm of the tube, and thereby the highest and lowest temperatures since the last reset. Typically the thermometer is reset every 24 hours to measure the diurnal temperature variation, {{the positions of the}} ends of <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> nearest to <b>the</b> mercury are examined. Their positions on the maximum and minimum scales show the highest and lowest temperatures encountered since the last reset.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>markers</b> include marble, granite, sandstone, and slate headstones, {{as well as}} footstones, obelisks, pedestal-tombs, box tombs, {{table-top}} tombs, and tablets.

5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (<b>the</b> <b>marker</b> boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Atlanta {{ranked among}} the fifty largest cities in the United States. The {{battlefield}} is now urban, residential, and commercial land, with many markers memorializing notable events of the battle, including McPherson's place of death. <b>The</b> <b>marker</b> was erected in 1956 by the Georgia Historical Commission. To commemorate the 140th anniversary of the battle, in 2004, two new markers were erected in the Inman Park neighborhood.

5|$|In {{his last}} act of public service, in 1839 Rowan was {{appointed}} as a commissioner to adjust land claims of U.S. citizens against the Republic of Mexico. During an adjournment {{of the commission}} in 1842, Rowan returned to Kentucky to visit relatives. While there, he fell ill {{and was unable to}} return to Washington, D.C.; consequently, he resigned his commission. Rowan died July 13, 1843. He was interred in the family burial ground at Federal Hill. In his will, Rowan specified that no marker should be placed over his grave, noting that his parents' graves had no markers, and {{he did not want to}} be honored above his parents. Several years later, members of his family placed a marker over his grave, despite his wishes. According to legend, <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> frequently tumbles from its base, purportedly a manifestation of Rowan haunting his grave.|$|E
5|$|Supernova discoveries are {{reported}} to the International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to that supernova. The name is <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> SN followed by the year of discovery, suffixed with a one or two-letter designation. The first 26 supernovae of the year are designated with a capital letter from A to Z. Afterward pairs of lower-case letters are used: aa, ab, and so on. Hence, for example, SN2003C designates the third supernova reported in the year 2003. The last supernova of 2005 was SN2005nc, indicating {{that it was the}} 367th supernova found in 2005. Since 2000, professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year (572 in 2007, 261 in 2008, 390 in 2009; 231 in 2013).|$|E
5|$|Within the {{memorial}} the architects added an inner shrine, or Record Room, in {{which could be}} recorded {{the names of the}} South Australians who fell during the war. While the design did not specify the exact form that this would take, in the completed memorial these names are inscribed in the bronzes that line the walls. The design also allowed for a cenotaph within the inner shrine, which the designers suggested could either be used as a symbolic representation of the unknown soldier or as <b>the</b> <b>marker</b> to an actual grave, although this aspect was never realised.|$|E
40|$|The {{extracts}} of Piper sarmentosum, a medicinal plant, {{are being}} used to prepare phytopharmaceuticals while the information about chemical kinetics of constituents of the extract is unavailable to assign precise shelf life (t 90) and find optimum storage conditions of the product for patient safety, and to avoid economic repercussions of launching an unstable product. The extract was exposed to three different conditions of high temperature and relative humidity (RH) for six months. The samples were then analyzed at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 months by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using pellitorine, sarmentine and sarmentosine as markers. Different chemical kinetic parameters of <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> were evaluated by Arrhenius equation to predict shelf life (t 90) at different storage conditions and at room temperature. <b>The</b> <b>markers</b> in <b>the</b> extract followed the zero order degradation, and the activation energy, pre exponential factor and rate constant of the reaction of <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> were found to be varying in samples stored at different conditions. The contents of <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> were found to be decreasing at high temperature and humidity with the passage of time. The predicted shelf life (t 90) of <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> at room temperature was found to be 16 months approximately. Results {{of this study indicate that}} extracts of the plant are stable at room temperature for 16 months. Moreover, the chemical kinetic data of <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> and <b>the</b> analytical method used to quantify <b>the</b> <b>markers</b> may be useful for phytopharmaceutical industry to produce efficacious and stable products from extracts of the plant...|$|R
