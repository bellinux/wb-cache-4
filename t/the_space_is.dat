5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>is</b> lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E
5|$|Linear maps V → W {{between two}} vector spaces form a vector space HomF(V, W), also denoted L(V, W). The space of linear maps from V to F {{is called the}} dual vector space, denoted V∗. Via the {{injective}} natural map , any vector space can be embedded into its bidual; the map is an isomorphism {{if and only if}} <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>is</b> finite-dimensional.|$|E

5|$|Comcast's {{office space}} was {{designed}} by Daroff Design + DDI Architects and Gensler. Comcast's space is topped by a conference room floor with the executive offices on the four floors below it. Below that are more offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>is</b> used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging from the open white space of the upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include a glass and stainless steel staircase that wraps around a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors.|$|E
5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>is</b> spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E
5|$|The Augustus {{opened in}} 2005 with 949 rooms, which were {{designed}} for more upscale luxury and service than {{the other parts of}} the resort. It is accessed through a private small lobby separate from the main Caesars' entrance. The rooms feature 9-foot ceilings with hotel chambers beginning at about , and going up to 2470 square feet for the largest suites. All feature spa tubs and televisions in the bathrooms. One of the highlights of <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>is</b> that the rooms view the Garden of the Gods pool area. On {{the second floor of the}} tower is a spa containing Roman baths of hot, cold and lukewarm pools; relaxing chaise longues sculpted of stone, which are underwater in the heated pool; and 51 separate therapy rooms. This tower, along with the Octavius Tower, forms a part of the 'Laurel Collection', Caesars boutique experience on the property. It features private elevator banks and exclusive Laurel Collection key cards.|$|E

50|$|Typically, when <b>the</b> sample <b>space</b> <b>is</b> finite, any {{subset of}} <b>the</b> sample <b>space</b> <b>is</b> an event (i.e. all {{elements}} of the power set of <b>the</b> sample <b>space</b> <b>are</b> defined as events). However, this approach does not work well in cases where <b>the</b> sample <b>space</b> <b>is</b> uncountably infinite (most notably when the outcome must be some real number).
