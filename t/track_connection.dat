5|$|The Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) {{would be}} {{acquired}} by the City and an embankment would be created with two bridges for the right-of-way over Jamaica Bay. To provide {{a connection to the}} rest of the subway system, a <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> would be built to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{line would}} have a <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> to the IRT Pelham Line at Third Avenue–138th Street {{and there would be}} a branch {{terminating}} at Third Avenue–149th Street to permit a transfer to the Third Avenue Elevated in the Bronx. This would allow for the elimination of the Third Avenue Elevated south of 149th Street.|$|E
5|$|On January 4, 2017, {{the office}} of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} a plan to renovate the entire airport {{at a cost of}} $7–10 billion. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> to the rest of New York City's transportation system. There would also be a rebuilding the Jamaica station so that there is a direct connection to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed start date for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for master plans to renovate the airport.|$|E
50|$|In fact, {{very few}} <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> exist {{to allow a}} train to reverse {{railroad}} direction without running around a loop or literally reversing direction by backing up. The IND system (except on the ex-LIRR Rockaway Line) has none of these; this philosophy may explain the lack of <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> between parallel IND lines at Seventh Avenue in Manhattan and Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets in Brooklyn.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of this station are <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> from both the express and local tracks to Jamaica Yard.|$|R

5|$|Three {{construction}} {{options were}} evaluated during the project's Environmental Impact Study for {{the portion of}} the line between 11th Street and Hanover Square. One option known as the Shallow Chrystie Option would mainly use cut and cover, while the Deep Chrystie Street and Forsyth Options would use a combination of tunneling by Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPBMs) and cut and cover. The Shallow Chrystie Option would have used the existing Confucius Plaza tunnel section between Canal and Division Streets, and like the plan from the 1970s, {{there would have been a}} cross-platform transfer to the existing Grand Street station, with the transfer expected to be heavily used. However, this option would require digging up Sara Delano Roosevelt Park to the east as Chrystie Street is not wide enough to fit four tracks. Under this option, a <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> would be built to allow trains from Second Avenue to run via the Manhattan Bridge north tracks to allow service to Brooklyn. The Forsyth Option would curve below the park to Forsyth Street and the station would be built under Forsyth Street, requiring a 200-foot transfer passageway that would be less convenient than the other options. The Deep Chrystie Option would have the Second Avenue Subway run deeper underground, running underneath the existing Grand Street station, with a mezzanine in between the two stations. In order to allow for sufficient room for stairways to transfer to the Second Avenue Line, the Grand Street station would be widened to have twenty foot wide platforms. No <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> would be built under this option, and the Confucius Plaza tunnel section would not be used for subway service, but it instead might be used for ancillary subway facilities. Currently, this is the preferred option.|$|E
25|$|There {{is still}} a <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> with the SNCF which is {{commonly}} used during the Steam Festival.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the three}} tracks end at bumper blocks at {{the west end of}} the platforms. Between the {{northbound}} local and the other tracks anywhere along the shuttle there is no <b>track</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though {{there are}} <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> between the four railways, they are seldom used; {{each has its}} own {{dedicated}} dead-end platform tracks.|$|R

25|$|The Canada Line, {{which was}} opened on August 17, 2009, runs {{underground}} through Vancouver and then along an elevated guideway with two branches, to Richmond and Vancouver International Airport. It meets the Expo Line at Waterfront Station in downtown Vancouver, {{but it is}} operationally independent {{and there is no}} <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> between them.|$|E
25|$|A {{long sought}} {{connection}} of train service between the Lackawanna Railroad's Montclair Branch and the Erie Railroad's New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad, which serviced five other stations in Montclair was first proposed in 1929 by the Regional Plan Association. However, the Great Depression shelved any plans {{to connect the}} lines. The plan continued to wane for several years until in 1963, when the old Boonton Branch was reconfigured at Mountain View in Wayne, New Jersey to the New York and Greenwood Lake, when revival plans returned. However, the connection {{continued to be a}} quiet subject until the late 1980s, when New Jersey Transit revived the proposal. A deal was struck with the township of Montclair in 1998, with a one <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> used for only diesel train sets. However, this proposal was changed into a double <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> with overhead electric catenary wires. Construction on the Montclair Connection began one year later and was completed on September 30, 2002.|$|E
25|$|The NYW {{crossed the}} New Haven at a joint station at Columbus Avenue in Mount Vernon. A ramp to the New Haven would have {{permitted}} NYW trains to run directly to Grand Central Terminal (GCT): provisions {{for such a}} ramp were designed into the overpass, but no <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> was constructed. The NH would have discouraged running trains into GCT, since it paid a rental fee to the NYC for each movement into the terminal.|$|E
25|$|At the new City station {{there were}} two {{platforms}} and either {{could be used by}} an arriving train, reversing in the platform. The <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> at the approach were a double slip, not a scissors, so a train could not leave while another was arriving. The left hand platform line was extended by a train length and trains could be stabled in the extension. A large diameter Greathead shield was used to bore the section of tunnel where the <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> would be installed.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} to serve three Metro-North lines (Hudson, Harlem and New Haven) via existing <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> that were not normally used for revenue passenger services.|$|R
25|$|The three subway {{lines are}} served by 678 cars grouped in trains of four cars on Line 4 Sheppard subway, and six cars on Line 1 Yonge–University and Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. The three subway lines share non-revenue <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> and use the same technology. The two {{versions}} of subway trains in use today are the new Toronto Rockets on Lines 1 and 4 and the T1s on Line 2. Line 3 Scarborough RT has a fleet of 28 S-series cars grouped into trains of four cars each, and is not compatible with other subway lines. It shares no <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> or equipment.|$|R
25|$|Moor Street {{station is}} 660 yards (600 metres) away from New Street station; the city's main railway station. There is a signposted route for {{passengers}} travelling between New Street and Moor Street stations which involves {{a short walk}} through a tunnel under the Bullring shopping centre. Although the railway lines into New Street pass directly underneath Moor Street station, there is no <b>track</b> <b>connection.</b> In 2013 a new direct walkway was opened between the two stations making interchange easier.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 1871, the PRR leased the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company, which {{included}} the original Camden and Amboy Railroad from Camden, New Jersey (across the Delaware River from Philadelphia) to South Amboy, New Jersey (across Raritan Bay from New York City), {{as well as a}} newer line from Philadelphia to Jersey City, New Jersey, much closer to New York, via Trenton, New Jersey. <b>Track</b> <b>connection</b> in Philadelphia was made via the PRR's Connecting Railway and the jointly owned Junction Railroad (Philadelphia).|$|E
25|$|The East 180th Street–Dyre Avenue Shuttle or Dyre Avenue Shuttle was {{established}} as a new subway service and full-time shuttle along this section on May 15, 1941, between the former East 180th Street station of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway and Eastchester–Dyre Avenue, which was the last station on the NYW within New York City. Passengers {{had to make a}} walking transfer between the Dyre Avenue Line and the IRT White Plains Road Line at East 180th Street as there was no <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> between the lines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Track</b> <b>connections</b> to {{the rest}} of the system were {{provided}} by the otherwise unused streetcar tracks under the Charlestown Elevated from Sullivan south to the Causeway Street Incline, once used by the 92.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{panel of}} a {{sectional}} door {{has its own}} connection to the door track. This increases reliability and robustness compared to monolithic doors, which {{have only a few}} <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> for the whole panel.|$|R
25|$|To {{the west}} of the station is a {{complicated}} track layout complete with <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> from the Fourth Avenue Line, ramps from the now-demolished Fifth Avenue El, and ramps from the 36th–38th Street Yard, combining together to form the six tracks and two levels of the station.|$|R
25|$|This {{station is}} the {{northern}} terminal of the IRT Lenox Avenue Line. There are two tracks and one island platform here. The tracks end at bumper blocks {{at the west}} end of the platform. Next to the station is Lenox Yard, which is used for train storage and has no maintenance facility. The yard predates the station, which was added in 1968 at a relatively low cost, since the yard and the <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> were already there. Formerly, the terminal was one station to the south, at 145th Street. Due to the high ceiling, platform service information signs are hung from heavy cables.|$|E
25|$|At Queensboro Plaza, the {{eastbound}} track (railroad north) {{is above}} the westbound track, with both tracks {{on the south side}} of the island platforms. On the north side of these platforms is the BMT Astoria Line. East of this point, both the Flushing Line and the Astoria Line were formerly operated by the IRT and the BMT, respectively. Connections still exist between the eastbound tracks just east of the platforms, but cannot be used for revenue service as BMT trains are wider than IRT trains. This is the only <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> between the Flushing Line and the rest of the subway system.|$|E
25|$|Rolling {{stock is}} stabled and {{maintained}} at the Cabot Yard near Broadway in South Boston. The connection to this yard {{is at the}} junction where the two branches split, near JFK/UMass. Trains are also stabled overnight at Braintree (Caddigan Yard) and Ashmont (Codman Yard), and at the stub tracks west of Alewife. Eliot Yard, on the surface near Harvard, served East Boston Tunnel (now Blue Line) cars {{for a short time}} and Red Line cars until it was demolished in the 1970s. (East Boston Tunnel cars accessed the yard through the now-closed Joy Street portal near Bowdoin and a <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> on the Longfellow Bridge).|$|E
50|$|At Dewey Square, the Union Freight Railroad {{continued}} {{north on}} Atlantic Avenue. Various <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> were provided to markets and docks on Boston Harbor. On {{the east side}} of the North End, the line merged onto Commercial Street, and turned west and continued along Causeway Street.|$|R
50|$|The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad also crossed {{through the}} area, moving north-south from its main line station at Cedar Falls, Washington, {{south to the}} large mill at Enumclaw, Washington. <b>Track</b> <b>connections</b> between the two roads {{were made to the}} north and south of town.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of the station is a {{complicated}} track layout complete with <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> from the Fourth Avenue Line, ramps from the now-demolished Fifth Avenue El, and ramps from the 36th-38th Street Yard, combining together to form the six tracks and two levels of the station.|$|R
25|$|East of Pitkin Avenue, the Canarsie Line {{enters the}} two-track {{elevated}} structure {{on which the}} line was originally grade-separated in 1906, entering Sutter Avenue station. At the next station, Livonia Avenue, the Livonia Avenue Elevated of the IRT New Lots Line passes overhead, and just beyond this point is a single <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> to the Linden Shops, which is now a track and structures facility. Besides the connection at Broadway Junction, this non-electrified yard connection is the only other connection {{to the rest of}} the subway system, as it is indirectly a connection to the New Lots Line. B Division-sized equipment cannot access this line, however, because of A Division width restrictions.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} obtain a {{terminal}} along the East River, the SSRLI asked the LIRR if a <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> could be made in Jamaica so that the LIRR's line {{could be used to}} Hunters Point. However, the LIRR refused and it stopped attempts by the South Side to use the Brpoklyn, Central and Jamaica Railroad and to purchase the New York and Flushing Railroad, which would have connected at Laurel Hill. Finally, South Eighth Street in Williamsburg was decided to be the terminal. Service was extended westward to Bushwick on July 18, 1868, and the line was completed to the East River on November 4, 1868. West of Bushwick, the cars were pulled by horses because the city of Brooklyn did not allow steam trains.|$|E
25|$|The current SEPTA Regional Rail {{station at}} Fern Rock Transportation Center, located along the SEPTA Main Line, {{was built in}} March 1992 to {{accommodate}} Regional Rail commuters displaced during SEPTA's 1992/1993 Railworks reconstruction project. The new station replaced former Reading Railroad stations Fern Rock and Tabor, respectively located {{north and south of}} the new station. It has high-level platforms and is handicap-accessible, being directly connected to the subway station by a ramp from the subway platform. While passengers can readily transfer between the Broad Street Line and the Regional Rail Lines at Fern Rock, such a transfer requires payment of a separate fare of the subway and regional rail, unless the rider possesses a SEPTA Trailpass, which can be used for travel on both subway and regional rail. A small <b>track</b> <b>connection</b> exists here between the SEPTA Regional Rail Lines and SEPTA's Broad Street Line.|$|E
5000|$|At its {{southern}} terminus, the Crenshaw Line's route will have direct <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> to the Green Line corridor. (The Metro Green Line already has an aerial [...] "wye" [...] junction built into it: {{this will allow}} Metro to connect the two corridors with minimal disruption to Green Line service.) ...|$|R
2500|$|On December 15, 1940, local subway service {{began on}} Sixth Avenue from the West Fourth Street subway station to the 47-50th Street subway station with <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> to the IND 53rd Street Line. The Sixth Avenue Line's {{construction}} cost $59,500,000. The following routes were added {{with the opening}} of service: ...|$|R
50|$|A level {{junction}} (or in the United Kingdom a flat crossing) is {{a railway}} junction {{that has a}} track configuration in which merging or crossing railroad lines provide <b>track</b> <b>connections</b> with each other that require trains to cross over in front of opposing traffic at grade (i.e. on the level).|$|R
