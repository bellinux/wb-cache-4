40|$|Oxalate oxidase (OXO) {{converts}} {{oxalic acid}} (OA) and O 2 to CO 2 and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), and {{acts as a}} source of H 2 O 2 in certain plant-pathogen interactions. To determine if the H 2 O 2 produced by OXO can function as a messenger for activation of defense genes and if OXO can confer resistance against an OA-producing pathogen, we analyzed <b>transgenic</b> <b>sunflower</b> (Helianthus annuus cv SMF 3) plants constitutively expressing a wheat (Triticum aestivum) OXO gene. The transgenic leaf tissues could degrade exogenous OA and generate H 2 O 2. Hypersensitive response-like lesion mimicry was observed in the transgenic leaves expressing a high level of OXO, and lesion development was closely associated with elevated levels of H 2 O 2, salicylic acid, and defense gene expression. Activation of defense genes was also observed in the transgenic leaves that had a low level of OXO expression and had no visible lesions, indicating that defense gene activation may not be dependent on hypersensitive response-like cell death. To further understand the pathways that were associated with defense activation, we used GeneCalling, an RNA-profiling technology, to analyze the alteration of gene expression in the transgenic plants. Among the differentially expressed genes, full-length cDNAs encoding homologs of a PR 5, a sunflower carbohydrate oxidase, and a defensin were isolated. RNA-blot analysis confirmed that expression of these three genes was significantly induced in the OXO <b>transgenic</b> <b>sunflower</b> leaves. Furthermore, treatment of untransformed sunflower leaves with jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, or H 2 O 2 increased the steady-state levels of these mRNAs. Notably, the <b>transgenic</b> <b>sunflower</b> plants exhibited enhanced resistance against the OA-generating fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum...|$|E
40|$|The sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., {{is one of}} the worldâ€™s major oilseed crops. Sunflower oil {{contains}} a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids than other vegetable oils and is therefore useful as a raw material in the production of biodiesel oil. The technology for processing sunflower oil into biodiesel oil has recently been developed; consequently, the importance of the sunflower is increasing. Despite the importance of this plant, effective methods for sunflower transformation have not yet been established. Although many {{attempts have been made to}} establish plant regeneration and gene transformation systems for the sunflower, only a limited number of reports have described successful transformation in this species. The transient expression of foreign genes, such as the GUS reporter gene, has been accomplished following the direct transfer of genes into sunflower protoplasts (Kirches et al. 1991) and particle bombardment into tissues (Schenk et al. 1999, 2001). In addition, transgenic calli and tumors containing the GUS gene have been obtained by direct gene introduction into protoplasts (Moyne et al. 1989) and infection of tissues with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Czarnecka et al. 1992). These methods, however, have not been used to successfully generate <b>transgenic</b> <b>sunflower</b> plants. Shoot regeneration systems have been used to produce <b>transgenic</b> <b>sunflower</b> plants. Specifically, transgenic shoots have been regenerated from mature, immature or germinated seeds infected with A. tumefacien...|$|E
40|$|Traditional plant {{breeding}} is often {{limited by the}} genetic diversity within a species. The use of biotech-nology allows introducing into a plant, specific traits that {{come from the same}} or another plant species. In this paper, we focus on tissue culture of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L., Asteraceae), particularly related to rooting <b>transgenic</b> <b>sunflower</b> plantlets. Sunflower is notoriously recalcitrant to genetic transformation and regeneration when subjected to tissue culture. Prior to 1985 there had only been four reports, as noted by Paterson and Everett (1985), of successful regeneration of sunflower plants in tissue culture. Although this report is more than 20 years old, sunflower continues to be a challenging species in tissue culture (Baker et al. 1999; Dhaka and Kothar...|$|E
30|$|Considerable {{evidence}} for the association of OXOs to resistance to fungal pathogens is available (Thompson et al. 1955; Zhou et al. 1998; Berna and Bernier 1999; Hu et al. 2003; Ramalingam et al. 2003; Livingstone et al. 2005). The barley HvOXO gene is expressed in the mesophyll tissue and {{the activity of the}} OXO enzyme increases in leaf extracts in response to Bgh, which may be a source of H 2 O 2 (Zhou et al. 1998). <b>Transgenic</b> <b>sunflower</b> and peanuts transformed with wheat OXO and HvOXO, respectively, exhibited enhanced resistance to Sclerotinia species (Hu et al. 2003; Livingstone et al. 2005). OXOs were also mapped to QTLs involved in fungal resistance in wheat and rice (Faris et al. 1999; Ramalingam et al. 2003; Friesen and Faris 2004; Wu et al. 2004). The results of this study further support the role of specific OXO genes in resistance. The presence of OXOs only in cereals provides an interesting speculation into the evolutionary process in which members of the cupin superfamily diversified after the divergence of monocots and dicots 200 millions years ago (Wolfe et al. 1989). It is probably likely that specialization into OXOs occurred after the divergence.|$|E
40|$|Sunflower {{improvement}} {{by conventional}} breeding is severely restricted by {{the availability of}} a rather limited gene pool owing to natural incompatibilities, even between related species, and by the time scale of most breeding programs. Therefore, much attention has been directed recently to the newly emerging and novel technologies of plant cell and molecular biology that provide a powerful means to supplement and complement the traditional methods of plant improvement. The concept of DNA-based markers has revolutionised our ability to direct access to any part of the plant genome, and has led to new opportunities such as map-based cloning and directed plant breeding. Efficient regeneration of fertile plants from cultured cells and protoplats, combined with novel methods of DNA delivery and selection of transformed cells, has resulted in the production of <b>transgenic</b> <b>sunflower.</b> Agronomically useful genes, which confer resistance to insect pests and pathogens, have been introduced. However, further molecular improvement of sunflower could be limited most by the lack of our knowledge about, and access to, important and useful genes (e. g., those controlling multigenic traits like yield, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses). Therefore, high priority should be given to the development of ultra high density (UHD) linkage maps and the development of new tools for high-throughput genome and expression analyses...|$|E
40|$|A partial {{sunflower}} cDNA clone, PLFOR 48, segregating with {{a resistance}} marker to Plasmopara halstedii, the causal agent of downy mildew, has been cloned from the mildew resistant sunflower line, RHA 266. PLFOR 48 encodes a putative protein with a nucleotide-binding site and a leucine-rich repeat domain, showing significant homology with previously cloned resistance genes {{belonging to the}} TIR-NBS-LRR family. Southern blot analysis of non-transgenic sunflower suggests that PLFOR 48 {{is part of a}} multigenic family. The potential role of PLFOR 48 sequence in sunflower resistance to mildew was studied, by assessing loss of function, using expression of the antisense cDNA in RHA 266 sunflower line. Quite unexpectedly, <b>transgenic</b> <b>sunflower</b> lines displayed severe developmental abnormalities, and in particular, on the main meristems of homozygote T 2 progeny, thus hampering any further challenge inoculation with Plasmopara halstedii. The presence of homologous sequences to PLFOR 48 in Nicotiana tabacum var Samsun NN, as demonstrated by Southern blotting, drove us to consider tobacco as an additional model to investigate the potential role of this sequence in fungal resistance. Expression of the same antisense cDNA in transgenic tobacco lines gave rise to higher degree of susceptibility to Phytophthora parasitica, as well as to severe alterations in seed development. These results suggest that PLFOR 48 and homologous sequences could be involved in both regulating developmental pathways and controlling resistance to fungal pathogens...|$|E
