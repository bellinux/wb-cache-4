25|$|The waiver, {{which can}} be granted after the {{completion}} of an eight-hour course, is required for outpatient treatment of opioid addiction with Subutex and Suboxone. Initially, the number of patients each approved physician could treat was limited to ten. This was eventually modified to allow approved physicians to treat up to a hundred patients with buprenorphine for opioid addiction in an outpatient setting. This limit was recently increased by the Obama administration, raising the number of patients to which doctors can prescribe to 275. Still, due to <b>this</b> <b>patient</b> limit and the requisite eight-hour training course, many continuing patients can find it very difficult to get a prescription, despite the drug's effectiveness.|$|E

2500|$|..... {{the first}} case [...] is clearly {{inconsistent}} {{with the possibility of}} infection , while the second case [...] remains strikingly unclear. Could ichor from <b>this</b> <b>patient</b> have been more damaging when conveyed in vaginal examinations to other patients {{than it would have been}} as a result of similar examinations carried out on <b>this</b> <b>patient</b> herself? In our hospital we have frequently recorded ichorous sores on the feet of delivering patients without having noticed any subsequent infections, either of those patients themselves or of other patients. Dr. Semmelweis places great emphasis on the better health of institutions exclusively for the education of midwives; he should consider that ichorous secretions occur equally in both institutions. Moreover, in an institution as large as the midwife clinic in Vienna, one or another of the patients must always be ill and so provide a source of infection. If the infection occurs as easily as he believes, this would reduce the inequality in mortality rates between the clinics.|$|E

2500|$|In one patient, the {{underlying}} cause for presumptive PAIS was a mutant steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) protein.

[...] A coactivator protein interacting with the activation function 1 (AF-1) transactivation domain of the androgen receptor may have been deficient in <b>this</b> <b>patient.</b> [...] The signal disruption could not be corrected by supplementation with any coactivators known at the time, nor was the absent coactivator protein characterized, which left some in the field unconvinced that a mutant coactivator would explain the mechanism of androgen resistance in CAIS or PAIS patients with a normal AR gene.|$|E

Renal components included acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and drug-associated injury from supratherapeutic tacrolimus levels (in {{part due to}} gastrointestinal disturbances and perhaps due to drug–drug interactions with fluconazole) leading to vasoconstriction and tubular toxicity. The ATN, a diagnosis supported {{by the presence of}} renal epithelial cells on urine microscopy, was conservatively treated with avoidance of further hypotension, ischemia, or low renal perfusion, and a reduction of calcineurin inhibitor therapy. The most surprising etiology of her AKI was postrenal, due to obstructive nephropathy from compression of the allograft ureter coincident with the cecal volvulus. Thus, several interventions were pursued to address <b>this</b> <b>patient’s</b> multifactorial allograft AKI.|$|R
