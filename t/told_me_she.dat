The situation soon became tense again; Richard de Mille, nephew of the famous director Cecil B. de Mille, recalled that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} turmoil and dissension in the Foundation at the time; he kept accusing Communists of trying to take control and he was having difficulties with Northrup. It was clear their marriage was breaking up – she was very critical of him and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was fooling around with Hollister and he didn't trust her." [...] Hubbard enlisted de Mille and another Dianeticist, Dave Williams, in an attempt to convince her to stay with him. John Sanborne, who worked with Hubbard for many years, recalled: ...|$|E

The song samples elements of [...] "Pony" [...] (1996), as performed by Ginuwine and written by Elgin [...] "Ginuwine" [...] Lumpkin, Stephen Garrett and Timothy [...] "Timbaland" [...] Mosley. In an interview with MTV News Ginuwine stated: [...] "You know what? My management <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> wanted to use it, and Rihanna, I'm a fan of hers and I love what she's doing.

And just when it was at its zenith a new play was launched with a new actress, who set the whole town raving over her beauty...."

2500|$|Jobs's {{biological}} mother Schieble became pregnant {{with him in}} 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer {{with his family in}} Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he [...] "was very much in love with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria. And so she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> wanted to give the baby up for adoption." [...] Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry. In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: [...] "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me ... {{she did not want to}} bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone." [...] Schieble put herself in the care of a [...] "doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions." ...|$|E
2500|$|North Carolina {{finished}} {{the regular season}} at 16–15, dropped to third in all-time wins, and bowed {{out in the first}} round of the ACC tournament. The Tar Heels did not receive a post-season tournament bid by the NCAA—the only time in Williams' coaching career that his team didn't take part in that tournament when eligible to do so. However, they did receive a bid to the NIT. The Tar Heels made it to the NIT championship game versus Dayton, which was played on April 1, 2010, at Madison Square Garden. The Tar Heels lost by a score of 79–68, bringing their overall tally to 20–17 for the 2009–10 season. This 20-win season however kept Williams' streak of 20-win seasons alive. Williams stated that the season was [...] "the biggest frustration and the biggest disappointment of my professional life". In addition to frustrating play, Williams was criticized for comparing the season to the disaster in Haiti by stating, [...] "Our massage therapist <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> said 'You know, Coach, what happened in Haiti is a catastrophe. What you're having is a disappointment.' And I told her that depends on which chair she was sitting in, because it does feel like a catastrophe to me, and that's because it is my life."

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
