5|$|After {{the rise}} of philosophy, history, prose and rationalism in the late 5th century BC, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to a {{conception}} of history which tried to exclude the supernatural (such as the Thucydidean history).

5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in <b>the</b> <b>myths,</b> was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which we hear little in <b>the</b> <b>myths,</b> seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E

5|$|Greek mythology is {{the body}} of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, {{concerning}} their gods and heroes, {{the nature of the}} world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices.

Modern scholars refer to and study <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.|$|E

40|$|This {{essential}} {{introduction to}} American studies examines <b>the</b> core foundational <b>myths</b> upon which <b>the</b> nation is based and which still determine discussions of US-American identities today.

5|$|In Northern Europe, Greek mythology {{never took}} the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature. The English {{imagination}} was fired by Greek mythology starting with Chaucer and John Milton and continuing through Shakespeare to Robert Bridges in the 20th century. Racine in France and Goethe in Germany revived Greek drama, reworking the ancient myths. Although during the Enlightenment of the 18th century reaction against Greek myth spread throughout Europe, <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> continued to provide {{an important source of}} raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for many of Handel's and Mozart's operas.|$|E
5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning of <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> {{was more important than}} elaborate storytelling.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th century, French trouvère (troubadour) Chrétien de Troyes, adapted many of <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> {{recounted in}} Ovid's Metamorphoses into Old French. However, de Troyes {{was not alone}} in making use of Ovid's material. Geoffrey Chaucer recounted the story in his {{unfinished}} work The Legend of Good Women and briefly alluded to the myth in his Troilus and Criseyde. John Gower included the tale in his Confessio Amantis. References to Philomela are common in the motets of the ars nova, ars subtilior, and ars mutandi musical eras of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that the Last Sonata, in B-flat major, is a farewell work in which Schubert faces his own death (somewhat analogous to <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> surrounding Mozart's Requiem); this is usually ascribed to the relaxed, meditative character which dominates the two opening movements. Death scenes are also associated, somewhat more explicitly, with the more tragic C minor Sonata; Charles Fisk, for example, mentions ghosts and a 'dance of death', in the outer movements. However, when judging from a biographical point of view, the notion that Schubert felt his imminent death {{at the time of}} composing the last sonatas is questionable.|$|E
5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor's {{version of the same}} or similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> about the gods and begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera and volcanic fallout may have inspired <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> of the Titanomachy in Hesiod's Theogony. The Titanomachy could {{have picked up}} elements of western Anatolian folk memory, as the tale spread westward. Hesiod's lines have been compared with volcanic activity, citing Zeus's thunderbolts as volcanic lightning, the boiling earth and sea as a breach of the magma chamber, immense flame and heat as evidence of phreatic explosions, among many other descriptions.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} role and significance of <b>the</b> ancient Greek <b>myth</b> of Prometheus in Western philosophy from Antiquity to today. Paying particular attention to its moral and existential meanings, an analysis of this in-depth investigation produces {{an overview of the}} exceptional array of <b>the</b> <b>myth’s</b> functions and themes. It demonstrates that the most significant functions of <b>the</b> Prometheus <b>myth</b> are its social, epistemic, ontological and moral functions and that <b>the</b> <b>myth’s</b> most significant themes are fire, rebellion, creation, human nature and ambiguity. The dissertation argues that this analysis brings to light meaningful information on two sides of a reference to the Prometheus myth: it reveals the nature, functions, themes and connotations of <b>the</b> <b>myth,</b> while information about these functions and themes provides access to fundamental meanings, moral statements and ontological concepts of the studied author. Based on its findings this work claims that, as in history, first, <b>the</b> Prometheus <b>myth</b> will still be meaningful in philosophy today; and second, that the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>myth’s</b> functions and themes will provide access to essential ideas underlying contemporary references to <b>the</b> <b>myth.</b> To prove <b>the</b> validity of these claims this thesis examines the contemporary debate on ‘human enhancement’. Advocates as well as opponents of enhancement make use of <b>the</b> Prometheus <b>myth</b> in order to support their arguments. Employing the acquired knowledge about <b>the</b> <b>myth’s</b> functions and themes, the dissertation analyses the references encountered. The results of this analysis confirm that <b>the</b> Prometheus <b>myth</b> still has a significant role in a contemporary philosophical context. They improve our understanding of the philosophical argument, ontological framework and ethics of the debate’s participants; and thus demonstrate that the information about <b>the</b> Prometheus <b>myth</b> acquired in this thesis is a useful means to reveal fundamental ideas and conceptualisations underlying contemporary (and possibly future) references to <b>the</b> <b>myth.</b> School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Exete...|$|R

5|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} Christianity did not curb {{the popularity of}} <b>the</b> <b>myths.</b> With the rediscovery of classical antiquity in the Renaissance, the poetry of Ovid became {{a major influence on}} the imagination of poets, dramatists, musicians and artists.* L. Burn, Greek Myths, 75 From the early years of Renaissance, artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, portrayed the Pagan subjects of Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Through the medium of Latin and the works of Ovid, Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as Petrarch, Boccaccio and Dante in Italy.|$|E
5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence.

She deliberately destroyed <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries.

5|$|Southey {{uses the}} poem to {{describe}} various superstitions and myths, {{with a heavy}} reliance on repetition of various themes that link <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> together.

Though the main character is purported to be a Muslim, the story actually takes place thousands of years before Islam, in ancient Babylon. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the strong morality within the work or the quality of the poetry.

5|$|The {{information}} available in Romania for the King Carol I Bridge in Cernavodă, {{as well as}} the results of scientists in France, say that <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> are pure fiction. First of all the Romanian government never finalised the construction contract with the company of Gustave Eiffel or with another foreign company, making the decision to build the bridge only with local companies. The Cernavodă Bridge was made entirely by Romanians, fulfilling the design of Anghel Saligny, which was also the supervisor of the site. In these conditions, not knowing if the contract will be approved, it is unlikely that a foreign company would build the whole superstructure of the bridge. On the other hand, in Austria–Hungary {{there was no need to}} construct a low bridge like the Faidherbe because of the trade routes on the Danube River.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>myths</b> {{and legends}} {{surrounding}} Cofresí {{fall into two}} categories: those portraying him as a generous thief or anti-hero and those describing him as overwhelmingly evil. A subcategory represents him as an adventurer, world traveler or womanizer. Reports by historians such as Tió of the pirate sharing his loot with the needy have evolved into a detailed mythology. These apologetics attempt to justify his piracy, blaming it on poverty, revenge or a desire to restore his family's honor, and portray Cofresí as a class hero defying official inequality and corruption. He {{is said to have}} been a protector and benefactor of children, women and the elderly, with some accounts describing him as a rebel hero and supporter of independence from imperial power.|$|E

5000|$|Mugambi is {{critical}} of Rudolf Bultmann's project of [...] "demythologisation", {{on the ground that}} hermeneutically, myth cannot be abstracted from the Gospel. Any attempt at 'demythologization' results in new myths. Instead of [...] "demythologization", Mugambi urges for [...] "remythologization." [...] He says of Bultmann, [...] "in (his) attempt to satisfy scientific positivism by denouncing myth (he) ends up destroying the reality of religion as a pillar of culture."
