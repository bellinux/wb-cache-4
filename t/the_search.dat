Brown and Batygin initially narrowed <b>the</b> <b>search</b> for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, a swath of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope.

40|$|In this paper, Differential Evolution (DE) that {{incorporates}} fuzzy control and k-nearest neighbors {{algorithm is proposed}} to tackle the economic load dispatch problem. To provide the self-terminating ability, a technique called Iteration Windows (IW) is introduced to govern the number of iteration in each <b>searching</b> stage during <b>the</b> optimization. The size of IW is controlled by a fuzzy controller, which uses the {{information provided by the}} k-nearest neighbors system to analyze the population during <b>the</b> <b>searching</b> process. <b>The</b> controller keeps controlling the IW till the end of <b>the</b> <b>searching</b> process.

40|$|We study power-law {{correlations}} {{properties of}} <b>the</b> Google <b>search</b> queries for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) component stocks. Examining the daily data of <b>the</b> <b>searched</b> terms {{with a combination}} of the rescaled range and rescaled variance tests together with the detrended fluctuation analysis, we show that <b>the</b> <b>searches</b> are in fact power-law correlated with Hurst exponents between 0. 8 and 1. 1. The general interest in the DJIA stocks is thus strongly persistent. We further reinvestigate the cross-correlation structure between <b>the</b> <b>searches,</b> traded volume and volatility of the component stocks using the detrended cross-correlation and detrending moving-average cross-correlation coefficients. Contrary to the universal power-law correlations structure of <b>the</b> related Google <b>searches,</b> <b>the</b> results suggest that there is no universal relationship between <b>the</b> online <b>search</b> queries and <b>the</b> analyzed financial measures.
