5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the perceptual influence structure of school teachers in school organizations and to investigate the relationship perceptions of penetration and spread of principals' influence with teachers' evaluation of <b>their</b> <b>colleague</b> group, task motivation, effectiveness of their educational activity and role expectation. The sample consisted of 53 school teachers. Main findings are as follows. First, teachers classified the principal centered influence style made their evaluation for <b>their</b> <b>colleague</b> group and effectiveness of their educational activity negatively. Second, teachers' perception on penetration of principals' influence correlated positively with their evaluation of <b>their</b> <b>colleague</b> group, effectiveness of their educational activity and role expectation. The high magnitude of correlations obtained was interpreted as supporting the importance of interaction among members in schools...|$|R

5|$|The Balgo {{community}} did {{not establish}} an art centre {{for more than}} ten years after <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> at Papunya, with artistic activities commencing when an adult education centre was opened in 1981. However once Warlayirti Artists was set up, the community went on to become one of Australia's most successful Indigenous art centres. Painting at the centre is a sociable, communal activity, and Susie Bootja Bootja would reguarlly collaborate with other painters, including her husband.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of the decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among those who}} were dismissed from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work to be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, {{at a party}} meeting, {{it was decided that}} {{administrative}} actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since {{only a small part of}} the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline <b>their</b> <b>colleagues.</b> Control over Literární noviny and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.|$|E

5|$|As {{dozens of}} newly {{unemployed}} professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> in the United States sought {{to provide assistance}} and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions, Bryn Mawr College in the United States and Somerville College at the University of Oxford in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.|$|E

5|$|Despite their travails, Rejewski and Zygalski had {{fared better}} than some of <b>their</b> <b>colleagues.</b> Cadix's Polish {{military}} chiefs, Langer and Ciężki, had also been captured by the Germans, {{as they tried to}} escape from France into Spain on the night of March 10–11, 1943 along with three other Poles: Antoni Palluth, Edward Fokczyński and Kazimierz Gaca. The first two became prisoners of war; the other three were sent as slave labourers to Germany, where Palluth and Fokczyński perished. Despite the varyingly dire circumstances in which they were held, none of them Stefan Mayer emphasizes betrayed the secret of Enigma's decryption, thus making it possible for the Allies to continue exploiting this vital intelligence resource.|$|E

By the next morning, there were several breakthroughs in the investigation: the body had been successfully identified as 28-year-old Dora Lange; an autopsy revealed she had been strangled, tortured, and possibly raped; and early toxicology reports found traces of lysergic acid and methamphetamine in her bloodstream. Martin, Rustin, and Quesada brief <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> with the new evidence.|$|E
5|$|On a cold, rainy Friday night, only 4,124 spectators paid {{to see the}} game, more to see {{players from}} the Philadelphia Eagles, the local American {{football}} team, play an exhibition basketball game against <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> from the Baltimore Colts before the NBA game started. The arena's capacity was over 8,000, and Warriors owner Eddie Gottlieb was infamous for exaggerating attendance numbers. Warriors home attendance had dropped from 7,000 in Chamberlain's rookie season to less than 5,000 in this, his third, season. College basketball had started offering doubleheaders during the Great Depression to provide customers value for their money. Fans had grown accustomed to watching two games, so doubleheaders in the NBA became common.|$|E
5|$|The two German governments {{promoted}} {{very different}} views of the border. The GDR saw it as the international frontier of a sovereign state– a defensive rampart against Western aggression. In Grenzer ("Border Guard"), a 1981 East German Army propaganda film, NATO and West German troops and tanks were depicted as ruthless militarists advancing towards East Germany. Border troops interviewed in the film described {{what they saw as}} the rightfulness of their cause and the threat of Western agents, spies and provocateurs. <b>Their</b> <b>colleagues</b> killed on the border were hailed as heroes and schoolchildren in East Berlin were depicted saluting their memorial.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce's {{health was}} {{continuing}} to fail, and he suffered further illnesses in 1824 and 1825. With his family concerned {{that his life}} was endangered, he declined a peerage and resigned his seat in Parliament, leaving the campaign {{in the hands of}} others. Thomas Clarkson continued to travel, visiting anti-slavery groups throughout Britain, motivating activists and acting as an ambassador for the anti-slavery cause to other countries, while Buxton pursued the cause of reform in Parliament. Public meetings and petitions demanding emancipation continued, with an increasing number supporting immediate abolition rather than the gradual approach favoured by Wilberforce, Clarkson and <b>their</b> <b>colleagues.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{in charge of}} ethnic and religious affairs in Guangdong said that the province had hired Uygurs, aged from 18 to 29, in May. A small group of Uyghurs arrived on 2 May, and workers at the factory remarked that {{relations between the two}} groups deteriorated as the number of Uyghurs increased. State media confirmed that all the workers were from Shufu County. China Labor Watch reported that workers at the Shaoguan factory, where the Uyghurs were employed, earned 28 yuan per day compared with 41.3 yuan in its factory in Shenzhen. They noted that rights of workers, Han and Uyghur alike, were frequently violated by verbal abuse from factory supervisors, unpaid overtime, poor dormitory conditions and illegal labour contracts. Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch said that low pay, long hours and poor working conditions combined with the inability to communicate with <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> exacerbated deeply held mistrust between the Han and Uyghurs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1951-1952 season, the TSO {{refused to}} renew the {{contracts}} of these musicians, stating that they had not fulfilled their contractual agreements. The six musicians appealed this decision to its union, the Toronto Musicians' Association; the Mayor of Toronto; the Canadian Civil Liberties Association; and many other bodies, without success. They received support from the Federation of Canadian Artists and the Canada Council for the Arts, but not from the Canadian Congress of Labour. The incident garnered extensive media coverage in both Canada and the United States, and sparked a protest against the TSO's decision. The orchestra's director, Ernest MacMillan, did not speak about the matter in public, which also prompted criticism, and two members of the TSO board resigned. The six musicians were viewed with suspicion by <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> and people avoided them to protect themselves from guilt by association. Budd and Staryk later returned to the TSO, while the four other musicians continued their careers elsewhere.|$|E
