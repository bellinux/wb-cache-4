5000|$|Older {{children}} {{tend to be less}} jealous than <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> sibling. [...] This is due {{to their}} ability to mentally process the social situation in a way that gives them more positive, empathetic feelings toward <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> sibling. Older children are better able to cope with their jealous feelings toward <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> sibling due to their understanding of the necessary relationship between the parent and younger sibling. Older children are also better at self-regulating their emotions and are less dependent on their caregivers for external regulation as opposed to <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings.Younger siblings' feelings of jealousy are overpowered by feelings of anger. The quality {{of the relationship between the}} younger child and the older child is also a factor in jealousy, as the better the relationship the less jealous feelings occurred and vice versa.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the schooling of girls on the education of <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings. In order to examine the causal impact of the education of older children on <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings, we take advantage of a stipend program targeted towards girls, but not boys of the same cohort. The program causes exogenous variation in schooling of girls which enable us to estimate {{the effects of the}}ir education on the education of <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings. We find that the education of older siblings has a significant positive effect on the schooling of <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings. The results suggest that an additional year of schooling of older siblings increases the schooling of <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings by about 0. 13 years. The stipend program can account about a 10 per cent increase in the schooling of younger siblings. The results suggest that such programs could bring both short- and long-term gains, not only via direct benefits to the affected children, but also via indirect benefits to their siblings...|$|R
5|$|Living mammal {{species can}} be {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} sweat glands, including those that are specialized to produce milk to nourish <b>their</b> <b>young.</b> In classifying fossils, however, other features must be used, since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils.|$|E
5|$|The mothers raise <b>their</b> <b>young</b> without {{aid from}} adult males. When the pups are {{about two months}} old and their coats grow in, their mother {{introduces}} them to the water. Otters are natural swimmers and, with parental supervision, they acquire {{the skills necessary to}} swim.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents also}} took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, the chick {{was covered with}} grey down. The young bird took {{only two or three}} weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for <b>their</b> <b>young</b> after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with <b>their</b> <b>young</b> perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|E

5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of <b>their</b> <b>young.</b> Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|A female may lay {{from several}} dozen to several {{thousand}} eggs during her lifetime, {{depending on the}} extent of parental care. This ranges from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf, to the parental care provided by scarab beetles, which house, feed and protect <b>their</b> <b>young.</b> The Attelabidae roll leaves and lay their eggs inside the roll for protection.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigates how {{elderly patients}} in Libya interact and communicate institutionally with younger physicians. In communities {{such as that}} in Sebha, Libya (Bedouin, Arab and Muslim) elderly people have important social status and power. Naturally occurring conversations between three elderly patients and <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> physicians were tape-recorded separately. The subjects were also interviewed. Conversation Analysis combined with social constructionist theories was employed {{as a method of}} data analysis. The analysis of the interviews shows that elderly patients and <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> physicians (subjects) perceive each other socially rather than institutionally. Younger physicians insist that they cannot practice their institutional concessions when the patients are elderly. They cannot produce interruption, overlap or verbal refusal. In comparison, elderly subjects suggest that they perceive <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> physicians like <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> sons. The analysis of the naturally occurring conversations reveals that elderly patients and younger physicians call each other as social actors (son/hajj or uncle) rather than institutional ones (doctor/sir). Elderly patients and younger physicians could not raise sexual topics or directly name sexual organs (e. g. rectum) related to the elderly patient's case. Moreover, elderly patients address <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> physicians with proverbs and religious expressions when describing their cases. The conversations’ exchange of turns was not thoroughly task-oriented. Rather, elderly patients address <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> physicians with social conversations (e. g. where are you from? Who is your cousin? Where do you live?). Elderly patient interactants manipulated the conversations’ time-span. Furthermore, they employed the least preferable repair strategy. This research concludes that elderly patients in Libya interact and communicate with <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> physicians in accordance to their social construction which shows prevalence over the institutional hierarchy of the interactants...|$|R

5|$|A {{nematode}} (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) {{causes the}} black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. The parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant, {{causing them to}} carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as Hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. The droppings of the bird are collected by other ants and fed to <b>their</b> <b>young,</b> leading to further spread of the nematode.|$|E
5|$|Adult solitary wasps {{spend most}} of their time in {{preparing}} their nests and foraging for food for <b>their</b> <b>young,</b> mostly insects or spiders. Their nesting habits are more diverse than those of social wasps. Many species dig burrows in the ground. Mud daubers and pollen wasps construct mud cells in sheltered places. Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from mud, often with multiple cells, attached to the twigs of trees or against walls.|$|E
5|$|Adults and <b>their</b> <b>young</b> may be preyed upon by mammals {{such as the}} {{feral cat}} (Felis catus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes), as well as rodent species, and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), and shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.), and {{reptiles}} such as goannas (Varanus spp.).|$|E

5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call <b>their</b> <b>young</b> by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and <b>their</b> <b>young</b> are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E
5|$|At nest sites, battles {{sometimes}} {{occur between}} {{two or more}} pairs before the original owners declare themselves {{as the owner of}} the nest. Red-billed tropicbirds are aggressive at nest sites, fighting with each other and ousting species such as shearwaters, petrels, and white-tailed tropicbirds. They have also been recorded taking over nests of white-tailed tropicbirds and raising <b>their</b> <b>young</b> if they failed to destroy their eggs. Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds have been implicated in egg loss in red-tailed tropicbird nests in Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Black-shouldered kites are {{generally}} silent, {{except in the}} breeding season when their calls, though weak, can be persistent. They primarily utter clear whistled 'chee, chee, chee' calls in flight and while hovering, or a hoarse wheezing 'skree-ah' when perched. The call has been confused {{with that of a}} silver gull. A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while a harsh scraping call is the most common call used by females and large young, and brooding females call to <b>their</b> <b>young</b> with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have <b>their</b> <b>young</b> between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; <b>their</b> <b>young</b> cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E
5|$|Burying beetles are {{attentive}} parents, {{and participate}} in cooperative care and feeding of their offspring.

The parents prepare the carcass and protect it from competitors and from early decomposition. After their eggs hatch, the parents keep the larvae clean of fungus and bacteria and help the larvae feed by regurgitating food for them.|$|E
