40|$|It {{is shown}} that the orientational {{structure}} of intermediate smectic phases can be determined using the symmetry properties of the general free energy with arbitrary orientational coupling between smectic layers, without addressing a particular model. The structure of <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layer</b> intermediate phases, obtained in this way, corresponds to experimental data. The same method enables one to predict the structure of intermediate phases with periodicity of five and six layers, which have not been observed experimentally so far. The resonant X-ray spectra of the five- and six-layer intermediate phases with predicted structure have also been calculated. These spectra are characterized {{by a number of}} features which enable one to distinguish five-layer and six-layer intermediate phases from phases with smaller periods...|$|E
40|$|Approximately {{quantitative}} {{values are}} presented on the mineral {{content of the}} clay and silt fractions of marine sediments from the Wadden Sea. Considering the extent of clay mineral transformation and neoformation in a marine environment, it {{is believed to be}} insignificant, because of the sea water and pore solutions of the sediments seem to represent - {{with the exception of a}} small Mg-surplus - a kind of equilibrium solution for <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layer</b> minerals, which neither favors a considerable base fixation nor base release. Therefore, illite neoformation during halmyrolysis or early diagenesis seems to be impossible, especially because of unfavourable relations of potassium to all other cations in the sea water. Obviously the neoformation of illite takes place only during later diagenetic stages. The processes of clay mineral neoformation in a marine environment are probably restricted to the formation of amorphous (Mg-) Fe-Si-particles which may be first steps in the formation of chamosites, chlorites or smectites...|$|E
40|$|A {{major concern}} in {{assessing}} the structural condition of existing flexible pavements is the estimation of the mechanical properties of constituent layers, which is useful for the design and decision-making process in road management systems. This parameter identification problem is truly complex due to {{the large number of}} variables involved in pavement behavior. To this end, non-conventional adaptive or approximate solutions via Artificial Neural Networks – ANNs – are considered to properly map pavement response field measurements. Previous investigations have demonstrated the exceptional ability of ANNs in layer moduli estimation from non-destructive deflection tests, but most of the reported cases were developed using synthetic deflection data or hypothetical pavement systems. This paper presents further attempts to back-calculate layer moduli via ANN modeling, using a database gathered from field tests performed on <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layer</b> pavement systems. Traditional layer structuring and pavements with a stabilized subbase were considered. A three-stage methodology is developed in this study to design and validate an “optimum” ANN-based model, i. e., the best architecture possible along with adequate learning rules. An assessment of the resulting ANN model demonstrates its forecasting capabilities and efficiency in solving a complex parameter identification problem concerning pavements. </p...|$|E

The local energy of such Galilean fermions is sensitive to the intrinsic curvature of the surface. We discuss the relationship between two-dimensional pseudospin and the different energy bands. An interpretation of the theory is given in terms of massless fermions in an effective 4 D spacetime, {{and in this case}} the pseudospin is related to four dimensional chirality.

How can a client {{be sure that the}} cloud has performed inference correctly? A lazy cloud provider might use a simpler but less accurate model to reduce its own computational load, or worse, maliciously modify the inference results sent to the client. We propose SafetyNets, a framework that enables an untrusted server (the cloud) to provide a client with a short mathematical proof of the correctness of inference tasks that they perform on behalf of the client.

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} {{has been}} used to study the structure and dynamics of methane in hydrated sodium montmorillonite clays under conditions encountered in sedimentary basins. Systems containing approximately one, two, three and four molecular layers of water have followed gradients of 150 bar km- 1 and 30 Kkm- 1, to a maximum burial depth of 6 km (900 bar and 460 K). Methane is coordinated to approximately 19 oxygen atoms, of which typically 6 are provided by the clay surface. Only in the <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layer</b> hydrates is methane able to leave the clay surface. Diffusion depends strongly on the porosity (water content) and burial depth: self-diffusion coefficients are in the range 0. 12 × 10 - 9 m 2 s- 1 for water and 0. 04 × 10 − 9 m 2 s− 1 < D < 8. 64 × 10 − 9 m 2 s− 1 for methane.

The displacement field is expanded along the thickness direction {{in a complete}} polynomial series with arbitrary degree whereas the series coefficients, function of the in-plane coordinates, are expressed, according to Ritz method, as a superposition of admissible functions. Expressing the energy functionals {{in terms of the}} generalized coordinate, the expressions of the elastic and geometric stiffness matrices are obtained. The problem is suitably nondimensionalized so as to single out the independent parameters affecting the buckling behaviour. The convergence properties of the adopted discretization scheme are investigated first considering simply supported orthotropic three-layer symmetric composite plates under a transverse distributed load. It is shown that higher-order terms in the thickness direction are needed for convergence. Variations of the lowest buckling loads with the width-to-thickness ratio and with the ratio between the in-plane elastic moduli are also investigated to ascertain the sensitivity of the buckling behavior with respect to these parameters.

40|$|The only direct {{evidence}} of past life {{is provided by}} fossils. Fossils {{tell us about the}} evolution of life on Earth and they give us clues concerning ancient environments. The Ediacaran Period (roughly 635 - 542 million years ago) is characterised by the appearance and diversification of various microbiota and also the diversification of metazoans. Well-preserved organic-walled microfossils referred to as acritarchs occur abundantly in Ediacaran sedimentary successions in the Officer Basin in South Australia. Acritarch assemblages from the Giles 1 and Murnaroo 1 drillcores show a wide morphological disparity and are taxonomically diverse. Assemblages change over short stratigraphic intervals which enables the recognition of different biozones. The presence of taxa common between Australia, Siberia, Baltica and China provides a means for global correlation of the Ediacaran System. Examination of the wall ultrastructure of several acritarch specimens by use of transmission electron microscopy reveals a complexity in the cell wall that is not seen in prokaryotes but is indicative in some cases of particular clades of microalgae. Wall ultrastructures range from single-layered to <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layered</b> <b>and</b> from homogeneous to porous. The wall ultrastructure can be used to assess biological affinities and the affinities of the studied taxa in relation to green algae, dinoflagellates and metazoans are discussed. However, before taxonomic interpretations can be made with confidence, an understanding of taphonomic degradation of microorganisms is required. With focus on illustrated specimens, one part of this thesis explains what happens to an acritarch as it undergoes various types of degradation and why an understanding of these processes is important for taxonomic identification. A meteorite impact in South Australia spread an ejecta layer over a 550 km radius area.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{accurate}} models currently used to represent the gravity field of irregular bodies is the polyhedral approach. In this model, {{the mass of the}} body is assumed to be homogeneous, which may not be true for a real object. The main goal of the present paper is to study the dynamical effects induced by three different internal structures (uniform, <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layers)</b> of asteroid (21) Lutetia, an object that recent results from space probe suggest being at least partially differentiated. The Mascon gravity approach used in the present work, consists of dividing each tetrahedron into eight parts to calculate the gravitational field around the asteroid. The zero-velocity curves show that the greatest displacement of the equilibrium points occurs in the position of the E 4 point for the <b>four-layers</b> structure <b>and</b> the smallest one occurs in the position of the E 3 point for the three-layers structure. Moreover, stability against impact shows that the planar limit gets slightly closer to the body with the four-layered structure. We then investigated the stability of orbital motion in the equatorial plane of (21) Lutetia and propose numerical stability criteria to map the region of stable motions. Layered structures could stabilize orbits that were unstable in the homogeneous model. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, and 4 Tables. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Video {{microscopy}} {{is employed}} {{to study the}} melting behaviors of multilayer colloidal crystals composed of diameter-tunable microgel spheres confined between two walls. We systematically explore film thickness effects on the melting process and on the phase behaviors of single crystal and polycrystalline films. Thick films (> 4 layers) are observed to melt heterogeneously, while thin films (≤ 4 layers) melt homogeneously, even for polycrystalline films. Grain-boundary melting dominates other types of melting processes in polycrystalline films thicker than 12 layers. The heterogeneous melting from dislocations is found to coexist with grain-boundary melting in films bewteen 5 - and 12 -layers. In dislocation melting, liquid nucleates at dislocations and forms lakelike domains embedded in the larger crystalline matrix; the “lakes” are observed to diffuse, interact, merge with each other, and eventually merge with large strips of liquid melted from grain boundaries. Thin film melting is qualitatively different: thin films homogeneously melt by generating many small defects which need not nucleate at grain boundaries or dislocations. For <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layer</b> thin films, different layers are observed {{to have the same}} melting point, but surface layers melt faster than bulk layers.

Two-, <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layer</b> models were used to simulate a series of low-incidence-energy HREEL spectra (1. 25 - 10 eV). An abrupt charge profile (the two-layer model) provided good agreement with experimental data when spatial dispersion and wavevector-dependent plasmon damping were included in the local dielectric model. This was {{in spite of the fact}} that the two-layer model does not accurately reflect the charge distribution, which was calculated using the modified Thomas-Fermi approximation (MTFA). Smoothing of the step profile by the inclusion of an intermediate layer (the three layer model) introduced 'plasmaron' modes, unless the plasma damping in the middle layer was set to a very high level. These modes were not observed experimentally, indicating that the abrupt charge profile in fact produced more accurate simulations. A four-layer model more closely approximating the calculated charge profile produced superior fits to the experimental spectra, but only when the plasma damping in each layer was carefully controlled. The limitations of step profile approximations and the local dielectric theory approach in describing regions of highly non-uniform charge density are discussed. In particular, the spatial and wavevector dependence of the plasmon damping is considered...|$|E

40|$|A general phenomenological {{description}} {{and a simple}} molecular model is proposed for the 'discrete' flexoelectric effect in tilted smectic liquid crystal phases. This effect defines a polarization in a smectic layer induced by a difference of director orientations in the two smectic layers adjacent to it. It is shown that the 'discrete' flexoelectric effect is determined by electrostatic dipole-quadrupole interaction between positionally correlated molecules located in adjacent smectic layers, while the corresponding dipole-dipole interaction is responsible for a coupling between polarization vectors in neighboring layers. It is shown that a simple phenomenological model of a ferrielectric smectic liquid crystal, which has recently been proposed in the literature, {{can be used to}} describe the whole sequence of intermediate chiral smectic C* phases with increasing periods, and to determine the nonplanar structure of each phase without additional assumptions. In this sequence the phases with <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layer</b> periodicities have the same structure, as observed in the experiment.

40|$|A {{series of}} liquid crystal {{mixtures}} displaying wide <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layer</b> intermediate phases are reported. The mixtures are formed from a selenium-containing antiferroelectric material combined {{with up to}} 9 % (by weight) of a chiral dopant. We describe physical properties including spontaneous polarization, layer spacing and tilt for mixtures including up to 9 % concentration of the chiral dopant. Such measurements offer an insight into the factors that affect {{the stability of the}} intermediate smectic phases. However, a quantitative measure of the interlayer interaction strength can be obtained from analysis of field-temperature phase diagrams. Therefore, the field-temperature phase diagrams are also determined in the intermediate phase regime of the mixtures containing up to 5 % w/w concentration of the chiral dopant and compared with theoretical predictions. Excellent agreement with the theory is observed for the pure material, though for mixtures with increasing concentrations of chiral dopant, deviations from the theory are recorded, in particular {{in the nature of the}} transition from the four-layer structure to the three-layer structure. Quantitative measurements of the interlayer interaction constants are deduced from the gradients of the field thresholds, and the interlayer pairing is found to reduce significantly with an increasing concentration of chiral dopant. An interlayer interaction constant of 147 ± 13 N m- 2 K- 1 is found in the pure material, reducing to 21 ± 4 N m- 2 K- 1 in the mixture with concentration of chiral dopant of 5 %. Measurement of the interlayer interaction constants from the field-temperature phase diagrams is shown to give a quantitative understanding of the importance of the interlayer interaction, which is only indicated qualitatively by other measurements.

The one of main problems for creation the neuron networks is determination of their optimal structures size (amount of layers in network and count of neurons in each layer). The method of neuron network size optimization intended for classification of GTE technical state is considered in the article. Optimization is cared out with taking into account of overlearning effect possibility when a learning network loses property of generalization and begins strictly describing educational data set. To determinate a moment when overlearning effect is appeared in learning neuron network the method  of three data sets is used. The method is based on the comparison of recognition quality parameters changes which were calculated during recognition of educational and control data sets. As the moment when network overlearning effect is appeared the moment when control data set recognition quality begins deteriorating but educational data set recognition quality continues still improving is used. To determinate this moment learning process periodically is terminated and simulation of network with education and control data sets is fulfilled. The optimization of two-, <b>three-</b> <b>and</b> <b>four-layer</b> networks is conducted and some results of optimization are shown. Also the extended educational set is created and shown.

The samples were grown by MBE and MOVPE. The photoreflectance spectra {{from a number of}} In gGa gAs layers with thicknesses from lOOA to 8000 A grown on GaAs substrates were measured. They showed clear, well defined structures attributed to the splitting of the valence band into the Mj=+/- 3 / 2,+/-l/ 2 manifolds. Their separation was observed to decrease and their overall position to move to lower energy with increasing thickness. Complex GaAs substrate structures were also observed whose shape was attributed to interference. The spectra were modelled using a Kramers-Kronig transformation to deduce the number, magnitude and broadening of the oscillators needed for a least-squares fit using Aspnes' third derivative functional form for a 3 d critical point. Excellent fits were obtained which are unrivalled in previous PR analysis. The position of the strained split structures corresponded well with the measured strain from x-ray analysis and theory. From these splittings, values of the axial deformation potential, b, were obtained in the range - 2. 5 to - 1. 54 eV. The photoreflectance from the single quantum wells showed clear, complex spectra. Good fits were obtained using the third derivative functional form (TDFF) for a 2 d critical point. Both symmetry allowed and forbidden transitions were observed. The predicted transitions were calculated using an effective mass formalism. Reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed confined transition energies was found. The band offsets were estimated by allowing the theoretical offsets, determined from the theory of Van der Walle, to vary until a good match with observed transitions was obtained.
