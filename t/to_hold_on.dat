5|$|In 1944, led by {{standout}} halfback Bill Paschal, whose 737 {{rushing yards}} and 54 points led the team, the Giants reached {{the championship game}} where they faced the Green Bay Packers {{for the third time}} in 10 seasons.

The brigade plan was now a day behind schedule, although with the unexpected ease experienced by the Canadians, overall, the divisional attack was still running according to plan.

The fire from rifles and bombs was very heavy all day, and it was due to the skilful disposition made, and the example and encouragement shown by Lt. Bruce that his men were able to hold out until dusk, when the trench was finally captured by the enemy.|$|E

5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on.</b> Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|Although his Test {{career had}} finished, Loxton {{continued}} to play for his state. He had another disappointing season with the bat in 1951–52, scoring only 322 runs at 24.76 in nine matches. After winning the opening match of the season against Western Australia, he did not taste victory again until the final fixture of the summer against South Australia, in which he scored 71—his only fifty of the season—and took a total of 4/37 in an innings victory. Victoria lost three times and would have suffered a fourth defeat but for Loxton’s unbeaten 41 against Queensland, which helped them <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> for a draw with one wicket intact. He continued to take regular wickets, ending with 21 scalps at 31.00 for the season, including an innings best of 4/56, but he managed a total of only 4/249 against New South Wales, {{who went on to}} win the competition.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him {{of some of his}} pace. Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> to the ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{struggled}} {{in the three}} representative matches against India. Hassett made 53 in the first match in Mumbai, and although the Australians took a 192-run first innings lead, the hosts managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> for a draw. The second match in Calcutta was an evenly-contested draw, before India won the deciding match. Hassett top-scored with 143 in Australia’s 339, but the hosts took a first innings lead of 186 {{to set up a}} six-wicket win. Hassett ended with 235 runs at 47.00 in the three international matches, but did not taste victory in any of his seven matches on Indian soil. He scored 57 as Australia defeated Ceylon by an innings in Colombo before returning to Australia mid December. As time had passed, the players had become increasingly tired by the long campaign, and morale began to drop as waited for their return to their families and civilian life.|$|E
5|$|First-team coach Ronnie Moran {{took charge}} of team affairs for several weeks before Graeme Souness was named as Dalglish's successor. Under Souness, Liverpool won the FA Cup in 1992, but nothing else. He made way for Roy Evans, who also won just one trophy, the League Cup, before Gérard Houllier was {{appointed}} joint manager with Evans in 1998. This arrangement lasted only 18 games before Evans resigned, leaving Houllier—Liverpool's first non-British manager—in sole charge. Houllier won nothing until a treble in 2001, consisting of the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season, but the squad was unaffected and managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> to a second-place finish. Although Phil Thompson stepped in as temporary manager while Houllier was recovering from heart surgery, the matches played under Thompson are included in Houllier's record. Another League Cup was won in 2003, but {{this was to be}} Houllier's last trophy as Liverpool manager as he and the club parted by mutual consent {{at the end of the}} 2003–04 season, to be replaced by Valencia manager, Rafael Benítez.|$|E
5|$|For the 1980 Grand Prix season, the Yamaha factory {{made the}} Yamaha USA team of Roberts and Carruthers {{the de facto}} factory racing team. The season got {{underway}} two months late due to cancellation of Austrian and Venezuelan rounds. Barry Sheene {{had been replaced by}} Randy Mamola as the top Suzuki rider as, Sheene had been dissatisfied with the Suzuki's efforts and had turned to a privateer Yamaha team. Roberts won the first three races as the Suzuki team appeared to be in disarray, but by the third race, the Suzukis of Mamola and Marco Lucchinelli were making things more difficult for Roberts. Roberts' Yamaha suffered a deflating front tire and a faulty rear shock absorber in the Netherlands forcing him {{to pull out of the}} race, but his main championship rivals also suffered setbacks with Cecotto, Ferrari and Hartog all missing races due to injuries and Sheene suffering mechanical breakdowns. Suzuki riders went on to win the last four races, but Roberts had built up a sufficient point lead <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> and clinch his third consecutive 500cc world championship.|$|E
