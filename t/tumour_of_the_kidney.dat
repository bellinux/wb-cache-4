50|$|Considerable {{debate has}} been focused on whether AT/RTs are the same as rhabdoid <b>tumours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> (i.e., just extra-renal MRTs (malignant rhabdoid tumours)).

This observation is not surprising because rhabdoid tumours at both locations possess similar histologic, clinical, and demographic features.

Methods In the current study we applied various techniques, including Affymetrix microarray hybridization and semiquantitative RT-PCR, to identify genes expressed differentially in renal oncocytomas. Subsequently, we used RACE and Northern blot hybridization to characterize the potential candidates for molecular diagnosis. Results We have identified new isoform of DLG 2 gene, which contains 3 '-end exons of the known DLG 2 gene along with the hypothetical gene FLJ 37266.

40|$|Background. Mucinous tubular and {{spindle cell}} {{carcinoma}} (MTSCC) {{is a rare}} type of renal cell carcinoma, whose clinical behaviour and metastatic potential have not been fully elucidated to date. There {{are only a few}} metastatic cases in the literature, which all either featured sarcomatoid differentiation or were synchronously metastasised at diagnosis. Case Presentation. We report a case of a 49 -year-old male with end-stage kidney disease on dialysis, presenting with multiple osseous metastases of a mucin-poor variant <b>of</b> MTSCC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney,</b> without sarcomatoid differentiation, two years after bilateral nephrectomy for papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at a curable stage.

Conclusions. It is proposed that MTSCC can be associated with end-stage renal disease and that particularly the mucin-poor variant is easily confused with papillary renal cell carcinoma, as happened in this case. Although it is considered as a relatively indolent malign entity, it can metastasise even years after successful primary surgical treatment.
