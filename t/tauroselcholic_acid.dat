40|$|Background In 2012, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) {{assessed}} guidance (DG 7) {{on the use}} of <b>tauroselcholic</b> (75 selenium) <b>acid</b> (also {{known as}} SeHCAT) for the investigation of diarrhoea due to bile acid malabsorption (BAM) in patients with IBS-D and in patients with Crohnâ€™s disease who have not had an ileal resection. NICE concluded that <b>tauroselcholic</b> (75 selenium) <b>acid</b> was recommended for use in research only. NICE will be reviewing the decision to update the guidance for <b>tauroselcholic</b> (75 selenium) <b>acid,</b> for these populations, in March 2017. Aim Our aim is to summarise advances in BAM, also known as bile acid diarrhoea (BAD), and encourage clinicians to re-evaluate their understanding of this disorder. Approach We review the prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of BAD/BAM. We describe the new evidence available since the original NICE review in 2012, and discuss the economic issues associated with failure to diagnose or to treat BAD/BAM accurately. Evidence update There is new and compelling evidence available since DG 7, which shows that <b>tauroselcholic</b> (75 selenium) <b>acid</b> scanning is a powerful tool in the diagnosis of BAD/BAM. We summarise published prevalence data (approximately 1...|$|R
