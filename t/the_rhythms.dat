5|$|Kulintang {{music has}} no set {{compositions}} {{due to its}} concept of rhythmic modes. A rhythmic mode (or designation or genre or pattern) {{is defined as a}} musical unit that binds together the entire five instrument ensemble. By adding together the various rhythms of each instrument, one could create music and by changing one of <b>the</b> <b>rhythms,</b> one could create different music. This is the basis of the rhythmic mode.|$|E
5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} <b>the</b> <b>rhythms</b> of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound may have come from an attempt to imitate the African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|Hip hop is a {{cultural}} movement, of which music is a part, along with graffiti and breakdancing. The music is composed of two parts, rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals, and DJing, the production of instrumentation either through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism or beatboxing. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc {{is widely regarded as}} the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him the practice of toasting over <b>the</b> <b>rhythms</b> of popular songs. In New York, DJs like Kool Herc played records of popular funk, disco and rock songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the songs and keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion breaks (the rhythmic climax of songs), thus producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over.|$|E

5|$|Hip hop is a {{cultural}} movement, of which music is a part. Hip hop music {{for the most part}} is itself composed of two parts: rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals; and DJing and/or producing, the production of instrumentation through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism, or beatboxing, the production of musical sounds through vocalized tones. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc is widely regarded as the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him from Jamaica the practice of toasting over <b>the</b> <b>rhythms</b> of popular songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the soul, funk, and R songs that the DJs played, and to keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion break of songs (when the rhythm climaxes), producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over.|$|E
5|$|Mini Metro is {{a puzzle}} {{strategy}} video game developed by indie development team Dinosaur Polo Club. Players are tasked with constructing an efficient rail transit network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Stations are represented by differently shaped nodes and players can build tracks to connect them by drawing lines. Levels are based on real cities {{and the appearance of}} stations and passengers is procedurally generated. The game's visual style makes use of bold colours and simple geometry to replicate the appearance of modern transit maps. The game uses a procedural audio system to generate sounds based on the player actions and transit network. <b>The</b> <b>rhythms</b> and sounds created took inspiration from works of minimal music.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn <b>the</b> <b>rhythms</b> and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E

5|$|While Totti was a {{prolific}} goalscorer, {{he was also}} renowned for his ball control, vision, creativity, and range of passing, {{as well as his}} ability to set the pace in midfield and provide through-balls and assists for his teammates, often through his trademark use of the no-look pass or backheel, in particular when holding up the ball or playing with his back to goal. Throughout his career, Totti drew particular praise from pundits for his excellent vision, technique, and precise long passing ability, which allowed him to play the ball first-time. Due to his movement and wide range of skills, his role has at times been described as that of a hardworking, generous, quick and dynamic centre forward, known as a centravanti di manovra in Italian. Known for his work rate, longevity, and willingness to contribute defensively, Totti underwent an athletic development during his time under Zeman: he undertook a muscle-strengthening programme to adapt to <b>the</b> <b>rhythms</b> of 21st-century football, gaining physical strength, stamina, fitness and shooting power to the detriment of some of his speed and agility, which also enabled him to maintain a consistent level of performance in his later career.|$|E

40|$|Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) {{shifts the}} phase of <b>the</b> {{circadian}} <b>rhythm</b> in <b>the</b> eye of Aplysia. We have examined the role of cAMP in mediating the effects of 5 -HT on <b>the</b> <b>rhythm.</b> <b>The</b> phase shifts produced by 5 -HT are mimicked by treatments that should increase intracellular levels of cAMP. An analogue of cAMP- 8 -benzylthio-cAMP, advanced and delayed <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> at phases in which 5 -HT had similar effects on <b>the</b> <b>rhythm.</b> In addition, two phosphodiesterase inhibitors, Ro- 20 - 1724 and papaverine, caused advance phase shifts where 5 -HT advances <b>the</b> <b>rhythm.</b> <b>The</b> phosphodiesterase inhibitors Ro- 20 - 1724 and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine each potentiated the effect of subthreshold doses of 5 -HT on <b>the</b> <b>rhythm.</b> <b>The</b> effects of 5 -HT and 8 -benzylthio-cAMP on <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> were nonadditive, indicating that 5 -HT and 8 -benzylthio-cAMP affect <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> through a common pathway. Finally, 5 -HT produced large changes (13 -fold) in the levels of cAMP in the eye. These results indicate that cAMP mediates the effect of 5 -HT on <b>the</b> <b>rhythm.</b> There are two possible roles for cAMP in the circadian system. Either the cAMP system is an intracellular step in an entrainment pathway or {{it is part of}} the biological clock. Because 5 -HT, 8 -benzylthio-cAMP, and three phosphodiesterase inhibitors inhibit impulses from the eye, cAMP may also mediate the inhibition produced by 5 -HT, or it might be involved in regulating the frequency of spontaneous impulses throughout the day...|$|R
