2500|$|In April 2010, while Congress was {{considering}} financial reform legislation, a reporter asked McConnell {{if he was}} [...] "doing the bidding of the large banks." [...] McConnell has received more money in donations from the [...] "Finance, Insurance and Real Estate" [...] sector than any other sector according to the Center for Responsive Politics. McConnell responded [...] "I'd say that that's inaccurate. You could talk to the community bankers in Kentucky." [...] The Democratic Party's plan for financial reform is actually a way to institute [...] "endless taxpayer funded bailouts for big Wall Street banks", said McConnell. He {{expressed concern that the}} proposed $50 billion, bank-funded fund that would be used to liquidate financial firms that could collapse [...] "would of course immediately signal to everyone that the government is ready to bail out large banks". In McConnell's home state of Kentucky, the Lexington Herald-Leader ran an editorial saying: [...] "We have read <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> a plan for financial reform, but McConnell isn't talking up any solutions, just trashing the other side's ideas with no respect for the truth." [...] According to one tally, McConnell's largest donor from the period from January 1, 2009, to September 30, 2015, was Bob McNair, contributing $1,502,500.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{shall not}} find {{that we will}} be less merciful, Arthur," [...] said de Lescure. [...] "General Santerre knows that the Vendean royalists have never disgraced {{themselves}} by shedding the blood of the prisoners whom the chance of war may have thrown into their hands. He knows that they can be brave without being cruel. I grieve to say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>have</b> hitherto not often allowed us to repay mercy with mercy. We shall now be glad {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity of doing so." ...|$|E
5000|$|The National Council for a New America is a {{group of}} Republican Party members that is aimed at {{rebranding}} the party. The group was formed as a way to both rebound from recent setbacks, and to cast off the [...] "party of no" [...] labeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> been given by the Democrats.|$|E
5000|$|Vice President Bush was {{nominated}} without opposition during the roll call vote, but with rumblings {{of opposition to}} the Quayle nomination, {{it was decided to}} have it ratified by voice vote, something <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> never done before.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> {{crushing}} defeat <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> experienced {{caused an}} immense sensation at Paris, {{and in the}} towns through which the Vendeans would pass {{on their way to}} the capital, which was at the time actually open to them.|$|R
50|$|The British and Russian commanders noticed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> {{left their}} right uncovered, {{and a very}} strong {{position}} unoccupied. This {{would have been difficult}} to correct if <b>the</b> attack on <b>that</b> flank had been vigorously carried out. They had also left Amsterdam undefended on the only side by which it was accessible.|$|R
50|$|As of the November 2012 elections, Republicans have a supermajority in {{both the}} Oklahoma Senate and Oklahoma House of Representatives, hold all statewide offices, and all Congressional seats {{in both the}} House and Senate. This {{accomplishment}} is notwithstanding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> fewer registered voters in the state than the Democrats (as of January 15, 2014, there are 854,329 registered Republican voters in Oklahoma, compared to 885,609 Democratic voters and 238,874 voters registered as independent or with other parties).|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Comics Journal, Danziger said, [...] "Keep in mind that I agree with a great many things <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> been traditionally for. I am {{in favor of a}} solid economy. I am in favor of a strong dollar. I am in favor of looking after troops. I am in favor of maintaining a strong army, and I am in favor of the ability to go into business and make a profit and not pay taxes for silly purposes." ...|$|E
5000|$|Leo McGarry is {{mentioned}} as being Labor Secretary {{in the administration}} that was in office in 1993 and 1995. In the first season, an outgoing Supreme Court Justice tells Jed Bartlet {{that he had been}} wanting to retire for five years, but waited [...] "for a Democrat" [...] because he did not want a Republican President to replace him with a conservative justice (the Justice then tells President Bartlet, snidely, [...] "Instead, I got you."). The season four episode Debate Camp features a flashback to the days just before Bartlet's inauguration, as Donna Moss meets with her Republican predecessor, Jeff Johnson. In season six Leo says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> been [...] "out of power for eight years", and Republicans at their convention say [...] "eight (years) is enough".|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} results gave Nelson 292,771 votes (49.91%) to Orr's 288,741 (49.23%). [...] Sullivan, {{running as}} a write-in, garnered 1887 votes (0.32%); other write-ins received 3143 votes (0.54%). [...] Nelson won 19 counties <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> won in <b>the</b> 1986 gubernatorial election, {{many of them in}} areas that had been suggested as locations for the radioactive-waste disposal site.|$|R
50|$|Issuing a {{statement}} 100 {{days into the}} 129th Ohio General Assembly, Grossman <b>has</b> stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> caucus <b>has</b> focused on jobs, government and accountability.|$|R
25|$|Dyer ran unsuccessfully {{for reelection}} in 1932, 1934 and 1936, during the Great Depression. Black voters <b>had</b> been {{disappointed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> {{failed to deliver}} on their promise to pass an anti-lynching law, {{part of the national}} platform in 1920, and by President Hoover's approach to dealing with economic problems. The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt attracted many voters to Democratic candidates because he was putting people to work through the Works Progress Administration and providing social aid programs.|$|R

40|$|Several years ago, I gave a talk on my {{research}} {{to a community}} group. My first slide included the words “Republican China” and as I waited to begin I heard {{a woman in the}} front row lean over and whisper to her neighbor, “I had no idea they have Republicans in China too!” At this time of bruising primary battles, though, the China <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> seems more relevant—as China, imagined and real, has played a recurring role in the raucous Republican primaries. Here’s a rundown of some of the ways China has popped up on the campaign trail in recent months...|$|E
2500|$|Mary Matalin: [...] "I'm {{not a big}} fan of Floyd Brown... He gave us the Willie Horton ads <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>has</b> had to eat for two {{election}} cycles now." ...|$|R
500|$|Taylor {{opened his}} {{campaign}} on August 22 in London, a Republican stronghold in eastern Kentucky. Among his supporters were Senator Deboe, Congressman Samuel Pugh, Caleb Powers, and former Republican gubernatorial candidate Thomas Z. Morrow (who {{was also the}} brother-in-law of Governor Bradley). Taylor stressed the economic prosperity brought about during the McKinley administration. He reminded <b>the</b> crowd <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> not supported <b>the</b> enslavement of blacks and stated they would not now support {{what he called the}} [...] "political enslavement" [...] that would result from electing Goebel.|$|R
50|$|One day later, once it {{was clear}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> taken <b>the</b> country, Manuel decided to embark from Ericeira on the royal yacht Amélia IV for Oporto, with armed <b>Republicans</b> {{arriving}} as <b>the</b> ship departed. It is unclear whether his advisers motivated Manuel to change his intentions or whether {{he was forced to}} change his destination en route, but the Royal Family disembarked in Gibraltar shortly later, after they received notice that Oporto <b>had</b> fallen to <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> <b>The</b> coup d'etat was complete, and the Royal Family departed for exile, arriving in the United Kingdom, where he was received by the King.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2016, as {{quoted in}} a Vox article, Roy said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>had</b> [...] "lost {{its right to}} govern, because it is driven by white {{nationalism}} rather than a true commitment to equality for all Americans." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, Vanocur {{covered the}} 1968 United States presidential {{election}} in which Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated. Vanocur, who had interviewed Kennedy on June 4, 1968 shortly before the Democratic candidate was shot, reported on the incident from The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California for the entire night. On the final night of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Convention in Miami Beach, during a convention-wrapping Thursday night round-table discussion with his fellow NBC floor reporters in the vacated folding chairs on the convention hall floor, Vanocur suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> [...] "kissed off the black vote" [...] in 1968, a comment which caused a media uproar in the ensuing week.|$|R
2500|$|After his {{retirement}} in 1987, Goldwater described the Arizona Governor Evan Mecham as [...] "hardheaded" [...] and called on him to resign, {{and two years later}} stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> party <b>had</b> been taken over by a [...] "bunch of kooks".|$|R
50|$|Another {{theory was}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Irish <b>Republican</b> Brotherhood <b>had</b> smuggled <b>the</b> jewels to the United States.|$|R
500|$|Dow mostly ignored <b>the</b> {{national}} contest <b>that</b> summer, {{focusing on}} campaigning for pro-temperance candidates in local Maine elections. Republicans pressured Dow to withdraw, fearing {{that he would}} claim enough votes to cost their nominee, James A. Garfield, the election. Dow declined to do so, but his vote totals were too small to harm Garfield in any case. The Prohibition ticket polled just 10,305 votes, 0.1% of the total. Garfield narrowly won the popular vote over Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, but in the electoral college, he carried a clear majority. Dow was not displeased with <b>the</b> result, happy <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> triumphed over <b>the</b> [...] "ex-slavedriving rebel element".|$|R
50|$|The National Defence Council (Consejo Nacional de Defensa) was the {{governing}} body in <b>Republican</b> Spain at <b>the</b> {{end of the}} Spanish Civil War (1936-39).The council seized power with Colonel Segismundo Casado’s coup on 5 March 1939 {{when it was clear}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> lost <b>the</b> war.The leaders hoped to negotiate an end to hostilities with the rebel forces led by General Francisco Franco. Franco insisted on unconditional surrender, and on 26 March 1939 launched the final offensive of the Spanish Civil War. By {{the end of the month}} he controlled the whole country. Most of the council members escaped into exile on British warships.|$|R

25|$|In October 2009, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>had</b> approached Sullenberger about running against Democratic U.S. Representative Jerry McNerney of California's 11th congressional district in the 2010 elections. Sullenberger's publicist said that Sullenberger {{had no desire to}} run for any public office.|$|R
2500|$|Before the caucus, {{comments}} made by Obama concerning former Republican president Ronald Reagan attracted rebuke from rivals and dissection from all sections of the media. Obama had stated in an interview that: [...] "Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America {{in a way that}} Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not." [...] According to the New York Times, Hillary Clinton [...] "ridiculed <b>the</b> idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were <b>the</b> party of ideas, suggesting Mr. Obama <b>had</b> said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> 'better' ideas". MSNBC noted that Senator John Edwards [...] "criticized Obama specifically for referring to Ronald Reagan as an agent of change [...] in a newspaper interview [...] 'I would never use Ronald Reagan as an example of change.'" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{race for}} <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> {{primaries}} began slowly in 2011. Gallup polls found <b>that</b> historically <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>had</b> a clear front-runner by March.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{researchers}} argue <b>that,</b> if <b>the</b> monarchy were popular, {{there would}} be moves against the republic then beyond the Canudos War and the Revolta da Armada. However, according to other researchers, {{what would have happened}} was a growing awareness about the new regime and the indifference by the most different sectors of Brazilian society. An opposing version is given by the researcher, Maria de Lourdes Monaco Janoti, in the book [...] "Os Subversivos da República", in which she recounts <b>the</b> fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> in <b>the</b> first decades of the republic, regarding a possible restoration of the monarchy in Brazil. Maria Janoti also shows in her book <b>the</b> strong <b>Republican</b> repression of any attempt to organize monarchist political groups at that time.|$|R
5000|$|However, when briefly {{interviewed by}} the BBC during its {{coverage}} of the 2012 presidential election, Amis displayed a change in tone, stating that he was [...] "depressed and frightened" [...] by the US election, rather than excited. Blaming a [...] "deep irrationality of the American people" [...] for the apparent narrow gap between the candidates, Amis claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> swung so far to <b>the</b> right <b>that</b> former President Reagan {{would be considered a}} [...] "pariah" [...] by the present party - and invited viewers to imagine a Conservative party in the UK which had moved to the right so much that it disowned Margaret Thatcher: [...] "Tax cuts for the rich", he said, [...] "there's not a democracy on earth where that would be mentioned!".|$|R
50|$|Cooper became {{active in}} {{politics}} {{in his new}} home town. He was appointed postmaster of Burlington (a patronage position) by Abraham Lincoln in 1861, now <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>had</b> won <b>the</b> Presidency (like most Wisconsin Freesoilers, Cooper <b>had</b> joined <b>the</b> new <b>Republican</b> Party upon its formation). He held that office until resigning in 1874.|$|R
50|$|On December 13, 2010, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Senate <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> decided to appoint Lehner to fill the remaining two years of Husted's term. In a homecoming of sorts, Lehner was sworn into the seat she previously held on January 11, 2011, resigning from the House to do so.|$|R
50|$|LGF {{has been}} ideologically opposed to Intelligent Design, and Johnson {{regularly}} posts {{to criticize the}} subject and those who endorse it. He is particularly critical of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal on this point. In 2009, he stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party's <b>having</b> visible advocates of Intelligent Design is one of <b>the</b> reasons <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Democrats were in power.|$|R
5000|$|Since Representatives and Senators {{are elected}} by {{exactly the same}} voters within the same district, each House of the Arizona Legislature tends to have members with {{identical}} political philosophies, which is illustrated by <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> party <b>has</b> two-thirds of the seats in each House. [...] This produces, in effect, a [...] "two-house unicameral" [...] legislature.|$|R
5000|$|In {{both the}} 2013 Virginia Gubernatorial Election and the 2014 Virginia US Senate Election, Libertarian Robert Sarvis {{received}} {{a number of}} votes greater than the difference between <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> and Democratic candidates. Given <b>the</b> similarity in <b>Republican</b> and Libertarian views, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> would <b>have</b> won each election {{if not for the}} inclusion of Sarvis on the ballot.|$|R
40|$|Journalists, scholars, {{and other}} {{observers}} of politics have claimed for decades <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>has</b> focused on crime as an electoral issue.

50|$|Romney's speech {{represented}} an unprecedented attack {{by a major}} U.S. party's presidential nominee against the party's front-runner for the nomination. There was also little precedent for a major party figure such as Romney urging {{a course of action}} that would lead to a contested convention. The speech was considered prime evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>had</b> fallen into an internal schism.|$|R
