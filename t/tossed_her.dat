5|$|Hargitay {{made his}} first film {{appearance}} with Mansfield in a bit part in Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. The couple became a popular publicity and performing team who toured widely in stage shows, where Mansfield's leopard-spot bikini became a topic of discussion and newspaper coverage. As a highlight, Hargitay <b>tossed</b> <b>her</b> around his waist and spun her in wide circles as her shows made more headlines. On screen, he was Mansfield's male lead in her Italian ventures—The Loves of Hercules and L'Amore Primitivo, and a major supporting character in Promises! Promises!. On stage, he was the male lead in The Tropicana Holiday, The House of Love, French Dressing, and other nightclub acts.|$|E
500|$|On 5 January 1589, Catherine {{died at the}} age of sixty-nine, {{probably}} from pleurisy. L'Estoile wrote: [...] "those close to her believed that her life had been shortened by displeasure over her son's deed." [...] He added that she had no sooner died than she was treated with as much consideration as a dead goat. Because Paris was held by enemies of the crown, Catherine had to be buried provisionally at Blois. Eight months later, Jacques Clément stabbed Henry III to death. At the time, Henry was besieging Paris with the King of Navarre, who would succeed him as Henry IV of France. Henry III's assassination ended nearly three centuries of Valois rule and brought the Bourbon dynasty into power. Years later, Diane, daughter of Henry II and Philippa Duci, had Catherine's remains reinterred in the Saint-Denis basilica in Paris. In 1793, a revolutionary mob <b>tossed</b> <b>her</b> bones into a mass grave with those of the other kings and queens.|$|E

500|$|In late February 1945, Sagan was {{betrayed by}} an {{informer}} {{in the movement}} and, like her parents, arrested by the Black Brigades. During her 45 days of imprisonment, she was beaten, raped, and tortured, leading up to a scheduled April 23 execution. At one point, a jailer <b>tossed</b> <b>her</b> {{a loaf of bread}} that contained a matchbox with the word corragio ("courage") written inside, a moment which would motivate much of her later work on behalf of prisoners. On the day of her scheduled execution, she was being beaten by guards in a villa in Sondrio, Italy, when a pair of German officers forced her Italian captors to release her into their custody. She later recalled watching the stars from the window of their car and thinking, [...] "I will never see another dawn." [...] However, the Germans revealed themselves to be Nazi defectors collaborating with her resistance comrades, and they delivered Sagan safely to a Catholic hospital. Sagan annually celebrated the date of April 23 {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

Spears emerged onstage for the chorus and performed alongside Minaj and her back up dancers while walking to a minor stage.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the IDS Center's {{peculiar}} {{and unique}} stepback design, termed [...] "zogs" [...] by its architect, Philip Johnson, each floor has up to 32 corner offices. The area of Nicollet Mall {{in front of}} the IDS Center is familiar to television viewers: The character of Mary Richards on [...] "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" [...] was seen on Nicollet Mall looking at an IDS shop in the opening montage of the series. Across 7th Street from the IDS was Donaldson's Department Store in front of which she <b>tossed</b> <b>her</b> hat in the air {{at the end of the}} opening sequence. A statue commemorating that shot stands kitty-corner from the view, created and maintained by TVLand. She is also seen in the show opening dining with then-husband Grant Tinker at what is now the terrace of Basil's Restaurant on the hotel's third floor overlooking the Crystal Court, where diners can sit at the [...] "Mary Tyler Moore Table." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tilikum, a male killer whale, {{has been}} {{involved}} in the death of three individuals since his capture near Iceland in November 1983. [...] In 1991, Tilikum and two other killer whales grabbed 20-year-old trainer Keltie Byrne in their mouths and <b>tossed</b> <b>her</b> to each other, drowning Byrne. On July 5, 1999, Daniel P. Dukes visited SeaWorld and stayed after the park closed, evading security so as to enter a killer whale tank. [...] He was found dead the next day, floating in Tilikum's pool. [...] He died due to a combination of hypothermia, trauma, and drowning but Dukes was covered in bruises, abrasions and bite marks, and his scrotum had been ripped open, indicating that Tilikum had toyed with the victim. [...] It is unclear whether Tilikum actually caused the man's death. On February 24, 2010, after a noontime performance at Sea World, Orlando, Florida, Tilikum killed trainer Dawn Brancheau during a training session with the whale. [...] This latest incident with Tilikum reawakened a heated discussion about the effect of captivity on the killer whale's behavior. [...] In May 2012, Occupational Safety and Health Administration administrative law judge Ken Welsch faulted SeaWorld for the death of Dawn Brancheau and introduced regulations requiring a physical barrier between trainers and killer whales.|$|E
