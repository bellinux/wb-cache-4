25|$|Machinability ratings {{can be used}} in {{conjunction}} with the Taylor <b>tool</b> <b>life</b> equation, , in order to determine cutting speeds or <b>tool</b> <b>life.</b> It is known that B1112 has a <b>tool</b> <b>life</b> of 60 minutes at a cutting speed of 100 sfpm. If a material has a machinability rating of 70%, it can be determined, with the above knowns, that {{in order to maintain the}} same <b>tool</b> <b>life</b> (60 minutes) the cutting speed must be 70 sfpm (assuming the same tooling is used).|$|E

25|$|Machinability can {{be based}} on the measure of how long a tool lasts. This can be useful when {{comparing}} materials that have similar properties and power consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the <b>tool</b> <b>life.</b> The major downfall with this approach is that <b>tool</b> <b>life</b> is dependent on more than just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting tool material, cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. Also, the machinability for one tool type cannot be compared to another tool type (i.e. HSS tool to a carbide tool).|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} factors {{affecting}} machinability, but no widely accepted way to quantify it. Instead, machinability is often assessed {{on a case-by-case}} basis, and tests are tailored {{to the needs of}} a specific manufacturing process. Common metrics for comparison include <b>tool</b> <b>life,</b> surface finish, cutting temperature, and tool forces and power consumption.|$|E
25|$|Thermoplastics are {{difficult}} to machine because they have poor thermal conductivity. This creates heat that builds up in the cutting zone, which degrades the <b>tool</b> <b>life</b> and locally melts the plastic. Once the plastic melts, it just flows around the cutting edge instead of being removed by it. Machinability can be improved by using high lubricity coolant and keeping the cutting area free of chip build up.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of this method {{is that it is}} easily measured with the appropriate equipment. The dis{{advantage of}} this criterion is that it is often irrelevant. For instance when making a rough cut, the surface finish is of no importance. Also, finish cuts often require a certain accuracy that naturally achieves a good surface finish. This rating method also doesn't always agree with other methods. For instance titanium alloys would rate well by the surface finish method, low by the <b>tool</b> <b>life</b> method, and intermediate by the power consumption method.|$|E

25|$|The Acme thread form has a 29° {{thread angle}} with a thread height {{half of the}} pitch; the apex (or crest) and valley (or root) are flat. This shape is easier to machine (faster cutting, longer <b>tool</b> <b>life)</b> than is a square thread. The tooth shape also has a wider base which means it is {{stronger}} (thus, the screw can carry a greater load) than a similarly sized square thread. This thread form also allows {{for the use of}} a split nut, which can compensate for nut wear.|$|E
25|$|The {{machinability}} {{rating of}} a material attempts {{to quantify the}} machinability of various materials. It is expressed as a percentage or a normalized value. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) determined machinability ratings {{for a wide variety}} of materials by running turning tests at 180 surface feet per minute (sfpm). It then arbitrarily assigned 160 Brinell B1112 steel a machinability rating of 100%. The machinability rating is determined by measuring the weighed averages of the normal cutting speed, surface finish, and <b>tool</b> <b>life</b> for each material. Note that a material with a machinability rating less than 100% would be more difficult to machine than B1112 and material with a value more than 100% would be easier.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} {{application}} of [...] was abrasive and cutting tools. Bulk, monolithic silicon nitride {{is used as}} a material for cutting tools, due to its hardness, thermal stability, and resistance to wear. It is especially recommended for high speed machining of cast iron. Hot hardness, fracture toughness and thermal shock resistance mean that sintered silicon nitride can cut cast iron, hard steel and nickel based alloys with surface speeds up to 25 times quicker than those obtained with conventional materials such as tungsten carbide. The use of [...] cutting tools has had a dramatic effect on manufacturing output. For example, face milling of gray cast iron with silicon nitride inserts doubled the cutting speed, increased <b>tool</b> <b>life</b> from one part to six parts per edge, and reduced the average cost of inserts by 50%, as compared to traditional tungsten carbide tools.|$|E

2500|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel greatly affects its machinability. High-carbon steels are {{difficult}} to machine because they are strong and because they may contain carbides that abrade the cutting tool. On {{the other end of}} the spectrum, low-carbon steels are troublesome because they are too soft. Low-carbon steels are [...] "gummy" [...] and stick to the cutting tool, resulting in a built up edge that shortens <b>tool</b> <b>life.</b> Therefore, steel has the best machinability with medium amounts of carbon, about 0.20%.|$|E
2500|$|There is no flash {{produced}} so material {{savings are}} between 20 and 30% over conventional forging. The final product is a consistent [...] so air cooling {{will result in}} a part that is still easily machinable (the advantage being the lack of annealing required after forging). Tolerances are usually ±, surfaces are clean, and draft angles are 0.5 to 1°. <b>Tool</b> <b>life</b> is nearly double that of conventional forging because contact times are on the order of 0.06-second. The downside is that this process is only feasible on smaller symmetric parts and cost; the initial investment can be over $10 million, so large quantities are required to justify this process.|$|E
2500|$|Liquid nitrogen, {{supplied}} in pressurized steel bottles, {{is sometimes}} used in similar fashion. In this case, boiling {{is enough to}} provide a powerful refrigerating effect. For years this has been done (in limited applications) by flooding the work zone. Since 2005, this mode of coolant has been applied in a manner comparable to MQL (with through-the-spindle and through-the-tool-tip delivery). This refrigerates the body and tips of the tool {{to such a degree}} that it acts as a [...] "thermal sponge", sucking up the heat from the tool–chip interface. This new type of nitrogen cooling is still under patent. <b>Tool</b> <b>life</b> has been increased by a factor of 10 in the milling of tough metals such as titanium and inconel.|$|E
50|$|Much of the tooling {{is made of}} {{hardened}} steel or tool steel to maintain and prolong the <b>tools</b> <b>life.</b> However wherever there is a concern of scratching or gouging the work piece, a softer material such as aluminum or bronze is utilized. For example, the clamping block, rotating form block and pressure die are often formed from the {{hardened steel}} because the tubing is not moving past these parts of the machine. On the other hand, the pressure die and the wiping die are formed from aluminum or bronze to maintain the shape and surface of the work piece as it slides by.|$|R

2500|$|Indexable {{drill bits}} are {{primarily}} used in CNC and other high precision or production equipment, {{and are the}} most expensive type of drill bit, costing the most per diameter and length. [...] Like indexable lathe tools and milling cutters, they use replaceable carbide or ceramic inserts as a cutting face to alleviate {{the need for a}} tool grinder. [...] One insert is responsible for the outer radius of the cut, and another insert is responsible for the inner radius. [...] The tool itself handles the point deformity, as it is a low-wear task. [...] The bit is hardened and coated against wear far more than the average drill bit, as the shank is non-consumable. [...] Almost all indexable drill bits have multiple coolant channels for prolonged <b>tool</b> <b>life</b> under heavy usage.
