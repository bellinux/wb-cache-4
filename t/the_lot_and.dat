5|$|DeForest Kelley, {{the actor}} who portrayed {{physician}} Leonard McCoy on Star Trek, was a personal favorite of John Belushi. Belushi had offices on the same lot as Kelley. Kelley overheard Belushi discussing the Saturday Night Live parody of Star Trek with William Shatner, and mentioned {{to both of them}} that he had not yet seen the sketch. Belushi immediately escorted Kelley to his office on <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> had him watch it on videotape.|$|E
5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie. When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> on a stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality it was on the right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
5|$|Ferrara has {{proposed}} a number of redevelopments for the orphanage itself, and its surroundings. In 2004, he proposed a plan to redevelop <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> building into 63 residential units. The proposed redevelopment was known as Glebe Gardens. Ferrara planned the construction of gardens and pools on the vacant grounds, but {{the front of the}} complex would face no development. Although the development application was approved by the city council, the plans were dropped because the costs to redevelop the lot were too great. In 2009, work began to revamp the orphanage and convert it into a retirement village, with trees being cleared to construct a retaining wall. Two metre high walls were going to be built to keep vandals out and to prevent further damage. He also stated {{that he was going to}} the fix up the orphanage once the proposed townhouses were under construction.|$|E

5|$|In May 1909, the Woman’s Club {{purchased}} {{an option}} to buy the property on {{the southwest corner of}} Winter and State streets for $5500, which was located across State from Willson Park (a city park at that time). This group then raised the funds to purchase the land for $12,000, and Salem applied for a grant from the Carnegie foundation. The city was allotted $14,000 by the foundation to build a library, but the Women’s Club which owned the existing library and land had not been involved in the process. The organization was able to get the money rescinded, and in November 1910, worked with the city to increase their maintenance fund for the library. Carnegie then raised the grant to $27,500 at the lobbying of Lulu Bush (daughter-in-law to Asahel Bush) and the Woman’s Club deeded <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> the other library assets to the city of Salem.|$|E
5|$|In late 1869, Earp courted 20-year-old Urilla Sutherland (c. 1849–1870), the {{daughter}} of William and Permelia Sutherland, who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar. They were married by his father Nicholas in Lamar on January 10, 1870, and in August 1870, Wyatt bought {{a lot on the}} outskirts of town for $50, where he built a house. Urilla was pregnant and about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> a house on it for $75. Hoping to keep the office to which he had been appointed, he ran against his elder half-brother Newton for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race.|$|E
5|$|The tornado then crossed Sooner Road, damaged {{an entry}} gate and several {{buildings}} at Tinker Air Force Base, then crossed 29th Street into Midwest City, destroying one {{building at the}} Boeing Complex and damaging two others. Widespread F3/F4 damage continued as the tornado moved across Interstate 40, affecting a large business district. Approximately 800 vehicles at Hudiburg Auto Group were damaged, located just south of Interstate 40. Hundreds of vehicles at the dealership were moved from their original location on <b>the</b> <b>lot,</b> <b>and</b> dozens of vehicles (including 30 awaiting tune-ups or repairs at Morris' Auto Machine and Supply, and an unoccupied Mid-Del School District bus) were picked up and tossed northward across the interstate into several motels, a distance of approximately two-tenths of a mile. Numerous motels and other businesses including Hampton Inn, Comfort Inn, Inn Suites, Clarion Inn, Cracker Barrel, and portions of Rose State College, were destroyed. While some of the damage through this area was rated high-end F4, low-end F5 was considered. The tornado then continued into another residential area located between Southeast 15th and Reno Avenue, where three fatalities occurred. Damage consistent with high-end F4 wind speeds was inflicted to four homes in this area. Two of these homes were located between Southeast 11th and 12th Streets, near Buena Vista, {{and the other two}} homes were located on Will Rogers Road, just south of Southeast 15th. Damage then diminished rapidly to F0/F1 strength as the tornado crossed Reno Avenue, before dissipating three blocks north of Reno, between Sooner Road and Air Depot Boulevard. Throughout Oklahoma County, 12 people were killed and 234 others were injured while losses amounted to $450 million.|$|E

25|$|Not once, {{but three}} times, the stumps were plucked by players eager to grab souvenirs of an {{historic}} occasion. First of all, the Australian captain bowled a full toss down the leg side {{and took it}} for granted that Compton would hit the ball to the boundary rails. He forgot that Compton was out of form and out of luck. Instead of the ball going to the rails, it was missed completely and poor Tallon, with his arms full of stumps and bails, had to drop <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> take the ball.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} and {{orientation of the}} site on which St. Clement's was built posed a significant problem {{for the design of}} the church. The west end of the site, where the main façade and doors would typically be located, {{was in the middle of}} a city block. For Notman, the easy solution would have been to reverse the church, erecting the main entrance on the east side of <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> the apse on the west side. However, this would have altered the eastward orientation of the building. Instead, Notman retained the apse on the east side of the church and incorporated it into the main façade.|$|E

25|$|Robert Collier {{established}} Collier Motors in 1955 as {{a single}} entrepreneur while in his 20s. His father {{was also in the}} automobile business and continued working until he was in his 80s. The Collier family had a longstanding relationship with AMC from the 1950s until the company was partially purchased by Renault in 1979. After AMC started importing Renaults, Robert Collier decided he preferred to sell only domestic-designed and built AMC cars. Rather than selling new Renault-derived passenger cars, such as the Alliance, Collier continued to sell the pre-Renault stock he already had on <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> focus on older AMC cars and Jeep vehicles. American Motors was bought by Chrysler in 1987.|$|E
25|$|The deputy barmasters kept {{records of}} all changes of title {{and of the}} amounts of ore {{measured}} and the amounts of lot ore and cope collected at their regular reckonings at the mines. <b>The</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> cope accounts involved quite complicated arithmetic.

25|$|In October 1925, Harry S. Black, {{in need of}} {{cash for}} his U.S. Realty Company, sold the Flatiron Building to a {{syndicate}} set up by Lewis Rosenbaum, who also owned assorted other notable buildings around the U.S. The price was $2 million, which equaled Black's cost for buying <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> erecting the Flatiron. The syndicate defaulted on its mortgage in 1933, and {{was taken over by}} the lender, Equitable Life Assurance Company after failing to sell it at auction. To attract tenants, Equitable did some modernization of the building, including replacing the original cast-iron birdcage elevators, which had cabs covered in rubber tiling and were originally built by Hecla Iron Works, but the hydraulic power system was not replaced. By the mid-1940s, the building was fully rented.|$|E
25|$|On 30 September 1793 Moreaux {{was offered}} {{command of the}} Army of the Moselle but refused. In the Second Battle of Wissembourg in December 1793, Moreaux led a {{division}} in Lazare Hoche's Army of the Moselle.

When Hoche became ill {{at the end of}} January 1794, Moreaux temporarily took command. Two months later Jean Baptiste Jourdan succeeded Hoche in command and the army pulled back to a position between Thionville and Sarrebruck.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before midnight}} on July 4, 1969, Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau {{drove into the}} Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, four miles from the Lake Herman Road murder site, and parked. While the couple sat in Ferrin's car, a second car drove into <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> parked {{alongside}} them but almost immediately drove away. Returning about 10 minutes later, this second car parked behind them. The driver of the second car then exited the vehicle, approaching the passenger side door of Ferrin's car, carrying a flashlight and a 9mm Luger. The killer directed the flashlight into Mageau's and Ferrin's eyes before shooting at them, firing five times. Both victims were hit, and several bullets had passed through Mageau and into Ferrin. The killer {{walked away from the}} car but upon hearing Mageau's moaning, returned and shot each victim twice more before driving off.|$|E

25|$|The site {{on which}} the Flatiron Building would stand was bought in 1857 by Amos Eno, who shortly built the Fifth Avenue Hotel on a site diagonally across from it. Eno tore down the four-story St. Germaine Hotel on {{the south end of}} <b>the</b> <b>lot,</b> <b>and</b> {{replaced}} it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder of the lot he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland's northern face exposed, which Eno rented out to advertisers, including The New York Times, who installed a sign made up of electric lights. Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, and projected images onto it from a magic lantern on top of one of his smaller buildings, presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately. Both the Times and the New York Tribune began using the screen for news bulletins, and on election nights {{tens of thousands of people}} would gather in Madison Square, waiting for the latest results.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{was delayed}} until February 1985 {{due to a}} delay in the chat show Wogan, {{that was to be}} a part of the major revamp in BBC1's schedules. Smith was uneasy about the late start as EastEnders no longer had the winter months to build up a loyal {{following}} before the summer ratings lull. The press were invited to Elstree to meet the cast and see <b>the</b> <b>lot,</b> <b>and</b> stories immediately started circulating about the show, about a rivalry with ITV (who were launching their own market-based soap, Albion Market) and about the private lives of the cast. Anticipation and rumour grew in equal measure until the first transmission at 7p.m. on 19 February 1985. Both Holland and Smith could not watch; they both instead returned to the place where it all began, Albertine's Wine Bar on Wood Lane. The next day, viewing figures were confirmed at 17 million. The reviews were largely favourable, although, after three weeks on air, BBC1's early evening share had returned to the pre-EastEnders figure of seven million, though EastEnders then climbed to highs of up to 23 million later on in the year. Following the launch, both group discussions and telephone surveys were conducted to test audience reaction to early episodes. Detailed reactions were taken after six months and since then regular monitoring was conducted.|$|E
