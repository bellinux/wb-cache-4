Fernandes described two subgenera based on basal chromosome number, Hermione, n = 5 (11) and Narcissus, n = 7 (13). He further subdivided these into ten sections (Apodanthi, Aurelia, Bulbocodii, Ganymedes, Jonquillae, Narcissus, Pseudonarcissi, Serotini, Tapeinanthus, Tazettae), as did Blanchard later.|$|E

This period starts from the 30 th September 1966, when Botswana became independent {{up to the present}} moment. Since then <b>the</b> education <b>system</b> has undergone many changes. Consequently {{the focus is on the}} nature and impact of these changes. The study identifies changes which took place with regard to <b>the</b> Education <b>System</b> <b>of</b> Botswana since independence as far as meeting the minimum requirements of education of developing countries are concerned. The minimum requirements that <b>the</b> education <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> developing countries, must meet are discussed according to the four central components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> education <b>systems,</b> viz. <b>the</b> education <b>system</b> policy, education system administration, structure for teaching and support services. After introducing the problem statement and background in the introductory chapter, the minimum requirements <b>of</b> education <b>systems</b> in developing countries are discussed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 then deals with a historical perspective on <b>the</b> education <b>system</b> <b>of</b> Botswana before independence, concentrating on the different historical periods associated with educational development up to independence day. The study then discusses the determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> education <b>system</b> <b>of</b> Botswana after independence in Chapter 4, focussing on the particular factors influencing <b>the</b> Botswana education <b>system.</b> Finally, Chapter 5 evaluates the level to which <b>the</b> education <b>system</b> policy and education <b>system</b> administration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> education <b>system</b> <b>of</b> Botswana meet <b>the</b> minimum requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> education <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> developing countries, while Chapter 6 evaluates the level to which the structure for teaching and support services meet the minimum requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> education <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> developing countries. In general, the evaluation indicates that <b>the</b> education <b>system</b> <b>of</b> Botswana has undergone many positive changes and that <b>the</b> Botswana education <b>system</b> compares favourably with the minimum requirements expected <b>of</b> <b>the</b> education <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> developing countries.
