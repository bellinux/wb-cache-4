5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack.

In July of that year, while assigned to the East Asia Division, Bussard and Falke assisted in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> of Mata'afa Iosefo's revolt in Samoa, along with a British corvette.

5|$|Around 1920, Petrov was {{transferred}} to Central Asia and fought in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> of the Basmachi movement, a Muslim uprising against Russian and Soviet rule. He later fought against insurgents in the Caucasus before {{being sent to the}} Tambov Infantry School, from which he graduated in 1923. While at the school, he participated in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> of the Tambov Rebellion. He graduated from the Transcaucasian Political School in 1925. In 1932, he graduated from the armored commanders refresher courses. Petrov served as the commander of a training battalion in the 1st Mechanized Brigade, before fighting in the Spanish Civil War, serving as a battalion commander in Dmitry Pavlov's tank brigade from October 1936 to June 1937. He was awarded the Order of the Red Star on 2 January 1937. On 21 June he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for his leadership. Returning to the Soviet Union, he held appointments as a battalion commander and then as a tank brigade commander. In 1937, he became commander of a tank division. In June of that year, he became commander of the 5th Mechanized Corps.|$|E

This was quickly achieved and his brother, Theophilos Kourkouas, replaced Boilas as governor of Chaldia.

The apogee of this upsurge was the anti-Ottoman Chiprovtsi Uprising of 1688. After <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> of the uprising, some of the town's population fled to Habsburg-ruled lands; those unable to flee were killed or enslaved by the Ottomans.|$|E
