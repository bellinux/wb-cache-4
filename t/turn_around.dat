5|$|In 2015, SpiceJet's {{operations}} {{experienced a}} significant <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> with 93 percent of available seats on flights being filled and only 0.13 percent of scheduled flights canceled each month. The airline became profitable {{in the first}} three consecutive quarters of the year 2015, in contrast to the previous five quarters when it suffered losses. As of November 2016, it is the fourth largest airline in India in terms of passengers carried with a 12.8 percent market share.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese never {{spotted the}} D-21B. The first one failed to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> and {{continued}} straight on, crashing {{somewhere in the}} Soviet Union. Another test flight was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct any problems. The second operational mission, however, was not until 16 December 1970. The D-21B reached Lop Nor {{and back to the}} recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs.|$|E

5|$|The {{demonstration}} profile {{as designed}} by Holland included a 360° <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> Fairchild's air-traffic-control tower. Holland had not attempted this maneuver in previous air-show demonstrations. During the final flight, Holland performed {{a series of}} 60° banked turns and a 68° pitch climb in violation of Brooks' orders. No evidence exists that McGeehan or Wolff attempted to intervene as Holland executed the maneuvers.|$|E

5|$|After eleven players {{left the}} club in 2014, Adams rebuilt for the 2014–15 {{campaign}} by signing left-sided player Colin Daniel, Northern Ireland internationals Ryan McGivern and Michael O'Connor, pacey winger Mark Marshall, Crewe Alexandra attacker Byron Moore, veteran midfielder Michael Brown, and midfielder Steve Jennings, and also took in three loanees in Swiss full-back Freddie Veseli, highly rated striker Jordan Slew and French target man Achille Campion. Defeat to local rivals Crewe Alexandra marked the club's fifth consecutive loss, and after the game Adams accepted that his position would be under threat if results did not <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> quickly. Following six straight defeats Adams resigned as manager on 18 September after lengthy discussions with the chairman.|$|E

When she strove for the second barrel, the bridle was hanging from the horse's mouth to down under his foot. Meanwhile, she is trying to hold that bit in his mouth.

5|$|Between his 1969 {{victory in}} the race and 1981, Andretti {{dropped out of the}} races due to part {{failures}} or crashes. His luck seemed to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> in 1981. Andretti finished second in the 1981 Indianapolis 500 by eight seconds behind Bobby Unser. The following day Unser was penalized one lap for passing cars under a caution flag, and Andretti was declared the winner. Unser and his car owner Roger Penske appealed the race stewards' decision. USAC overturned the one lap penalty four months later, and penalized Unser with a $40,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised {{that they had}} proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E

5|$|On 7 February, several {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that JAL would decide {{to keep its}} alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta. Inamori and ETIC officials, according to the reports, decided that switching alliances from Oneworld to Skyteam would be too risky and could hinder JAL's ability to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> quickly. Two days later, JAL officially announced that they would strengthen their partnership with American, including a joint application for antitrust immunity on transpacific routes. The airline would also fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} investigation {{concluded that the}} crash was primarily attributable to Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' inadequate reactions to the previous incidents involving Holland, and {{the sequence of events}} and aircrew response during the final flight of the aircraft. Holland's disregard for procedures governing the safe operation of the B-52 aircraft that he commanded and the absence of firm and consistent corrective action by his superior officers allowed Holland to believe that he could conduct his flight in an unsafe manner, culminating with the slow, steeply banked, 360° <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> the control tower.|$|E
5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many Midwestern cities its age, Dayton {{has very}} broad and {{straight}} downtown streets (generally {{two or three}} full lanes in each direction) that improved access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular. The main reason for the broad streets was that Dayton was a marketing and shipping center from its beginning; streets were broad to enable wagons drawn by teams of three to four pairs of oxen to <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> In addition, some of today's streets were once barge canals flanked by draw-paths.|$|E
5|$|Wrexham exited 18-months of {{administration}} {{at the start}} of 2006–07, and started the season with an eight-match unbeaten run, including a 4–1 win over Championship club Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup. However, a 5–0 defeat at Accrington Stanley triggered a run of bad results that Smith was unable to <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> With Wrexham hovering above the relegation zone in 18th place, Smith was dismissed on 11 January 2007. He is one of only 24 people to have managed over 1,000 professional matches in English football.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E

During a <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> the final corner, Ohno, Ahn Hyun Soo, Li Jiajun and Mathieu Turcotte all fell {{in a series of}} collisions. The last man standing was Steven Bradbury from Australia, who was trailing behind at the time, and skated through to win the gold medal, becoming the first person from the southern hemisphere to win a gold medal at a Winter Olympics. Ohno quickly got to his feet and crossed the finish line to win silver with Turcotte winning the bronze. Ohno, coincidentally was wearing skates, made by Bradbury's own boot company, Revolutionary Boot Company. Bradbury had given them to Ohno, expecting for Ohno to win wearing them.|$|E
5|$|BL-80 {{continues}} {{to the east}} past Aria Boulevard, which to the north connects to I-80, and to the south leads to the historic Wendover Air Force Base, where the 509th Composite Group was stationed while it prepared to conduct atomic bomb attacks against Japan during 1944 and 1945. The highway briefly parallels the Shafter Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor, which was formerly part of the Feather River Route of the Western Pacific Railroad. As the highway travels east towards a half trumpet interchange with I-80, the number of lanes drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access eastbound I-80 or turn off onto Frontage Road; however, to access westbound I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit and <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> Traffic into Wendover can access BL-80 from both directions of I-80, and from Frontage Road.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{returned}} to Massillon in 1932, {{when he was}} 24 years old and barely two years out of college. His assignment was to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown's old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2–6-2 record. Brown's strategy was {{to build up a}} disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late because he had to work on his farm. No Tigers player was allowed to sit on the bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown put in an offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke's Jimmy DeHart and Purdue's Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.|$|E
40|$|Visual stimuli and {{socialization}} influence exploratory behaviour in crayfish. The predominant components of spontaneous exploratory behaviour {{were determined by}} observing the activity of solitary adult crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in a glass aquarium containing fresh water and no objects. Five distinct behaviours were observed: rearing up (climbing on the wall), <b>turning</b> <b>around,</b> cornering (facing the comer), backward walking, and crossing (crossing the midline of the aquarium). The frequency of rearing up, cornering and <b>turning</b> <b>around</b> decreased when reflection from the glass wall was blocked with black cardboard, black paint or non-reflective transparent plastic. In a tank containing mirrors {{on one side and}} non-reflective plastic on the other, crayfish cornered, reared up, and <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> more in front of the mirrors. Socialization was necessary for crayfish to respond to the reflection. Crayfish that were housed in pairs for two weeks exhibited more rearing up, <b>turning</b> <b>around</b> and cornering in front of the mirrors than in the non-reflective side. Crayfish isolated for two weeks did not show these differences. Socialized crayfish also exhibited more rearing up, <b>turning</b> <b>around</b> and cornering than did isolated crayfish. Thus, crayfish respond to visual stimuli provided by a glass tank, but the responds depends on socialization...|$|R
