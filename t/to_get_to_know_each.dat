5|$|The Federation {{starship}} Enterprise {{arrives at}} the planet Haven, where the ship's Betazoid Counselor Deanna Troi has been summoned by her mother Lwaxana. Troi had previously been set into an arranged marriage to the young human doctor, Wyatt Miller (Robert Knepper), and his parents have since tracked down Lwaxana to enforce the marriage. After Lwaxana and the Millers are welcomed aboard the Enterprise, the parents argue over whose cultural traditions will be honored at the ceremony. Troi and Wyatt attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other but find it difficult, as Troi is {{still in love with}} Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes). Wyatt has had numerous dreams of another woman with whom he has fallen in love, and had initially believed her to be Troi communicating telepathically with him.|$|E
25|$|A {{major feature}} of the tours is a 5- to 10-day mifgash (Hebrew for 'encounter') with Israeli peers, usually {{soldiers}} serving in the Israel Defense Forces, who join the tour. The stated purpose for the mifgash is for the participants and the soldiers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other and to better understand each other's world view and Jewish identity. Guided discussion sessions explore topics such as the Jewish tradition in the modern world, how Jewish life in Israel differs from Jewish life abroad, and how mandatory military service impacts young Israelis' perceptions of service and commitment to their country. More than 65,000 Israelis {{have participated in the}} program since 2000.|$|E

So we (meaning the team I introduced above) have put together a new section of this website where we can all pool our knowledge and experiences and drunken mishaps into one highly accessible and fun place.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{opportunities}} {{to take part in}} Residential trips for both fun and learning. Year 4 students go to Burwell {{near the end of the}} year and Year 6 students go to Brancaster quite promptly after the autumn term begins. At the beginning of Year 7, students and year staff go to Grafham Water to take part in team building exercises. This helps the year <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other and become closer. In Year 10, all students who can afford it go to Flanders, for a cross-curricular trip. Exchanges take place for all modern languages taught; The French Exchange in Years 8 and 9, and the others in Year 10. The Year 9 Ski trip and USA exchange are also very popular. In 2013 the 6th form went to Costa Rica (science expedition), in 2014 to Ladakh, India and in 2015 to Zanzibar, Tanzania.|$|E

500|$|The Giants started 4–2 in 2005. Then, on October 25, patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he worked for them as a ball boy. Except a tour of duty in the military during World War II, Mara spent his entire adult life with the team.

Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge, and Simon Cowell have both claimed to have come {{up with the idea of}} forming the band. In 2013, Cowell said that it [...] "took him 10 minutes to put them together as a group". Subsequently, the group got together for two weeks <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other and to practice. Styles came up with the name One Direction.

500|$|... "Break the Ice" [...] is an electro-R {{song with}} {{influences}} of the rave scene and crunk. It is {{performed in a}} moderate pop groove. The song is composed in the key of F minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. According to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Break the Ice" [...] sounds similar to Nelly Furtado's [...] "Say It Right" [...] (2006). It opens with Spears singing the lines [...] "It's been a while / I know I shouldn't keep you waiting / But I'm here now", which serve as an apology for being gone so long from the music industry as well as away from her love interest in the song. After the first line, Spears sings over a choir. According to Chuck Arnold of People, Spears delivers her [...] "trademark breathy vocals". In the first verse, synthesizers kick in and run {{until the end of}} the second chorus. After it, Spears stops the song and sings [...] "I like this part / It feels kind of good", mimicking Janet Jackson in [...] "Nasty" [...] (1986). The music changes, as described by Tom Ewing of Pitchfork Media, to [...] " [...] sounds like spacehoppers [...] bouncing in slow motion round a padded cell".

Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves hanging around the locker room and getting to know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured me. I could tell he disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E
