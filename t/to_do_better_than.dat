5|$|Industry analysts {{feared that}} the storm could seriously impact the box office {{prospects}} of two films opening that weekend, Identity Thief and Side Effects, {{both of which were}} seen as having potential <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> most winter movies. While it afterwards appeared that the two films were not seriously affected, and did better than expected, with Identity Thief even winning the weekend, despite generally poor reviews and word of mouth, with $36 million in receipts, overall box office was down 45% from the same weekend the previous year. Side Effects finished a distant third with a quarter of Identity Thiefs take. The clearest sign of the storm's effect, according to Box Office Mojo, was the 35% drop in earnings for Silver Linings Playbook, then in wide release after several Oscar nominations.|$|E
25|$|Now {{entering}} its ninth season, {{the venerable}} B31 was still Götz's car {{of choice for}} the Interserie. In the season opener, held at AVUS, Götz took third overall, and won Division II, for the car's best overall finish since 1979. He was slightly less competitive at the Österreichring, where he finished seventh overall, and fourth in his division; and he was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> 14th overall, and sixth in his division, at the Nürburgring. Götz then took another seventh overall, and fourth in his division, at Erding; however, {{this was followed by}} a successful race at Most, where he couldn't make the start of the race. The final round of the Interserie season, held again at the Nürburgring, was also unsuccessful; Götz could do no better than 16th, and seventh in Division II. He slipped to joint-sixth in the Driver's standings; level with Henri Pescarolo in a Porsche 956. Gotz switched to a March 832 for 1985, and the B31 would remain unused in that year, and 1986.|$|E
25|$|St Sylvesters {{were the}} first team to qualify for the second round as Erins Hope failed to field a team for the game. Defending champions UCD began their title race with a one-sided victory over Garda. St Judes beat Ballymun Kickhams convincingly and went on to the second round. Naomh Maur {{defeated}} O'Tooles sending them straight to the backdoor round and Naomh Mearnóg defeated their Fingal rivals Fingallians with Cillian O'Driscoll scoring a total of five frees for Mearnóg. Ballyboden will hope <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> their fourth round appearance in 2006 as they cruised past Trinity Gaels. Raheny defeated Parnells despite a late attempt by the opposition. St Marys beat Whitehall Colmcille with a late goal by substitute Kenneth Kelly. Former Sligo forward T Brennan impressed with seven points in Lucan Sarsfields four point win over St Annes. Na Fianna had a comfortable five point win over St Marks and St Brigids crushed a lacklustre Round Towers. Kilmacud Crokes beat St Vincents by two goals in what proved to be a disappointing game between two of Dublins highest rated teams. Plunkett's forward line proved too hot to handle for a gutsy Olaf's with solid performances from Alan Brogan and Jason Sherlock. Last years Intermediate champions St Peregrines lost their first senior game to Naomh Barróg. Ballinteer St Johns cruised into the second tound with a victory over Clontarf. Thomas Davis went on to play in the backdoor round against St Vincents as they lost to Erins Isle who progress to the next stage.|$|E

500|$|With its [...] "furious, anarchist edge", [...] "Gandhi Mate, Gandhi" [...] {{focuses on}} the {{distinction}} between social and economic stability, summarising capitalism as [...] "a long outdated system... that does nothing but divide and segregate us". The song {{has been seen as}} supporting the Occupy London movement; Reynolds called it a [...] "very frustrated and confused song" [...] reflecting the current Zeitgeist: [...] "People know we have the resources, the creativity, and the ingenuity <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> what we have at the moment and are struggling {{to come to terms with}} the short term love of money over the long-term stability and progression of our species." [...] The song focuses on two characters; Reynolds' vocals supply a revolutionary perspective, and Rory Clewlow's are those of a person in power. [...] "Gandhi mate, Gandhi" [...] has unconventional lyrics for its characters; [...] "Yabba Dabba do one, son" [...] was described by Reynolds as the product of a drunken MC battle, and during the song the other band members pause and urge Reynolds to calm down. Reynolds described [...] "Gandhi mate, Gandhi" [...] as a [...] "lively electro influenced dubstep" [...] and a [...] "rap rock pileup" [...] textured over [...] "wobbly dubstep bass".|$|E
2500|$|Leno did {{not expect}} his show to beat {{competing}} first-run episodes, but <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> reruns, in part because topical jokes benefit from the [...] "immediacy" [...] of the time slot versus 11:30 pm. A television analyst predicted that Leno would finish in [...] "a safe third place" [...] every night. NBC research before the show's debut indicated that fans of Leno would watch Leno {{two to three times}} a week.|$|E
2500|$|A {{critical}} review of 14 cases where VAN claimed 10 successes showed only one case where an earthquake occurred within the prediction parameters. The VAN predictions not only fail <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> chance, but show [...] "a much better {{association with the}} events which occurred before them", according to Mulargia and Gasperini. Other early reviews found that the VAN results, when evaluated by definite parameters, were statistically significant. Both positive and negative views on VAN predictions from this period were summarized in the 1996 book [...] "A Critical Review of VAN" [...] edited by Sir James Lighthill and in a debate issue presented by the journal Geophysical Research Letters that {{was focused on the}} statistical significance of the VAN method. VAN had the opportunity to reply to their critics in those review publications. In 2011, the ICEF reviewed the 1996 debate, and concluded that the optimistic SES prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the players}} {{who went to the}} West Indies, the only ones who had played against South Africa in the summer were Hutton, Evans, Cranston, Robertson, Howorth and Butler. Hardstaff and Ikin had been to Australia and New Zealand the {{previous}} winter. The other eight were Allen and seven newcomers: Dennis Brookes, Billy Griffith, Jim Laker, Winston Place, Gerald Smithson, Maurice Tremlett and Johnny Wardle. Playfair was disappointed with the situation in the West Indies, especially as England were well beaten in the Test series. The team, it said, [...] "could not be called great by any standards" [...] as it was too [...] "experimental" [...] but it at least seemed [...] "workmanlike" [...] and in Laker a new star had been discovered. Playfair ominously concluded its review by reference to the 1948 Australian team being [...] "about to descend upon us well armed in all key departments (and) we shall have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> this".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mixed}} reviews critics {{generally}} praised Lewis's voice but criticised the music. Lyndsey Winship from BBC Music complimented Lewis's vocal ability but perceived {{a lack of}} [...] "hooks, innovation and personality". On Lewis's vocals Robert Christgau commented [...] "The subtle flutter of her finest melismatics could give an open-minded person goose bumps. Her coarser melismatics, however, are the usual showoff BS and probably also a commercial prerequisite, like not having a harelip." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised Lewis's voice but criticised the mixture of styles within the album. The New York Timess Nate Chinen felt the album did {{not live up to}} the standards of lead single [...] "Bleeding Love", but was successful in showcasing Lewis's vocal capabilities. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian was disappointed, saying [...] " [...] has clearly invested every scrap of energy into these songs [...] but being able to belt 'em out is only half the story, and if there's a personality here, it's well hidden." [...] Victoria Segal of The Times praised Lewis's voice, but criticised the music, saying [...] " [...] has a powerful voice but on Spirit it seems to have paralysed her collaborators creatively. Instead of taking the opportunity to craft it into new and exciting shapes, it has been stuck in a big spotlit display case, revolving slowly and rather boringly on a velvet cushion of overstuffed balladry." [...] She concluded by saying, [...] "If Lewis is looking for the greatest love of all – public adoration – she will have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> this." ...|$|E

50|$|After {{the death}} of Fred Thorpe, he began to work by himself. Initially he did quite well, as a chimp detective {{was seen as a}} novelty.
