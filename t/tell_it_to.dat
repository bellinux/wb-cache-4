500|$|After 1974, Harrison {{no longer}} wrote songs as {{obviously}} Krishna-devotional as [...] "It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)", although {{he returned to}} recording bhajans intermittently, with songs such as [...] "Dear One" [...] in 1976 and [...] "Life Itself, released in 1981. In his book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes that following Dark Horse and the [...] "ill-fated 1974 tour", Harrison [...] "continued to infuse his work with an implicit spirituality that rarely manifested on the surface". Speaking to ISKCON devotee Mukunda Goswami in 1982, Harrison said: Back in the sixties, whatever we were all getting into, we tended to broadcast it as loud as we could. I had had certain realizations and went through a period where I was so thrilled about my discoveries and realizations that I wanted to shout and <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> everybody. But there's a time to shout it out and a time not to shout it out.|$|E
500|$|Gabriel Luna, who portrays Reyes, {{explained}} {{at the end}} of October 2016 {{that the}} confrontation between his character and the last member of the Fifth Street Locos gang in the episode [...] "Lockup" [...] revealed to Reyes that the accident that caused him to become Ghost Rider [...] "wasn’t just random, it was a hit, somebody ordered that, these guys were just the guys who carried it out—there’s a whole batch of new questions that Robbie has after that. In episode 6, we’re going to find out exactly how it happened, and we may find out why later." [...] Luna said that the series' take on Reyes' origin story would mix elements from Felipe Smith's original comic with [...] "this new angle that we’re approaching from, but that new angle still draws from the source material." [...] He also felt the episode's approach to revealing the story, by having Reyes <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his brother Gabe for the first time, was [...] "really interesting and powerful" [...] and the most surprising aspect of the script for him.|$|E

500|$|Khánh {{participated in}} the 1963 South Vietnamese coup that deposed Diệm, playing a minor role, {{although}} he {{claimed to be a}} key player. Khánh expected a large reward, but the junta instead sidelined him, excluding him from the twelve-man Military Revolutionary Council. In mid-December he was moved from the II Corps in the central highlands to the command of the I Corps based around Huế and Da Nang in the far north of the Republic of Vietnam. This, it was speculated, was to keep him far away from Saigon in an attempt to stop him from involving himself in politics. This was contrary to Khánh's request for a transfer to the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta close to Saigon, where most of the fighting was taking place. In an interview with journalist Robert Shaplen, Khánh made no attempt to hide his annoyance at not being given a more important job. With respect to the 1963 coup that overthrew and killed Diệm, he cryptically commented [...] "It is too soon yet to tell the whole story, but someday I will <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also reported that Khánh was motivated by a suspicion that Minh's junta knew he was untrustworthy and was going to give him an overseas government post to sideline him completely.|$|E
500|$|Straczynski viewed [...] "sitting {{down and}} ferreting out [...] story" [...] as {{a return to}} his journalistic roots. He also drew on his {{experience}} writing crime drama for the procedural elements of the plot. Straczynski said he had gathered so much information about the case {{that it was difficult}} to work out how to <b>tell</b> <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts he wanted to tell. He described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: [...] "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You start with her, and her story gets broader and broader and begins having impact from all kinds of places. The overlay on that was an upside down triangle with the base on top, which is the panorama of Los Angeles at that time—1928. And it begins getting narrower and narrower toward the bottom, bearing down on her." [...] Once Straczynski saw this structure, he felt he could write the story. He chose to avoid focusing on the atrocities of the Wineville murders in favor of telling the story from Collins' perspective; Straczynski said she was {{the only person in the}} story without a hidden agenda, and it was her tenacity—as well as the legacy the case left throughout California's legal system—that had attracted him to the project. He said, [...] "My intention was very simple: to honor what Christine Collins did." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, Rava asked Rabbah bar Mari where Scripture supports the saying of the Rabbis that if your neighbor (justifiably) calls you a donkey, you should put a saddle on your back (and not quarrel to convince the neighbor otherwise).
