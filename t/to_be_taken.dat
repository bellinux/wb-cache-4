5|$|The {{creators of}} the series likened themes of the episode to the Star Wars trilogy, {{referring}} to the revelations about Mulder's father, and Sophie's Choice, referring to how William Mulder was forced to choose Fox or Samantha <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b>|$|E

5|$|The written test {{as well as}} the {{practical}} exam has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> in the Czech language. Until 31 December 2011, test-takers were allowed to use a sworn interpreter/translator, but this has since been forbidden.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 International Energy Agency forum {{presented}} {{costs for}} managing intermittency {{as a function}} of wind-energy's share of total capacity for several countries, as shown in the table on the right. Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into account by adding 20% to the operating reserve, but it does not make the grid unmanageable. The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.|$|E
5|$|A serious {{accident}} occurred on 28 April 1980, when a three-coach train carrying 80 passengers from Dalmuir to Motherwell derailed at Hyndland West Junction, just after leaving Jordanhill. All the bogies {{on the leading}} coach left the rails, causing fifteen people (nine women and six men) to be injured seriously enough for them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to the Western Infirmary.|$|E
5000|$|The verb in a {{relative}} clause takes {{the same person}} (first, second, or third) and number (singular or plural) {{as that of the}} antecedent of the relative pronoun. In ("The people who were present ...") the antecedent of who is people (third person, plural), so the verb <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>takes</b> its form (<b>were)</b> for third person and plural number; in ("I, who am normally very tolerant, ...") who‘s antecedent is the pronoun I (first person, singular), so the verb <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>takes</b> its form (<b>am)</b> for first person and singular number.|$|R

5|$|After this tournament, the gambit {{finally began}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> seriously. Top players like Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch {{started to play}} it. Schlechter {{published}} in 1918 the monograph Die budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits, which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920, {{so much so that}} many White players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|An {{expedition}} {{was immediately}} {{prepared to take}} punitive action against the Ghassanids. Muhammad appointed Zayd ibn Harithah as {{the commander of the}} force. In the event of Zayd's death, the command was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> over by Ja`far ibn Abī Tālib, and if Jafar were to be killed, the command would {{be in the hands of}} `Abd Allah ibn Rawahah. In the event that all three were killed, the men of the expedition were to select a commander from amongst themselves.|$|E
5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces than at {{the other}} gates, so that Khalid {{would be unable to}} move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector. Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success were achieved in any sector other than the Gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited by sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough. Thomas ordered Khalid <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> alive.|$|E

5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features {{of the story that}} were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> up by Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus' love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is the introduction of the go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his love is unsuccessful, generous when it is.|$|E
5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, {{which might}} {{indicate that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime {{and what happens to}} him later seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E
5|$|Both of Tillingbourne's former garage {{sites in}} Cranleigh have been {{converted}} for other uses. Permission was granted in February 2002 {{for the smaller}} site abandoned shortly before the company closed down <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> over by a plant and vehicle hire firm. The larger site used in the final few months of operation was converted for use by a mail order firm, with permission for the change granted by the local council in November 2002.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} part of the East Coast State Railway (from Waltair <b>to</b> Vijayawada) <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> over by Madras Railway in 1901.

5|$|Care needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when {{machining}} hafnium {{because it}} is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled {{as if they were}} toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{renovation}} at {{the turn}} of the 20th century allowed St Briavels Castle <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> over as a Youth Hostel in 1948.

5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{when two}} or more rats from the same litter are {{of the same sex}} they live {{together}} with no disruptions but with the occasional friendly tussle and play fight. Although it is possible that rats from different litters can be integrated together, the integration process can be easy or hard. Several measures have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to provide security for both rats.|$|E
5|$|Harwood said {{he first}} {{realized}} on 8 April, {{when he saw}} the Guardian video, that Tomlinson had died. He reportedly collapsed at home and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to hospital by ambulance. Harwood and three colleagues made themselves known to the IPCC that day.|$|E
