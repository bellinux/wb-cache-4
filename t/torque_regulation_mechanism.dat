40|$|Although {{the quality}} of parent-adolescent {{emotional}} bonds has consistently been proposed as {{a major influence on}} young adult's psycho-emotional functioning, the precise means by which these bonds either facilitate or impede adaptive coping are not well-understood. In an effort to advance this inquiry, the present study examined interrelationships among measures of parental attachment, emotion regulation processes, and preferred coping strategies within a sample of 942 college freshmen. Structural Equation Modelling was used to test whether the link between attachment to parents and the use of particular coping strategies is mediated by differences in emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> As hypothesized, differences in attachment to parents predicted differences in the use of emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and coping strategies. More specifically, having a close emotional bond, feeling supported in autonomy processes and having (moderately) low levels of separation anxiety toward parents predict more constructive emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and coping strategies.

40|$|In Flanders (Belgium), {{distribution}} {{companies are}} {{to a large}} extent owned by the municipalities and as such these municipalities collect an important share of the profits from electricity distribution. This situation (by many it is seen as a hidden tax) cannot be maintained because, in the process of electricity market liberalisation, the ownership will be reshuffled and because the old <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> allowing for such cash flows, will be revised. This paper presents some simulations on the restructuring of the electricity distribution sector, using a partial equilibrium model. The focus of the simulations is on the impact of the choice of the <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanism</b> on prices and on the municipalities' budget. Three regulation schemes are simulated, 'rate-of-return' (ROR) regulation, 'constant profit per unit of output' (CPU) regulation and 'price-cap' (PC) regulation. The simulations show that, irrespective of the regulation scheme, it is not obvious that end-user electricity prices will decrease after the liberalisation. Moreover, the restructuring will have a large impact on the profits received by the municipalities. The sign of this impact depends on the <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that is imposed, but it appears that, from the three <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that were analysed, the ROR mechanism performs worst, both in terms of municipal cash flows and of economic welfare.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} risks in demand {{information}} sharing applications by electronic soft-orders using {{electronic data interchange}} (EDI) systems in e-commerce and aims to suggest a sustainable <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanism</b> with a trust-embedded contract. In a supply chain with one retailer and one supplier, the retailer solicits private forecasted demand and places soft-orders via EDI to the supplier. To ensure abundant supply, the retailer has an incentive to inflate her soft-orders, which potentially harms the credible information sharing and sustainability of business cooperation. Normally, {{the degree to which}} the supplier relies on the retailer’s order information is specified by trust, which is evaluated according to the retailer’s reputation and supplier’s intuition in this study. Based on standard game theory, we find that both the retailer’s order and the quantity of supplier prepared materials are independent of the retailer’s forecast. Therefore, EDI based information sharing in e-commerce without a <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanism</b> leads to inefficient demand information sharing. Since both the supplier and retailer are proved to faces huge of potential profit losses due to the failure of information sharing, the commerce by EDI based information sharing is full of risk and unsustainable. Therefore, a <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that leaded by the retailer is proposed to establish ‘win-win’ sustainable cooperation. Numerical experiments highlight the value of trust, the impact of reputation and intuition in decisions, and the effectiveness of the <b>regulation</b> <b>mechanism</b> by a cost-sharing contract...|$|R
