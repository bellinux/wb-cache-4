5|$|In 1957, Dr. Seuss's How <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> Stole Christmas! was {{published}} by Random House. The tale's rhyming verse accompanies illustrations by the author, and follows a disagreeable character called <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> and his attempts to thwart the arrival of Christmas by stealing the gifts, trims, and other trappings of the holiday from the happy Whos of Whoville. In spite of his attempts, Christmas arrives all the same.|$|E

5|$|NORAD's {{tracking}} of Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve, for example, was initiated in 1955 {{and has become}} an annual tradition. The stop motion animated film, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer remains an annual telecast on American televisionalmost fifty years after its debut, and Dr. Seuss's How <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> Stole Christmas! of 1957 has become a literary Christmas classic.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Grinch</b> realizes {{then that}} Christmas is {{something}} more than its trappings. The book criticizes the commercialization of Christmas and satirizes those who exploit the holiday. The tale was adapted into a 1966 short animated film for television with a screenplay by Seuss and narration by Boris Karloff. Later adaptations include a Broadway musical and a feature film in 2000 starring Jim Carrey.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Royal National Theatre {{created a}} stage {{version of the}} book, adapted and {{directed}} by Katie Mitchell. Seussical, a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in the Hat as narrator. The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters. The Cat also stars in the 1982 television film <b>The</b> <b>Grinch</b> Grinches the Cat in the Hat and the 2010 animated television series The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That! A ride at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, Florida, is based around The Cat in the Hat.|$|E

5|$|X-Men was {{originally}} released on VHS and DVD in November 2000, {{to take advantage}} of Thanksgiving in the United States. In its initial home video weekend, the film earned $60 million in rentals and direct sales, making it earn more than all films in theaters outside from leader How <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> Stole Christmas. X-Men finished 2000 as the seventh highest-grossing home release of the year with $141 million, with 78% being earned through sales. A new two-disc DVD version was issued in 2003 in anticipation to the theatrical release of sequel X2, titled X-Men 1.5.

25|$|In 1966, Geisel {{authorized}} eminent cartoon artist Chuck Jones – {{his friend}} and former colleague from the war – to make a cartoon version of How <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> Stole Christmas! Geisel was credited as a co-producer under his real name Ted Geisel, along with Jones. The cartoon was narrated by Boris Karloff, who also provided the voice of <b>the</b> <b>Grinch.</b> It was very faithful to the original book, and is considered a classic to this day by many. It is often broadcast as an annual Christmas television special. Jones directed an adaptation of Horton Hears a Who! in 1970 and produced an adaptation of The Cat in the Hat in 1971.|$|E
5000|$|This matchup {{quickly became}} {{known for the}} {{controversial}} comments made by Coach Barnum {{leading up to the}} game when he said, referring to Cedar City, Utah (home of SUU), [...] "I didn’t want to stay in Whoville.

5000|$|A longer, {{different}} {{version of}} this song, called [...] "Where Are You, Christmas?", was co-written by Mariah Carey, James Horner, and Will Jennings. The song was originally recorded by Carey, but because of a legal case with her ex-husband Tommy Mottola, {{it could not be}} released, so it was re-recorded and released by Faith Hill. A video was released featuring Hill singing from <b>the</b> <b>Grinch's</b> mountaintop home, interspersed with clips from the film and a cameo appearance by Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who.|$|R

25|$|After the war, Geisel {{focused on}} children's books once again, writing {{classics}} like If I Ran the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who!

5000|$|A {{dispute between}} two neighbors over extravagant Christmas decorations gained Monte Sereno {{attention}} in national news. Bonnie and Alan Aerts of Monte Sereno {{had for years}} showcased elaborate holiday displays, costing as much as US$150,000, on their front yard. The displays attracted large masses of visitors, resulting in great traffic around the normally quiet cul-de-sac of four houses. Neighbors Le and Susan Nguyen protested, and, in late 2003, the city council voted 3-2 (Nesbet, Brodsky, Wright for, Garner, Baxter against) to pass an ordinance regarding [...] "regulation of special events" [...] http://www.montesereno.org/details.php?type=agendas&id=88, http://www.montesereno.org/details.php?type=agendas&id=90 which would require permits for such displays. On the first Christmas season for which the law was effective (in 2004), the Aertses declined {{to apply for a}} permit, which would allow the Aerts's holiday display to be active only for 12 hours in a 72-hour period and would require a 30-day waiting period before a new 72-hour permit could be applied for. Instead, they erected a huge, 10-foot-tall Grinch on their lawn, who swayed from side while singing [...] "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch". <b>The</b> <b>Grinch's</b> outstretched arm pointed conspicuously at the home of the Nguyens. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6590930/ ...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2015, Telnaes {{created an}} {{animated}} political cartoon that responded to {{an ad for}} the presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, in which his 5- and 7-year old daughters appeared. The older daughter spoke in the ad, reading a line from a book called [...] "The Grinch Who Lost Her Emails" [...] in which she referenced <b>the</b> <b>Grinch's</b> use of a private email server — an obvious reference to the Hillary Clinton email controversy. In her cartoon, Telnaes portrayed {{the daughters of the}} senator as monkeys on leashes, with Cruz holding the leashes and grinding an organ. [...] In response to complaints, Telnaes then posted a comment that the Cruz children were [...] "fair game" [...] for her cartoon because [...] "Ted Cruz uses his children as political props." [...] Washington Post editor Fred Hiatt eventually retracted and deleted the cartoon and replaced it with the statement that [...] "It's generally been the policy of our editorial section to leave children out of it. I failed to look at this cartoon before it was published. I understand why Ann thought an exception to the policy was warranted in this case, but I do not agree." [...] Telnaes' [...] "fair game" [...] comment was also deleted.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in November 1999, the Opry {{was held}} at Ryman Auditorium for three months, {{partly due to the}} ongoing {{construction}} of Opry Mills. The Opry has returned to the Ryman for the three winter months every year since, allowing the show to acknowledge its roots while also taking advantage of a smaller venue during an off-peak season for tourism. While still officially the Grand Ole Opry, the shows there are billed as Opry At The Ryman. From 2002 to 2014, a traveling version of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular took up residence at the Grand Ole Opry House each holiday season while the Opry was away. It was replaced by Dr. Seuss' How <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> Stole Christmas! The Musical beginning in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Hopkins was Britain's highest paid {{performer}} in 1998, starring in The Mask of Zorro and Meet Joe Black, and {{also agreed to}} reprise his role as Dr Hannibal Lecter for a fee of £15 million. In 2000, Hopkins narrated Dr. Seuss' How <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> Stole Christmas. Hopkins received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003. Hopkins stated that his role as Burt Munro, whom he portrayed in his 2005 film The World's Fastest Indian, was his favourite. He also asserted that Munro was the easiest role that he had played because both men have a similar outlook on life. In 2006, Hopkins was {{the recipient of the}} Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement. In 2008, he received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the highest award the British Film Academy can bestow.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Seuss' How <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> Stole Christmas! was {{originally}} {{part of the}} strike, and shut down on November 10 like the other affected shows. The producers of this show were not members of the League, {{and because of the}} show's special schedule they had negotiated a separate contract with Local One that was not in dispute. On November 19, the union authorized its members return to work on the show. However, the owners of the St. James Theater, Jujamcyn Theatres, locked out both producers and stagehands, keeping the show closed. The producers then sought an injunction in the Manhattan Supreme Court to force the owners to reopen the theater, and on November 21 the judge granted the injunction, allowing the show to re-open on Friday, November 23 at 11:00AM. Jujamcyn Theatres had planned to appeal the ruling, but dropped the case, allowing Grinch to play its entire run.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Geisel and {{his wife}} moved to La Jolla, California where he {{returned}} to writing children's books. He wrote many, including such favorites as If I Ran the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who! (1955), If I Ran the Circus (1956), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> Stole Christmas! (1957), and Green Eggs and Ham (1960). He received numerous awards throughout his career, but he won neither the Caldecott Medal nor the Newbery Medal. Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as Caldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): McElligot's Pool (1947), Bartholomew and the Oobleck (1949), and If I Ran the Zoo (1950). Dr Seuss also wrote the musical and fantasy film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T, which was released in 1953. The movie was a critical and financial failure, and Geisel never attempted another feature film. During the 1950s, he also published a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in Redbook Magazine. Some of these were later collected (in volumes such as The Sneetches and Other Stories) or reworked into independent books (If I Ran the Zoo). A number have never been reprinted since their original appearances.|$|E

500|$|Michael A. Morrison {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} Dr. Seuss' How <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> Stole Christmas! on the film, writing that Jack parallels <b>the</b> <b>Grinch</b> and Zero parallels Max, the Grinch's dog. Philip Nel writes that the film [...] "challenges the wisdom of adults through its trickster characters", contrasting Jack as a [...] "good trickster" [...] with Oogie Boogie, whom he also compares with Dr. Seuss' Dr. Terwilliker as a bad trickster. Entertainment Weekly reports that fan reception of these characters borders on obsession, profiling Laurie and Myk Rudnick, a couple whose [...] "degree of obsession with [...] film {{is so great that}} ... they named their son after the real-life person that a character in the film is based on." [...] This enthusiasm for the characters has also been profiled as having spread beyond North America to Japan. Yvonne Tasker notes [...] "the complex characterization seen in The Nightmare Before Christmas".|$|E
5000|$|Real Racing 3 {{received}} mixed reviews. Critics {{praised the}} game's twenty-two car grid, its improved graphics {{and the addition}} of real-world tracks, but many were heavily critical of the game's freemium business model. The iOS version holds aggregate scores of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on thirty reviews (compared to scores of 88 and 94 for its predecessors), and 70.07% on GameRankings, based on fourteen reviews (compared to scores of 95.83% and 95% for its predecessors). Eurogamer's Martin Robinson was extremely critical, scoring the game 3 out of 10. He praised the gameplay, graphics, sound, use of real world tracks, controls and the TSM system, but felt every positive aspect of the game was negated by the freemium model; [...] "At a time when the gaming world is finally comfortable {{with the idea of a}} triple-A mobile game, Real Racing 3 should have been a triumphant affirmation of a point made convincingly enough by the first game in the series. Instead, it's been strangled by the tentacles of gaming's next unconquerable: free-to-play. If games like Dota and Tribes are the warm, welcoming faces of free-to-play, then Real Racing 3 is the grotesque polar opposite, <b>the</b> snarling <b>grinch</b> that's <b>the</b> embodiment of every sceptic's worst nightmare. It's cynical, it's nasty and it's hard-wired into the very fabric of the game, making it totally unavoidable ... There's a good game somewhere within Real Racing 3 - and there are plenty of free-to-play games that prove this model can work while respecting the player. Firemonkeys and EA have got that balance horribly, horribly wrong, to an extent where the business model becomes the game - with gut-wrenching results." ...|$|R
