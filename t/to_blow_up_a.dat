5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> block of flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. Interrupted, Blažek set the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{had been}} looking for someone to turn into a martyr for the Nazi cause. His first attempt was with Albert Leo Schlageter, a member of the Freikorps and a saboteur who was caught {{attempting}} <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> train in the Ruhr region while it was under occupation by French troops in retaliation Germany's not making its schedule of reparation payments. Schlageter was executed by the French, and his gravesite later became a Nazi shrine. There were also the 16 Nazis who had died during the Beer Hall Putsch, and would have a memorial built for them in Munich which was required to be saluted when passing by, and who were honored with a public ceremony every year when the Putsch was remembered.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, the {{situation}} remained tense in Tawau. A {{group of eight}} Indonesians were detained while trying to poison the water supply of the town. On 12 May 1964, there was a bombing attempt on the Kong Fah cinema. At the end of January 1965, a night time curfew was imposed in Tawau to prevent attackers from contacting the approximate 16,000 Indonesians living there. By the end of February 1965, 96 of the 128 Indonesian volunteers had been killed or captured, around 20 successfully retreated to Indonesia, and 12 remained at large. On 28 June 1965, an attempt by Indonesian troops to invade eastern Sebatik was repelled by a heavy bombardment by Australian destroyer HMAS Yarra. In August 1965, an unknown assailant made an attempt <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> high-tension electricity pylon while in September 1965, a logging truck was destroyed by a land mine.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{explicit}} supersymmetric deformation of supergravity backgrounds describing D 3 -branes on Calabi-Yau cones.

In the field theory, we identify this deformation with motion on non-mesonic directions in the full moduli space of vacua.

25|$|The fifth game mode, Robbery, {{is similar}} to Powder Keg, with one team the attackers and one the {{defenders}}. The attackers need <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> bank vault and steal three bags of gold. The defenders attempt to defend the bank and the gold. This mode is played in two rounds with each side alternating as attacker and defender. In the sixth game mode, Greed, players are to deliver as many gold sacks as possible to their team's drop zone. Once a gold sack spawns on the map, both teams fight to bring the sack to their respective areas. Once a team successfully brings the gold sack to their zone they gain a point and a new round begins.|$|E

Shah, managing director of Mukand Ltd., helped them find contacts for procuring dynamite, used extensively in quarries around Halol (near Baroda). They aimed at blowing up toilets in government offices and cause explosions near the venue of public meetings to be addressed by Indira Gandhi. The idea was not to injure anybody, but only create a scare. The explosions were to be carried out either late in the night or hours before the public meeting was to begin to avoid injury.

Wiretappers recorded nine telephone calls between Parmar's residence in Vancouver and Reyat from either his residence or workplace on Vancouver Island that month, which got Reyat added to the list of persons being monitored for terrorist activities. The Canadian government would later accuse Reyat of lying in 2003 when at first {{he said he did not}} know what three clocks he had bought could be used for. He later said Parmar needed an explosive device <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> bridge or something large in India, and that he needed timers for an explosive device.
