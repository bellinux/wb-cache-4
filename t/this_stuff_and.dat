We exist in a cinematic universe, [...] the mythology {{of the universe is}} connected, but they look very different, tonally they’re very different… That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into Daredevil or what’s come before? And the answer is no." [...] On references or [...] "easter eggs" [...] in the season, Rosenberg explained that [...] "A little is always there and in the writer’s room we have some fanboys that know all <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>and</b> they’re all geeking out with different stuff....a lot of references are to the [...]" [...] She also said that nods to the larger MCU are in the season, with each episode having a [...] "little something in it." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2012, 20th Century Fox {{announced}} plans {{to create their own}} shared universe, consisting of Marvel properties that it holds the rights to including the Fantastic Four and X-Men, with the hiring of Mark Millar as supervising producer. Millar said, [...] "Fox are thinking, 'We're sitting on some really awesome things here. There is another side of the Marvel Universe. Let's try and get some cohesiveness going.' So they brought me in to oversee that really. To meet with the writers and directors to suggest new ways we could take <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>and</b> new properties that could spin out of it." [...] , released in 2014, was Fox's first step towards expanding their stable of Marvel properties and creating this universe, ahead of the release of a Fantastic Four reboot film the next year. However, in May 2014, Days of Future Past and Fantastic Four screenwriter Simon Kinberg stated that the latter film would not take place in the same universe as the X-Men films, explaining that [...] "none of the X-Men movies have acknowledged the notion of a sort of superhero team—the Fantastic Four. And the Fantastic Four acquire powers, so for them {{to live in a world}} where mutants are prevalent is kind of complicated, because you're like, 'Oh, you're just a mutant.' Like, 'What's so fantastic about you?' ... they live in discrete universes." [...] In July 2015, X-Men director Bryan Singer said that there was still potential for a crossover between the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises, if reaction to Fantastic Four and [...] warranted it.|$|E
500|$|James Villas is {{a former}} food editor for Town & Country magazine. The back flap of the book's jacket notes that Villas was [...] "beguiled by bacon {{since he was a}} boy." [...] Prior to The Bacon Cookbook, Villas had written other cookbooks {{including}} The Glory of Southern Cooking, My Mother's Southern Kitchen, and Biscuit Bliss. The Bacon Cookbook is his 15th book on food. In the lead-up to the 2009 International Bacon Day, Villas commented to Pork Magazine, [...] "People are starting to realize that bacon is no longer just a breakfast staple. Bacon is, without a doubt, one of the most versatile and flavorful options in the grocery aisle. Most importantly, a little bacon goes a long way. A sprinkle can enhance not only the flavor, but also the aroma and appeal of nearly any dish. We’re seeing chefs and home cooks add bacon to dishes you wouldn’t expect, like popcorn or cookies, and take traditional tastes to another dimension." [...] Villas explained to Salon, [...] "Bacon has the perfect balance of sweet, salty, smoky flavor, and the perfect balance of meaty and crispy texture." [...] Villas commented to CBS News that his book was part of a growing interest in bacon products, [...] "We have a lot more conscientious producers today, you know, really turning out fresh great product like we've got here in this store. I mean quality bacon. And America really should be out there searching for <b>this</b> <b>stuff.</b> <b>And</b> it'll change your life. It will really change your life." ...|$|E

Known for his individuality, {{he was the only}} Australian cricketer to declare himself {{unavailable}} to tour Zimbabwe in 2004 on moral grounds. He also refused to appear in an advertisement for Cricket Australia sponsor KFC, saying: [...] "The problem for me is that KFC and Cricket Australia are hitting parents where they’re vulnerable. Parents are already {{under a lot of pressure}} from kids to buy <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>and</b> when you get the Australian cricket team endorsing it you just increase that pressure.

2500|$|According to Gomez, one of {{the main}} inspirations behind the track was the body-shaming she dealt with from tabloids and social media, after photos {{surfaced}} online of the singer in a bikini during a trip to Mexico in April 2015. [...] Many claimed she gained weight, with some news outlets going as far as to label her a [...] "mess", and suggested Gomez was [...] "going off the deep end". She commented: [...] "I was getting a lot of hate for my body and ‘you’re gaining weight,’ and so I was in Mexico and I was just feeling all of <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>and</b> I would be lying to you if I said it didn’t kind of hurt my feelings, but I kind of channeled that into my music." [...] Gomez called the experience [...] "degrading", explaining that she had never been through intense bullying before.|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who argue}} for Ivins' innocence {{claim that the}} anthrax used in the attacks was too {{sophisticated}} to be produced by a lone researcher without relevant training. [...] "In my opinion, there are maybe four or five people {{in the whole country}} who might be able to make <b>this</b> <b>stuff,</b> <b>and</b> I'm one of them," [...] said Richard O. Spertzel, former deputy commander of USAMRIID. [...] "And even with a good lab and staff to help run it, it might take me a year {{to come up with a}} product as good." [...] The spores in the Daschle letter were 1.5 to 3 micrometres across, many times smaller than the finest known grade of anthrax produced by either the US or Soviet bioweapons programs. An electron microscope, which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, would be needed to verify that the target spore size had been consistently achieved. The presence of the anti-clumping additive silicon in the anthrax samples also suggests a high degree of sophistication as specialists working at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory were unable to duplicate this property despite 56 attempts.|$|E
