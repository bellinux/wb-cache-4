His work on it gave Jones the foresight to pitch another show he knew the network would want. Initially unsure if {{he was ready to}} pitch AJ's Infinite Summer, the network rejected the pilot the first time he did but approved it on the second, after he had reworked it throughout a few months. Jones contrasted the physical limitations of animating in <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> the animation of the pilot itself. He cited having the character of AJ run up a wall in one scene as an example of this.|$|E

5|$|Mercer's {{greatest}} passion however {{was reserved}} for the Canadian militia, which he joined as a student in 1881.

Her relationships offered her the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> pursue her social work while being supported emotionally and romantically. From her exclusively romantic relationships with women, she would most likely be described as a lesbian in contemporary terms, similar to many leading figures in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom of the time.|$|E

On his retirement, he gave all his <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> public service for art. A trustee of the Whitney Museum beginning in 1981 and its vice president when he died, Ganz was the only active trustee to have served on all its acquisition committees.

500|$|Speer devoted {{much of his}} <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> reading. Though {{the prisoners}} brought some books with them in their {{personal}} property, Spandau Prison had no library so books were sent from Spandau's municipal library. From 1952 the prisoners were also able to order books from the Berlin central library in Wilmersdorf. Speer was a voracious reader and he completed well over 500 books {{in the first three}} years at Spandau alone. He read classic novels, travelogues, books on ancient Egypt, and biographies of such figures as Lucas Cranach, Édouard Manet, and Genghis Khan. Speer took to the prison garden for enjoyment and work, at first to do something constructive while afflicted with writer's block. He was allowed to build an ambitious garden, transforming what he initially described as a [...] "wilderness" [...] into what the American commander at Spandau described as [...] "Speer's Garden of Eden".|$|E

500|$|Twentieth century {{historian}} Christopher Hibbert describes Lehzen as [...] "a handsome woman, {{despite her}} pointed nose and chin, clever, emotional, humourless." [...] Though she at first feared Lehzen's stern manner, [...] "dear, good Lehzen" [...] soon came {{to occupy a}} place in Victoria's heart that superseded all others, including her own mother, the Duchess of Kent. Lehzen encouraged the princess to distrust {{her mother and her}} mother's friends, and to maintain her independence. The governess was uninterested in money and lacked ambition for herself, instead choosing to devote her <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> the princess. Victoria took to calling Lehzen [...] "Mother" [...] and [...] "dearest Daisy" [...] in private, writing Lehzen was [...] "the most affectionate, devoted, attached, and disinterested friend I have." [...] As part of the controlling Kensington System devised by Conroy, after 1824 Victoria was to be accompanied by Lehzen at all times during the day; consequently Lehzen was not allowed out to leave Victoria's side until the Duchess dismissed her at nighttime, and was required to hold the princess' hand when Victoria descended a staircase.|$|E
500|$|Dorothee Pesch {{was born}} in Düsseldorf, Germany on 3 June 1964, {{the only child of}} Walter, a truck driver, and Barbara Pesch. Doro's first memory of rock music is the song [...] "Lucille" [...] by Little Richard, which she sang when she was three years old. She learned to play piano and started singing at the age of ten years, when she was exposed to the glam rock of bands like T. Rex, Sweet and Slade. When she was sixteen and after a {{life-threatening}} form of tuberculosis, she decided to dedicate more of her <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> singing, without giving up her study of graphic design. In 1980, she was accepted in her first band called Snakebite, which was playing rock music in a Düsseldorf basement used as rehearsal space by many other underground groups. The first recording with Doro on vocals was a cheap 7-track demo released by Snakebite for promotion. When Snakebite disbanded in 1981, Doro went on to sing for the garage bands Beast and Attack, before forming Warlock with Peter Szigeti, Rudy Graf, Thomas Studier, and Michael Eurich in 1982.|$|E
500|$|Single {{and having}} no children, Anthony had the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> do the {{speaking}} and traveling that Stanton {{was unable to}} do. Their skills complemented each other; Stanton, the better orator and writer, scripted many of Anthony's speeches, while Anthony was the movement's organizer and tactician. Stanton once wrote to Anthony, [...] "No power in heaven, hell or earth can separate us, for our hearts are eternally wedded together." [...] Likewise, when writing a tribute that appeared in The New York Times when Stanton died, Anthony described Stanton as having [...] "forged the thunderbolts" [...] that she (Anthony) [...] "fired." [...] Unlike Anthony's relatively narrow focus on suffrage, Stanton wanted {{to push for a}} broader platform of women's rights in general. While their opposing viewpoints led to some discussion and conflict, no disagreement threatened their friendship or working relationship; the two women remained close friends and colleagues until Stanton's death some 50 years after their initial meeting. While always recognized as movement leaders whose support was sought, Stanton and Anthony's voices were soon joined by others who began assuming leadership positions within the movement. These women included, among others, Matilda Joslyn Gage.|$|E
