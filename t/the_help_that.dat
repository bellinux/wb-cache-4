5|$|In 1918, Halifax sent a Christmas tree to the City of Boston in {{thanks and}} remembrance for <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>that</b> the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee {{provided}} {{immediately after the}} disaster. That gift was revived in 1971 by the Lunenburg County Christmas Tree Producers Association, which began an annual donation of a large tree to promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge Boston's support after the explosion. The gift was later {{taken over by the}} Nova Scotia Government to continue the goodwill gesture as well as to promote trade and tourism. The tree is Boston's official Christmas tree and is lit on Boston Common throughout the holiday season. In deference to its symbolic importance for both cities, the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{was hoping}} to gain support from the West, and more {{specifically}} from the Pope. However, <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>that</b> he received was modest in numbers. The Hungarian Kingdom sent 1,800 Hungarians, while Poland sent 2,000 horsemen. Stephen recruited 5,000 Székely soldiers. The Moldavian army consisted of twenty cannon; light cavalry (Călăraşi); elite, heavy cavalry – named Viteji, Curteni, and Boyars – and professional foot soldiers. The army reached a strength of up to 40,000, of whom 10,000 to 15,000 comprised the standing army. The remainder consisted of 30,000 peasants armed with maces, bows, and other home-made weapons. They were recruited into Oastea Mare (the Great Army), into which all able-bodied free men {{over the age of}} 14 were conscripted.|$|E

Couhig said that his weak showing may have been a reflection of his inability to convince voters how his vision differed from the other Republican candidates. He noted that he spent $500,000 of his own money on the race despite bleak prospects.|$|E
25|$|Evolution has a {{different}} meaning {{in terms of the}} lizards. Leslie and Sarah are literally evolving. They were creatures that lived in the sea but apparently developed beyond their species. They were compelled to move to the land, though they do not really understand why. Though Leslie and Sarah are somewhat fearful of the change, they do accept <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>that</b> Nancy, enthusiastically, and Charlie, reluctantly, give them. At the end of the play, rather than go back into the sea where they might feel safer, they remain on land.|$|E
25|$|Watson's {{merger of}} {{diplomacy}} and business {{was not always}} lauded. During the 1930s, IBM's German subsidiary was its most profitable foreign operation, and a 2001 book by Edwin Black, IBM and the Holocaust, argues that Watson's pursuit of profit led him to personally approve and spearhead IBM's strategic technological relationship with Nazi Germany. In particular, critics point to the coveted Order of the German Eagle medal that Watson received at the Berlin ICC meeting in 1937, as evidence {{that he was being}} honored for <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>that</b> IBM's German subsidiary Dehomag (Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH) and its punch card machines provided the Nazi regime, particularly in the tabulation of census data (i.e. location of Jews). Another study argues that Watson believed, perhaps naively, that the medal was in recognition of his years of labor on behalf of global commerce and international peace. Within a year of the Berlin congress though, where Watson's hopes had run high, he found himself strongly protesting the German policy toward the Jews. Because of his strong feelings about the issue, Watson wanted to return his German citation shortly after receiving it. When Secretary of State Hull advised him against that course of action, he gave up the idea until the spring of 1940. Then Hull refused advice, and Watson sent the medal back in June 1940. Dehomag's management disapproved of Watson's action and considered separating from IBM. This occurred when Germany declared war on the United States in December 1941, and the German shareholders took custody of the Dehomag operation. But during World War II, IBM subsidiaries in occupied Europe never stopped delivery of punch cards to Dehomag, and documents uncovered show that senior executives at IBM world headquarters in New York took great pains to maintain legal authority over Dehomag's operations and assets through the personal intervention of IBM managers in neutral Switzerland, directed via personal communications and private letters.|$|E

The track featured Harrison on vocals, harmonium {{and all other}} instruments, and vocal contributions from Mal Evans and assistant engineer Eddie Klein. That same month, Harrison finished his production work on Starr's 1971 single [...] "It Don't Come Easy", the basic track for which they had recorded with Voormann in March at Trident. Aside from his contributions to projects by Starr, Clapton, Preston and Ashton during 1970, over the following year Harrison would reciprocate <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>that</b> his fellow musicians on All Things Must Pass had given him by contributing to albums by Whitlock, Wright, Badfinger and Keys.|$|E

5000|$|Significant {{concerns}} {{had been}} raised about her proficiency in French, especially {{given the fact that}} 98 percent of Berthier-Maskinongé's residents are francophone and 77 percent of them don't speak English at all. At a press conference held the day after Brosseau's election, Thomas Mulcair, then the NDP co-deputy leader and Quebec lieutenant, addressed her language issues. While conceding that Brosseau's command of French was [...] "not at a level we would expect for a riding like Berthier—Maskinongé," [...] he personally promised to [...] "help organize her office" [...] and [...] "give her all <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>that's</b> needed." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{validity}} of <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>that</b> is provided to guests {{has been called}} into dispute; professional psychotherapist and TV agony uncle Philip Hodson, who was offered {{the chance to work}} on the show claimed that he believed the ratings were more important to the show's producers than solving the guests' problems. A former producer for the show claimed that the production team encourages guests to react angrily to one another. This is strengthened {{by the fact that the}} high-octane music that plays whenever a guest appears is actually played live and not edited in, serving to deliberately incense or upset guests (or heighten their already increased emotional state) as they reach the stage and enter a conflict. [...] It has also been alleged that the producers [...] "plied an alcoholic guest with beer before he appeared on the programme". ITV has denied these charges, claiming that [...] "two of the guests were given alcohol to counteract withdrawal symptoms while the third had not mentioned a drink problem", that [...] "guests are not deliberately agitated before appearing", and that the show provides to its guests [...] "proper, professional help, funded by the programme, which has really and undeniably helped hundreds of people".|$|E
2500|$|Josephus only cited Menander as a {{means to}} {{authenticate}} themes of his own writings. One such theme was the antiquity of the Jewish people, for which Josephus summoned Menander and several other non-Jewish historians to support his case. In terms of chronology, the earliest event to which Josephus calls Menander as his witness is the reign of Solomon. In Ant. 8.5.3, Josephus describes <b>the</b> <b>help</b> <b>that</b> Hiram, king of Tyre, provided for the building of Solomon's Temple. A description of Hiram's building projects in Tyre is then quoted from Menander in order to show the historicity of the Hiram mentioned in the Bible. A few other details about Hiram are added, including an exchange of riddles between Solomon and Hiram. In Ant. 8.13.2, the drought in Israel in the days of Elijah (1 Kings 17 and 18) is equated, by Josephus, with a drought that Menander said occurred in the days of Ethbaal (Ithobaal I, 878-847 BC), king of the Tyrians. In Ant. 9.14.2, after relating that Shalmaneser V was responsible for the destruction of Samaria (2 Kings 17:3-6), Menander is cited as bearing witness to the existence of Shalmaneser. Here Menander says that the king of Tyre during this time was named Eluleus, who reigned 36 years, and who successfully endured a siege of five years started by Shalmaneser.|$|E
