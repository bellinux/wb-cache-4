Materials and methods we investigated 458 consecutive patients who were admitted with blunt thoracic and/or abdominal trauma caused by road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> between 1986 and 1999. Vascular trauma was encountered in 54 patients (12 %). Results the injured vessels were located in the abdomen in 45 patients and in the chest in nine patients. Mesenteric vessels were the most frequently injured vessels (33 / 45) in the abdomen, while the aorta and major vessels were most frequently injured (9 / 9) in the chest. Injury to the large/small intestine was often associated with mesenteric vessel injury (26 / 27). In the 190 patients with blunt abdominal organ injury, the frequency of mesenteric vessel injury was also highest, regardless of the injured organ.

40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>accident</b> <b>reconstruction</b> {{has been}} defined as the effort to determine, from {{whatever}} evidence is available, how an accident happened. <b>Traffic</b> <b>accident</b> <b>reconstruction</b> can be treated as a problem in uncertain reasoning about a particular event, and developments in modeling uncertain reasoning for artificial intelligence can be applied to this problem. Physical principles can usually be used to develop a structural model of the accident and this model, together with an expert assessment of prior uncertainty regarding the accident's initial conditions, can be represented as a Bayesian network. Posterior probabilities for the accident's initial conditions, given evidence collected at the accident scene, can then be computed by updating the Bayesian network. Using a possible worlds semantics, truth conditions for counterfactual claims about the accident can be defined and used to rigorously implement a 'but for' test of whether or not a speed limit violation could be considered a cause of an accident.

The Investigations and Risk Management Group of TRL Limited has been researching and developing applications for 3 D laser scanning technology in <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> investigation and <b>reconstruction.</b> Laser scanning systems can rapidly capture vast amounts of data thereby allowing such systems to ‘preserve’ incident scenes. This data also provides a source for the construction of detailed three dimensional models which can be used in vehicle dynamics simulation and incident animation. Applications of this technology in <b>accident</b> investigation and <b>reconstruction</b> include the spatial measurement of physical evidence at <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> scenes, including: vehicle positions, vehicle damage, tyre and other road marks, debris, the road geometry and that of the surrounding environment. Preliminary studies have determined that the use of laser scanning systems could allow significant time savings {{to be made in the}} measurement of complex road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> scenes as well as capturing significantly more spatial data at such scenes than is possible using surveying systems such as total station. Laser scan data has been used to generate detailed road surface models, in the form of dense three dimensional meshes. These surfaces can be used for complex vehicle dynamics simulations where the precise geometry of the road surface is important to the simulation. Laser scanning systems also allow detailed geometric data to be captured at sites where such data is difficult or impractical to measure using other means. As the use of laser scanning systems at incident scenes (or sites) typically involves the measurement of areas surrounding the road such as topography, buildings, vegetation etc., this information can be used to construct detailed three dimensional environments to enhance computer simulations, or within which to animate the circumstances of an incident. This paper describes the use of laser scanning systems at incident scenes and presents examples of the use of ‘scan’ data in the development of complex vehicle dynamics simulations and animated incident sequences.

This study proposed a Google Map-based accident reconstruction system integrating functions of crash scene diagramming and crash simulation. The modulus of crash scene diagramming includes positioning of accident location, Google satellite map and Google Sketch Up to accurately present road geometry and accident vehicle position information. The modulus of crash simulation refers to the vehicle dynamic differential equations generated using the Newton-Euler formulation, and enhances with the calculation of momentum conservation in the collision to predict the vehicle dynamics after collision.

40|$|Abstract: Throughout {{the last}} decade {{forensic}} scientists, technicians and police have employed a number of 3 D measurement tools for crime scene and accident reconstruction. These have ranged from the basic, such as EDM instruments, to the complex, namely terrestrial laser scanners. In the field of <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> <b>reconstruction,</b> close-range photogrammetry is now being adopted, {{primarily because of the}} greatly reduced on-scene time, which leads to shorter periods of traffic disruption. The fact that a permanent visual record is also obtained, from which 3 D measurements can be made at any time, is a further notable benefit. However, for successful application of close-range photogrammetric techniques in accident reconstruction a few important issues must first be dealt with. These include accommodation of the generally very poor, near-planar network geometry encountered and the need for maximum ease of use, from which follows the requirement for highly automated processing and fully automatic camera calibration. This paper reports upon two innovative developments undertaken to enhance the applicability of close-range photogrammetry and consumer-grade digital cameras to accident reconstruction. The developments comprise a new approach to robust on-line image orientation and a method for automatic camera calibration which employs colour coded targets. They are highlighted via the iWitness system, which has been developed primarily for accident scene reconstruction and forensic measurement applications. 1...|$|E
