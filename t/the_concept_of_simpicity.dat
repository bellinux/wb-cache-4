Kaufman reformulates <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God. For Kaufman <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> world and nature are religiously relevant {{insofar as they}} call for a theology for our contemporary life centred in this world rather than in some metaphysical beyond. This study examines how Kaufman articulates a <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God {{that is not necessarily}} bound by the traditions of a particular religion, but also whether he offers a <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God for <b>the</b> so-called 'secular' modern world. Chapter one examines how Kaufman conceives of the difference between world and nature. Chapter two relates <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> these <b>concepts</b> to <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God as well as Kaufman's treatment of revelation in light of his attempts to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God. Chapter three considers some of Kaufman's recent suggestions for reformulating <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> God that take into account the relativist and historicist perspectives...|$|R
