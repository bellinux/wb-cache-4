5|$|Although {{the match}} results were {{encouraging}} {{for such a}} young and inexperienced team, Craig scored only 103runs at 14.71. Despite his contributions as a leader, this was not up to standard. He had <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> defence, being bowled eight times in 17innings. In the 12 matches {{in the last three}} months of the tour, Craig passed fifty only once in 13 innings. However, the selectors did not have to reverse their youth policy: Craig contracted a bout of hepatitis before the start of the 1958–59 season. He returned to cricket at the beginning of the season, but was underprepared, scoring two ducks in his only two innings of the season, the second coming against the touring England team. Craig declared that he was not ready for a return to Test cricket and relinquished the captaincy, which the selectors handed to Benaud. Benaud went on to defeat England 4–0; as England were widely regarded as the best team at the time, this established him as captain of a resurgent Australia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Lucas di Grassi {{challenged}} Jarno Trulli for the lead, but Trulli closed the racing line into turn one. As Trulli lost the rear end of the car going into turn three, di Grassi took the lead. The other Audi Sport Abt of Daniel Abt was less fortunate, being sent into a spin at the same corner, dropping {{to the back of the}} field. Nelson Piquet, Jr. immediately made up for ground lost in qualifying, gaining three positions during the first lap, running in tenth place. At turn six on the following lap, he went past Stéphane Sarrazin (Venturi) for ninth. While di Grassi built an early lead, several manoeuvres were made behind him, with Nicolas Prost (e.dams-Renault) losing two positions to Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Dragon Racing) and Vitantonio Liuzzi (Trulli GP), dropping back to seventh. Pole sitter Jarno Trulli looked to be in <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> car and lost positions continuously, running in thirteenth after lap twelve. Third placed Nick Heidfeld was also unable to hold onto his podium position, being overtaken by d'Ambrosio on lap thirteen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Big Boo and Doggett's {{friendship}} continues to develop. Seeing that Doggett bears strong {{feelings of guilt}} relating to the six abortions that she has had, Big Boo makes reference to the book Freakonomics, which suggests that crime rates in the 1990s fell because of Roe v. Wade. Following Lorna Morello (played by Yael Stone) being relieved of her duty of driving the prison van, the role is given to Doggett. She comes into contact {{with one of the}} new correctional officers called Charlie Coates (played by James McMenamin). Coates is initially friendly towards Doggett. Despite relationships between prison staff and prisoners being forbidden, Coates kisses Doggett, against her will, after feeding some ducks. Following another outing, Coates gets in <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> boss Joe Caputo (played by Nick Sandow) for being late for count and is placed on probation. Doggett apologises for having caused him trouble, and he rapes her {{in the back of the}} prison van.|$|E

25|$|Sturt {{returned}} to Adelaide with his family, arriving back in August 1849. He was immediately appointed Colonial Secretary {{with a seat}} in the council. There was no lack of work in the ensuing years. Roads were constructed, and navigation on the Murray was encouraged. But Sturt had renewed <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> eyes.|$|E
25|$|Busby {{returned}} as manager in December 1970, though the 1970–71 season also ended without a trophy. Best {{began to get}} into <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> discipline: he was fined by the Football Association for receiving three yellow cards for misconduct, and he was suspended by United for two weeks after missing his train to Stamford Bridge so as to spend a weekend with actress Sinéad Cusack.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s Cross began to {{experience}} <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> eyes, which grew more severe in the 1900s. He also increasingly suffered from arthritis. At {{least in part}} due to these health issues that plagued him for years, Cross's body of work is relatively small. However, in his last years he was productive and very creative, and his work was featured in significant solo exhibitions; he received great acclaim from critics and enjoyed commercial success.|$|E

25|$|Shoaib Malik first played tape-ball cricket in {{the streets}} as a child. He began playing cricket seriously in 1993/94 when he {{attended}} Imran Khan's coaching clinics in Sialkot. He began as a batsman, and developed his bowling later. He used to get in <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> family for playing cricket, as {{they wanted him to}} focus on his education. In 1996, Malik attended trials for the U-15 World Cup. He was selected in the squad for his bowling.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 Edwards hit <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> party {{over its}} {{proposal}} to nationalise the {{iron and steel}} industry. He spoke out against the proposal, based on his experience in the industry; which his local party felt was going back on election pledges to support it. In April 1948, the local party passed a resolution declaring that they had lost all confidence in him and calling on him to resign his seat. Edwards declared he would ignore the resolution. He intensified his criticism, describing the Civil service and efficiency as a contradiction in terms.|$|E
25|$|After {{playing in}} the Rockets' first 10 out of 11 games to start the 2014–15 season, Howard missed 11 {{straight}} due to a strained right knee before returning to action on December 13 against the Denver Nuggets. In just under 30 minutes of play, he recorded 26 points and 13 rebounds to help the Rockets defeat the Nuggets, 108-96. To add to his return, Howard recorded his 10,000th career rebound during the second quarter. However, on January 31, 2015, Howard was ruled out for a further month due to persistent <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> right knee. After setbacks forced him out for a further month {{and a total of}} 26 games, Howard returned to action on March 25 against the New Orleans Pelicans. He started the game but was held under 17 minutes by coach Kevin McHale and finished with just four points and seven rebounds in a 95-93 win.|$|E

25|$|Ejō's {{tenure as}} abbot {{attempted}} {{to keep things}} at Eihei-ji as they were. Unfortunately, he was not gifted with Dōgen's keen leadership abilities, {{and he had the}} most <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> former fellow students of the Darumashū, who saw him as an equal and not an authority figure. Problems also arose with the question of a successor. Dōgen had clearly considered Tettsū Gikai a preeminent disciple, which Ejō well knew. However, he disliked Gikai's desire to reintroduce aspects of Darumashū practice that Dōgen had rejected, and Dōgen himself had commented on his lack of compassion in his interactions with other monks. Nonetheless, Ejō formally made Gikai his heir in January 1256 after making him agree to uphold Dōgen's teachings above all else. After this, Ejō sent Gikai on a pilgrimage of Zen temples in Japan, which Gikai voluntarily extended to include a visit to China, whence he returned in 1262.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, he was shot, which {{affected}} his control of his right-hand. His temporary fix to this possibly long-term problem was to work together with Cristina during every one of his surgeries so that she could take over in case he might have <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand. The arrangement fell apart after Cristina, reacting to growing stress after George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) caught onto their secret, went to the Chief and confessed everything. Initially, he was engaged in a cold war with Cristina, where neither of them spoke. However, after she broke the silence, he proposed to her and she accepted his proposal. Before their secret was revealed, Burke was to become the next Chief of Surgery, but he had to compete with his fellow attendings for the position. He has since recovered from the injury, after Derek operated on him. For the remainder of the season, Preston and Cristina prepared for the wedding and experienced normal stresses that result from such a process, such as meeting each other's parents.|$|E
25|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. In the first practice session, {{which took place in}} dry and sunny weather conditions, Hamilton was fastest with a time of one minute and 26.187 seconds, six-tenths of a second faster than Button in second who held the fastest time until Hamilton's lap and Rosberg third. Alonso was fourth-fastest, ahead of Magnussen in fifth and Vettel sixth. Kimi Räikkönen, Pérez, Daniil Kvyat and Nico Hülkenberg rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. During the session, where several drivers noted the hard compound tyre took longer than ancipitated to reach their optium working temperature, and multiple drivers went off the track while acquainting themselves with their low-downforce set-ups, Ricciardo had <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> DRS and his session ended early when he entered the pit lane with a suspected energy recovery system problem and Magnussen struggled with rear-braking issues.|$|E

25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, but he got into <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E
25|$|In June 1986 Mehmet and Ali start a cab {{firm called}} 'OzCabs' from a corner table in Ali's Café. Mehmet is married with three children, but monogamy is one {{sanctity}} of marriage {{that he is}} {{more than willing to}} overlook. Later that month punk Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) catches his eye, and so he bets his sceptical brother £10 that he can get Mary to have sex with him. Mary is well aware that Mehmet's intentions are dishonourable and initially refuses to have sex with him, but Mehmet persists and she finally relents and spends the night with him. A triumphant Mehmet then collects his winnings and gloats to his brother in the café. However, Mary overhears their entire conversation and she then sets about trying to get revenge on him by hoax calling his cab-firm and vandalising his car. Later in the year Mehmet acts as Pat Wicks's (Pam St. Clement) pimp, setting her up with clients on a regular basis and he even persuades Pat to convince Mary to go prostitute herself too. He also gets involved in Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) Knitting business, later conning her and disappearing with all her profits. After he gets into more <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> customers for overcharging on fares and then trying to seduce Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe) — the wife of his employee — the residents of Albert Square decide to confront him. Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) find him and give him a severe beating which involves having his arms pinned behind his back whilst taking a number of blows to the stomach.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} week, he {{teamed with}} Atlantis against Último Dragón and Keiji Mutoh but his team lost after Atlantis hit Rey Bucanero by accident. For the following weeks, Bucanero kept having <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> teammates and magazines hinted at a possible face turn. Later that month, Averno and Mephisto {{turned on him}} during an Arena México match. Shortly afterwards, Tarzan Boy and Guerrero turned on him as well, ripping his tights, signifying {{he was no longer}} a member of Los Guerreros.|$|E

500|$|He {{attended}} Breckenbeds Junior High School, {{then the}} Heathfield Senior High School, {{both in the}} Low Fell area of Gateshead. He was noticed by football scouts while playing for Gateshead Boys, though failed to impress in a trial at Ipswich Town. Further trials at Middlesbrough and Southampton also proved unsuccessful, before the team he supported, Newcastle United, signed him as a schoolboy in 1980. He was usually overweight whilst signed to Newcastle and frequently got into <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> friend Jimmy [...] "Five Bellies" [...] Gardner, particularly when the pair were taken to court and fined over a hit and run incident.

500|$|Doctor Who {{novelist and}} Faction Paradox creator Lawrence Miles posted a scathing review of [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] on the Internet {{within an hour}} of its broadcast, {{focusing}} on a perceived political subtext suggesting that asylum seekers (the Gelth) are really all evil and out to exploit liberal generosity (the Doctor). He criticised the script for promoting xenophobia and [...] "claiming that all foreigners were invaders", especially as the top stories in the news were about immigration into Britain. The review produced considerable backlash on the Internet, mainly over his comments about writer Mark Gatiss. Miles was personally contacted and ran into <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> publishers. Miles deleted the review and posted a revision, though the original is still available on another of his websites.|$|E
