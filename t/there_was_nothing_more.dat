The only open course therefore had to be to take a firmer line with Portugal. Two days later, on 7 September, Wilson discussed the matter with Hughes and Stewart, and agreed with their conclusions, telling them to proceed.|$|E

On their way they were continuously illuminated by German searchlights and were hit at least six times by the German guns. Passing ML 270, they ordered her to follow and made smoke to hide both boats.|$|E

25|$|While {{the allies}} were at Brussels making dispositions to {{march to the}} relief of Mons, Saxe slipped down the Scheldt with {{the main body of}} the army towards his real target; one column on the left bank of the river, and two columns on the right to cover the march and engage the allies in battle. The capture of Tournai would {{consolidate}} and extend the gains that had been made in the previous campaign, and provide the French with the key to the approaches of Ghent and Oudenarde, threatening British communications with Ostend and the sea. Yet the siege was also a decoy for a much more original manoeuvre – the prompt engagement of the enemy in a place favourable to the French army, and at a time before the allies could reach their full strength. Although Saxe favoured movement over siege warfare he knew <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> likely to provoke an early encounter than to threaten one of the allies' larger fortresses, which only the most confident and able commander could ignore.|$|E
25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the Salon des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I can see it clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear in the Salon des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E
500|$|The International Union of Operating Engineers (called Operators for short) {{represented}} {{the men and}} women who sat at the controls of the heavy equipment used on the construction of the pipeline. This equipment included bulldozers, cranes, drilling rigs, and sidebooms—a cross between a bulldozer and a crane that could lay a section of pipe in a trench parallel to its tracks. Because most of the heavy equipment was unheated, six operators were typically assigned to each piece of equipment, allowing for frequent breaks. A popular joke on the pipeline was that the sole qualification to be an Operator was, [...] "Must be able to sit on a sideboom at 40 below and not freeze up." [...] More seriously, one laborer wrote, was that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> terrifying than to be in a trench and have a drunken or unskilled Operator handling the pipe that was being laid in the trench.|$|E

The staff of Gameranx rated [...] "this Mortal Kombat femme fatality" [...] as the second-sexiest female villain in gaming, writing: [...] "She’s gorgeous, packs a punch, and is infused with evil from birth. How much more badass can you go?" [...] Placing Mileena 18th on his 2013 list of the most brutal fighters in Mortal Kombat, Hanuman Welch of Complex described her as a [...] "deadly mixture of Kitana's agility and seduction, and Baraka's impulsive behavior." [...] Mileena and Kitana were among the top ten [...] "hottest" [...] female villains in gaming and [...] "old-school hotties that still got it" [...] by Travis Hubert of Cheat Code Central in 2014. Márcio Pacheco Alexsandro of Brazil's Game Hall placed them both at second spot of his top list of female ninja characters in games, calling Mileena [...] "beautiful and monstrous" [...] and adding that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> [...] "cool" [...] than a ninja who is both sexy and insane.|$|E

[...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but I have a feeling that the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E

Truman, {{in which he said}} of Roosevelt, [...] "all of France loved him".|$|E
2500|$|Senna {{was married}} to Lilian de Vasconcelos Souza from 1981 until 1982. Vasconcelos, whom he had known since childhood, had {{difficulty}} adapting to her husband's racing life in England. Vasconcelos later said: [...] "I was his second passion. His first passion was racing... <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> important {{in the world for}} him, not family, not wife, nothing." [...] Though he did not have much of an income early in his racing career, Senna insisted on supporting his wife with no help from his father {{out of a sense of}} pride. The marriage ended in divorce. Senna then courted Adriane Yamin, daughter of an entrepreneur from São Paulo, who was 15 years old when they began the relationship in 1985 and often chaperoned by her mother during meetings with Senna. They were briefly engaged, but the relationship was broken off by Senna in late 1988. Senna dated Brazilian TV star Xuxa from late 1988 until 1990. He then dated Christine Ferracciu, who lived with him at his homes in Monaco and Portugal, on and off between 1990 and 1991. Senna also had an affair with American model Carol Alt, and briefly dated models Marjorie Andrade and Elle Macpherson. At the time of his death, Senna was in a relationship with Brazilian model, and later TV personality, Adriane Galisteu.|$|E

2500|$|At seventeen, {{rather than}} repeat Grade 11, Sim {{dropped out of}} high school. [...] His {{explanation}} was that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> he could learn from school that would further his career as a cartoonist. [...] He wrote and drew comics throughout his adolescence, and began submitting work to fanzines. [...] His first published work was some articles in the comics fanzine Rocket's Blast Comicollector. [...] He had submitted artwork as well, and although it was rejected, Sim struck up a relationship with editor Gabe Quintanilla, who encouraged him to continue submitting material to fanzines. [...] Sim convinced Now & Then Books owner Harry Kremer to allow him to produce a newsletter called Now & Then Times. [...] The first issue arrived in the summer of 1972. [...] He produced another issue in 1973, but had begun devoting his time to John Balge's Comic Art News and Reviews, another Canadian comics fanzine. [...] For CANAR he did interviews with subjects such as Barry Windsor-Smith. [...] Sim also worked on [...] "Oktoberfest Comics", a one-shot that featured his [...] "Beavers" [...] characters and was published by Harry Kremer. [...] During this time, he continued to hone his drawing craft by copying the artists he most admired in his comic book collection. [...] He became friends with artist Gene Day in 1974, with whom he had corresponded since 1973. [...] Sim was inspired by the older Day's perseverance, keeping at drawing comics despite the small financial reward. [...] He came to believe that Day's volume of output would be a key to success, and adopted Day's work ethic. [...] The two worked together on a proposed character called [...] "The Partisan" [...] which they hoped would run in Jim Waley's Orb Magazine.|$|E
2500|$|On June 20, 2017, the day after. The {{opposition}} political party, National Action Party (PAN) {{denounced the}} Mexican {{government to the}} Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for suspicions of violations towards human rights and requested them, to lead an investigation citing such spying causes violations towards the article 16th of the Mexican Constitution, as well as violating article 11th of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While, {{in response to the}} accusations, Peña Nieto made public that such technology was bought and indeed used by the Mexican government, but he denied misuses, and stated that it was only used to protect Mexicans by searching for criminal by saying he [...] "also felt spied upon, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> fake than blaming the (Mexican) government", and that there was [...] "no proof"; saying he ordered the PGR an investigation and that he hoped [...] "under the law, it can be applied against those that have raised false accusations against the government.", with {{the last part of the}} quote making journalist hacking victims feel threatened. Which forced the Mexican president to call writer of the article Azam Ahmed to tell him, he was not menacing him. However, due to his previous presidential scandals, Peña Nieto words lacked credibility to most Mexicans, with journalist like Jorge Ramos complaining about how Enrique Peña Nieto remains in power despite his illegal actions. Later on the day political rival Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) who competed for the presidency against EPN in 2012 and intends to compete again in 2018 as the candidate from the MORENA political party, was also revealed to be among the hacking targets, with his son also as a target. On June 23, 2017, the National Human Rights Commission (Mexico) opened a case regarding the government espionage.|$|E
