25|$|Eclecticism is {{not open}} to the {{superficial}} objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which {{is not in the}} individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.|$|E

500|$|This {{problem of}} {{explaining}} introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general {{in terms of}} third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the explanatory gap. There are several different views {{of the nature of}} this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind. David Chalmers and the early Frank Jackson interpret the gap as ontological in nature; that is, they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because physicalism is false. There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other. An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as Thomas Nagel and Colin McGinn. According to them, the gap is epistemological in nature. For Nagel, science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required. We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently. For McGinn, on other hand, the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations. We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants. Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem. This semantic problem, of course, led to the famous [...] "Qualia Question", which is: Does Red cause Redness? ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{wide range}} of Marian devotions are {{followed}} by Catholics ranging from simple Rosary recitations to formalized, multi-day Novenas to activities which do not involve any prayers, such the wearing of scapulars or maintaining a Mary garden. Two well known Marian devotions are the Rosary recitation and the wearing of the Brown Scapular. Following their joint growth in the 18th and 19th centuries, by the early 20th century the Rosary and the devotional Scapular had gained such a strong following among Catholics worldwide that the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1914 stated: [...] "Like the Rosary, the Brown Scapular has become the badge of the devout Catholic." [...] In his encyclical Rosarium Virginis Mariae Pope John Paul II {{emphasized the importance of}} the Rosary. The Mariological basis of the Scapular devotion is effectively the same as Marian consecration, as discussed in the dogmatic constitution Lumen gentium of the Second Vatican Council, namely the role of the Virgin Mary as [...] "the mother <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order of grace" [...] which allows her to intercede for [...] "the gift of eternal salvation".

2500|$|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals ( [...] ; 1785; {{also known}} as the Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, Grounding of the Metaphysics of Morals and the Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals) is the first of Immanuel Kant's mature works on moral {{philosophy}} and {{remains one of the most}} influential in the field. Kant conceives his investigation as a work of foundational ethics—one that clears the ground for future research by explaining the core concepts and principles of moral theory and showing that they are normative for rational agents. Kant aspires to nothing less than this: to lay bare the fundamental principle of morality and show that it applies <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> text, Kant provides a groundbreaking argument that the rightness of an action is determined by the character of the principle that a person chooses to act upon. Kant thus stands in stark contrast to the moral sense theories and teleological moral theories that dominated moral philosophy at the time he was writing. [...] Central to the work is the role of what Kant refers to as the categorical imperative, the concept that one must act only according to that precept which he or she would will to become a universal law.|$|E
2500|$|Willis {{is also a}} quilter, also {{incorporating}} photographic images {{into her}} pieces. Daddy's Ties: The Tie Quilt II from 1992 (27 x 34"), for example, is a fabric collage with added button, tie clips, and pins forming [...] "a supple, irregularly shaped memorial." [...] The work references multiple generations and genders, as it elicits memories of fathers teaching their sons, boys maturing into adult clothes and rituals, and women adjusting their husbands' knots. At the same time, however, the artist's cutting and reconfiguration of the ties {{raises the possibility that}} such nostalgic references might be outmoded or rejected. This multivalent collage [...] "also memorializes black soldiers who fought in World War II," [...] since Willis includes photos of soldiers on linen fabric collaged onto the tie fabric. Willis's focus on the African-American experience is evident in Tribute to the Hottentot Venus: Bustle (1995), a fabric and photo linen collage (23 x 28") in a triptych format. Small images of Saartjie Baartman, the so-called [...] "Hottentot Venus," [...] appear in the left and right sections together with pieced fabric silhouettes of her body.

2500|$|Different Hebrew {{sources for}} the MT and the LXX. Evidence {{of this can be}} found {{throughout}} the Old Testament. Most obvious are major differences in Jeremiah and Job, where the LXX is much shorter and chapters appear in different order than in the MT, and Esther where almost one third of the verses in the LXX text have no parallel in the MT. A more subtle example may be found in Isaiah 36.11; the meaning ultimately remains the same, but the choice of words evidences a different text. The MT reads [...] "...al tedaber yehudit be-'ozne ha`am al ha-homa" [...] The same verse in the LXX reads according to the translation of Brenton [...] "and speak not <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jewish tongue: and wherefore speakest thou in the ears of the men on the wall." [...] The MT reads [...] "people" [...] where the LXX reads [...] "men". This difference is very minor and does not affect the meaning of the verse. Scholars at one time had used discrepancies such as this to claim that the LXX was a poor translation of the Hebrew original. With the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, variant Hebrew texts of the Bible were found. In fact this verse is found in Qumran (1QIsaa) where the Hebrew word [...] "haanashim" [...] (the men) is found in place of [...] "haam" [...] (the people). This discovery, and others like it, showed that even seemingly minor differences of translation could be the result of variant Hebrew source texts.|$|E
2500|$|Some Christians {{note that}} the Christian faith teaches [...] "salvation is by faith", [...] "But as for you, {{continue}} in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which {{are able to make}} you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus." [...] The Holy Bible, New International Version. International Bible Society. 1984. and that faith is reliance upon the faithfulness of God. The most extreme example of this position is called fideism, which holds that faith is simply the will to believe, and argues that if God's existence were rationally demonstrable, faith in its existence would become superfluous. Søren Kierkegaard argued that objective knowledge, such as 1+1=2, is unimportant to existence. If God could rationally be proven, his existence would be unimportant to humans. It is because God cannot rationally be proven that his existence is important <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Justification of Knowledge, the Calvinist theologian Robert L. Reymond argues that believers should not attempt to prove the existence of God. Since he believes all such proofs are fundamentally unsound, believers should not place their confidence in them, much less resort to them in discussions with non-believers; rather, they should accept the content of revelation by faith. Reymond's position {{is similar to that of}} his mentor Gordon Clark, which holds that all worldviews are based on certain unprovable first premises (or, axioms), and therefore are ultimately unprovable. The Christian theist therefore must simply choose to start with Christianity rather than anything else, by a [...] "leap of faith". This position is also sometimes called presuppositional apologetics, but should not be confused with the Van Tillian variety.|$|E
