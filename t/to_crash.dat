30|$|According <b>to</b> the <b>crash</b> data, {{the injury}} {{severity}} {{of each individual}} involved is coded on a four—point ordinal scale: (1) fatal injury, (2) serious injury, (3) moderate injury, and (4) slight injury. Fatal injury refers <b>to</b> <b>crashes</b> that result in immediate death or subsequent death within 30  days of the accident; serious injury refers <b>to</b> <b>crashes</b> that require hospitalization for 2  weeks or more; moderate injury refers <b>to</b> <b>crashes</b> that require hospitalization from 1  day to 2  weeks; and slight injury refers <b>to</b> <b>crashes</b> that require hospitalization for 24 -h or less, or no hospitalization at all.|$|R

5|$|After Brokeback Mountain {{lost the}} Academy Award for Best Picture <b>to</b> <b>Crash,</b> many accused the Academy of {{homophobia}} and {{for making a}} non-groundbreaking choice, and commentators including Kenneth Turan and Nikki Finke derided the Academy's decision.

5|$|Among the German claimants was Helmut Lent who was {{credited}} with two victories. After landing at Jever from a patrol, Lent took off to intercept. He engaged Herbie Ruse's Wellington, killing most of the crew. The Wellington was pouring black smoke, and Lent broke off believing it about <b>to</b> <b>crash.</b> Lent then pursued Officer Thompson's Wellington, which crashed just {{off the coast of}} Borkum. Lent's third claim was not granted: he attacked and downed Flying Officer Wimberley's aircraft, but because the aircraft was already badly damaged and judged to be about <b>to</b> <b>crash,</b> Lent was refused the victory. Instead, Stab./JG 1's Geschwaderkommodore Schumacher was given the credit. Schumacher also shot down Pilot Officer Lewis's aircraft, close to Borkum. At 13:45, the German fighters—at the limit of their endurance—returned to base. By 14:05, the other bomber formation was beyond interception range and the last shots were fired.|$|E
5|$|Emmy passed within 135miles (215km) of the Lesser Antilles, {{though only}} minor effects were experienced.

5|$|In New Jersey, {{high winds}} downed power lines, which killed two people. Along the coast, high waves damaged boardwalks and caused flooding.

5|$|Lock was {{the first}} of three {{successful}} RAF aces who were shot down during this period: Douglas Bader was shot down in error and taken prisoner on 9 August 1941; Robert Stanford Tuck's Spitfire was hit by enemy ground-based flak near Boulogne-sur-Mer on 28 January 1942 and he was forced <b>to</b> <b>crash</b> land and taken prisoner. In July 1942, Paddy Finucane would be lost in similar circumstances to Lock.|$|E
50|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, if the two {{vehicles}} {{have similar}} physical structure, crashing into another car is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>crashing</b> into a rigid surface (like a wall) at half of the closing speed. This means that rear-ending a stationary car while travelling at 50 km/h (30 mph) is equivalent, in terms of deceleration, <b>to</b> <b>crashing</b> into a wall at 25 km/h (15 mph). The {{same is true for}} the vehicle crashed into. However, if one of the vehicles is significantly more rigid (e.g. the rear of a truck) then the deceleration is more typically reflected by the full closing speed for the less rigid vehicle.|$|R
30|$|Why do the {{reactive}} attention capture mechanisms, identified above, sometimes {{fail and}} lead <b>to</b> <b>crashes?</b> As a companion {{question to the}} afore-mentioned one, {{the focus is on}} different forms of inattention including fatigue, sleepiness and cognitive load.|$|R

5|$|September 3, 1821 — The 1821 Norfolk and Long Island {{hurricane}} {{results in}} severe damage on Long Island and {{is accompanied by}} storm surge of 13 feet (4 m). High wind causes a ship <b>to</b> <b>crash</b> on Long Island killing 17 people.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him <b>to</b> <b>crash</b> was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus <b>to</b> <b>crash</b> in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E

On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.|$|R

5|$|A storm {{causes the}} ship <b>to</b> <b>crash,</b> {{and the group}} awakens to {{discover}} that a glacier blocks the reinforcements' path. While investigating the glacier, the group finds Sherincal, a half-dragon, guarding the entrance to an Aurilite temple. They learn that Sherincal leads the Legion of the Chimera's western forces, and that {{the leaders of the}} Legion of the Chimera, cambion twins named Isair and Madae, reside in the Severed Hand. Inside the Aurilite temple, the group finds a prisoner from Kuldahar, who asks them to warn Kuldahar of the threat posed by the Legion of the Chimera. After this, the group creates a passage through the glacier, and meets with the reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|After Indiana {{returned}} to active duty, she {{participated in the}} invasion of Hollandia in western New Guinea. The ship then {{returned to}} the central Pacific and bombarded Truk, and subsequently took part in operations off the Marianas Islands. On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack the ship, but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage to the ship. Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot down, but a third managed <b>to</b> <b>crash</b> into the ship. The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side armor plates and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern. Five men were injured, but the ship suffered only very slight damage.|$|E
40|$|Motorcycle riders {{constitute}} an increasing proportion of deaths and injuries due <b>to</b> road <b>crashes.</b> Further, older riders represent an increasing proportion of motorcycle riders, with particular concern {{for those who}} have returned to riding after a substantial break (returned riders). These riders seem reluctant to undertake any sort of refresher training. In a motorcycle simulator task continuing riders performed best, followed by newly licensed riders, and then returned riders, though that result did not extend <b>to</b> <b>crashes</b> that occurred in the simulator...|$|R
50|$|Highway safety {{engineering}} is {{a branch of}} traffic engineering that deals with reducing the frequency and severity of crashes.

40|$|Although {{rental cars}} {{experience}} a higher collision rate per registered vehicle compared to non-rental cars, {{little research has}} been conducted to understand the differences in the factors contributing <b>to</b> <b>crashes</b> involving rental cars and non-rental cars, especially driver related factors. This study develops a conceptual framework to compare the driver-related factors contributing <b>to</b> <b>crashes</b> involving rental cars and non-rental cars and tests the hypotheses developed using data from South Korea and applying the binary logistics, rare event logistic, Firth logistic models and random parameters logit models. We find significantly higher contribution of several risky driving behaviors but no differences in roadway, vehicle and environmental factors. We also find that rental car crashes involve more male and drivers under 25 years of age...|$|R
