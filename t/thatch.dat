5|$|The native kentia palm (known {{locally as}} the <b>thatch</b> palm {{as it was}} used to <b>thatch</b> the houses of the early settlers) is now the most popular {{decorative}} palm in the world. The mild climate of the island has evolved a palm which can tolerate low light, a dry atmosphere and lowish temperatures – ideal for indoor conditions. Up to the 1980s the palms were only sold as seed but from then onwards only as high quality seedlings. The nursery received certification in 1997 for its high quality management complying with the requirements of Australian Standard AS/NZS ISO 9002.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{was used}} for beams, and for lintels, even in masonry structures. Throughout Maya history, common huts and some temples {{continued}} to be built from wooden poles and <b>thatch.</b> Adobe was also applied; this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the woven-stick walls of huts. Like wood and <b>thatch,</b> adobe was used throughout Maya history, even after the development of masonry structures. In the southern Maya area, adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available.|$|E
30|$|The {{study also}} showed {{that there is a}} major loss of natural resources, such <b>thatching,</b> and {{firewood}} are lost as a result of wildland fires. These observations are in agreement with the eco-feminist theory, which argue that women, girls and children are the most affected by wildland fires as firewood becomes scarce causing rural girls to travel long distance in search of firewood and <b>thatching</b> grass for <b>thatching</b> their huts.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, the {{independent}} Timeform organisation gave <b>Thatching</b> {{a rating of}} 98, thirty-five pounds below their top-rated three-year-old Ile de Bourbon. In the following year, <b>Thatching</b> was rated 131 by Timeform and rated the best sprinter of the year. In the official International Classification <b>Thatching</b> was rated the second-best older horse in Europe and the fifth best horse of any age after Three Troikas, Troy, Ile de Bourbon and Le Marmot.|$|R

5|$|The Horseshoes is a Grade II listed {{residential}} thatched cottage, {{which was}} originally the Three Horseshoes public house, a 17th-century pink-painted cottage built {{to follow the}} curve of the road. April <b>Thatch</b> is a former public house, now a Grade II listed residential property. This white-painted early 18th-century cottage used to be the Rose & Crown.|$|E
5|$|A {{circle of}} Bronze Age stone coffins {{was found on}} the Drumpellier estate in 1852. A number of other Bronze Age urns and relics have been found in Coatbridge. An Iron Age wood and <b>thatch</b> crannóg {{dwelling}} was sited in the Loch at the present day Drumpellier Country Park. Dependent upon the water level in the loch, the remains can still be seen today.|$|E
5|$|Danybryn Cheshire Home {{was once}} a private house owned by Sir Lewis Lougher MP. It later had two wings added to {{accommodate}} the residents, who are physically disabled young people. The <b>Thatch,</b> the only thatched cottage in Radyr, was built for the Mathias family in 1936. St John the Baptist parish church is nearly 800 years old, but underwent a Victorian restoration in the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thatching</b> was {{retired from}} racing to {{stand as a}} {{breeding}} stallion at Coolmore's Longfield Stud at Cashel, County Tipperary at an initial fee of £8,000. <b>Thatching</b> was euthanized at Castlehyde Stud, County Cork in 1999 due to infirmities of old age.|$|R
50|$|The {{leasehold}} arrangements concerning <b>Thatched</b> House Lodge {{differ from}} the arrangements relating to other royal residence leased from the Crown Estate, Royal Lodge and Bagshot Park, leased by the Duke of York and Earl of Wessex respectively. In particular the Crown Estate never made a contribution towards restructuring <b>Thatched</b> House Lodge, {{as it did in}} the case of Royal Lodge and Bagshot Park, showing the non-commercial considerations which influenced those leases as opposed to <b>Thatched</b> House Lodge.|$|R

5|$|Early Medieval architecture's secular {{buildings}} were simple constructions mainly using timber with <b>thatch</b> for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture {{ranged from a}} synthesis of Hiberno—Saxon monasticism, to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Durham Castle and Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|The reserve's {{location}} {{means that}} migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers {{when the weather}} conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities, including a western sandpiper in 2012, a displaying great snipe in 2011, a trumpeter finch in 2010 and a collared pratincole in 2009. In order to maintain a good habitat, parts of the reed bed are cut and sold for <b>thatch</b> each year to establish a mosaic of plants of different ages.|$|E
5|$|Antankarana {{homes are}} {{typically}} raised on stilts above ground level. Young men seeking {{to start a}} family typically leave their father's house and build their own from wood and <b>thatch</b> gathered locally. After marrying a young woman will leave her family's home to move into her husband's house, where she manages the household and assists in planting and harvesting rice. The husband is responsible for earning money for basic necessities and farming the family's land. A young couple typically receives furniture and other essentials as wedding gifts from friends, family and community members. Divorce and remarriage are common in Antankarana society.|$|E

5000|$|Significant {{salt marsh}} {{regeneration}} and planting of <b>Thatching</b> grass (Gahnia filum) {{has been done}} at the wetlands. This included the removal of invasive woody weed boxthorn (Lycium ferocissimum). This weed species competes with the <b>Thatching</b> grass, which {{is necessary for the}} survival of the Yellow Sedge-Skipper (Hesperilla Flavescens).|$|R
5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get {{quite close to}} their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves before reaching the target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and {{would be used to}} ignite straw or <b>thatch</b> roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
5|$|Housing {{and social}} {{organization}} among the Mikea {{can vary from}} one individual or community to the next. Some Mikea remain in the forest their entire lives, while others live {{part of their lives}} in villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of virgin forest in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of <b>thatch</b> and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for three to five years as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses. During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups that relocate deeper into the forest to settle near babo tuber patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and <b>thatch</b> sunshades, and some individuals not living in shelters at all. In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Milo <b>Thatch,</b> a {{cartographer}} and linguist at the Smithsonian Institution who is marginalized for {{his research}} on Atlantis, believes that he has found The Shepherd's Journal, an ancient manuscript that contains directions to the lost island. After the museum board declines his proposal {{to search for the}} journal, a mysterious woman, Helga Sinclair, introduces Milo to Preston B. Whitmore, an eccentric millionaire. Whitmore has already funded a successful effort to retrieve the journal as repayment of a debt to Milo's grandfather, recruiting Milo to lead an expedition to Atlantis, as soon as he receives it.|$|E
5000|$|Reed {{is used in}} {{many areas}} for <b>thatching</b> roofs. In the British Isles, common reed {{used for this purpose}} is known as Norfolk reed or water reed. However [...] "wheat reed" [...] and [...] "Devon reed", also used for <b>thatching,</b> are not in fact reed, but long-stemmed wheat straw.|$|R

5|$|In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier {{working for}} the East India Company, {{estimated}} the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but it was presumably an overestimation. There were few brick buildings in the town. The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a custom house. Most of the houses were made of wood and <b>thatch.</b> The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were made of stone and brick. There were also {{a considerable number of}} Arabs and their descendant in Kuala Terengganu.|$|E
5|$|It is counted {{little better}} than a kite, for it is of ravenous quality, and is very mischievous; it will steal and carry away any thing it finds about the house, that is not too heavy, tho' not fit for its food; as knives, forks, spoons and linnen cloths, or {{whatever}} it can fly away with, sometimes they say it has stolen bits of firebrands, or lighted candles, and lodged them in the stacks of corn, and the <b>thatch</b> of barns and houses, and set them on fire; but this I only had by oral tradition.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about their {{behaviour}} until the field studies of Birutė Galdikas, who became a leading authority on the apes. When she arrived in Borneo, Galdikas settled into a primitive bark and <b>thatch</b> hut, at a site she dubbed Camp Leakey, {{near the edge of}} the Java Sea. Despite numerous hardships, she remained there for over 30 years and became an outspoken advocate for orangutans and the preservation of their rainforest habitat, which is rapidly being devastated by loggers, palm oil plantations, gold miners, and unnatural forest fires.|$|E

5|$|The City was {{essentially}} medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded warren of narrow, winding, cobbled alleys. It had experienced several major fires before 1666, {{the most recent}} in 1632. Building with wood and roofing with <b>thatch</b> had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used. The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, surrounded by an inner ring of overcrowded poorer parishes whose every inch of building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population. These parishes contained workplaces, {{many of which were}} fire hazards—foundries, smithies, glaziers—which were theoretically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and <b>thatch,</b> Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)). Nor would anonymous bone fragments have been of much interest to the hungry people sifting through {{the tens of thousands of}} tons of rubble and debris after the fire, looking for valuables, or to the workmen clearing away the rubble later during the rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|When Norfolk {{was first}} settled, homes {{were made of}} wood and frame construction, similar to most medieval English-style homes. These homes had wide {{chimneys}} and <b>thatch</b> roofs. Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682, the Georgian architectural style, which was popular in the South at the time, was used. Brick was considered more substantial construction; patterns were made by brick laid and Flemish bond. This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions, Palladian windows, balustraded roof decks, and two-story porticoes. By 1740, homes, warehouses, stores, workshops, and taverns began to dot Norfolk's streets.|$|E
