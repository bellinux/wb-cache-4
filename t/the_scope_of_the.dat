5|$|The {{meaning of}} the word law in Article 9(1) has a direct bearing on <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} customary international law principles), <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E

5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not within <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
5|$|Images of meth mouth {{are usually}} {{considered}} disturbing {{and have been}} used in anti-drug campaigns, even being placed on hoardings/billboards. The condition is often mentioned in media coverage of methamphetamine, and it has been included in media portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug's effects or to provoke disgust in the audience. Opponents argue that the term is used to negatively stereotype methamphetamine users, and that it is falsely portrayed as inevitable or characteristic.|$|E
40|$|The article {{looks at}} <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{introduction}} <b>of</b> Union citizenship on <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty. In particular it considers how the citizenship provisions {{have affected the}} personal and <b>the</b> material <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty. By virtue of Article 17 EC <b>the</b> personal <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty is expanded so that any Union citizen, and not only the migrant citizen, now falls within <b>the</b> personal <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty. <b>The</b> significance <b>of</b> this finding then depends on <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty, i. e. on <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rights that Union citizens can claim qua citizens. In this respect, {{it is clear that}} Union citizens have a right to move; and a right to reside in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Member States (subject to limitations and conditions). Union citizens have also a right to equal treatment deriving from Article 12 EC. In this respect, the article argues that such a right to equal treatment is not merely an ancillary right which is conditional upon migration; rather, Article 12 EC is a self-standing right pertaining to all those who fall within <b>the</b> personal <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty. As a result, Article 12 EC is capable of being invoked by static union citizens to challenge reverse discrimination...|$|R

5|$|In Ong Ah Chuan and the {{subsequent}} decision Haw Tua Tau v.

5|$|Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, {{the three}} Baltic states, had formed the Baltic Entente in 1934.

In Latvian and Estonian opinion, the Polish–Lithuanian dispute over Vilnius was outside <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Entente, but they wished for a resolution, considering the conflict detrimental to the stability of the region. Latvia attempted to persuade Estonia to exert mutual pressure on Lithuania for a speedy acceptance of the ultimatum. This reaction from an ally was unexpected.|$|E
