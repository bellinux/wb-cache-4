5|$|Closing <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Tom Waits, {{released}} in March 1973 on Asylum Records. Produced and arranged by former Lovin' Spoonful member Jerry Yester, Closing Time {{was the first}} of seven of Waits' major releases by Asylum.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the ill-fated}} 1263 {{expedition}} of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides {{along with the}} Isle of Man, were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland {{a result of the}} 1266 Treaty of Perth. Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and placenames, the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited. The best known find from this <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit (God's <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{very best}} time), , {{also known as}} Actus tragicus, is an early sacred cantata {{composed}} by Johann Sebastian Bach in Mühlhausen, intended for a funeral.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> heating <b>time</b> <b>was</b> {{equal to}} <b>the</b> {{sum of the}} {{preheating}} time and the holding <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> preheating <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> used for inner wall temperature heating to the set value. When inner wall temperature reached the set value, hold the temperature unchanged by the heating controller. Then continued to heat for a period, this duration <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> holding <b>time.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the Critérium du Dauphiné, four {{different}} jerseys were awarded. The most {{important was the}} general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. The rider with the least accumulated <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> race leader, identified by a yellow jersey with a blue bar; the winner of this classification was considered {{the winner of the}} race.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{dating from}} St-Calais' <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> confraternity {{relationship}} between the monks of Durham and the monks of the monastery of Saint Calais in Maine. The cult of Saint Calais {{appears to have been}} confined to the region around the monastery which the saint had founded. St-Calais {{appears to have been a}} devotee of the cult, and the most likely date for the creation of the confraternity link between the two houses is during St-Calais' time as bishop.|$|E
5|$|The final {{competition}} {{is the team}} classification. On each stage, each team is awarded a time based on the cumulative time of its top three riders. The times for each stage are then added together and {{the team with the}} lowest total <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> leader of the team classification. There is no jersey awarded for this classification.|$|E

5|$|The no {{decompression}} limit (NDL) or no stop <b>time,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> interval that a diver may theoretically {{spend at}} a given depth without having to perform decompression stops. The NDL helps divers plan dives {{so that they can}} stay {{at a given}} depth and ascend without stopping while avoiding unacceptable risk of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the energy payback <b>time,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E
5|$|Another {{work from}} this <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>The</b> Green Feather, which Knight painted, and {{reworked}} {{due to a}} change in the weather, outdoors in a single day and shows the model Dolly Snell in an emerald evening dress with a hat and a large feather. Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E

5|$|Bottom <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{time spent}} at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning {{may be defined}} differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E
5|$|For {{the points}} classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for {{finishing}} {{a stage in}} the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The Cima Coppi for this Giro was the Col Agnel, {{but it was not}} climbed due to avalanches that prevented the riders from being able to pass on the roads. The intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro {{is similar to that of}} the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{several other}} craters of {{around the same}} age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit crater in the North Sea and the Boltysh crater in Ukraine. Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across {{striking}} the Earth. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> larger Shiva crater, though the structure's status as an impact crater is contested.|$|E
5|$|Lacquerware is {{produced}} in a three-step process: first the base is prepared. Most often the base consists of wood, {{but it can also}} be of paper or leather. Next is the application of lacquer, which hardens while drying, thereby sealing the base. Generally several layers of lacquer are applied. The lacquer is then decorated with a variety of methods. In the maki-e technique, a powdered metal (usually gold or silver) is sprinkled on the lacquer before completely hardened. This technique was developed and popular in the Heian period but continued to be used with refinements into the early modern period. Over the next centuries various other methods that employ precious metals were developed, such as the ikakeji technique originating in the Kamakura period in which a finely ground gold powder was spread in sufficient quantities to mimic solid gold. The use of metallic powders was complemented with other techniques such as polished shell inlay or gold leaf (kirikane). The former was used in the Heian and Kamakura periods and popular motifs included water, rocks, trees or flowers. Starting in the Kamakura period, larger and more solid objects such as toiletry chests were decorated with realistic images. Towards the end of the medieval period (late-16th century), simpler designs were favoured in decorations. Honami Kōetsu who lived around this <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> earliest lacquer artist known by name.|$|E
5|$|Question Time is an {{opportunity}} for the British public to put questions to politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. Question <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time. It is for that reason – not for some misguided desire to be controversial, but for that reason alone – that the invitation has been extended.|$|E
50|$|The cyclist {{to reach}} the finish in <b>the</b> least <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> winner of the stage.

If a cyclist had received a <b>time</b> bonus, it <b>was</b> subtracted from this total; all <b>time</b> penalties <b>were</b> added to this total. The cyclist with <b>the</b> least accumulated <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.|$|R

5|$|The men's {{individual}} {{time trial}} {{event at the}} UCI Road World Championships is the men's world championship for the road bicycle racing discipline of time trial. Introduced in 1994 by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the world's governing body of cycling, the event consists of a time trial covering a distance of approximately 45 kilometres (28mi) over flat or rolling terrain. Riders start separated by two-minute intervals; the one that completes the course in the shortest <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> winner, and is entitled to wear the rainbow jersey in time trial events for the forthcoming season.|$|E

The first rider to cross the Pordoi Pass was Spaniard Miguel Indurain. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided {{the same way as}} the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1969 were eligible for it. The intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped.

There was another team classification that awarded points to each team based off their riding's finishing position in every stage. The team with the highest total of points was the leader of the classification.|$|E
