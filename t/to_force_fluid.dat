40|$|We {{describe}} the fabrication of a controllable microfluidic valve {{coupled with an}} electrochemical pump, which {{has been designed to}} deliver reagents to an integrated microfluidic biosensing system. Fluid, retained within an insertion reservoir using a stop valve, was pumped using electrochemical actuation, providing a low power, low voltage integrated Laboratory-on-a-Chip for reproducible, small volume fluidic manipulation. The properties of the valve were characterized using both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements, enabling the calculation of the magnitude of the forces involved (which were subsequently verified through experimental measurement).

40|$|A {{device for}} {{controlling}} flow of fluid {{to and from}} a resilient inflatable cuff implanted about the urethra to control flow of urine therethrough. The device comprises a flexible bulb reservoir {{and a control unit}} that includes a manually operated valve that opens automatically when the bulb is squeezed <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>fluid</b> into the cuff for closing the urethra. The control unit also includes a movable valve seat member having a relatively large area exposed to pressure of fluid in a chamber that is connected to the cuff and which moves to a position in which the valve member is unseated by an abutment when fluid pressure in the chamber exceeds a predetermined value to thereby relieve excess fluid pressure in the cuff. The arrangement is such that the valve element is held closed against the seat member by the full differential in fluid pressures acting {{on both sides of the}} valve element until the seat member is moved away from the valve element to thus insure positive closing of the valve element until the seat member is moved out of engagement with the valve element by excess pressure differential...|$|E

ZNMF-Jets have been seen to create two distinct flow regimes when impinging into a flow, either singular or multiple trajectories as characterised by the Strouhal Number. This paper shows two cases for a ZNMFJet in Cross-flow, when the flow is singular and when the flow shows multiple trajectories, using Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV). Time and Phase-averaged experiments were conducted in a vertical water tunnel, where the ZNMF-Jet was created using a stepper motor scotch-yoke piston arrangement of cylinder diameter 20 mm <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>fluid</b> through a 10 mm circular jet orifice.

40|$|The flow of a {{thin film}} down an {{inclined}} surface over topography is considered for the case of liquids with Sisko’s model viscosity. For the first time lubrication theory is used to reduce the governing equations to a non-linear evolution equation for a current of a Sisko’s model non-Newtonian fluid on an inclined plane under the action of gravity and the viscous stresses. This model is solved numerically using an efficient Full Approximation Storage (FAS) multigrid algorithm. Free surface results are plotted and carefully examined near the topography for different values of power-law index np, viscosity parameter m, the aspect ratio A and for different inclination angle of the plane with the horizontal. Number of complications and additional physical effects are discussed that enrich real situations. It is observed that the flows into narrow trenches develop a capillary ridge {{just in front of}} the upstream edge of a trench followed by a small trough. For relatively small width trenches, the free surface is almost everywhere flat as the dimensional width of the trench is much smaller than the capillary length scale. In this region, surface tension dominates the solution and acts so as to stretch a membrane across the trench leading to smaller height deviations. The ridge originates from the topographic forcing which works <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>fluid</b> upstream immediately prior to the trench before helping to accelerate it over. The upstream forcing slows down the fluid locally and increases the layer thickness...|$|E
40|$|Permeability of a fluid {{through a}} {{saturated}} material {{is determined by}} measuring the dynamic response of that saturated material to shaking vibrations and/or shear wave propagation, and then mapping the dynamic response (preferably, viscoelastic stiffness and damping properties) to an invented model (called 2 ̆ 2 KVMB 2 ̆ 2) that yields the property of permeability. The preferred embodiments may use shear waves, inertial effects, and/or transmission effects, but preferably not compression, <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>fluids</b> through the pores. The mapping preferably predicts two possible mappings to permeability, coupled and uncoupled. The preferred methods are both internally consistent and directly related to known laws of physics rather than dependent on empirical calibrations. In use, for example, one may use a porosity log (conventional neutron or sonic) and recordings of SH -waves to obtain damping ratio, followed by locating of the damping ratio on a KVMB map that depends on porosity, and choosing {{of one of the}} two possible permeabilities indicated by the mapping, wherein the best choice is typically the largely coupled case...|$|R
