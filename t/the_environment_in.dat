In night missions, the enemies' cones of vision are weakened, but standing in bright light makes you especially noticeable against the darkness.

5|$|TCDD is {{the most}} potent {{compound}} (congener) of its series (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, known as PCDDs or simply dioxins) and became known as a contaminant in Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Vietnam War.

5|$|Bonif√°cio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. <b>The</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.|$|E
5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate image of <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> {{which they are}} moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Columbian mammoths {{inhabited}} the southern half of North America, {{ranging from the}} northern United States across Mexico {{as far south as}} Costa Rica. One Costa Rican specimen, a molar, was reported in 1963 but has since been lost. <b>The</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> these areas may have had more varied habitats than those inhabited by woolly mammoths in the north (the mammoth steppe). Some areas were covered by grass, herbaceous plants, trees and shrubs; their composition varied from region to region, and included grassland, savanna and aspen parkland habitats. There were also wooded areas; although mammoths would not have preferred forests, clearings could provide them with grass and herbs.|$|E

Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band, more so than any of her record producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously. The band moved on from former label Cooking Vinyl and established a partnership with Birthday Records, a small, independent record label founded by former Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Nick Hodgson.|$|E
5|$|Lead forms {{a variety}} of {{compounds}} and exists in <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> various forms. Features of poisoning differ {{depending on whether the}} agent is an organic compound (one that contains carbon), or an inorganic one. Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic lead compounds as gasoline additives, but such compounds are still used in industrial settings. Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the central nervous system predominantly.|$|E
5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> <b>In</b> the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, {{or physical}} characteristics. Phenotype {{is determined by}} an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> which the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the protagonist Jill Valentine from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment and enemies. Aside from Jill, the player takes control of another character for a brief portion of the game. To advance through the game, the player has to explore a city while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating various types of enemies. The player can interact with <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> several ways, such as opening doors, pushing objects or climbing obstacles. Scattered throughout the city are weapons, ammunition and other items, which can be collected and put in the player's inventory. Items can be examined, used, or combined with others. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to a storage box located in special rooms to manage space.|$|E

Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.|$|E

Originality/value: At present, there are no guidelines which specifically inform how to mainstream women into disaster reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> built <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> Sri Lanka.
