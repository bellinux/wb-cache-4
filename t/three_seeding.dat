40|$|Two {{field trials}} were {{conducted}} at Crop Research Division, D. S. I. R., Lincoln, in the 1971 / 72 and 1972 / 73 seasons to examine ways {{of reducing the}} cost of establishing lucerne and reducing the loss of production in the first year. Trial I examined {{the effect of a}} spring sown barley (cv Zephyr) cover crop at <b>three</b> <b>seeding</b> rates, 0, 56 and 112 kg/ha, on lucerne sown at the same time at <b>three</b> <b>seeding</b> rates, 2. 9, 3. 8 and 5. 8 kg/ha with and without irrigation. The 1971 / 72 season was drier than normal but lucerne establishment was unaltered by a cover crop regardless of seeding rate or irrigation treatment. The overall establishment was high with 73 % of viable seeds being present as plants after the first winter at a seeding rate of 2. 9 kg/ha. Lucerne production at the harvest cut was reduced by barley sown at 56 kg/ha to 21 % and 49 % non-irrigated and irrigated respectively and remained depressed for two further cuts non-irrigated but yield was restored by the following cut irrigated. Irrigation increased the first season lucerne yield by 100 % clear seeded and 194 % with 56 kg/ha of barley and lucerne seeding rate had no effect on lucerne yield. Undersown lucerne at all seeding rates reduced barley grain yield by 20 % at the low barley seeding rate but lucerne at the high seeding rate only reduced grain yield at the high barley seeding rate. Trial II examined the effect of a winter sown wheat (cv Arawa) and a spring sown barley (cv Research) on the establishment and early yield of lucerne sown in the spring at <b>three</b> <b>seeding</b> rates (2. 25, 9. 0, 35. 0 kg/ha). The influence of cover crop competition was further examined by sowing the cover crops at <b>three</b> <b>seeding</b> rates (56, 112 and 224 kg/ha), and by simulated grazing of the wheat and the use of a herbicide on the barley and clear seeded lucerne. The 1972 / 73 season was drier than normal and although percentage lucerne establishment decreased as the lucerne seeding rate increased, no cover crop treatments effected lucerne establishment. Overall establishment was low with 36. 5 % of viable seed being present as plants after harvest at the 2. 25 kg/ha seeding rate. Lucerne production at the harvest cut was low and was reduced markedly by cover crop treatments and height, root weight and root weight distribution data suggested that wheat had a greater effect than barley. No further cuts w. ere taken in the establishment season but cover crops continued to reduce lucerne yields in four cuts, in the following season. The use of spring sown cereal cover crops for lucerne establishment can be justified on the basis of providing a more profitable return, provided the establishment year production of clear seeded lucerne is low but cannot be justified on the basis of weed suppression. Lucerne seeding rates of 2. 25 and 2. 9 kg/ha produced stands with at least 30 plants/m² which was a density sufficient for maximum production...|$|E

A similar experiment was conducted at the Sherman Experiment Station, Moro in Eastern Oregon, using only two winter wheat cultivars, Stephens and Jackmar. Data were obtained on grain yield, tillers and spikes per square meter, heading and anthesis date, plant height, kernels per spike, 1000 kernel weight, test weight and harvest index. At Hyslop Experiment Station, Stephens, Bezostaya and Roussalka produced maximum grain yield at 10 cm row spacing and 160 Kg/ha seeding rate, and Maris-Hobbit at 24 cm row spacing and 160 Kg/ha seeding rate. At Sherman Experiment Station, 30 cm row spacing and 90 Kg/ha seeding rate constitutes the best combination for Stephens, and 30 cm row spacing and 120 Kg/ha seeding rate for the club wheat Jackmar. The interaction between row spacings x cultivars and seeding rates x cultivars indicated that all the cultivars produced high numbers of tillers and spikes per m² at narrow (10 cm) row spacing and high (240 Kg/ha) seeding rate. There were no significant differences between row spacings for heading and anthesis date. Lower seeding rate resulted in later heading date. The cultivar Roussalka was the earliest and Maris-Hobbit the latest in average heading date, Plant height decreased with increased row spacing and increased with increased seeding rate. The plants of the four cultivars were shorter at the second date than at the first. More kernels per spike were produced at the second than at the first date.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of growth stage and legume proportion on the nutritive and ensiling characteristics of triticale–pea–vetch intercrop mixtures. The three-species mixtures were sown at <b>three</b> <b>seeding</b> ratios to produce different legume proportions (low, medium and high proportions) and harvested at two growth stages. The six resulting forages were subsequently ensiled in mini-silos. Forage dry-matter (DM) yield, nutritive characteristics of fresh and ensiled mixtures and fermentation characteristics of silages were determined. Forage DM yield almost tripled between early-stage harvest and late-stage harvest. Nutritive characteristics of fresh and ensiled mixtures were affected by both growth stage and legume proportion: crude protein concentration and pepsin–cellulase digestibility decreased whereas NDF and ADF concentrations increased as growth stage advanced. Crude protein concentration and pepsin–cellulase digestibility were higher for the high-legume treatment at both growth stages. All mixtures ensiled well, as indicated by low pH and high lactic and acetic acids contents. However, all silages had high soluble nitrogen and ammonia concentrations. This study showed that triticale–pea–vetch silages hold good potential net energy supply value for ruminants, especially at early-stage growth and when legume proportion increases. However, protein value has to be improved by reducing protein breakdown during ensiling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract approved: No-till pasture {{renovation}} {{can increase the}} quality and forage yield of underproductive pastures. Decreased erosion, lower costs, and less lost grazing time are advantages of no-till renovation compared to conventional renovation. Unwanted vegetation is first controlled with herbicides to decrease competition for introduced orchardgrass. Two field trials were conducted using a split-plot design to compare <b>three</b> <b>seeding</b> methods and two herbicides. An Aerway no-till drill, a Tye double disk drill, and broadcast followed by harrowing were the seeding methods. Paraquat and glyphosate {{were used to determine}} herbicide effect on vegetation control. Orchardgrass did not adequately survive at either trial site. However, where some orchardgrass did survive, vegetation control was more important than seeding method. Competition from annual grasses, many germinating after herbicides were applied, was the reason for renovation failure. Herbicide Redacted for Privacy and initial growth for best control. Yield was doubled in the first harvest by the addition of fertilizer. Early spring forage production from poor pastures is usually more than adequate, so the increase from fertilizer is of marginal value unless it is stored for later use. Yield increase did not carry over to the second harvest when it could be better utilized. Later application dates would extend yield increases from certain species if water is available...|$|E

Nevertheless, details related to the optimum seeding time to maximize the stem yield of sweet sorghum have not been studied. This study elucidated information necessary to ascertain the optimum seeding time to obtain the maximum stem yield. We conducted an examination with <b>three</b> <b>seeding</b> times at intervals of two weeks, ranging from late May to mid-June for four years during 2009 – 2012, and we analyzed the relation between seeding times and stem yield based on internode characteristics of stems using two sorghum cultivars with different maturity: ‘Kazetachi’ and ‘Wray’. Differences were observed in the respective relations between the seeding times and the stem yields. For Kazetachi, the dry matter yield increased with the earlier seeding time. Thus, to expand the growing period, an earlier seeding time with good establishment is better. For Wray, a cultivar that can grow to heading in the Tohoku region, the stem dry weight was greater by seeding in early June. For cultivars such as Wray with a sufficient growing period in a given region, the optimum seeding time to obtain stable higher stem yield existed and the cultivars should be seeded when they could grow under good weather conditions at the critical time strongly influences growth...|$|E

The primary project goal is to increase winter snowpack in the target area through operational cloud seeding. An average increase of 10 % in November through March precipitation via cloud seeding was calculated, using results from the Climax I and II research programs. Simulations using empirically derived snowpack-streamflow relations yielded increases in streamflow from <b>three</b> <b>seeding</b> modes totaling approximately 109, 500 acre feet (1. 35 x 108 m 3) on average.
