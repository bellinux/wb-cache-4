As a member of the board, he was also appointed to the directorships of a number of subsidiary and affiliated companies of Jardine Matheson, such as the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd. He was appointed an unofficial Justice of the Peace by the Hong Kong government in 1937. At that time, the future prospect of the firm was shadowed by uncertainties arising from the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and the increasing instability in the Far East. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, he was enlisted to the Hong Kong Defence Reserve. Yet, he was permitted to quit the Reserve in the following year to join the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He saw active service until 1943, when he retired from the Volunteer Reserve as a lieutenant and was appointed as the Minister of War Transport Representative in the Middle East. His role was to help co-ordinate logistical support and transportation for the Allied Forces in that region. He held that position until the war ended in 1945. In the same year, he returned to Hong Kong, where he served briefly as the first Honorary Air Commodore of the Air Arm of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recognizing the mindless {{nature of}} many food decisions, {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that attempts to increase healthy eating should not focus on convincing people what is 'right' but rather aim to adjust the environment such that people are automatically directed toward healthy choices. This study investigated a nudge aiming to promote healthy food choices in train station snack shops. METHODS: The nudge involved a repositioning of food products: healthy foods were placed at <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> register <b>desk,</b> while keeping unhealthy products available elsewhere in the shop. Three snack shops were included: a control condition; a nudge condition repositioning healthy products and a nudge + disclosure condition employing the same nudge together with an explanatory sign. Next to examining its effectiveness during 1 week, the study assessed customers' acceptance of the nudge. RESULTS: Controlling for a baseline week, more healthy (but not fewer unhealthy) products were sold in both nudge conditions, with no difference between the nudge and the nudge + disclosure condition. A majority of customers reported positive attitudes toward the nudge. CONCLUSIONS: Repositioning healthy foods is a simple, effective and well-accepted nudge to increase healthy purchases. Moreover, disclosing its purpose does not impact on effectiveness...|$|R
2500|$|Another legend is {{that the}} birth of poutine took place in Princeville at the {{restaurant}} La Petite Vache, founded in 1966 by Henri Provencher.

La Petite Vache being located in a building adjacent to the cheese factory, they began selling fresh cheese at <b>the</b> restaurant's <b>cash</b> <b>desk.</b> An assiduous customer came to the restaurant and ordered french fries and bought a sack of cheese curds, then went to his table, opened the bag and mixed the cheese in with his fries.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the context}} of a sharp {{decrease}} in the citizens’ standard of living, and of the increase in unemployment and the need to upgrade local infrastructure, public authorities throughout the country face some major challenges. On the one hand, they have to ensure the cash flow needed to support current and new investments and, on the other hand, manage properly the local tax and duty receipts. As the international visibility of localities cannot be increased unless thoughtful and well-funded investment plans are implemented to remediate local infrastructure, local public authorities must see that citizens are still satisfied with the level of taxation and the public services provided. Local public authorities must prove fully responsible with the public money and grant low-income people the possibility to pay taxes by installments. Additionally, they must innovate, granting citizens various methods of payment of taxes and duties due: at <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>desk,</b> through bank transfer or by credit card. Within the research conducted among local public authorities in Transylvania, the authors attempt to highlight to what degree these objectives are implemented in localities studied by decision-makers, as well as citizens’ degree of satisfaction with these objectives...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} design and evaluation of a checkout system in self-service shops in Sweden. The aims were (a) to study the ergonomics of {{the development of a new}} check-out system which is to be part of a new automatic data handling system in retailing, and (b) to evaluate certain ergonomics methods used in a system development programme. The thesis falls into five parts. The first deals with a system analysis of check-out systems in self-service shops. The second consists of a literaturereview of the ergonomics of keyboards relevant to cash register design. The third describes an experimental evaluation of two keyboards suitable for use with cash registers. The fourth describes surveys, involving interviews, cuestionnaires and observational studies, on customers and cashiers using and working in self-service shops. In the fifth and final part experimental and survey results are discussed and interpreted. The principal results obtained can be summarised as follows. (a) For ten button keyboards speed and accuracy of performance is better with the keys 123 on the top row and the keys 789 on the bottom row, than conversely. Cashiers generally prefer the 123 to the 789 keyboard. (b) A new cash desk (into which the 123 keyboard may be placed) incorporating two moving conveyor belts, which has recently been introduced into self-service shops has improved working conditions for cashiers. Suggestions are made on how <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>desk</b> may be further improved from the point of view of both cashiers and customers. (c) Important relationships between results obtained from interviews involving the reporting of critical incidents, questionnaires and observational studies are reported and the methodological implication of these relations reviewed...|$|E

The present research was done to study the inpatient admission unit condition in Khorramabad teaching hospitals affiliated to Lorestan university of medical sciences in 2009. Materials and Methods: This research is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Data were collected using researcher made check-lists based on inpatient admission department standards, and by observation and interview with process owners. The validity and reliability of the checklists were evaluated by content validity and test-retest respectively. The inpatient admission unit process analysis was also done in all the above-mentioned hospitals and data were analyzed by analysis limit, descriptive statistic indices, and SPSS software. The collected information was prepared as statistical tables. Results: The inpatient admission unit process was similar in foresaid hospitals and only <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>desk,</b> among the units involving in this process was locally centeralized. Mean of waiting time for inpatient admission was 19 / 10 ± 20 / 50 minutes.

Conclusion: The condition of the investigated admission departments was evaluated as average. To improve admission process, some solutions should be taken into consideration including: preparing and supplying special strategies of inpatient admission department, employing professional and interested staff, holding postgraduation courses, ideal allotting of resources and space, regular evaluation of the admission department function and implementing process improvement procedures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pricing {{strategies}} are mentioned frequently as a potentially effective tool to stimulate healthy eating, mainly for consumers {{with a low}} socio-economic status. Still, {{it is not known}} how these consumers perceive pricing strategies, which pricing {{strategies are}} favoured and what contextual factors are important in achieving the anticipated effects. Methods We conducted seven focus groups among 59 residents of deprived neighbourhoods in two large Dutch cities. The focus group topics were based on insights from Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations Theory and consisted of four parts: 1) discussion on factors in food selection; 2) attitudes and perceptions towards food prices; 3) thinking up pricing strategies; 4) attitudes and perceptions regarding nine pricing strategies that were nominated by experts in a former Delphi Study. Analyses were conducted with Atlas. ti 5. 2 computer software, using the framework approach. Results Qualitative analyses revealed that this group of consumers consider price to be a core factor in food choice and that they experience financial barriers against buying certain foods. Price was also experienced as a proficient tool to stimulate healthier food choices. Yet, consumers indicated that significant effects could only be achieved by combining price with information and promotion techniques. In general, pricing strategies focusing on encouraging healthy eating were valued to be more helpful than pricing strategies which focused on discouraging unhealthy eating. Suggested high reward strategies were: reducing the price of healthier options of comparable products (e. g., whole meal bread) compared to unhealthier options (e. g., white bread); providing a healthy food discount card for low-income groups; and combining price discounts on healthier foods with other marketing techniques such as displaying cheap and healthy foods at <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>desk.</b> Conclusion This focus group study provides important new insights regarding the use of pricing strategies to stimulate healthy eating. The observed perceptions and attitudes of residents of deprived neighbourhoods can be integrated into future experimental studies and be used to reveal if and how pricing strategies are effective in stimulating healthy eating. </p...|$|E
