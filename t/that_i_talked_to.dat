[...] "The man was seen around Fort Bedford for two days, but he didn't tell his business, and nobody <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> had seen the babies nor had they seen him a-talkin' to any wimmen folks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so glad, {{for now it}} will {{be easier}} for me to tell you. And since that I have seen Mr. Furnival, and he says the same. I tell you because you are so good and so loving to me. I will keep nothing from you; but you must not tell Sir Peregrine <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Furnival about this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Mademoiselle, {{you have}} read me strangely {{if you think}} <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her with my lips, yes--but it was of you I was {{thinking}}. I was thinking that you were born to {{play a part in}} many dramas, that you have the fatal beauty which is rare in all ages." [...] The Vicomte bent towards her, and his voice became caressing. [...] "You cannot realize how beautiful you are," [...] he sighed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah! that's the question. If <b>I</b> felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a real Christian {{that had}} a {{care for the poor}} girl's soul, I would tell you in a moment." ...|$|R
60|$|From then on I {{began to}} take some notice of my fellow-travelers. The {{conductor}} {{proved to be an}} agreeable old fellow; and the train-boy, though I mistrusted his advances because he tried to sell me everything from chewing-gum to mining stock, turned out to be pretty good company. The Negro porter had such a jolly voice and laugh <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him whenever I got the chance. Then occasional passengers occupied the seat opposite me from town to town. They were much alike, all sunburned and loud-voiced, and it looked as though they had all bought their high boots and wide hats at the same shop.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} {{arranged}} {{as part of}} the day's programme that Mr. Cooke was to drive those who wished to go over the Rise in his new brake. But the table was not graced by our host's presence, Mrs. Cooke apologizing for him, explaining that he had disappeared quite mysteriously. It turned out that he and the judge had been served with luncheon in the Ethiopian card-room, and neither threats nor fair words could draw him away. The judge had not held such cards for years, and it was in vain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him of consequences. The Ten decided to remain and watch a game which was pronounced little short of phenomenal, and my client gave orders for the smaller brake and requested the Celebrity to drive. And this he was nothing loth to do. For the edification as well as the assurance of the party Mr. Allen explained, while we were waiting under the porte cochere, how he had driven the Windsor coach down Piccadilly {{at the height of the}} season, with a certain member of Parliament and noted whip on the box seat.|$|E
60|$|Now at this I grew angry, {{for it is}} not {{pleasant}} to a woman to hear that a man whom all know to be but a child compared to her can see things in water which she {{is not able to}} see, even though the things are born only of the false magic of a witch-doctoress. Still, as at that moment I chanced to hear Jan seeking me, for he wondered where I had gone, I called to him and set out the matter, expecting that he would be very angry and dismiss Sihamba, breaking up her magic bowl. But all the while <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him the little woman sat, her chin resting upon her hand, looking into his face, and I think that she had some power over him. At the least, he was not at all angry, although he said that I must not mention the business to the predicant, who was well known to be a prejudiced man. Then he asked Sihamba to show him the wonders of the bowl. Replying that she would if she might, and always keeping her eyes fixed upon his face, she bade him kneel down and look into the water in such fashion that he did not shut the moonlight off from it, and to tell us what he saw.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir," [...] said I, [...] "these {{months are}} very easily filled up; but yet before I told my story, I {{would be glad}} <b>to</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a friend." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "None of {{the people}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> spoke of any warmongering attitude, nothing of the kind. On the contrary, this was a speech of peace, {{encouraging}} people to live together in harmony, all of the nationalities, the Turks, Gorani, Ashkali living in Kosovo, as well as throughout the entire Yugoslavia." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1930, Whittemore {{founded the}} Byzantine Institute of America, whose {{mission was to}} [...] "conserve, restore, study, and document" [...] the monuments and artworks of the Byzantine world. In 1931, Whittemore {{traveled}} with the Institute to Istanbul {{with the permission of}} Mustafa Kemal Atatürk to oversee the removal of plaster covering the Byzantine mosaics in Hagia Sophia. Of the radical and sudden transformation of Hagia Sophia from an active mosque to a secular museum in 1931 he wrote: [...] "Santa Sophia was a mosque the day <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him. The next morning, when I went to the mosque, there was a sign on the door written in Ataturk's own hand. It said: 'The museum is closed for repairs'" ...|$|E
5000|$|When filming began, Capra {{quickly learned}} Stanwyck was unlike any actress he {{previously}} had directed. In his autobiography The Name Above the Title, he recalled: I discovered a vital technical lack - one that shook us all up: Stanwyck gave {{her all the}} first time she tried a scene ... All subsequent repetitions, in rehearsals or retakes, were pale copies of her original performance. This was a new phenomenon [...] - [...] and a new challenge, not only to me, but to the actors and the crews. I had to rehearse the cast without her. The actors grumbled. Not fair to them, they said. Who ever heard of an actress not rehearsing? ... On the set I never let Stanwyck utter one word of the scene until the cameras were rolling. Before <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her in her dressing room, told her the meaning of the scene, the points of emphasis, the pauses ... I talked softly, not wanting to fan the smoldering fires that lurked beneath that somber silence. She remembered every word I said [...] - [...] and she never blew a line.|$|E

3000|$|I {{was annoyed}} {{when he was}} at home for too long, but you know it is not like that…I missed him a lot, when I was younger, but then I got used <b>to</b> it <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him over the phone (…), but then <b>I</b> didn’t <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about my {{important}} things, he was away and when he was back he tried to, you know, to organize everything, as if he never left, like…to be at home on this hour, don’t bring your friends over, these things, and when I grew older we argued a lot {{when he was at}} home, I was so looking forward for him to go to Germany again.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine Indigenous versus Western philosophies that pertain to {{treatment}} of mental health and wellbeing for Indigenous youth in the Yukon. This thesis is framed by two questions about the experience of identity for Yukon First Nations Youth: (1) How are Yukon First Nations Youth able to develop and sustain their individual and collective identity by balancing the two worlds they live in? And (2) What is the Yukon First Nations perspective on spirituality, mental health and Youth suicide prevention? It is pertinent that a distinction be made between what has been implemented {{in health care and}} seen as the social norm in terms of the Western use of power versus emphasis on spiritual truth. The words Spirituality and Healing are synonymous to Indigenous philosophies of wellness. There is a need for culturally appropriate healing approaches in the Yukon. This thesis focuses on solutions for the First Nations youth in the Yukon, as described by two Elders, two service providers, a mom and a dad, and the two youth <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to,</b> thus taking a unique and insightful approach. The questions they were asked have identified how these people view youth developing and sustaining their individual and collective identity by balancing the two worlds they live in. [...] P. v.

"He talks, like yourself, much nonsense," [...] said Katherine, {{turning to}} her flags, with a pettish air, that was {{singularly}} contradicted by her gratified countenance; [...] "but {{the situation of}} things requires <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Barnstable more freely." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with the Billings Gazette, Sheriff Sgt. Roger Rizor stated: [...] "I {{believe it was a}} homicide, and I believe what happened to her happened on the day she disappeared.

6000|$|... "A {{long line}} is usually planned on {{a sort of}} loop when the country will permit, so that the trapper may go out one way and return another. When two are {{trapping}} together, pardners like Pat and me, one works the line one way and one the other. Of course two can work a longer line than one can, and cover {{it the way it}} ought to be covered. I've put in more'n one winter alone, but ye ken it's michty satisfying to hae speech wi' some one once in a while. When I'm alone it gets so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the varmints just to hear a human voice, even though it be my own." ...|$|R

50|$|In a 2003 interview, Matt Skiba {{stated that}} Good Mourning: is pretty good. I mean {{it took us}} a long time to do and I think most of the people <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> make records and stuff, there's always stuff that you wish you did better or maybe a little differently. I've never been able to avoid that, even with this. There's things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish I had done maybe a little differently. But that also comes with just {{listening}} to it and living with it for so long that until it's done you won't really hear things in that way until it's like too late I guess. But I would say for the most part that I'm really happy with it.|$|R
