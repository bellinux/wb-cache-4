5|$|Cancer pagurus {{is heavily}} {{exploited}} commercially throughout its range, {{being the most}} commercially important crab species in Western Europe. <b>The</b> <b>crabs</b> are caught using crab pots (similar to lobster pots) which are placed offshore and baited. The catch of C. pagurus has increased steadily, rising from 26,000tonnes in 1978 to 60,000t in 2007, of which more than 70% was caught around the British Isles. The fishery is widely dispersed around the British and Irish coasts, and C. pagurus {{is thought to be}} overfished across much of this area. Most of the edible crabs caught by the British fleet are exported live for sale in France and Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{angelshark}} is {{an ambush}} predator that feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes, especially flatfishes, though it also preys on skates and invertebrates. Prey reported taken include the hake Merluccius merluccius, the bream Pagellus erythrinus, grunts in the genus Pomadasys, the flatfishes Bothus spp., Citharus linguatula, and Solea solea, the squid Loligo vulgaris, the cuttlefishes Sepia officinalis and Sepiola spp., and <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> Medorippe lanata, Geryon trispinosus, Dromia personata, Goneplax rhomboides, Liocarcinus corrugatus, and Atelecyclus rotundatus. The stomachs of some examined specimens have also contained seagrass or birds (in one case an entire cormorant). Individual sharks select sites that {{offer the best}} ambush opportunities, and if successful, may remain there for several days.|$|E

Their effort is interrupted as the Doctor and Clara arrive on the scene. While introductions are being made, however, they come under attack from <b>the</b> <b>crabs,</b> only to be rescued by Santa, who also provides a specimen of one of the creatures. The Doctor identifies the creatures as Dream Crabs – aliens that induce pleasant, euphoric dreams on their intended victims as a distraction whilst <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> devour their brains. During this time, both the Doctor and Clara reveal that they had lied to each other during their last meeting: Clara lied about her dead boyfriend, Danny Pink, having returned from the Nethersphere, while the Doctor falsely claimed to have found Gallifrey. While investigating the Dream Crabs, the Doctor sends Clara to recover Santa's specimen, only for him to remember that they use telepathic connections to their intended victims to see their surroundings, but only when they are being thought about. This causes the specimen in the lab to come alive and attack Clara.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally decapods {{were divided}} into two suborders: The Natantia or {{swimmers}}, and the Reptantia or walkers. The Natantia or swimmers included the shrimp.

These species have small abdominal appendages, but robust legs well adapted for walking. The Natantia was thought to be paraphyletic, that is, it was thought that originally all decapods were like shrimp.|$|E

25|$|Cephalopods {{are widely}} {{regarded}} as the most intelligent of the invertebrates, and have well developed senses and large brains (larger than those of gastropods). The nervous system of cephalopods is the most complex of the invertebrates and their brain-to-body-mass ratio falls between that of endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates. The brain is protected in a cartilaginous cranium. The giant nerve fibers of the cephalopod mantle have been widely used for many years as experimental material in neurophysiology; their large diameter (due to lack of myelination) makes them relatively easy to study compared with other animals. Cephalopods have also been known to climb out of their aquaria, maneuver a distance of the lab floor, enter another aquarium to feed on <b>the</b> <b>crabs,</b> and return to their own aquarium.|$|E
25|$|Trapping is {{ineffective}} for rats, {{given their}} sheer numbers, {{and the only}} method that works is poisoning, which can be delivered into the field by broadcasting (by hand or from the air) or by the maintenance of bait stations. This method has been employed around the world, in the Falkland Islands, in the tropical Pacific, and off New Zealand, where over 40 islands have been cleared. This method is not without problems, especially if the rats share the island with other, native species of rodent that might take the bait as well, as has happened on Anacapa Island in the Channel Islands. In the Pacific poison intended for rats was taken by land crabs instead; <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> were not affected by the poison but frustrated attempts to clear the rats.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crab</b> only molts {{at night}} or in night-like {{conditions}} due to <b>the</b> <b>crab</b> being extremely vulnerable to predators without the protection of its shell.

25|$|Increased {{nitrogen}} uptake by marsh species {{into their}} leaves can prompt greater rates of length-specific leaf growth, {{and increase the}} herbivory rates of crabs. The burrowing crab Neohelice granulata frequents SW Atlantic salt marshes where high density populations can be found among populations of the marsh species Spartina densiflora and Sarcocornia perennis. In Mar Chiquita lagoon, north of Mar del Plata, Argentina, Neohelice granulata herbivory increased as a likely response to the increased nutrient value of the leaves of fertilised Spartina densiflora plots, compared to non-fertilised plots. Regardless of whether the plots were fertilised or not, grazing by Neohelice granulata also reduced the length specific leaf growth rates of the leaves in summer, while increasing their length-specific senescence rates. This may have been assisted by the increased fungal effectiveness on the wounds left by <b>the</b> <b>crabs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The pot is {{then brought}} {{on board the}} boat and the crew sorts the king crab. Any crab not meeting the {{regulation}} requirements are thrown back. <b>The</b> <b>crabs</b> are stored live in a holding tank until the boat reaches shore, where they are sold. If the weather becomes too cold the live crabs may freeze and burst. If they are left in the tank for too long they will harm and possibly kill {{each other as they}} can be cannibalistic. Even the rocking of the boat can cause damage to the crab, so boards are inserted in the holds to prevent excessive side-to-side movement. If a crab dies in the hold for any reason it releases toxins which can kill other crabs. If the crew fails to remove the dead crabs, they can poison the entire tank and ruin the catch.|$|E
25|$|From 1936 to 1958, Browne {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} the mission hospital at Yakusu, Belgian Congo. At Yakusu, he performed {{a wide range of}} roles from treating disease outbreaks and researching diseases to performing operations to midwifery. Patients {{with a wide variety of}} ailments arrived from surrounding areas daily to seek care. He frequently handled outbreaks of smallpox, polio, tuberculosis, malaria, yaws and typhoid and made major breakthroughs in the treatment of leprosy and Onchocerciasis. Browne, who would later concentrate his studies on leprosy, was the one of the first doctors to use Dapsone in the treatment of leprosy. He made a major epidemiological breakthrough related to Onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness, when he discovered it was caused by a black fly that bred on crabs. After having <b>the</b> <b>crabs</b> caught and exterminated and the streams cleaned, 98% of the black fly population had disappeared. Despite being based in Yakusu, Browne embarked on frequent expeditions to surrounding dispensaries and mission stations, travelling by car, motor boat, canoe or on foot.
