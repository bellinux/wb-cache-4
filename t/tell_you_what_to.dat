500|$|Pinter's {{aversion to}} any {{censorship}} by [...] "the authorities" [...] is epitomised in Petey's {{line at the}} end of The Birthday Party. [...] As the broken-down and reconstituted Stanley is being carted off by the figures of authority Goldberg and McCann, Petey calls after him, [...] "Stan, don't let them <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do!" [...] Pinter told Gussow in 1988, [...] "I've lived that line all my damn life. Never more than now." [...] The example of Pinter's stalwart opposition to what he termed [...] "the modes of thinking of those in power"—the [...] "brick wall" [...] of the [...] "minds" [...] perpetuating the [...] "status quo"—infused the [...] "vast political pessimism" [...] that some academic critics may perceive in his artistic work, its [...] "drowning landscape" [...] of harsh contemporary realities, with some residual [...] "hope for restoring the dignity of man." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Perry, {{the song}} is about [...] "falling {{in love with a}} foreigner". James Montgomery of MTV News also noted that Perry sings about a [...] "lover from {{different}} dimension". For its single release, the song was reworked to feature two verses from Kanye West, in which he raps about [...] "extraterrestriality". [...] "E.T." [...] opens with the first rap verse by West containing the lines [...] "I got a dirty mind / I got filthy ways / I'm trying to bathe my Ape in your milky way / They callin' me an alien / A big-headed astronaut". Then, using metaphors about extraterrestrials, Perry sings, [...] "You're not like the others / Futuristic lover / Different DNA". The chorus has Perry addressing her lover: [...] "Kiss me, kiss me / Infect me with your love and / Fill me with your poison", claiming to be [...] "ready for abduction". West contributes a second verse to the track, before Perry's final refrain, with heavily auto-tuned vocals: [...] "I know a bar out in Mars / Where they driving spaceships instead of cars". He finishes with a reference to the fictional animated character Shrek and lyrics about [...] "alien sex": [...] "I'mma disrobe you then I'mma probe you / See, I abducted you so I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Ben Kaplan from National Post noted West's presence on the track was similar to the work on his fourth studio album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008).|$|E
2500|$|In the {{original}} interview {{first published in}} The New York Times, on 30 December 1988, Gussow quotes Pinter as stating: [...] "The character of the old man, Petey, {{says one of the}} most important lines I've ever written. As Stanley is taken away, Petey says, 'Stan, don't let them <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.' I've lived that line all my damn life. Never more than now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Of Nasser, Ravelo says, [...] "He's a good trainer. He {{teaches the}} right things. He <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. He motivates his fighters. I know he don't {{get a lot}} of credit because he's young. I think he's one of the better coaches out there." ...|$|R
2500|$|Few singers of the English folk revival have {{attempted}} {{as much on}} record as Collins – an extraordinary combination of fragility and power. [...] "I like music to be fairly straightforward, simply embellished – the performance without histrionics allowing {{you to think about}} the song rather than <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> think." ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{major theme}} {{of much of}} West's work was a question: when so many organisations use extreme {{violence}} towards evil ends, when {{and under what circumstances}} is it morally acceptable for their opponents to respond with violence? [...] He stated on different occasions that his novels all deal with the same aspect of life, that is, the dilemma when sooner or later you have a situation such that nobody can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the movie}} of William Inge's {{play of the}} same name, The Dark at the Top of the Stairs, young Sonny Flood, the son of Robert Preston's {{character}} Rubin Flood, collects pictures of motion picture stars. When he asks his aunt and uncle if they wouldd like to see them, his uncle asks, [...] "Have you got any of Norma Talmadge?" [...] Apparently the uncle's attraction to Norma Talmadge is a sore spot in the marriage, because Aunt Lottie (played by Eve Arden) goes on a rant about Norma Talmadge being a Catholic. She says, [...] "Norma Talmadge! Norma Talmadge! That's all I hear, is 'Norma Talmadge'! Maybe you'd like to marry Norma Talmadge some day, and let the Pope <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the rest}} of your life." [...] She [...] "gets even" [...] with Morris, though, when she comments, seeing a picture of Rudolph Valentino, [...] "I think it's a sin for a man to be as pretty as he is. I'd be scared stiff to let a man like him touch me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Norquist and {{his wife}} {{attended}} the annual Burning Man festival in August 2014 in Black Rock, Nevada. Norquist explained that he wishes to attend because, [...] "There's no government that organizes this. That's what happens when nobody <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>You</b> just figure it out. So Burning Man is a refutation of {{the argument that the}} state has a place in nature." ...|$|R

500|$|Deus Ex {{received}} critical acclaim, attaining a {{score of}} 90 out of 100 from 28 critics on Metacritic. Thierry Nguyen from Computer Gaming World said that the game [...] "delivers moments of brilliance, idiocy, ingenuity, and frustration." [...] Computer Games Magazine praised the title for its deep gameplay and its use of multiple solutions to situations in the game. Similarly, Edge highlighted the game's freedom of choice, saying that Deus Ex [...] "never <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.

500|$|The game {{is noted}} for its simple combat system that would [...] "disappoint those craving sheer {{mechanical}} depth", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. [...] The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that [...] "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, even though the game is always <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do". [...] Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls [...] "painfully short" [...] with [...] "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that [...] "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not {{for the fact that the}} player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending." ...|$|R
