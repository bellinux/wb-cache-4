50|$|The {{length of}} time {{convictions}} are kept on the record varies according to <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>conviction.</b> Convictions will be removed from a criminal record after 5 years (suspended sentences, fines, and community service supplementary to a suspended sentence), 10 years (custodial sentences less than 2 years, community service) or 20 years (custodial sentences between 2-5 years). If no recent convictions {{have been added to}} an individual's records, judgments will be removed upon death or when the individual reaches 90 years old.|$|E
50|$|Although this {{database}} is not public, {{applications for}} a criminal records disclosure {{can be made}} to the DCREM, anyone who has lived in Slovenia for a significant amount of time may apply for the disclosure of a particular criminal record. Although perspective employers cannot request a copy directly from the DCREM, they must request this from the perspective employee.The time in which a conviction remains on a person's criminal record depends on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>conviction</b> received, i.e. The longer the prison sentence served the longer the conviction remains on the record, up to 15 years. If a conviction is 15 years imprisonment this shall never be removed from the criminal record. However, if the conviction is removed, then all rights are given back to the person in question, as if the conviction had never been received at all.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{relative}} contribution of hyperactivity, conduct, {{and emotional problems}} in predicting criminal offending. Method: In all, 173 boys aged 6 to 8 years (assessed for hyperactivity, conduct, and emotional problems) were followed up 19 years later by examining criminal offense histories. Results: Significant main effects for total and violent convictions were found, the strongest being for violent criminal offenses. Conduct problems predicted general offending (irrespective of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>conviction),</b> whereas emotional problems were the single best predictor of violent convictions. Hyperactivity {{was not a significant}} predictor in the models. Conclusion: The findings provide insight into the developmental mechanisms that mediate criminal behavior by showing that childhood emotional problems independently contribute to the risk of violent offending in later...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} procedure is developed to analyze recidivism in samples which {{are subject to}} the presence of desisters and to multiple modes of reconviction. This allows for a more accurate study of individuals' transition and hazard in the type and timing of offenses following a specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>conviction.</b> The use of a nonparametric approach for investigating failure in the presence of other acting causes is shown; initial estimators of the probabilities of reconviction for different types of offenses are obtained, and the method can be used both to display the data and to choose an appropriate parametric family for the survival times. An exponential mixture model for competing risks is presented {{in such a way that}} it allows us to adjust for concomitant variables and to assess their effects on the probabilities both of reconviction for predetermined types of offenses and desistance and of the hazards of reconviction; a method for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities is suggested. A 21 -year follow-up of persons convicted of indecent assault on a female in 1973 illustrates the methods; we find a high probability of sexual reconviction for individuals with previous sexual convictions and evidence of diversity and a raised hazard of reconviction for young chronic offenders...|$|E
40|$|On October 11, 2011, in United States v. Vann, the U. S.

50|$|In the United States, {{most states}} allow for expungement of {{criminal}} records, though laws vary significantly by state. The availability of expungement and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> charge or <b>conviction</b> {{that may be}} expunged will depend upon {{the laws of the}} state in which the case was prosecuted. In some states, once sealed or expunged, all records of an arrest and/or subsequent court case are removed from the public record, and the individual may legally deny or fail to acknowledge ever having been arrested for or charged with any crime which has been expunged. Even after expungement, other states may maintain a public or confidential record of the charge and its disposition.|$|R
40|$|Amy Berning was the COTR {{for this}} project. This report {{summarizes}} how DWI conviction rates are calculated. Arrest and conviction {{data were obtained}} from ten sites along with information and opinions from local officials on how DWI conviction rates should be calculated. It was found that often DWI conviction rates were not calculated, {{or at least the}} information would not be released publicly. When rates or calculation methods were released, calculation methods differed among the sites, and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>conviction</b> rate quoted was largely a function of the type of agency doing the quoting and the data available to that agency. The DWI conviction process can be affected by plea bargains, speedy trial laws, offenders who fail to appear, and pre-trial diversion practices. Although it would seem that a state-wide, complex system would be necessary to provide all the data required to provide a system-wide conviction rate, the smallest site included in the study proved that, with cooperation from all the organizations involved, an effective system can be set up in any jurisdiction. The objective of the project was to examine various conviction rate formulas, but was not concerned with the success or lack thereof of convicting persons charged with DWI offenses in the participating jurisdictions. Individuals in those sites who {{agreed to participate in the}} project should b...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{determining}} patterns of criminal behaviour from official criminal histories, concentrating on the variety and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> offending <b>convictions.</b> The analysis is carried out {{on the basis of}} a multivariate latent Markov model which allows for discrete covariates affecting the initial and the transition probabilities of the latent process. We also show some simplifications which reduce the number of parameters substantially; we include a Rasch-like parameterization of the conditional distribution of the response variables given the latent process and a constraint of partial homogeneity of the latent Markov chain. For the maximum likelihood estimation of the model we outline an EM algorithm based on recursions known in the hidden Markov literature, which make the estimation feasible also when the number of time occasions is large. Through this model, we analyse the <b>conviction</b> histories <b>of</b> a cohort of offenders who were born in England and Wales in 1953. The final model identifies five latent classes and specifies common transition probabilities for males and females between 5 -year age periods, but with different initial probabilities.

40|$|People {{suffering}} from anxiety disorders hold anxious convictions such as ‘If I feel my heart pounding, I {{am going to}} have a heart attack’. Most often, these people {{have had the opportunity to}} learn that their convictions are untrue. After all, everybody must have felt their heart pounding every now and then, yet in most people this will never have resulted in a heart attack. Still, people {{suffering from}} anxiety disorders firmly believe in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> anxious <b>convictions.</b> This thesis shows that people suffering from anxiety disorders have a tendency to judge information relevant to their anxiety based on the rough-and-ready rule ‘what I believe is true’. This implicit rule prevents anxious convictions from being corrected, even when disconfirming evidence if widely available. It should be noted that not only people suffering from anxiety disorders make use of this rough-and-ready rule. When judging information regarding strongly held beliefs (like for instance ‘exercising is healthy’), almost everybody makes use of this rule. This thesis shows that people who heavily apply this rule tend to hold on to anxious notions that have been proven untrue longer than people with a lesser tendency to apply this rule. Because of this, people who heavily apply this rough-and-ready rule are at greater risk for developing an anxiety disorder. ...|$|R
40|$|New {{research}} by the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR) shows that prison is no more effective in deterring domestic violence (DV) offenders than a suspended sentence. BOCSAR compared 1, 612 matched pairs of DV offenders, one of whom received a prison sentence of 12 months or less and the other of whom received a suspended sentence of two years or less. The offenders were carefully matched {{on a wide range}} of factors, including age, Indigenous status, offence type(s), whether in custody in the last five years, level of socioeconomic disadvantage, legal representation, results of risk assessment instruments (LSI-R), past breaches of apprehended violence orders and the number and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> prior <b>convictions.</b> The number <b>of</b> ‘free’ days before the first new proven DV-related offence was then compared across the two matched groups. No significant difference was observed in DV-related reoffending between those who were given a prison sentence and those who were given a suspended sentence. After one year in the community, 20. 3 % of people given a suspended sentence and 20. 3 % of people given a prison sentence had at least one new DV-related offence. After three years in the community, the proportions were 34. 2 % and 32. 3 % respectively. These were not significantly different...|$|R

30|$|As {{the left}} {{half of the}} table shows, {{the results for the}} CEO study are quite {{different}} for recidivism outcomes. The CEO program significantly reduced arrests, convictions, and incarceration. Program group members were 10 percentage points less likely than control group members to be arrested (49 %, compared with 59 %). Program group members were also significantly less likely to be convicted of a crime and {{were less likely to be}} re-incarcerated, with reductions of 13 and 11 percentage points, respectively (60 % of program group members were incarcerated, compared with 71 % of control group members). Overall, the CEO transitional jobs program led to a 9 percentage point reduction in any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> recidivism (arrest, <b>conviction,</b> or incarceration) over the three year follow-up period. In summation, while the TJRD transitional jobs programs did not lead to reductions in recidivism among recently released former prisoners, the CEO transitional jobs program did so across a number of recidivism measures.|$|R

40|$|For over a century, {{immigrants}} have faced adverse immigration consequences if convicted <b>of</b> certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> offenses in criminal court. Many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>convictions</b> carry severe immigration penalties, including deportation, detention, and {{the denial of}} status like asylum or U. S. citizenship. The Supreme Court recently recognized that these penalties are so intimately tied to criminal court adjudications that criminal defense attorneys {{have a duty to}} advise noncitizen defendants of the immigration consequences of their guilty pleas in criminal court. Yet there is little clarity as to how one determines whether a particular conviction triggers an immigration penalty. Historically, courts have applied a categorical analysis for assessing the immigration consequences <b>of</b> a criminal <b>conviction.</b> Under a categorical analysis, an immigration official determines the penalties based on an assessment of the statutory definition of the offense, not the factual circumstances of the crime. However, recent Supreme Court, federal court, and agency decisions have ignored this longstanding analysis and have instead examined these issues through the lens of Taylor v. United States, a criminal sentencing case that adopts a categorical analysis in a different context. Distinguishing Taylor and its criminal sentencing rationales, recent decisions have invented a new approach for how past criminal convictions are assessed in the immigration context that now permits a circumstance-specific inquiry into facts beyond the criminal court’s findings in some immigration cases. Under these recent decisions, the immigration consequences <b>of</b> a criminal <b>conviction</b> no longer turn on the criminal court adjudication alone, but may also account for facts that were not proven or pleaded in the criminal court proceeding. This article argues that this shift in analysis is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the origins of categorical analysis in immigration law and its independent rationales, including its promotion of notice and an opportunity to be heard, uniformity, predictability, efficiency, and judicial review in the administrative agency context. The article further argues that, because of the flaw in the current debate, courts have failed to consider the negative impact that the erosion of categorical analysis has on the functioning of the current immigration and criminal justice systems. The rationales meriting categorical analysis apply with even greater force today than they did when categorical analysis was first articulated nearly a century ago...|$|R
