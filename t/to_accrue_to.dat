However, since these rules are regarded as applying only to Jews, and since traditional Rabbinical law regards being a Jew as something which is only maternally inheritable, {{the child of a}} male mamzer and a non-Jewish woman cannot be a mamzer. Notably, the child of a female mamzer and a non-Jewish man is an ordinary Jew, because both parents must be Jews in order for mamzer status <b>to</b> <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> the child, but the child does inherit Jewish status from the mother.|$|E

2500|$|A {{leveraged}} buyout (LBO) is a financial transaction {{in which a}} company is purchased {{with a combination of}} equity and debt, such that the company's cash flow is the collateral used to secure and repay the borrowed money. The use of debt, which has a lower cost of capital than equity, serves to reduce the overall cost of financing the acquisition. The cost of debt is lower because interest payments reduce corporate income tax liability, whereas dividend payments do not. [...] This reduced cost of financing allows greater gains <b>to</b> <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> the equity, and, as a result, the debt serves as a lever to increase the returns to the equity.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{results for}} the United States {{demonstrated}} that overall tax policy was mildly progressive — that is, when regressive state-local tax systems are combined with progressive federal taxes, the result is mildly progressive overall. On the spending side, early results illustrated that the distribution of expenditure benefits {{as a percentage of}} income was progressive as well, making the overall fiscal system more progressive that is apparent from the tax system alone. As a result, early studies found that overall fiscal incidence resulted in a net redistribution of income between income groups within the United States, from higher-income individuals to lower-income individuals. Here the term [...] "progressive" [...] refers <b>to</b> benefits <b>accruing</b> <b>to</b> lower-income individuals as opposed to those with higher incomes; [...] "regressive" [...] conversely refers <b>to</b> benefits <b>accruing</b> <b>to</b> higher-income individuals as opposed to those with lower incomes.
