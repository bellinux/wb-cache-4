40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems in both speaking and writing is to use appropriate collocation. Collocation is the two words or more which are linked together in appropriate for the patterns and naturally used by the native speakers in written and oral language. Usually, the collocation errors happen when the foreign learners are trying to translate the Indonesian language (SL) to the English language (TL). The interference of the learnerâs mother tongue has affected the translations into words per words. The aims of the study are 1) to find out the <b>negative</b> <b>transfers</b> of English collocations that students make, 2) to find out the category of the <b>negative</b> <b>transfers</b> of English collocations according to the Lexical Collocation Category. The method in this analysis is using the seven categories by BBI Combinatory Dictionary of English. From 24 writing assignments of Gunadarma Universityâs Students, the writer identified 59 <b>negative</b> <b>transfers</b> of lexical collocations which are classified into six categories which include L 1 Verb (Creation + Activation) + Noun have 32 (54. 24 %) <b>negative</b> <b>transfers,</b> L 3 (Adjective + Noun) have 11 (18. 64 %) <b>negative</b> <b>transfers,</b> L 4 (Noun + Verb) have 3 (5. 08 %) <b>negative</b> <b>transfers,</b> L 5 (N 1 + N 2) have 8 (13. 56 %) <b>negative</b> <b>transfers,</b> L 6 (Adverb + Adjective) have 3 (5. 08 %) <b>negative</b> <b>transfers,</b> and L 7 (Verb + Adverb) have 1 (1. 69 %) <b>negative</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|R
30|$|Second, {{another area}} to {{investigate}} is <b>negative</b> <b>transfer.</b> Most {{of these methods}} do not employ safeguards against <b>negative</b> <b>transfer.</b> More specifically, none of the surveyed techniques have such safeguards except RLG/GLG. This technique claims to avoid <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> by setting the right environment for knowledge transfer by ensuring the label spaces do not change after transformation; though this method does not necessarily prevent <b>negative</b> <b>transfer.</b> Thus, {{there is a need}} for research of methods which implement such safeguards or techniques that can be incorporated into current HTL methods for this task.|$|R
30|$|This paper surveys {{a number}} of works {{addressing}} the topic of <b>negative</b> <b>transfer.</b> The subject of <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> is still a lightly researched area. The expanded integration of <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> techniques into transfer learning solutions is a natural extension for future research. Solutions supporting multiple source domains enabling the splitting of larger source domains into smaller domains to more easily discriminate against unrelated source data are a logical area for continued research. Additionally, optimal transfer is another fertile area for future research. <b>Negative</b> <b>transfer</b> {{is defined as a}} source domain having a negative impact on a target learner. The concept of optimal transfer is when select information from a source domain is transferred to achieve the highest possible performance in a target learner. There is overlap between the concepts of <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> and optimal transfer; however, optimal transfer attempts to find the best performing target learner, which goes well beyond the <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> concept.|$|R

40|$|Source Language {{interference}} (SLI), or cross-linguistic influence, is {{the result}} of language transfer and interpretation. Language transfer can be classified into positive <b>transfer</b> and <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> or interference. While positive transfer facilitates the communicative function of interpretation, <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> may have <b>negative</b> impact, weakening the content and form of interpretation, which will influence the realization of its communicative function. In the thesis, concept and features of interpretation, as well as its relationship with language interference are explored. Then some interpreting materials are analyzed to prove the influence of SLI in interpretation. Finally, some general approaches and specific strategies are put forward, aiming at avoiding the SLI as much as possible and improving the quality of interpretation. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of English prepositions is particularly challenging for students learning English {{as a second}} language. This project explores the {{acquisition of}} English spatial expressions by Arab ESL learners. This study examines several issues that may affect the processes of acquiring the English prepositions among Arab ESL learners such as the age of acquisition, learning transfer, and frequency. Furthermore, it considers the difficulties that Arab learners may encounter when learning English spatial locatives via transfer phenomena. These phenomena involve possible positive <b>transfer</b> and <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> in second language acquisition. This is especially problematic {{in the case of}} the lack of a one-to-one mapping and the different number of prepositions in Arabic and English. The study elicits English prepositions by Arab ESL learners through a Cloze procedure. The experiment focuses on the use of the spatial prepositions in, on, and at across different levels of Saudi students in Miami.

30|$|The {{previous}} papers {{attempt to}} measure how related source data is to the target data in a transfer learning environment and then selectively transfer the information that is highly related. The experiments in the above papers demonstrate that accounting for <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> effects from source domain data can improve target learner performance. However, most transfer learning solutions do not attempt to account for <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> effects. Robust <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> measurements are difficult to define. Since the target domain typically has limited labeled data, it is inherently {{difficult to find a}} true measure of the relatedness between the source and target domains. Further, by selectively transferring information that seems related to the limited labeled target domain, a risk of overfitting in the target learner is a concern. The topic of <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> is a fertile area for further research.|$|R

At first, this paper presents the concept of transfer, and then it analyzes the factors, which affect the language transfer, including kinship, learning environment, teaching method, linguistic knowledge and experience, and learners' cognitive ability.

30|$|An early {{paper by}} Rosenstein [98] {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> in transfer learning and claims that the source domain needs to be sufficiently related to the target domain; otherwise, the attempt to transfer knowledge from the source can {{have a negative impact}} on the target learner. Cases of <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> are demonstrated by Rosenstein [98] in experiments using a hierarchical Naive Bayes classifier. The author also demonstrates the chance of <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> goes down as the number of labeled target training samples goes up.|$|R

40|$|In this {{narrative}} study, I explore the transformative visual cultural dialogue behind {{the sight of}} the veil or veiled women in Denton, Texas as a Western culture. The narrative is constructed from the experiences of three Western non-Muslim women participants who wore the veil publicly in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, especially Denton, Texas, for about two weeks, in the spring of 2014. The main question for this study is: How do veiled Western women incite transformative visual cultural dialogue and ideas concerning veiled women? To gather rich data to answer the study's question, I utilized qualitative narrative inquiry to explore the transformative dialogue that the veil, as a visual culture object, can incite in non-Muslim Western women's narratives. The study involves three participants who are non-Muslim American women who voluntarily wore the veil in public and recorded their own and other's reactions. The participants' interviews and diaries demonstrated that the veil incited a particular perceptive dialogue and often <b>transferred</b> <b>negative</b> meanings. For example, {{the sight of the}} veil suggested the notion of being Muslim, and consequently, the ideas of not belonging. The reactions the participants received were either negative verbal interactions or physical ones, both of which are limited in this study to face gestures or some form of negative body language that is meant to be a message of disliking. In summation, this study shows that the women's veil is a visual culture symbol that <b>transfers</b> <b>negative</b> meaning in the DFW area in Texas...|$|R

30|$|A select {{number of}} {{previously}} surveyed papers contain solutions addressing <b>negative</b> <b>transfer.</b> The paper by Yang [136] addresses the <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> issue, which {{is presented in}} the “Heterogeneous transfer learning” section. The homogeneous solution by Gong [42] defines an ROD value that measures the relatedness between a source and target domain. The work presented in Chattopadhyay [14] is a multiple source transfer learning approach that calculates the source weights as a function of conditional probability differences between the source and target domains attempting to give the most related sources the highest weights. Duan [28] proposes a transfer learning approach that only uses source domains that are deemed relevant and test data demonstrates better performance compared to methods with no <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> protection.|$|R
30|$|The {{paper by}} Ge [40] claims that {{knowledge}} transfer can be inhibited {{due to the}} existence of unrelated or irrelevant source domains. Further, current transfer learning solutions are focused on transferring knowledge from source domains to a target domain, but are not concerned about different source domains that could potentially be irrelevant and cause <b>negative</b> <b>transfer.</b> In the model presented by Ge [40], there is a single target domain with limited labeled data and multiple labeled source domains for knowledge <b>transfer.</b> To reduce <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> effects from unrelated source domains, each source is assigned a weight (called the Supervised Local Weight) corresponding to how related the source is with the target (the higher the weight the more it is related). The supervised local weight is found by first using a spectral clustering algorithm (Chung [17]) on the unlabeled target information and propagating labels to the clusters from the labeled target information. Next, each source is separately clustered and labels assigned to the clusters from the labeled source. The supervised local weight of each source cluster is computed by comparing the source and target clusters. This solution further addresses the issue of imbalanced class distribution in source domains by preventing a high-weight class assignment in the case of high-accuracy predictions in a minority target class. The final target learner uses the supervised local weights to attenuate the effects of <b>negative</b> <b>transfer.</b> Experiments are performed in three application areas including cardiac arrhythmia detection, spam email filtering, and intrusion detection. Area under the curve is measured as the performance metric. The source and target domains are represented by a homogeneous feature input space. The method presented in this paper is compared against methods by Luo [71], by Gao [38], by Chattopadhyay [14], and by Gao [37]. The Luo [71] and Gao [38] methods are the worst performing, most likely {{due to the fact that}} these solutions do not attempt to combat <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> effects. The Chattopadhyay [14] and Gao [37] methods are the next best performing, which have means in place to reduce the effects of <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> from the source domains. The Chattopadhyay [14] and Gao [37] methods do address the <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> problem but do not address the imbalanced distribution issue. The Ge [40] method does exhibit the best overall performance due to the handling of <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> and imbalanced class distribution.|$|R

40|$|Transfer {{learning}} {{method has}} been widely used in machine learning when training data is limited. However, class noise accumulated during learning iterations can lead to <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> which can adversely affect performance when more training data is used. In this paper, we propose a novel method to identify noise samples for noise reduction. More importantly, the method can detect the point where <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> happens such that transfer learning can terminate at the near top performance point. In this method, we use {{the sum of the}} Rademacher distribution to estimate the class noise rate of transferred data. Transferred data having high probability of being labeled wrongly is removed to reduce noise accumulation. This negative sample reduction process can be repeated several times during transfer learning until we find the point where <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> occurs. As we can detect the point where <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> occurs, our method not only has the ability to delay the point where <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> happens, but also the ability to stop transfer learning algorithms at the right place for top performance gain. Evaluation based on cross-lingual/domain opinion analysis evaluation data set shows that our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art result. Furthermore, our system shows a monotonic increase trend in performance improvement when more training data are used beating the performance degradation curse of most transfer learning methods when training data reaches certain size.

30|$|The {{high-level}} {{concept of}} transfer learning {{is to improve}} a target learner by using data from a related source domain. But {{what happens if the}} source domain is not well-related to the target? In this case, the target learner can be negatively impacted by this weak relation, which is referred to as <b>negative</b> <b>transfer.</b> In a big data environment, there may be a large dataset where only a portion of the data is related to a target domain of interest. For this case, {{there is a need to}} divide the dataset into multiple sources and employ <b>negative</b> <b>transfer</b> methods when using transfer learning algorithm. In the scenario where multiple datasets are available that initially appear to be related to the target domain of interest, it is desired to select the datasets that provide the best information transfer and avoid the datasets that cause <b>negative</b> <b>transfer.</b> This allows for the best use of the available large datasets.
