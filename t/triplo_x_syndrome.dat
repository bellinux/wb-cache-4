40|$|Ph. D, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2011 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore what {{contributes}} to resilience in females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome</b> can be defined as an inherited (genetic) condition that causes mental impairment, attention deficit and hyperactivity, anxiety and unstable mood, autistic behaviours, hyper-extensible joints, and seizures. I became aware of Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome</b> during my time as a live-in caretaker to an adolescent female who was diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Because she coped with her disability so resiliently, I was encouraged to explore what contributes to resilience in females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> I followed a qualitative approach, anchored in the interpretivist paradigm. This means that I tried to understand the resilience of females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome</b> through the meanings that the participants in my study assigned to them. Furthermore, I worked from a transformative paradigm, which meant that I was interested in changing the traditionally negative ways in which females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome</b> are seen. I followed a multiple case study approach, which included four case studies. I conveniently selected the first participant, but realised that convenience sampling was not very credible for a qualitative case study. An Advisory Panel was then used to purposefully recruit three more participants. In order to explore what contributed to their resilience, I made use of interviews, observations, and visual data collection. I also interviewed adults (e. g. parents, teachers and consulting psychologists) who were significantly involved in the lives of my participants. My findings suggest that resilience in females with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome</b> is rooted in protective processes within the individual as well as within her family and environment. Because my findings do not point to one specific resource, my study underscores newer understandings of resilience as an Eco systemic transaction. Most of the resilience-promoting resources noted by the participants in my study as contributing to their resilience have been identified as resilience-promoting in previous studies. Although the themes that emerged in my study have been reported in resilience previously, I make a contribution to theory because I link traditional resilience-promoting resources to resilience in females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Peer support was previously reported as a resilience-promoting resource, but in my study I noticed that the main source of peer support came from peers who were also disabled. Furthermore, my study transforms how we see females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> This transformation encourages communities and families to work together towards resilience in females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Doctora...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Currently, {{there is}} no {{adequate}} animal model to study the detailed molecular biochemistry of fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the leading heritable form of mental impairment. In this study, we sought to establish the use of immature neural cells derived from adult tissues as a novel model of fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{that could be used}} to more fully understand the pathology of this neurogenetic disease. Methods By modifying published methods for the harvest of neural progenitor cells from the post-mortem human brain, neural cells were successfully harvested and grown from post-mortem brain tissue of a 25 -year-old adult male with fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and from brain tissue of a patient with no neurological disease. Results The cultured fragile X cells displayed many of the characteristics of neural progenitor cells, including nestin and CD 133 expression, as well as the biochemical hallmarks of fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome,</b> including CGG repeat expansion and a lack of FMRP expression. Conclusion The successful production of neural cells from an individual with fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> opens a new avenue for the scientific study of the molecular basis of this disorder, as well as an approach for studying the efficacy of new therapeutic agents. </p...|$|R
40|$|In 1986, a {{population}} study of school {{children in the}} city of Coventry gave an overall prevalence in males and females for fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> of 1 / 952. The 29 children diagnosed as having fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> in this study have been re-evaluated with molecular diagnostic techniques. Eighteen of the original 29 children have been found not to have the expansion of the FMR 1 gene associated with fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Revised prevalence figures have been calculated giving rise to an overall prevalence figure of 1 / 2720 (range 1 / 2198 - 1 / 3089). If the four children lost to follow up are also assumed not to have the fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the revised prevalence figure was 1 / 5714 (range 1 / 4762 - 1 / 6349). Clinical review of boys with severe mental retardation from this and a subsidiary study show that the clinical features of head circumference greater than the 50 th centile, testicular volume greater than the 50 th centile, and IQ between 35 and 70 remain helpful in distinguishing boys with fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> from those who have non-specific mental retardation...|$|R
40|$|The fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{a common}} X-linked mental {{retardation}} and autism, affecting females as well as males. The fragile site X chromosomes were studied {{in a series of}} 153 mentally retarded boys of unknown etiology to determine the frequency of fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and to assess the feasibility of making a clinical diagnosis of the fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> in young boys before cytogenetic results were known. The 10 boys (6. 4 %) were positive for fra (X) (q 27). The phenotype of fra (X) (q 27) positive patients were typical except one who also had sex chromosomal mosaicism. There were three pairs of siblings among the fra (X) (q 27) positive patients. Frequency of expression of the fragile site was in 10 to 47 per cent of cells. In addition, 19 boys showed a previously unsuspected chromosomal abnormality.

40|$|Summary Fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{patients}} present neuronal alterations {{that lead}} to severe intellectual disability, but the underlying neuronal circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. An exciting hypothesis postulates that reduced GABAergic inhibition of excitatory neurons is a key component in the pathophysiology of fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Here, I directly test this idea. First, I show that a Drosophila melanogaster model of fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> exhibits strongly impaired olfactory behaviors. In line with this, olfactory representations are less odor-specific due to broader response tuning of excitatory projection neurons. I find that impaired inhibitory interactions underlie reduced specificity in olfactory representations. Finally, I show that defective lateral inhibition across projection neurons is caused by weaker inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. I provide direct evidence that deficient inhibition impairs sensory computations and behavior in an in vivo model of fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Together with evidence of impaired inhibition in autism and Rett syndrome, these findings suggest a potentially general mechanism for intellectual disability. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{the most}} common {{inherited}} cause of mental retardation. Early diagnosis is important not only for appropriate management of individuals but also to identify carriers who are unaware of their high risk of having an affected child. The disorder is associated with a cytogenetically visible fragile site (FRAXA) at Xq 27. 3, caused by amplification of a (CGG) n repeat sequence within the gene at this locus designated FMR 1. Clinical and molecular studies have been undertaken to screen for fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> in 154 children with moderate and severe learning difficulties of previously unknown origin. Southern blot analysis of peripheral blood showed the characteristic abnormally large (CGG) n repeat sequence associated with fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> in four of the 154 children. The findings were confirmed by cytogenetic observation of the fragile site and by further molecular studies. The families of the affected children were offered genetic counselling and DNA tests to determine their carrier status. These findings show that there are still unrecognised cases of fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Given the difficulty of making a clinical diagnosis and the implications for families when the diagnosis is missed, screening in high risk populations may be justified.

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{expansion}} of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 50 UTR of FMR 1. This expansion leads to transcriptional silencing of the gene. However, othermutationalmechanisms, such as deletions of FMR 1, also cause fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The result is the same for both the expansion mediated silencing and deletion, absence of the gene product, FMRP. We report here on an 11 -year-old boy with a cognitive and behavioral profile with features compatible with, but not specific to, fragile <b>X</b> <b>syndrome.</b> A mosaic deletion of 1, 013, 395 bp was found using high-density X chromosome microarray analysis followed by sequencing of the deletion breakpoints.
