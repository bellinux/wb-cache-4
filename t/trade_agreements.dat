5|$|The {{disastrous}} {{effects of}} the Smoot–Hawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the 32nd U.S. president and the Democratic Party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of trade liberalization. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreements</b> Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average tariff rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential tariff rates. The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates.|$|E

5|$|Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially {{received}} in Spain and Rome, {{it happened at}} a time when Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity.

Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Alfonsín {{refused to}} foster {{diplomatic}} relations with the Brazilian military government, and only did so when the dictatorship ended and José Sarney became president. One of their initial concerns was to increase Argentine–Brazilian trade. Both presidents met in Foz do Iguaçu and issued a joint declaration about the peaceful use of nuclear power. A second meeting in Buenos Aires strengthened the <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> Argentina and Brazil signed the Program of Integration and Economic Cooperation (PICE), and in 1988 both countries and Uruguay agreed to create a common market. This led to the 1991 Treaty of Asunción, that created the Mercosur.|$|E

5|$|Many Japanese-Palauans assumed key {{positions}} in the public service sector and politics. At least one ethnologist, Mark Peattie, suggested that the strong representation of Japanese-Palauans in leading positions in society {{could be attributed to}} the mainstream Japanese education which they had received in their youth. Palau's first president, Kuniwo Nakamura—who was half-Japanese—fostered closer diplomatic ties between Japan and Palau during his Presidency. During a state visit to Japan in 1996, Emperor Akihito personally received Nakamura, and the visit was commended by Palauans and Japanese alike. Nakamura's visit prompted Japan to channel monetary aid to Palau to facilitate repair work on the Koror-Babeldaob Bridge and securing special <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> with Japan.|$|E

Sealed by India after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Nathu La was re-opened in 2006 {{following}} numerous bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> The opening of the pass shortens the travel distance to important Hindu and Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the region and was expected to bolster the economy of the region by playing {{a key role in the}} growing Sino-Indian trade.

5|$|Perón's second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favoured {{increased}} agricultural output over industrialization, but {{industrial growth}} and high wages {{in previous years}} had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as {{the majority of those}} who worked in agriculture laboured on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates. Argentina signed <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening the market to international trade as Perón's second economic plan sought to capitalize on the country's comparative advantage in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{issue of}} {{debate within the}} {{sovereignty}} movement became on what terms sovereignty would be put before the electorate. Parizeau, long identified with the independantiste wing of the party, was opposed to the PQ's general historical preference for an economic relationship {{with the rest of}} Canada to be offered alongside sovereignty, as he thought this would encourage the Federal government to simply refuse to negotiate and cast the project as doomed, as had happened in 1980. As a practical matter, Parizeau believed that given the emotional circumstances of separation a special partnership was unlikely, and that given free <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> and other multilateral institutions it was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} {{system is the}} worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic actors that together facilitate international flows of financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening {{the effects of the}} global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the international monetary system after World War II improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.|$|E
