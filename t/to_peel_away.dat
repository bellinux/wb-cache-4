5|$|In the past, some {{visitors}} {{would write}} {{their names on}} the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised {{the sanctity of the}} Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began <b>to</b> <b>peel</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Society {{and some}} {{healthcare}} professionals often marginalise pregnant women who take illicit substances. Likewise the midwives {{who care for}} these women are often viewed as working {{on the edge of}} society. The aim of this research was to examine the lived world of these midwives to gain insight into the world of their work. DESIGN: A phenomenological study informed by Heidegger, Gadamer and Merleau-Ponty was chosen to frame these lived experiences of the midwives. Using face-to-face phenomenological interviews data were collected from 12 midwives whose work is only caring for women who take illicit drugs. RESULTS: The 3 fundamental themes that emerged from the study were: making a difference, establishing partnerships: and letting go and refining practice. Conclusions and impetus for this paper: Lived experiences are unique and can be difficult for researchers to grasp. The stories told by participants are sometimes intangible and often couched in metaphor. This paper aims to discuss lived experience and suggests that like an onion, several layers have <b>to</b> be <b>peeled</b> <b>away</b> before meaning can be exposed; and like peeling onions, each cover reveals another layer beneath that is different from before and different from the next. Exemplars from this midwifery study are used to explain lived experiences...|$|R

40|$|Richard von Mises (1883 1953), {{the younger}} brother of Ludwig, had an Apollonian genius. He was a leading probabilist and {{statistician}} of the world, a leading engineer and designer of airplanes for the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and a leading philosopher of positivism. Von Mises was rational and measured, a man of observations and proportions. Though too modest to say so, {{he was a hero}} in his own story of scientific philosophy. A Harvard professor, von Mises was also learned in the humanities: his Positivism: A Study in Human Understanding (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1939 [1951]) is painted with images from Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and Goethe, and in equal proportions with the positivist icons of Mach and Comte and Kant (pp. 401 04). Von Mises owned and loved the world s largest collection of Rilke poetry before bequeathing the collection to Harvard s Houghton library. But von Mises believed his Dionysian self to be rhetorically separable from the positivist-scientist self, and lower. He tried <b>to</b> <b>peel</b> rhetoric <b>away</b> from science and gaze at its logical and empirical clarity. Abraham Wald was his student. His theory of collective probability influenced the econometrics of Trygve Haavelmo. Yet econometricians and philosophers younger than Arnold Zellner have never heard of Richard von Mises. ...|$|R

50|$|Two {{commercial}} preparations using hexachlorophene, pHisoDerm and pHisoHex, {{were widely}} used as antibacterial skin cleansers {{in the treatment}} of acne, with pHisoDerm developed for those allergic to the active ingredients in pHisoHex. In the US during the 1960s, both were available over the counter. After the ban was enacted, pHisoDerm was reformulated without hexachlorophene, and continued to be sold over-the-counter, while pHisoHex, which contained 3% hexachlorophene (three times the legal limit imposed in 1972), became available (and remains available today) as a prescription body wash. In the European Community countries during the 1970s and 1980s, pHisoHex was available over the counter. A related product, pHisoAc, was used as a skin mask <b>to</b> dry and <b>peel</b> <b>away</b> acne lesions. Another preparation, pHiso-Scrub, was a hexachlorophene-impregnated sponge for scrubbing, has since been discontinued.

Sanofi-Aventis was the sole manufacturer of pHisoHex, while The Mentholatum Company owns the pHisoDerm brand today. Sanofi-Aventis discontinued production of several forms of pHisoHex in August 2009 and discontinued all production of pHisoHex in September 2013.|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} way to husk rice is to pass {{it between}} two rubber rollers that are rotating with a surface speed differential. The resulting normal pressure and shear stress causes the husk <b>to</b> be <b>peeled</b> <b>away</b> from the kernel. The process is suited to high-rice flow rates, but is energy intensive and can result in considerable wear to the surfaces of the rollers. The operating parameters for machines of this design are usually determined and set empirically. In this article, some experiments and calculations had been carried out in order to explore the mechanisms involved in husking rice grains using this method. A simple sliding friction rig with load cell and high-speed camera was used to observe the mechanisms that occur during husking. The husking performance of different rubbers was compared {{for changes in the}} applied normal load. It was found that grains rotate between the rubber counterfaces on initial motion before being husked. In addition, harder rubbers were found to husk a higher proportion of entrained grains at lower applied normal load. By measuring the coefficient of friction between rice and rubber samples, the shear force required to husk a given percentage of grains could be calculated and was shown to be constant regardless of rubber type. Based on the mechanism seen in the high-speed video, it was evident that there was a limiting shear stress that was the governing factor over the husked ratio...|$|R
5000|$|The {{asthenosphere}} rises {{until it}} comes {{into contact with}} the base of the lower crust, causing the lower crust and lithospheric mantle to start <b>to</b> <b>peel</b> <b>away.</b> Slumping, cracking, or plume erosion facilitates the intrusion of underlying asthenosphere. [...] Potential energy that drives the delamination is released as the low density, hot asthenosphere rises and replaces the higher density, cold lithosphere. Separation of lowermost crust and lithospheric mantle is controlled by the effective viscosity of the upper continental crust. These processes often occur in environments of rifting, plume erosion, continental collision or where there is convective instability.|$|E
50|$|Patents on Manual label {{dispensers}} {{go back to}} the 1920s. They are designed for light-duty use. They are operated by hand and are not automated, but still assist in the process of removing labels from their liners. Many manual {{label dispensers}} can dispense multiple rolls at once. Operation is performed by pulling the liner/backing paper around a plate or bar which causes the label <b>to</b> <b>peel</b> <b>away</b> from the backing paper. This happens because the backing paper is usually thinner than the label itself and is also underneath. When the liner is forced around a tight radius the label lifts away and protrudes through the front or top of the dispenser.|$|E
