5|$|Maryland had {{previously}} shown {{an ability to}} strike quickly on offense and did so again in the game. In the 2008 season, the team scored 18out of 28touchdowns in drives consisting of six or fewer plays or less than <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> game time. This led to the team often trailing opponents in time of possession. In the Humanitarian Bowl, Maryland continued the pattern by scoring in the first 1:01 with a 59-yard Chris Turner pass to Adrian Cannon. Maryland also possessed the ball for 2:26 less than Nevada.|$|E

However, as he got up, he then fell to his knees before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately carried to the stadium's medical room where attempts were made to resuscitate him.|$|E
5|$|Before the kickoff, seven Maryland players, {{including}} six starters, received partial-game suspensions {{for violating the}} team's curfew. Maryland took a quick lead within the first <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> play, but repeated errors allowed Nevada to remain competitive and the lead changed hands five times. In the second quarter, Nevada's dual-threat quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, was hobbled by an ankle injury that altered the complexion of the game. Nevertheless, Kaepernick remained in the game for almost its entirety {{and was able to}} scramble for a touchdown. Halfway through the third quarter, Maryland's leading running back, Da'Rel Scott, made his first appearance of the game. He {{had been one of the}} suspended players, but scored twice in the final quarter to help secure a victory for the Terrapins.|$|E

5|$|Fàbregas {{was linked}} with a {{move away from}} the London after he was an unused {{substitution}} in the 2016–17 Premier League opener against West Ham. On 20 August 2016, Fàbregas once again started on the bench against Watford, entering the match in the second half to replace Nemanja Matić and creating an assist for Diego Costa, who scored the winner in a 2–1 victory. In the post-match press conference, Fàbregas earned the praise of manager, Conte, for his inspiring performance in the comeback win as well as the attitude he shows during training sessions. Fàbregas's first two goals of the season came in an EFL Cup tie against Leicester City on 20 September, both coming within <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> each other in extra time to win the game 4–2, the victory moving Chelsea on to the Round of 16.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by Class of '44, a slice-of-life film made up of vignettes about Herman Raucher and Oscar Seltzer's experiences in college. Class of '44 involves the boys facing army service {{in the last year}} of World War II. The only crew member from Summer of '42 to return to the project was Raucher himself, who wrote the script; a new director and composer were brought in to replace Mulligan and Legrand. Of the principal four cast members of Summer of '42, only Jerry Houser and Gary Grimes returned for prominent roles, with Oliver Conant making two brief appearances totaling less than <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> screen time. Jennifer O'Neill did not appear in the film at all, nor was the character of Dorothy mentioned.|$|E
5|$|In week 12, in {{what would}} turn out to be a preview of Super Bowl XXI, veteran {{defensive}} end George Martin (at 34 the oldest player on the team) intercepted a pass from Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway and returned it 78yards for a touchdown before being tackled from behind in the end zone by a celebrating Lawrence Taylor. Then in the final <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the game, Simms hit fan–favorite Phil McConkey for a 46-yard pass. This led to another game-winning kick from Allegre as the Giants defeated Denver 19–16 in front of 75,116 fans at Giants Stadium. With the victory the Giants completed their second five-game winning streak of the season, several of them in close contests; the margin of victory in those five games was 7, 3, 3, 2, and 3 points.|$|E

5|$|The Canadiens were {{scheduled}} to play the Montreal Maroons the evening of March 9, a game the NHL offered to cancel in honour of Morenz's death. However Mary insisted the game be played, saying that Morenz would have wanted the game to continue. The players on the Canadiens and Maroons wore black armbands for the game, and prior to the start, <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> silence were observed in his honour.

5|$|The referee added <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> injury {{time at the}} end {{of extra}} time, during which time Manchester United won another free kick, but Scholes' shot was {{straight}} at the Arsenal defensive wall. Then, with just seconds left in regulation time, Ronaldo made a break towards the Arsenal half, only to be cynically body-checked by Reyes. Referee Styles made no hesitation and showed Reyes a second yellow card, making the Spaniard the second player to be sent off in an FA Cup Final, after Manchester United's Kevin Moran in 1985. The full-time whistle went immediately after Reyes' dismissal, and the match finished at 0–0, making it the first FA Cup Final to result in a penalty shootout.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} of the season came {{in a game against}} the Minnesota Vikings in November. Trailing Minnesota 20–19 late in the fourth quarter in the Metrodome, Phil Simms {{completed}} a desperate fourth and 17 pass to Bobby Johnson for a first down. The completion led to Raul Allegre's fifth field goal and an important Giants victory. The following week, veteran defensive end George Martin intercepted a pass from Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway and returned it 78yards for a touchdown. Then in the final <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the game, Simms hit fan–favorite Phil McConkey for a 46-yard pass. This led to another game-winning kick from Allegre as the Giants defeated Denver 19-16. In a Monday night encounter at San Francisco the next week, the Giants overcame a 17–0 halftime deficit to Joe Montana's 49ers en route to a 21–17 victory.|$|E

5|$|Trinidad {{traveled}} to San Diego, California and defeated the IBF welterweight champion Maurice Blocker in two rounds, {{in a fight}} card that took place on June 19, 1993, televised by Showtime. Trinidad spent the first <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the fight analyzing Blocker's style. With 11 {{seconds left in the}} first round, one of Trinidad's punches injured Blocker, who barely survived the round. In the second round, the champion's condition appeared to improve, but after the first 30 seconds, another Trinidad punch injured him. Trinidad followed with a combination, scoring a knockout at 1:49 in the round when the referee stopped the fight. Afterwards, tournament organizer Don King's exclusive relationship to stage fights for the cable channel Showtime meant that Trinidad would be showcased regularly on Showtime Championship Boxing.|$|E
5|$|A throw-in by Hagi led to Şükür {{attempting}} to reach Erdem, {{who was in}} the penalty area, but was tackled and match play continued, which saw Arsenal attack on the counter under Parlour, whose volley shot went wide. Overmars then had an opportunity, after being given the ball by Henry, but the shot was off target. In the 70th minute, Korkmaz exchanged passes with Erdem, but his effort was successfully blocked by Tony Adams. Three minutes later, Parlour attempted a bending cross for Henry, but Taffarel read it easily. A well-played pass by Nwankwo Kanu ensured the ball reached Henry on the left area, who proceeded to give it to Overmars in the penalty area – however, Overmars's shot fell flat, but still enough for Taffarel to make a save. With four minutes of normal time remaining, the Turks came close to a winning goal, when Şükür collected the ball from the centre and entered Arsenal's area, but lost his footing before he could make an effort on goal, allowing Seaman to pick up the ball for a goal kick. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> extra time were added on, just when a free-kick was awarded to Galatasaray. Şükür took the shot, but the ball headed wide around the wall. It proved to be the final event in normal time, as the match entered extra time.|$|E

In the final <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> the half the Midshipmen forced the Mean Green to punt after three plays, and Navy quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada threw a 47-yard pass to running back Reggie Campbell. The Midshipmen ran for another touchdown on the next play. North Texas got the ball back with seven seconds left in the half, but chose not to attempt to score again. At {{the end of the first}} half, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen 49–45.|$|E

5|$|Alan Pattillo, a {{longtime}} scriptwriter and director for APF, was appointed the company's first official script editor in late 1964. This move was aimed {{to reduce the}} burden on Gerry Anderson who, while reserving his producer's right to overall creative control, had grown weary of revising scripts himself. Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs: veterans Pattillo and David Elliott alternated with the less-experienced Desmond Saunders and newcomer David Lane for each month's filming. Due to the difficulties of setting up takes, progress was slow: even on a productive day, it was rare for the crew to complete more than <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> puppet footage. In a contemporary interview, Hill noted that Thunderbirds contained several times as many shots as a typical live-action series.

5|$|At UEFA Euro 2004, Baroš {{scored the}} first {{goal for the}} Czech Republic in their {{first game of the}} tournament, a come-from-behind 2–1 victory over Latvia. With the goal he became the {{youngest}} goalscorer at the European Championships for the Czech Republic. His second goal of the tournament came against the Netherlands; the Dutch team had taken a two-goal lead over the Czechs before Jan Koller scored from a Baroš pass. Baroš then scored before Vladimír Šmicer completed the scoring, as the Czechs won the game 3–2. The third group match saw the Czech Republic make nine changes to their starting lineup, having already qualified for the quarter-finals. Baroš appeared as a substitute and scored the winning goal, as opponents Germany failed to advance to the next stage of the tournament. Baroš added two goals in <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> {{the second half of the}} Czechs' quarter-final win over Denmark, and finished as the tournament's Golden Boot winner with five goals.|$|E
5|$|CSKA kicked-off {{the first}} half of extra-time. Five minutes into the half, Liverpool {{substitute}} Sinama Pongolle was booked.

His subsequent shot was saved by Akinfeev, but the ball rebounded to Cissé who scored to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. The half was brought to an end with Liverpool leading {{for the first time in}} the match. Liverpool kicked-off the second half of extra-time. CSKA had the first chance of the half, but Vágner Love's effort was easily saved by Reina. Liverpool responded midway through the half; Cissé's cross from the right side of the pitch was met by García, who scored. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Liverpool.|$|E
