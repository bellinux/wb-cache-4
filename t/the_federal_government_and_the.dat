5|$|Canada's federal {{structure}} divides government responsibilities between <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral {{and operate}} in parliamentary fashion {{similar to the}} House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, {{but these are not}} sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tribes, the Court held that removal treaties {{could only be}} enforced against the tribes by the federal government, not private parties (whether through self-help or through the courts). In other words, the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|From July 1895 to March 1901 Harrison {{served on}} the Board of Trustees of Purdue University, where Harrison Hall, a dormitory, was named in his honor. He wrote a series of {{articles}} about <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> presidency which were republished in 1897 as a book titled This Country of Ours. In 1896, Harrison at age 62 remarried, to Mary Scott Lord Dimmick, the widowed 37-year-old niece and former secretary of his deceased wife. Harrison's two adult children, Russell, 41 years old at the time, and Mary (Mamie) McKee, 38, disapproved of the marriage and did not attend the wedding. Benjamin and Mary had one child together, Elizabeth (February 21, 1897– December 26, 1955).|$|E
5|$|Recommendation #6: The roles, responsibilities, and {{authorities}} of local, state, and tribal governments (with respect to facility siting {{and other aspects}} of nuclear waste disposal) must be an element of the negotiation between <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other affected units of government in establishing a disposal facility. In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions. Additionally, states and tribes should retain—or where appropriate, be delegated—direct authority over aspects of regulation, permitting, and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and {{in a way that is}} helpful in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens.|$|E

The objective of the invasion was to topple Colonel Mohamed Bacar's leadership in Anjouan, an island part of the Union of Comoros, when he refused to step down after a disputed 2007 election, in defiance of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> AU. The Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean has had a fractious history since independence from France in 1975, experiencing more than 20 coups or attempted coups.|$|E
