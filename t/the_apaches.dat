5|$|Among the enthusiasms of <b>the</b> <b>Apaches</b> was {{the music}} of Debussy. Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy {{slightly}} since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued {{for more than ten}} years. In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece. <b>The</b> <b>Apaches</b> were loud in their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.|$|E

5|$|The tribes traded freely, {{and soon}} many had {{acquired}} French guns, while others had traded for Spanish horses. Tribes {{without access to}} either resource were left at a disadvantage. The Lipan Apache, who had been seasonal farmers, were soon pressed by the Comanche, who had horses, and the Wichita, who had guns. <b>The</b> <b>Apaches</b> were bitter enemies of the Tejas of East Texas and had transferred their enmity to the Spanish as friends of the Tejas. After discovering San Antonio in 1720, the Apache began repeatedly raiding the area to steal livestock, especially horses. An average of 3Spaniards died each year in Texas {{as a result of}} Apache attacks, with approximately 100animals taken each year. In retaliation, the Spanish launched multiple attacks on <b>the</b> <b>Apaches,</b> capturing horses and mules, hides and other plunder, and taking Apache captives, whom the Spanish used as household servants. By 1731, however, the San Antonio garrison was begging the government for help in negotiating a peace with the tribes.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} 1770s, the Comanche had raided in New Mexico. They {{were driven}} from New Mexico in 1779 by a broad assault led by New Mexico {{governor}} Juan Bautista de Anza and redirected their activities to the weakly defended Texas. During {{the same time period}} <b>the</b> <b>Apaches,</b> who had been stockpiling guns received from the Karankawas, returned to raiding settlements in Texas, violating their peace treaty.

5|$|On 27 May 2011, {{military}} officials announced that Apaches would be deployed {{as part of}} Operation Ellamy, the ongoing military intervention in Libya. The helicopters operated from the flight deck of HMS Ocean in conjunction with French Eurocopter Tiger helicopters over Misrata. <b>The</b> <b>Apaches</b> were also to assist in Operation Unified Protector, the enforcement of an embargo and no-fly zone upon Libya. On 14 June 2011, reports of British preparation to evacuate Yemen emerged, involving Apache and Merlin helicopters operating from Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels off the coast.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} {{settlers}} of the municipality, the Islanders {{and their descendants}} were designated hidalgos. The established settlers resented the Islanders for their new titles and exclusive privileges within the city government. The newcomers {{did not know how}} to handle horses, rendering them useless in mounted warfare against <b>the</b> <b>Apaches.</b> Unlike the established settlers, who relied on ranching, the Islanders were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage and the need for closer economic ties had helped to alleviate some of the infighting, and the original settlers were given permission to serve as magistrates and council members.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War, {{during which}} many U.S. Apaches {{operated}} from bases within Saudi territory, Saudi Arabia purchased twelve AH-64As for the Royal Saudi Land Force. It {{has been speculated}} that the Saudi purchase had motivated Israel to also procure <b>the</b> <b>Apaches.</b> In August 2006, the Saudi Arabian government began negotiations for Apache upgrades worth up to $400M, possibly remanufacturing their AH-64As to the AH-64D Longbow configuration. In September 2008, the U.S. Government approved the purchase of 12 AH-64Ds requested by Saudi Arabia.

During the 100-hour ground war a total of 277 AH-64s took part, destroying 278 tanks, numerous armored personnel carriers and other Iraqi vehicles.

5|$|Although he {{had never}} {{finished}} high school, {{with the help of}} the GI Bill, Rothenberg completed a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in 1954. He attended graduate school at the University of Chicago, where he was recognized as an argumentative, sometimes abrasive, graduate student with a keen mind. As a graduate student, Rothenberg reviewed W.E.D. Allens Caucasian Battlefields: A History of the Wars on the Turco-Caucasian Border, 1828–1921 (Cambridge University Press, 1953) for Journal of Modern History, He wrote his 1956 masters' thesis entitled General Crook and <b>the</b> <b>Apaches,</b> 1871–1874: the campaign in the Tonto Basin. Rothenberg received his doctorate from the University of Illinois: his 1959 dissertation, Antemurales Christianitatis: then military border in Croatia, 1522–1749, was published in 1960 by the University of Chicago Press, as The Military Border in Croatia, 1522–1749; he followed this with a second study, The Military Border in Croatia, 1750–1888: a study of an imperial institution in 1966, also published by University of Chicago Press.

5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers {{headed out to}} Sulfur Springs to deny that source of water to <b>the</b> <b>Apaches.</b> In the early light of day, Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding {{out of the mountains}} and attacked savagely. The wagons held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of the wagons. The warriors were met with rifle fire, as the teamsters circled the wagons in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able to avoid them.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} Apache raids {{led to a}} {{constant}} state of unease in San Antonio, and some families left the area, while others refused to leave the safety of the town to tend their livestock. The problems culminated with a late-night raid on San Antonio by 350Apache on June 30, 1745, retaliation for a Spanish military campaign several months before. The attackers were repelled with the assistance of 100Indians from Mission Valero. The Apache also preyed on other tribes, including the Deadose and Tonkawa. In the 1740s, these weaker tribes requested missions along the San Gabriel River in the hopes that the Spanish could protect them from attack. Mission San Francisco Xavier was established at the confluence of the San Gabriel River and Bushy Creek in January 1746 to serve the Deadose, Mayeye, and Coco Indians. In 1748 alone, <b>the</b> <b>Apaches</b> raided the mission four times, killing threesoldiers and four of the Indian residents. Many of the resident Indians fled the mission due to the threat of attacks. This did not deter the missionaries, who founded two more missions, San Ildefonso and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, in the area the following year. Within six months, all of the potential converts at San Ildefonso had left. By 1755, the missions were transferred to a new location on the San Marcos River.|$|E
