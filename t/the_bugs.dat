5|$|A {{number of}} {{animated}} cartoons were produced, including <b>the</b> <b>Bugs</b> Bunny cartoon Southern Fried Rabbit (1953), in which Bugs disguises himself as Uncle Tom and sings My Old Kentucky Home {{in order to}} cross the Mason-Dixon line; Uncle Tom's Bungalow (1937), a Warner Brothers cartoon supervised by Tex Avery; Eliza on Ice (1944), {{one of the earliest}} Mighty Mouse cartoons produced by Paul Terry; and Uncle Tom's Cabaña (1947), an eight-minute cartoon directed by Tex Avery.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{also are}} quite popular {{inspiration}} for many science-fiction insectoids, {{such as the}} Formics of Ender's Game, <b>the</b> <b>Bugs</b> of Starship Troopers, the giant ants in the films Them! and Empire of the Ants, Marvel Comics' super hero Ant-Man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in Phase IV. In computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the Master of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II. These characters are often credited with a hive mind, a common misconception about ant colonies.|$|E

5|$|Mia Ikumi {{spent a year}} {{designing}} the Tokyo Mew Mew manga before {{the release of the}} first volume in February 2001. The story she originally presented to her editors, Tokyo Black Cat Girl, featured a heroine named Hime Azumi. An intergalactic police officer named Masha gave her the ability to transform into a cat-girl and asked her to aid him in defeating alien invaders called <b>the</b> <b>Bugs.</b> After the production team decided to focus on five female superheroes, Ikumi was asked to reconstruct the lead character. She had reservations about the changes, as the character was originally designed for a more dramatic series.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2010, Symantec {{released}} the 18.5 version through Norton LiveUpdate. However, this update was later pulled due to numerous {{reports on the}} Norton forums that the update is causing system instability and freeze ups during system scans (both full and quick scans). This issue only affects some customers. Users affected by this update are advised to uninstall the product, run the Norton Removal Tool, and reinstall the 18.1 version from http://www.norton.com/nis11. Symantec later fixed <b>the</b> <b>bugs</b> and re-{{released the}} update.|$|E

Russell, the leader of the robbers, demands food and the police supply them with pizzas whose boxes include listening devices. <b>The</b> <b>bugs</b> pick up a language which the police identify as Albanian. They discover, however, that the conversations are in fact propaganda recordings of deceased Albanian communist dictator Enver Hoxha, implying that the robbers anticipated the attempted surveillance.|$|E
30|$|Shihab et al. (2010; 2012) {{developed}} a decision tree model, based on features about <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> report, <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> fix, and human factors, to predict which bugs would be reopened.

40|$|In {{open-source}} {{software development}} a new bug firstly is found by developers or users. Then <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> {{is described as}} a bug report, which is submitted to a <b>bug</b> repository. Finally <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> triager checks <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> report and typically assigns a developer to fix <b>the</b> <b>bug.</b> <b>The</b> assignment process is time-consuming and error-prone. Furthermore, a large number of bug reports are tossed (reassigned) to other developers, which increases bug-fix time. In order to quickly identify <b>the</b> fixer to <b>bug</b> reports we present an approach based on <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> tossing history and textual similarities between bug reports. This proposed approach is evaluated on Eclipse and Mozilla. The results show that our approach can significantly improve <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>bug</b> assignment: <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> fixer is often identified with fewer tossing events. </p...|$|R
5|$|Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch was {{broadcast}} on NBC {{as part of}} their Saturday morning children's lineup between September 7 and November 30, 1974; and before being cancelled, it continued to air regularly on the network until August 30, 1975. The series featured a total of 13 episodes with 3 segments each, bringing a total of 39 segments overall. During its original allocated time slot, the show rivaled <b>The</b> <b>Bugs</b> Bunny Show on ABC and repeats of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! on CBS; it also aired immediately following the animated adaptation of The Addams Family and right before Emergency +4 on NBC.|$|E
5|$|Testing was, however, able to {{continue}} in the meantime, as Platt-LePage had re-negotiated the XR-1 contract to cover a second flight-test aircraft. Built to a revised and improved version of the XR-1's design and designated XR-1A, the second aircraft had flown {{for the first time in}} May 1943. The XR-1A featured a revised cockpit covering compared to that of the XR-1, with the area of glazing being increased for improved visibility, and the pilot and observer's positions being reversed, the pilot now seated in the rear cockpit. During flight testing the XR-1A was found superior in flight performance to the XR-1; however, the controls were still proving troublesome, although the worst of <b>the</b> <b>bugs</b> did seem to have been worked out.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Who Framed Roger Rabbit rekindled an {{interest}} in the Golden Age of American animation, and sparked the modern animation scene. In 1991, Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey's Toontown for Disneyland, based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced; Tummy Trouble played in front of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Roller Coaster Rabbit was shown with Dick Tracy and Trail Mix-Up was included with A Far Off Place. The film also inspired a short-lived comic book and video game spin-offs, including two PC games, the Japanese version of <b>The</b> <b>Bugs</b> Bunny Crazy Castle (which features Roger instead of Bugs), a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy.|$|E

50|$|Typical bug {{tracking}} systems support {{the concept of}} the life cycle for a bug which is tracked through the status assigned to <b>the</b> <b>bug.</b> A bug tracking system should allow administrators to configure permissions based on status, move <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> to another status, or delete <b>the</b> <b>bug.</b> <b>The</b> system should also allow administrators to configure <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> statuses and to what extent a bug in a particular status can be moved. Some systems will e-mail interested parties, such as the submitter and assigned programmers, when new records are added or the status changes.|$|R
5|$|With {{the journal}} debugged, Data-Riku uncovers extra data that {{contains}} the secret to the journal's message. Mickey guides the reset Data-Sora to the extra world where he is tested by a virtual Roxas to endure the pain of having forgotten his friends {{as a result of}} being reset. Data-Sora defeats Data-Roxas and is allowed access to the deepest portion of Castle Oblivion. There he and Mickey encounter a virtual Naminé, who reveals the real Naminé as the one who left the message after discovering a set of memories relating to the people tied to the real Sora's heart—Roxas, Axel, Xion, Terra, Aqua, and Ventus—while restoring his lost memories; <b>the</b> <b>bugs</b> are also revealed to have been an unintentional side effect of her message. Before disappearing, Data-Naminé explains that it is the real Sora's duty to save these people. Mickey relays this message to Sora through the bottled letter shown at the end of Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E
5|$|Worn {{out by the}} effort, Urey {{left the}} project in February 1945, handing over his {{responsibilities}} to R. H. Crist. The K-25 plant commenced operation in March 1945, and as <b>the</b> <b>bugs</b> were worked out, the plant operated with remarkable efficiency and economy. For a time, uranium was fed into the S50 liquid thermal diffusion plant, then the K-25 gaseous, and finally the Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant; but soon {{after the war ended}} the thermal and electromagnetic separation plants were closed down, and separation was performed by K-25 alone. Along with its twin, K-27, constructed in 1946, it became the principal isotope separation plant in the early post-war period. For his work on the Manhattan Project, Urey was awarded the Medal for Merit by the Project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Volition {{aimed for}} a quality release, {{and promised to}} deliver a product without major bugs. Minor bugs would be fixed in a prompt manner. The shipped game, however, had {{deficiencies}} admitted by the team, such as problems with the multiplayer code, and a few design issues. The game underwent four patches, which resolved most of <b>the</b> <b>bugs,</b> and improved the multiplayer performance. Complaints about an online mission giving unfair scores led to Volition removing the mission from scoring play. Another patch allowed EAX capability to be enabled for Creative Sound Blaster sound cards. Interplay played its part in drumming up the community's interest by holding contests, and expanding material for the FreeSpace universe. Meanwhile, Volition created official star maps, and released Vasudan voice clips and story development notes. Interplay hired science-fiction writers such as Fred Saberhagen, Simon Hawke, and Jeff Grubb to write weekly FreeSpace stories for two months. Preparing for Silent Threats release, Interplay held a contest from July 28 to August 25, 1998, in which the submitted fan-designed missions could win their authors prizes such as free copies of Silent Threat, FreeSpace apparel, and gaming hardware. Entries were judged by a panel from PC Gamer, and qualified entries constituted half of the missions in Silent Threat.|$|E
