5|$|Kenyatta was an African nationalist, and was {{committed}} to the belief <b>that</b> <b>European</b> colonial rule in Africa must end. Like other anti-colonialists, he believed that under colonialism, the human and natural resources of Africa had been used not {{for the benefit of}} Africa's population but for the enrichment of the colonisers and their European homelands.|$|E
5|$|Although greatly {{obstructed}} by Ranavalona's policies, French and British {{political interests}} in Madagascar remained undiminished. Divisions between traditionalist and pro-European factions at the queen's court created opportunities <b>that</b> <b>European</b> intermediaries exploited {{in an attempt}} to hasten the succession of Ranavalona's son, Radama II. The young prince disagreed with many of his mother's policies and was amenable to French proposals for the exploitation of the island's resources, as expressed in the Lambert Charter he concluded with a French representative in 1855. These plans were never successful, however, and Radama II was not to take the throne until 1861, when Ranavalona died aged 83.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} <b>that</b> <b>European</b> {{settlers}} {{first arrived in}} South Africa in 1652, the country was divided on racial lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided. Following its general election victory in 1948, the National Party, led by Daniel Malan, formalised this racism under a government policy called apartheid. Under apartheid, different races were kept apart {{in all aspects of}} life. This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down and laws, supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{book was}} also well {{furnished}} with maps, including a series in which {{areas of the}} word were progressively revealed from being obscured with brown ink, showing the {{different areas of the}} world <b>that</b> <b>Europeans</b> had explored. The areas <b>that</b> <b>Europeans</b> had explored were called the [...] "known world".|$|R

5|$|Lexus has {{not sold}} {{as well in}} Europe, where it suffers from smaller brand recognition, image, and a less-developed {{dealership}} network. In European markets, the Lexus LS has ranked behind Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW in flagship luxury car sales. Automotive analysts have suggested a possible rationale for the sales disparity, in <b>that</b> <b>European</b> buyers place less emphasis on vehicle reliability and have more brand loyalty to established domestic marques. In contrast, the Lexus LS has ranked second in sales to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (and ahead of rivals from BMW, Audi, and Jaguar) in markets outside Europe, such as South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The plan's aim was {{to rebuild}} the {{democratic}} and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to Europe's balance of power, such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections. The plan also stated <b>that</b> <b>European</b> prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery. One month later, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, creating a unified Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council (NSC). These would become the main bureaucracies for US policy in the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} approach to Arctic exploration had relied on large-scale forces, with a presumption <b>that</b> <b>European</b> techniques could be successfully transplanted into the hostile polar climate. Over the years this strategy had brought little success, and {{had led to}} heavy losses of men and ships. By contrast, Nansen's method of using small, trained crews, and harnessing Inuit and Sami expertise in his methods of travel, had ensured that his expedition was completed without a single casualty or major mishap.|$|E
2500|$|A 2011 survey {{published}} by YouGov suggests {{that more than}} {{four out of five}} people in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy think the financial sector has a responsibility to help repair the damage caused by the economic crisis. A 2011 Eurobarometer poll of more than 27,000 people found <b>that</b> <b>Europeans</b> are strongly in favour of a Financial Transactions Tax, by a margin of 61% to 26%. It found <b>that</b> <b>Europeans</b> [...] "strongly support the various measures <b>that</b> the <b>European</b> Union could adopt to reform the global financial markets... about the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, this proposal is nevertheless supported by more than six out of ten respondents (61%). A quarter of Europeans are against it, possibly because of the fear that they themselves might be subject to this tax." ...|$|R

5|$|A year later, he {{was elected}} to the Netherlands' {{national}} parliament, but his first four years in parliament drew little attention. However, his appointment in 2002 as a public spokesman for the VVD led Wilders to become more well known for his outspoken criticism of Islamic extremism. Tensions immediately developed within the party, as Wilders found himself to be to the right of most members, and challenged the party line in his public statements. He was expelled from the VVD parliamentary party, and in September 2004, Wilders left the VVD, having been a member since 1989, to form his own political party, Groep Wilders, later renamed the Party for Freedom. The crunch issue with the VVD party line was about his refusal to endorse the party's position <b>that</b> <b>European</b> Union accession negotiations must be started with Turkey.|$|E
5|$|All {{populations are}} migratory, and most birds winter in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, {{with just a few}} records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East Africa. Some Asian birds may {{therefore}} cross 100° of longitude on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or C. e. meridionalis. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent tracking data has revealed <b>that</b> <b>European</b> nightjars have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial Africa where they have to cross several ecological barriers (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar stop-over sites as do other European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised <b>that</b> <b>European</b> astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E
40|$|This article {{offers a}} new {{interpretation}} {{of how and why}} Europeans developed a taste for chocolate. While previous studies have suggested <b>that</b> <b>Europeans</b> transformed chocolate materially and ideologically {{in order to make it}} fit their existing set of tastes and prejudices, it is demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>Europeans</b> learned to like chocolate on Indian terms as a result of their status as cultural minorities in colonial Mesoamerica. In addition this article uses the historical case study of chocolate's transcultural migration to revise current models of taste used in historical and anthropological literature. It rejects biologicalessentialism and culturalfunctionalism and instead shows that taste is an independent historical variable affected by social circumstances...|$|R

5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was known}} in Europe during the High Middle Ages due to the usage of guns and explosives by the Mongols and the Chinese firearms experts employed by the Mongols as mercenaries during the Mongol conquests of Europe, {{it was not until}} the Late Middle Ages <b>that</b> <b>European</b> versions of cannons were widely developed. The first cannons introduced into Europe were probably used in Iberia, during the Christian wars against Muslims in the 13th century; their use was also first documented in the Middle East around this time. English cannons first appeared in 1327, and later saw more general use during the Hundred Years' War, when primitive cannons were engaged at the Battle of Crécy in 1346. By the end of the 14th century, the use of cannons was also recorded in Russia, Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an {{administrator}} of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role {{in the relationship between}} princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory <b>that</b> <b>European</b> nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need to consider that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.|$|E
5|$|William's {{great work}} is a Latin chronicle, written between 1170 and 1184. It {{contains}} twenty-three books; the final book, which deals with the events of 1183 {{and the beginning of}} 1184, has only a prologue and one chapter, so it is either unfinished or the rest of the pages were lost before the whole chronicle began to be copied. The first book begins with the conquest of Syria by Umar in the seventh century, but otherwise the work deals {{with the advent of the}} First Crusade and the subsequent political history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It is arranged, but was not written, chronologically; the first sections to be written were probably the chapters about the invasion of Egypt in 1167, which are extremely detailed and were likely composed before the Fatimid dynasty was overthrown in 1171. Much of the Historia was finished before William left to attend the Lateran Council, but new additions and corrections were made after his return in 1180, perhaps because he now realized <b>that</b> <b>European</b> readers would also be interested in the history of the kingdom. In 1184 he wrote the Prologue and the beginning of the twenty-third book.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{economic}} historians have argued <b>that</b> <b>European</b> colonialism {{played a major}} role in the deindustrialization of non-Western societies. Paul Bairoch, for example, cites British colonialism in India as a primary example, but also argues <b>that</b> <b>European</b> colonialism {{played a major role}} in the deindustrialization of other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, and contributed to a sharp economic decline in Africa. Other modern economic historians have blamed British colonial rule for India's deindustrialization in particular. The colonization of India is seen as a major factor behind both India's deindustrialization and Britain's Industrial Revolution.|$|E
50|$|Europeanism is a {{term that}} encapsulates the norms and values <b>that</b> <b>Europeans</b> have in common, and which transcend {{national}} or state identity. In addition to helping promote {{the integration of the}} European Union, this doctrine also provides the basis for analyses <b>that</b> characterise <b>European</b> politics, economics, and society as reflecting a shared identity. Opponents to the idea stress that there are various differences among <b>European</b> groups and <b>that</b> the factors seen as characteristic of this shared culture do not necessarily follow its premise.|$|R
