5|$|According to legend, the Christian apostle and martyr Saint Andrew, {{the patron}} saint of Scotland, was crucified on an X-shaped cross. Use of the {{familiar}} iconography of his martyrdom, showing the apostle bound to an X-shaped cross, first appears in the Kingdom of Scotland in 1180 during the reign of William I. It was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century, including on one used by <b>the</b> <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> Scotland, dated 1286.|$|E

5|$|At Hawkeye's trial, Hawkeye testifies that Banner {{approached}} him months earlier {{and asked that}} he kill him should Banner ever lose control. After Hawkeye is acquitted of all charges, Iron Man informs the other heroes of his test results: Ulysses' power is based on probability calculations, not absolute truth. Unpersuaded, Captain Marvel returns to the Triskelion, headquarters of the Ultimates, to continue her investigation of a suspected Hydra agent. There, Captain Marvel, the Ultimates, Alpha Flight, and Storm's X-Men are confronted by Iron Man, the Avengers, and Magneto's X-Men.

5|$|Billions {{of years}} ago, beings called <b>the</b> <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> the Universe used the green essence of willpower {{to create an}} intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps. They divided the {{universe}} into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors on the planet, feeding on their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu {{into taking}} a {{container}} supposedly containing the Stone, {{and gives the}} real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well {{that they did not}} deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as <b>the</b> <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt Milano along with a sapling cut from Groot.|$|E
5|$|The Dravidar Kazhagam {{came to be}} {{well known}} among the urban {{communities}} and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as <b>the</b> <b>guardians</b> <b>of</b> such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the Dalits. It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.|$|E

5|$|The scandal {{began as}} an {{operation}} to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised {{to do everything in}} their power to achieve the release of the hostages. Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-Sandinista, or Contras, in Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|We earnestly {{recommend}} a longer recess from labour at noon, {{and a more}} early dismission from it in the evening, {{to all those who}} work in the cotton mills: but we deem this indulgence essential to the present health, and future capacity for labour, of those who are under the age of fourteen; for the active recreations of childhood and youth are necessary to the growth, vigour, and the right conformation of the human body. And we cannot excuse ourselves, on the present occasion, from suggesting to you, who are <b>the</b> <b>guardians</b> <b>of</b> the public weal, this further very important consideration, that the rising generation should not be debarred from all opportunities of instruction at the only season of life in which they can be properly improved.|$|E
5|$|While Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko {{considered}} {{the outcome of}} the war still open, and were planning to use the combined Polish-Lithuanian forces to defeat the still separate Russian forces, King Poniatowski, with the consent of <b>the</b> <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> the Laws (cabinet of ministers) decided to ask for a ceasefire. Tsarina Catherine demanded that the King Poniatowski joins the pro-Russian aristocratic faction, the Targowica Confederation; with his cabinet split, he gave in to her demand around 22–23 July, which effectively forced Prince Poniatowski to terminate military resistance. The last military confrontation of the war was fought on 26 July at Markuszów in Lublin province, where an enemy attack was repelled by Polish cavalry led by Poniatowski.|$|E

Gary Oldman voices as Ignitus, Corey Burton as Volteer, Jeff Bennett as Cyril, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Terrador.|$|R
5|$|According to Ibn Saad, {{opposition}} in Mecca started when Muhammad delivered verses that condemned idol worship and the polytheism {{practiced by the}} Meccan forefathers. However, the Quranic exegesis maintains that it began as Muhammad started public preaching. As his followers increased, Muhammad became {{a threat to the}} local tribes and rulers of the city, whose wealth rested upon the Ka'aba, the focal point of Meccan religious life that Muhammad threatened to overthrow. Muhammad's denunciation of the Meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe, the Quraysh, as they were <b>the</b> <b>guardians</b> <b>of</b> the Ka'aba. Powerful merchants attempted to convince Muhammad to abandon his preaching; he was offered admission to the inner circle of merchants, as well as an advantageous marriage. He refused both of these offers.|$|E
5|$|According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona {{asked the}} {{guardian}} of Matsatso, {{one of the three}} most prominent royal idols, to ask the idol which of his sons should rule after him. The guardian hesitated to declare the idol's choice, but after the king promised no ill reaction to the decision, the man declared the successor to be Andrianavalonimerina. However, the king had hoped that the successor would be another son, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. He decided to test the prophecy by sending one of his wives to the guardian's house, where the population showed her respect by offering zebu for her to eat. The zebu cooked inconsistently, and the king interpreted this as a sign that the guardian was dishonest and intended to seize power himself, so Andriamasinavalona ordered him put to death and had the idol Matsatso discarded in a lake. He then asked <b>the</b> <b>guardians</b> <b>of</b> the two other idols (Kelimalaza and Soratra) to declare a successor; {{the guardian of}} Soratra fled, while the guardian of Kelimalaza stated that only the king could choose his successor.|$|E
5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to <b>the</b> <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E

5|$|It was in {{this period}} that the {{national}} flag emerged as a common symbol. The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, {{first appeared in the}} Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century; including on one particular example used by <b>the</b> <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> Scotland, dated 1286. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century. The earliest reference to the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag {{is to be found in}} the Vienna Book of Hours, circa 1503.|$|E
5|$|John de Vieuxpont died in 1241, {{before he}} came of age. The new heir, John's son Robert, was not old enough to inherit, so the family's lands {{remained}} in wardship. During this time, the estates fell into disrepair, and this probably included Brougham Castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont {{came of age in}} around 1257 he inherited considerable debts. He was one of the northern lords that revolted in support of Simon de Montfort in the Second Barons' War (1264–1267). By June 1264, Vieuxpont was dead; as he was considered a traitor, his property was confiscated by King HenryIII. In 1266, the king pardoned Vieuxpont posthumously, and his two daughters inherited the family estates. <b>The</b> <b>guardians</b> <b>of</b> the two girls, who at the time were too young to marry, divided the Vieuxpont lands with the expectation that they would come into their possession through marriage. Isabel Vieuxpont was given in marriage to Roger Clifford, the son of her guardian, and with her the shrievalty of Westmorland and the castles of Brougham and Appleby transferred to the Cliffords.|$|E
5|$|Russian armies entered Poland and Lithuania, {{starting}} the Polish–Russian War of 1792. The Sejm voted {{to increase the}} army of the Commonwealth to 100,000men, but owing to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved and soon abandoned even as a goal. The Polish King and the reformers could field only a 37,000-man army, many of them untested recruits. This army, under the command of Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, defeated or fought to a draw the Russians on several occasions, but in the end, a defeat loomed inevitable. Despite Polish requests, Prussia refused to honor its alliance obligations. Stanisław August's attempts at negotiations with Russia proved futile. As the front lines kept shifting to the west and in July 1792 Warsaw was threatened with siege by the Russians, the King came to believe that victory was impossible against the numerically superior enemy, and that surrender was the only alternative to total defeat. Having received assurances from the Russian ambassador Yakov Bulgakov that no territorial changes will occur, <b>the</b> <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> the Laws cabinet voted 8:4 to surrender. On July 24, 1792, King Stanisław August Poniatowski joined the Targowica Confederation, as the Empress had demanded. The Polish Army disintegrated.|$|E
