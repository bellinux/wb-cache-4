25|$|Metaphysical naturalists do {{not believe}} in a soul or spirit, nor in ghosts, and when {{explaining}} what constitutes the mind they rarely appeal to substance dualism. If one's mind, or rather one's identity and existence as a person, is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as ideas, theories, emotions, moral and personal values, or aesthetic response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>all</b> humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism calls into question the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{expanding}} Siegfried's Tod {{into a series}} of two or more operas would have been particularly appealing to Wagner, as he had now come to realize that it would be impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>all</b> that he wanted to in a single opera without an inordinate number of digressions. The political events {{of the past few years}} and his recent discovery of the philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach had greatly enlarged the scope of ideas which he hoped to explore in his new opera. He also wished to incorporate various ideas that he had been mulling over in the works on Jesus, Frederick, Achilles and Wieland (all four of which had been effectively abandoned by now). These ideas ranged over the politics of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin and the philosophy of Hegel and the Young Hegelians.|$|E
500|$|Dwipayana's {{influence}} {{ensured that}} contemporary reviews, especially synopses, repeated the government's {{position on the}} G30S coup. This is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>all</b> reviews were positive. Marselli of Kompas, for instance, found that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was highly detailed, with extensive work and quality acting going to represent events accurately. He felt, however, that the film felt too long and, as viewers knew instantly who the good and bad characters were, it became [...] "nothing but a black-and-white portrait without any complex issues", which ignored the underlying problems which had sparked the G30S movement.|$|E

500|$|Clarkson favored [...] "Run Run Rudolph" [...] as her {{favorite}} classic, saying: [...] "Just because {{it got to}} be a little more rock and roll." [...] She also remarked that [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics. Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, [...] "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album. She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Brandon Blackstock, Reba McEntire's stepson, saying: [...] "Every Christmas, I was just like, 'This is going to be different, right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life?'". The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley's [...] "Blue Christmas". Its follow-up, a rendition of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside", features Ronnie Dunn. Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying: [...] "Like, it's straight-up his personality <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>all</b> of that to try and get you to stay, and have a drink." [...] "Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)" [...] was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to [...] "Every Christmas". Dedicated to Blackstock, the song accounts her holiday after meeting him. She remarked: [...] "Christmas changes, it morphs, it comes to life a little more… It’s just a happier time." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>all</b> that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to me and say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E
500|$|Richard Fogle {{responded to}} the {{critical}} attack on Keats's emphasis on rhyme and language put forth by Garrod, Gerard, and others in 1953. His argument was similar to Brooks: that the poem was thematically coherent {{and that there is}} a poet within the poem that is different from Keats the writer of the poem. As such, Keats consciously chose the shift in the themes of the poem and the contrasts within the poem represent the pain felt when comparing the real world to an ideal world found within the imagination. Fogle also responded directly to the claims made by Leavis: [...] "I find Mr. Leavis too austere, but he points out a quality which Keats plainly sought for. His profusion and prodigality is, however, modified by a principle of sobriety." [...] It is possible that Fogle's statements were a defense of Romanticism as a group that was both respectable in terms of thought and poetic ability. Wasserman, following in 1953, claimed that [...] "Of all Keats' poems, it is probably the 'Ode to a Nightingale' that has most tormented the critic [...] in any reading of the 'Ode to a Nightingale' the turmoil will not down. Forces contend wildly within the poem, not only without resolution, but without possibility of resolution; and the reader comes away from his experience with the sense that he has been in 'a wild Abyss'". He then explained, [...] "It is this turbulence, I suspect, that has led Allen Tate to believe the ode 'at least tries to say everything that poetry can say.' But I propose it is the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' that succeeds in saying what poetry can say, and that the other ode attempts <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>all</b> that the poet can." ...|$|E

2500|$|A simple-expansion {{engine is}} a steam engine that expands the steam through only one stage, which is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>all</b> its {{cylinders}} are operated {{at the same}} pressure. Since this {{was by far the}} most common type of engine in the early period of marine engine development, the term [...] "simple expansion" [...] is rarely encountered; rather, an engine is assumed to be simple-expansion unless otherwise stated.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} decades of Israel as a state, strong {{cultural}} conflict was going on between Mizrahi, Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews (mainly east European Ashkenazim). The roots of this conflict, which still exists to a much smaller extent in present-day Israeli society, stems from the many cultural differences between the various Jewish communities; this happened despite of the government's encouragement of the [...] "melting pot". That is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>all</b> Jewish immigrants in Israel were strongly encouraged to [...] "melt down" [...] their own particular exile identities within the general social [...] "pot" [...] in order to become Israeli.|$|E

Although Morente's work is now widely recognized by most critics, and has inspired many singers of the young generation like Mayte Martín or Arcángel, there is still a section of traditionalist critics and public that still disparage his work: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1915, Rogers {{began to appear in}} Florenz Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic. The variety revue began at midnight in the top-floor night club of Ziegfeld's New Amsterdam Theatre, and drew many influential—and regular—customers. By this time, Rogers had refined his act. His monologues on {{the news of the day}} {{followed}} a similar routine every night. He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit, nonchalantly twirling his lasso, and said, [...] "Well, what shall I talk about? I ain't got anything funny <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>All</b> I know is what I read in the papers." [...] He would make jokes about what he had read in that day's newspapers. The line [...] "All I know is what I read in the papers" [...] is often incorrectly described as Rogers's most famous punch line, when it was his opening line.|$|E
2500|$|Two notable {{people who}} had {{previously}} defended Cosby, and believed in his innocence, changed their minds. American actress and talk show host Whoopi Goldberg and Joseph C. Phillips (a Cosby Show regular for three years) each made public statements on July 15, 2015. Goldberg said, [...] "If {{this is to be}} tried {{in the court of public}} opinion, I got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>all</b> of the information that's out there kind of points to guilt." [...] In an interview Goldberg had a message for Cosby: [...] "It looks bad, Bill. Either speak up or shut up." [...] Goldberg had received threats for staunchly standing by Cosby. Goldberg, in the form of a question, referred to Cosby as a [...] "serial rapist" [...] and questioned why he was still on the streets. Phillips was more direct in a separate comment from Goldberg, saying [...] "Of course Bill Cosby is guilty!" ...|$|E
