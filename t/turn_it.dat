5|$|Among {{the most}} {{abundant}} sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds primarily on small bony fishes, but also takes cephalopods and crustaceans. In <b>turn,</b> <b>it</b> often falls prey to larger sharks and possibly marine mammals. In common {{with other members of}} its family, this species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection. Females give birth to one to eight young either during a defined breeding season or throughout the year, depending on location. The reproductive cycle is usually annual, but may be biennial or triennial. Large numbers of milk sharks are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries for meat, fins, and fishmeal. Despite this, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as being of Least Concern, because its wide distribution and relatively high productivity seemingly allow present levels of exploitation to be sustained.|$|E

5|$|Banks used {{a number}} of {{keyboards}} during Genesis' career, continually trying out new models, though he used the piano regularly throughout the group's lifetime. In the 1970s, he frequently used the Hammond organ, Hohner Pianet, Mellotron, RMI Electronic Piano and ARP Pro Soloist. In the 1980s, he used the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 and Prophet 10, the ARP Quadra and various Korg synthesizers. For the <b>Turn</b> <b>It</b> On Again tour in 2007, his main board was a Korg Oasys. As both a guitarist and bassist, Rutherford regularly swapped between the two roles, and his trademark instrument with Genesis, particularly through the 1970s, was a double neck guitar. In the 1980s and beyond, he favoured the Eric Clapton Stratocaster.|$|E
5|$|Between 1963 and 1965, {{archaeological sites}} and remains were located {{with the help}} of aerial photographs, and a ground survey was carried out as well to {{determine}} the periods that were present at each site.
