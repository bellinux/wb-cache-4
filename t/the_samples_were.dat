5|$|Hiller {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} heating and burning on bone mineral using X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The bone samples were heated in temperature of 500, 700, and 900 C° for 15 and 45 min. The results show bone crystals began to change during the first 15 min of heating at 500 C0 and above. At higher temperatures, thickness and shape of crystals of bones appear stabilized, but when <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> heated at lower temperature or for shorter period, XRD traces showed extreme changes in crystal parameters.|$|E
5|$|Samples of {{wood from}} the {{shipwreck}} were sent for analysis at the Forest and Forest Products {{division of the}} Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. The analysis was conducted by Jugo Ilic of CSIRO, a wood identification specialist. Many of <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> too badly deteriorated to be positively identified, as the lack of cellulose remaining in the wood cells prevented successful analysis.|$|E

30|$|To {{investigate}} the specificity and adhesion of analyte {{to the surface}} of nanoholes, biotin–streptavidin immunoassay was studied with a nanohole sample in several subsequent steps, and the LSPR spectrum was taken after each step. First, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> immersed into biotinylated thiol at the concentration of 374 μM in ethanol for 20 h at room temperature to form a self-assembled monolayer of biotin, then <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> rinsed with ethanol and DI water and nitrogen dried.

Third, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> rinsed repeatedly with ethanol, PBS and DI water and nitrogen dried. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> exposed under a UV cleaner for 30 min to break the chemical bond between the thiol and gold, then <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> rinsed with ethanol, PBS and DI water repeatedly and nitrogen dried.

5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. <b>The</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Nuremberg, Hess was {{reluctant}} {{to give up some}} of his possessions, including samples of food he said had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use these for his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised him that he would be allowed no special treatment; <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to be in good health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he was out of his cell.|$|E

The decay heat of corium at 224 minutes after scram was estimated to be 0.13W/g, falling to 0.096W/g at scram+600 minutes.

Five samples were found to include traces of Mobistix, aka acetaminophen a widely used over-the-counter analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). The sixth sample was erroneously reported in the press as having shown indications of cocaine use, but the lab reported that it was indications of caffeine usage.

25|$|The {{acceptable}} level {{as defined by}} WHO for maximum concentrations of arsenic in safe drinking water is 0.01mg/L. The Bangladesh government's standard is a fivefold greater rate, with 0.05mg/L being considered safe.

The total population in these seven districts is over 34 million while the number using arsenic-rich water is more than 1 million (above 0.05mg/L). That number increases to 1.3 million when the concentration is above 0.01mg/L. According to a British Geological Survey study in 1998 on shallow tube-wells in 61 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh, 46 percent of <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> above 0.01mg/L and 27 percent were above 0.050mg/L.
