40|$|The {{effect of}} nozzle <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> {{thickness}} on broadband acoustic radiation {{and the production}} of tones is investigated for coannular nozzles. Experiments were performed for a core nozzle <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> thickness between 0. 38 mm and 3. 17 mm. The on-set of discrete tones was found to be predominantly affected by the velocity ratio, the ratio of the fan velocity to the core velocity, although some dependency on <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> thickness was also noted. For a core nozzle <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> thickness {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 89 mm, tones were produced for velocity ratios between 0. 91 and 1. 61. For a constant nozzle <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> thickness, the frequency varied almost linearly with the core velocity. The Strouhal number based on the core velocity changed with nozzle <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> thickness and varied between 0. 16 and 0. 2 for the core nozzles used in the experiments. Increases in broadband noise with increasing <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> thickness were observed for tone producing and non-tone producing conditions. A variable thickness <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> (crenellated) nozzle resulted in no tonal production and a reduction of the broadband <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> noise relative to that of the corresponding constant thickness <b>trailing</b> <b>edge.</b> I...|$|R
50|$|If an airfoil {{with a sharp}} <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> {{begins to}} move with a {{positive}} angle of attack through air, the two stagnation points are initially located on the underside near the leading edge and on the topside near the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge,</b> just as with the cylinder. As the air passing {{the underside of the}} airfoil reaches the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> it must flow around the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> and along the topside of the airfoil toward the stagnation point on the topside of the airfoil. Vortex flow occurs at the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> and, because the radius of the sharp <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> is zero, the speed of the air around the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> should be infinitely fast. Though real fluids cannot move at infinite speed, they can move extremely fast. The high airspeed around the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> causes strong viscous forces to act on the air adjacent to the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> of the airfoil and the result is that a strong vortex accumulates on the topside of the airfoil, near the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge.</b> As the airfoil begins to move it carries this vortex, known as the starting vortex, along with it. Pioneering aerodynamicists were able to photograph starting vortices in liquids to confirm their existence.|$|R
40|$|Inlet {{guide vanes}} (IGV) of high {{temperature}} gas turbines require an effective trailling edge cooling. But this cooling influences significantly the aerodynamic performance {{caused by the}} unavoidable thickening of <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> and the interference of the cooling flow with the main flow. Generally the blade <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> losses belong to the most importantpenalties for the overall turbine stage efficiency. They are functionof the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> thickness and the base pressure and may amount to 30 % of the losses for cascades operating at transonic outlet Mach numbers. It is also known that the ejection of coolant flow from the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> affects considerably the base pressure and thereby the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> losses. Most investigations refer to coolant flow ejection through the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> but the actual tendency seems to favour the ejection of the coolant from the pressure side {{just ahead of the}} <b>trailing</b> <b>edge.</b> The obvious advantage is the reduction of the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> thickness.

5|$|In many respects, the YF-22s were {{different}} from production F-22s. Contrary to the F-117 Nighthawk, which was initially difficult to control because of small vertical stabilizers, Lockheed over-specified the fin area on its YF-22. Therefore, the company reduced the size of those on F-22s by 20–30 percent. Lockheed recontoured {{the shape of the}} wing and stabilator <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics; the wing and stabilitor sweep was reduced by 6° from 48°. Finally, to improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7inches (178mm), and the engine intakes were moved rearward 14inches (356mm).|$|E
5|$|Some of the ECM {{equipment}} which initially saw {{use on the}} Victor, such as {{the original}} chaff dispenser and Orange Putter tail warning radar, had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and were already considered to be near-obsolete {{by the time the}} Victor had entered service. Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites, as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor's role; for example, the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar. The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems, including a passive radar warning receiver, a metric radar jammer and communications jamming equipment. Streamlined fairings on the <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff/flares were also new additions. While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar, neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet.|$|E
5|$|The adult plumage {{of most of}} the {{albatrosses}} {{is usually}} some variation of dark upper-wing and back with white undersides, often compared to that of a gull. The extent of colouration varies: the southern royal albatross is almost completely white except for the ends and <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of the wings in fully mature males, while the Amsterdam albatross has an almost juvenile-like breeding plumage {{with a great deal of}} brown, particularly a strong brown band around the chest. Several species of mollymawks and North Pacific albatrosses have face markings like eye patches or have grey or yellow on the head and nape. Three albatross species, the black-footed albatross and the two sooty albatrosses, vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown (or dark grey in places in the case of the light-mantled albatross). Albatrosses take several years to get their full adult breeding plumage.|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{investigate}} a route to {{reduction of the}} turbulent boundary layer–trailing edge interaction noise. The <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> noise is generated by surface pressure fluctuations beneath a turbulent boundary and scattered at the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> of wind turbine blades. <b>Trailing</b> <b>edge</b> noise {{is considered to be}} the dominant noise source of modern wind turbines. Therefore, efforts are constantly made to attenuate the noise. Today, noise emission can be reduced by proper airfoil design or passive devices, such as <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> serrations. A further improved candidate technology for <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> noise attenuation is active flow control in the form of wall-normal suction. With active flow control, the boundary layer features responsible for <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> noise generation can be manipulated, and correspondingly the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> noise can be reduced. Detailed experimental investigations were performed at the Universities of Tel-Aviv and Stuttgart. The tests showed that steady wall-normal suction has a positive effect on the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> noise by reducing the boundary layer thickness, and with it the integral length scales of the eddies within the boundary layer...|$|R

Simultaneous measurements of the flow and far-field noise have been taken for three flat plate models with new <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> geometries in an anechoic wind tunnel at the University of Adelaide. The far-field acoustic data are scaled according to existing theory and compared with predictions of <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> noise obtained using current semi-empirical methods.

5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E

Adhering to the 'Schüle München' the fuselage is a welded steel-tube space-frame with fabric covering and wooden tail surfaces, also covered in plywood and fabric. Despite failing in the Olympic selection the Mü17 Merle was put into production with around 60 units built before and after World War II, many with variations such as retractable landing gear.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to demonstrate a four blade rotor trim in forward flight using integrated <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flaps instead of using a swashplate controls. A compact brushless DC motor was evaluated as an on-blade actuator, with the possibility of achieving large <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flap amplitudes. A control strategy to actuate the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flap at desired frequency and amplitude was developed and large <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flap amplitudes from the motor (instead of rotational motion) were obtained. Once the actuator was tested on the bench-top, a lightweight mechanism was designed to incorporate the motor in the blade and actuate the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flaps. A six feet diameter, four bladed composite rotor with motor-flap system integrated into the NACA 0012 airfoil section was fabricated. Systematic testing was carried out for a range of load conditions, first in the vacuum chamber followed by hover tests. Large <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flap deflections were observed during the hover testing, and a peak to peak <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flap amplitude of 18 degree was achieved at 2000 rotor RPM with hover tip Mach number of 0. 628. A closed loop controller was designed to demonstrate <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flap mean position and the peak to peak amplitude control. Further, a soft pitch link was designed and fabricated, to replace the stiff pitch link and thereby reduce the torsional stiffness of the blade to 2 /rev. This soft pitch link allowed for blade root pitch motion in response to the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flap inputs. Blade pitch response due to both steady as well as sinusoidal flap deflections were demonstrated. Finally, tests were performed in Glenn L. Martin wind tunnel using a model rotor rig to assess the performance of motor-flap system in forward flight. A swashplateless trim using brushless DC motor actuated <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flaps was achieved for a rotor operating at 1200 RPM and an advance ratio of 0. 28. Also, preliminary exploration was carried out to test the scalability of the motor driven <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flap concept. In conclusion, the concept of using brushless DC motors as on-blade actuators, actuating <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flaps has the potential to replace the current mechanically complex swashplate with a hydraulic-free swashplateless system and thereby reduce overall weight and hub drag...|$|R
