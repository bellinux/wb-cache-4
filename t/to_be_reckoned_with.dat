The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however.

In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E

5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> <b>with,</b> as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published.

5|$|There {{were few}} {{airborne}} {{resources available to}} the British Army by mid-1941. The only unit trained and available for an airborne operation was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, {{there were very few}} transport aircraft available to transport an airborne force, there were few RAF flight crews with experience of parachute droppings and none with operational experience, and there were no specialized overseas facilities to cater exclusively for airborne operations. However, it had been decided that some form of airborne operation would have to be carried out. The reasons for mounting an operation with such meagre resources were two-fold; firstly a successful raid would demonstrate {{to the rest of the}} world that Britain was still a force <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> <b>with</b> and had not been defeated, and secondly a raid would test the fighting ability of the battalion and its equipment, as well as the RAF's ability to deliver paratroopers at a predetermined location at a required time. The target chosen for the operation was an aqueduct that crossed the Tragino river in the Campania province of southern Italy near the town of Calitri. The aqueduct carried the main water supply for the province of Apulia, which at the time was inhabited by approximately two million Italians and included the strategically important port of Taranto; it was hoped that destroying the aqueduct and depriving the population of their regular water supply would damage their morale, and also have some impact on the Italian war efforts in North Africa and Albania. The aqueduct was a significant distance from the Italian coast, making it unlikely that a sea-borne raiding party could reach it, and it was believed that it was too strongly constructed to be destroyed by aerial bombing; as such, an airborne raid conducted by parachute troops was thought to be the ideal way to eliminate the aqueduct.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{strategy}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> create {{a good fit}} between {{the characteristics of the}} organisation for which the strategy is designed and the business environment. The strategist needs to consider both parts of the equation. This task needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried out in a situation which is uncertain and ambiguious. The higher the uncertainty and the more dynamic the situation, the more problematic is the idea of 'the best strategy'. What seems best today may be far from ideal tomorrow. The key to success becomes the ongoing process of strategic evaluation and action. The uncertain business environment can be studied by means of the scenario technique. Uncertainty means that there are multiple equally plausible futures <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reckon</b> <b>with.</b> This <b>is</b> captured in a number of scenarios. Vygotsky's theory of proximal development helps to understand the critical parameters for a successful scenario project. Scenarios have been popular for a long time. However, in most cases the analysis stops at the boundary of the organisation, and it <b>is</b> left <b>to</b> the manager to use his/her intuition to develop conclusions relating to their meaning for the organisation. In this paper a methodology is presented which allows the manager <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more explicit about the specific strategic characteristics of the organisation itself. It is suggested that for every surviving organisation a 'business idea' can be formulated which explains its ongoing success. It is suggested that a 'business idea' needs to clarify three drivers for success: * how 'rent' is created * how 'rent' is appropriated by the organisation by deploying 'distinctive competencies' * how rent and 'distinctive competencies' <b>are</b> employed <b>to</b> create growth. By bringing together the 'business idea' and scenarios the success formula of the organisation can be tested in various plausible futures. In this way its power and its robustness can be evaluated. In a changing processual world the purpose <b>is</b> not <b>to</b> come to a final yes/no decision on strategy, but to keep working on the proposed 'business idea' by using the scenario testbed, trying to improve its effectiveness. While strategic actions are taken the 'business idea' and the scenarios evolve, keeping the strategic question on the agenda. The process is compared with an ongoing learning loop, which stays with the organisation during its entire lifetime.

For Agamben, the homo sacer, as the ‘sacred man’, is that figure of the ancient Roman world which has the most relevance for understanding our contemporary state of biopolitics. This figure is the opposite image of the sacred-sovereign power which claims political authority and legitimacy precisely through its exclusion of the homo sacer, thus constituting the realm of the political as a whole. Agamben’s work, for its part, foresees how a re-envisioning of the figure of the homo sacer can actually lead to the end of political and cultural representations in general, a sign of the ‘coming community’ as he terms it. In this sense, his work contains the seeds for portraying the marginalized figures of society as those persons who must not become central to communal self-identity, but rather as those who should maintain a privileged position as that figure most capable of ending the violence of political representations as a whole. In this paper, I hope to demonstrate how Agamben’s formulations of sacrifice and the homo sacer maintain an interesting, and often critical, alignment with Girard’s work, yet with an increased focus being placed upon the political implications. It is perhaps also, and here lodging a possible critique of Agamben, to contrast the role of sacrifice in the realm of the political with that of sacrifice in the religious, something which Girard’s nuanced stance taken in relation to sacrifice throughout his career might help further elaborate. status: publishe...|$|R
