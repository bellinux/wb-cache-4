5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the screen, with the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game should be able <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> in either direction.|$|E
5|$|Initially most of {{the main}} map and minimap are blacked out, but the visible area expands as the player's units explore the map. The mini-map shows {{a summary of the}} whole territory, with green dots for the player's {{buildings}} and units and red dots for enemy ones. The player can click in the main map or the minimap <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> the main map around the territory.|$|E
5|$|Shadowrun is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game (RPG) that combines the statistical factor {{of the original}} tabletop game (with minor changes) with real-time gameplay. The player is given direct control over the protagonist Jake and moves him around using the directional pad within the game's isometrically displayed world. A cursor system allows the player <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> a pointer across the screen and perform various actions that include opening doors and passageways, examining and picking up objects, engaging in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), and utilizing firearms and magic commands while in combat.|$|E

5|$|Defender {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} titles of the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis' best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Though not the first game <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> horizontally, it created the genre of purely horizontal scrolling shooters. It inspired the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations.|$|E
5|$|For Vorticons, Carmack {{had created}} {{adaptive}} tile refresh {{to produce a}} scrolling effect on computers not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For Keen Dreams, he wanted <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be.|$|E
5|$|Gibson's {{work has}} {{influenced}} several popular musicians: references to his fiction {{appear in the}} music of Stuart Hamm, Billy Idol, Warren Zevon, Deltron 3030, Straylight Run (whose name is derived from a sequence in Neuromancer) and Sonic Youth. U2's Zooropa album was heavily influenced by Neuromancer, and the band at one point planned <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> the text of Neuromancer above them on a concert tour, although this did not end up happening. Members of the band did, however, provide background music for the audiobook version of Neuromancer as well as appearing in No Maps for These Territories, a biographical documentary of Gibson. He returned the favour by writing {{an article about the}} band's Vertigo Tour for Wired in August 2005. The band Zeromancer take their name from Neuromancer.|$|E

5|$|As the {{gameplay}} {{designs were}} being implemented, Brown switched {{focus to the}} game's aesthetics. Scenes from the game were sketched on storyboards to aid development. Cauldron IIs game world, the witch's castle, was designed to resemble Palace Software's logo as an advertising tactic. Brown photographed separate screens {{of the game and}} assembled them into a complete map, showing the shape of his company's logo, for video game magazines. Enemy designs were similar to those in the previous game, based on the Halloween holiday. Brown envisioned a graphical effect for the game's narration, showing a book whose pages turned as the story is read. However, technical limitations at the time prohibited the implementation of such a visual effect. Brown also wanted the game's visuals <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> seamlessly as the character moved through the game world, but flick-screening (showing one section of the world at a time) was more feasible. As with the previous game, Brown created a Plasticine model of the witch character as a reference for a painting that was used for the game's box art. The group tested the game prior to release and deemed it too challenging. They reduced the difficulty level so that more players could complete the game.|$|E

Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and while considering ways to remove Keen's parents during the introduction for Galaxy, came up with a stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies, which appeared in all three episodes made in 1991. Additionally, music, which was missing in prior Keen games, was added to Aliens, composed by Bobby Prince.|$|E

25|$|On {{the stock}} Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), {{as well as}} on most 8-bit arcade hardware, {{platform}} games generally only scroll in one direction at a time, usually horizontally. This means designers must use a very narrow level progression, or break levels up into subareas that scrolled either horizontally or vertically, {{as was the case in}} Metroid and Mega Man — or effectively upgrade the system using memory management controller chips, embedded into each relevant cartridge. One of the first platform games <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> in all four directions freely and follow the on-screen character's movement is in a vector game called Major Havoc, which comprises a number of mini-games, including a simple platformer, a shoot 'em up sequence, a landing sequence, and a Breakout clone. One of the first raster-based platform games <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> fluidly in all directions in this manner is the previously mentioned 1984 classic, Legend of Kage.|$|E

The only playable character in the game is Luigi, with the same performance attributes {{he has in the}} 1986 Japan release of Super Mario Bros. 2. If the two-player mode is played then both players play as Luigi. The game is based on a mission in NES Remix, featuring Luigi in a mirrored version of World 1-2.|$|E
25|$|The Mighty Mouse is made {{of white}} plastic and has a {{recessed}} Apple logo on the mouse's face. The mouse has four functional controls: a left capacitive sensor, a right capacitive sensor, a track ball with a pressure sensor and side squeeze sensors. The track ball enables users <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> a page or document in any direction, including diagonally. Instead of mechanical buttons, the touch-sensitive topshell (mentioned below) and the pressure sensing trackball allow the mouse to detect which side is being touched or whether the trackball is being held in.|$|E

40|$|Speed {{dependent}} automatic zooming (SDAZ) is {{a promising}} refinement <b>to</b> <b>scrolling</b> in which documents are automatically zoomed-out as the scroll rate increases. By automatically zooming, the visual flow rate is reduced enabling rapid scrolling without motion blur. In order to aid SDAZ calibration we theoretically and empirically scrutinise human factors of the speed/zoom relationship. We then compare user performance with four alternative text-document scrolling systems, {{two of which}} employ automatic zooming. One of these systems, which we term ‘DDAZ’, is based on van Wijk and Nuij’s recent and important theory that calculates optimal pan/zoom paths between known locations in 2 D space. van Wijk and Nuij suggested that their theory could be applied <b>to</b> <b>scrolling,</b> but did not implement or test their formulaic suggestions. Participants in our evaluation (n= 27) completed scrolling tasks most rapidly when using SDAZ, followed by DDAZ, normal scrollbars, and traditional rate-based scrolling. Workload assessments and preferences strongly favoured SDAZ. We finish by examining issues for consideration in commercial deployments...|$|R

WeatherStar units also allow cable providers <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> text messages when in use, including the capability to broadcast severe weather advisories and warnings in effect for the jurisdiction in which the WeatherStar system's cable headend is located and its immediate surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, Liberty University {{opened the}} new Jerry Falwell Library. The four-story, 170,000-square-foot {{building}} is located behind the Vines Center. The library features a robot-assisted storage and retrieval system for over 250,000 archived items, with room for another 170,000. The robot locates requested items within a large storage room and delivers the items {{to the front}} desk. There are also 150 public computers throughout the building for electronic archive research. The library features group study rooms, writable walls, balconies, terraces and a vegetative roof. The entrance to the library is highlighted by a 24ft media wall powered by three Microsoft Kinect units and integrated using a custom program. The media wall uses motion-sensor technology to enable visitors <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> through university news, browse pictures contributed from students and learn about upcoming university events.

500|$|Day of the Tentacle {{follows the}} point-and-click {{two-dimensional}} adventure game formula, first {{established by the}} original Maniac Mansion. Players direct the controllable characters around the game world by clicking with the computer mouse. To interact with the game world, players choose from a set of nine commands arrayed on the screen (such as [...] "pick up", [...] "use", or [...] "talk to") and then on an object in the world. This was the last SCUMM game to use the original interface of having {{the bottom of the}} screen being taken up by a verb selection and inventory; starting with the next game to use the SCUMM engine, Sam & Max Hit the Road, the engine was modified <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> through a more concise list of verbs with the right mouse button and having the inventory on a separate screen.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} graphics {{were created}} {{with a special}} graphics machine ("Character Generator Computer Aided Design") that generated a collection of all the graphical shapes used in the game. Shapes in the collection were assigned numbers that the game's code uses to access, and are combined to form complete images on the screen in real time. The Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge uses Nintendo's custom MMC3 (memory management controller) ASIC to enhance the NES capabilities. [...] The MMC3 chip allows for animated tiles, extra RAM for diagonal scrolling, and a scan line timer to split the screen. The game uses these functions to split the game screen into two portions, a playfield {{on the top and}} a status bar on the bottom, allowing the top portion <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> as the character navigates the stage while the bottom portion remains static to display text and other information.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert started {{programming}} Maniac Mansion in 6502 assembly language, but {{he quickly}} decided that the project was too large and complex for this method. He decided that a new game engine {{would have to be}} created. Its coding language was initially planned to be LISP-inspired, but Gilbert opted for one similar to C. Lucasfilm employee Chip Morningstar contributed the base code for the engine, which Gilbert then built on. Gilbert hoped to create a [...] "system that could be used on many adventure games, cutting down the time it took to make them". Maniac Mansions first six-to-nine months of production were dedicated largely to engine development. The game was developed around the Commodore 64 home computer, an 8-bit system with only 64 KB of memory. The team wanted to include scrolling screens, but as it was normally impossible <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> bitmap graphics on the Commodore 64, they had to utilize lower-detail tile graphics. Winnick gave each character a large head made of three stacked sprites to make them recognizable.|$|E

[...] IGN described the game as one that may be [...] "amazingly frustrating for the now mainstream Final Fantasy fan," [...] and noted {{that while the}} unique concept of the job system was one that [...] "simply blew gamers' minds" [...] at the time, in the contemporary environment, comparing it to Final Fantasy XIIs license board system was [...] "literally no contest." [...] The review additionally argued that the remake hampered the game, citing that battles that would take [...] "mere seconds <b>to</b> <b>scroll</b> through" [...] were now [...] "lengthened to nearly a minute." [...] Another complaint was in the game's presentation on the Nintendo DS, noting that the handheld's top screen was inactive for [...] "75% of the game," [...] and that even displaying only artwork on the screen during those periods would have been a preferable outcome. However IGN described the game as [...] "graphically phenomenal and...set to a simply beautiful musical score."
