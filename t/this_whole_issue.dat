40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Oxford, 1992 This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} primarily with determining {{the nature and}} degree of influence that Katherine Parr and the women of her household exercised over politics and religion {{in the last years}} of Henry VIII's reign. Katherine Parr's household, which was loosely modeled on that of the king's, was staffed with women who had marital and other family ties to men in the king's household and government. These important family relationships are examined in chapter one, parts I and II. The considerable material benefits which came to Katherine Parr and the members of her family after her marriage to the king are explored in chapter two. Katherine Parr and her women actively promoted the interests of their family, friends, and dependents, and cultivated the good will of potentially influential members of court. Yet despite the ambitions of the queen's women, and despite the king's confidence in Katherine Parr, as evidenced in his appointment of her as regent, neither the queen nor her women exercised much political influence. A full examination of <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>issue</b> forms chapter three. Katherine Parr and her women may have been excluded from direct political power, but their religious activities nevertheless made them political figures. These religious activities are discussed in chapter four, part I. Part II concerns the patronage, and in two instances, authorship, of religious literature by the queen and her circle. Chapter five looks at Anne Askew and the two plots against Katherine Parr and a select number of her women in 1546. The conclusion emphasizes the point that Katherine Parr is an important historical figure not simply because she was Henry VIII's last wife, but because her experiences better highlight the circumstances of aristocratic women at the Tudor court...|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} rightly {{regarded as}} a silent-epidemic is continually on the rise and estimated to have a global prevalence of 6. 4 % as of 2010. Diabetes during pregnancy is a well known risk factor for congenital anomalies in various organ systems that contribute to neonatal mortality, including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and neurological systems, among which the neural tube defects are frequently reported. Over the last two to three decades, several groups {{around the world have}} focussed on identifying the molecular cues and cellular changes resulting in altered gene expression and the morphological defects and in diabetic pregnancy. In recent years, the focus has gradually shifted to looking at pre-programmed changes and activation of epigenetic mechanisms that cause altered gene expression. While several theories such as oxidative stress, hypoxia, and apoptosis triggered due to hyperglycemic conditions have been proposed and proven for being the cause for these defects, the exact mechanism or the link between how high glucose can alter gene expression/transcriptome and activate epigenetic mechanisms is largely unknown. Although preconceptual control of diabetes, (i. e., managing glucose levels during pregnancy), and in utero therapies has been proposed as an effective solution for managing diabetes during pregnancy, the impact that a fluctuating glycemic index can have on foetal development has not been evaluated in detail. A tight glycemic control started before pregnancy has shown to reduce the incidence of congenital abnormalities in diabetic mothers. On the other hand, a tight glycemic control after organogenesis and embryogenesis have begun may prove insufficient to prevent or reverse the onset of congenital defects. The importance of determining the extent to which glycemic levels in diabetic mothers should be regulated is critical as foetal hypoglycemia has also been shown to be teratogenic. Finally, the major question remaining is if <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>issue</b> is negligible and not worthy of investigation as the efficient management of diabetes during pregnancy is well in place in many countries...|$|E

40|$|Being {{heard on}} the world stage Cue: If {{international}} trade is like a boxing match, the World Trade Organisation, or WTO, would have to be the referee - keeping the fight clean and ensuring the rules are followed. And while many developing countries may often feel like a tiny David facing the developed world?s Goliath, WTO trade talks do give them the opportunity to make and influence trade agreements. Government delegations from around the world come to the WTO to fight their corner, {{and in the case of}} African countries, they are able to fight as a team, called the ?African Group?. Making sure that the voices of ordinary farmers are heard at such negotiations is a job that has been taken up by a number of NGOs. One of them is Action Aid, an organisation that offers both practical support to farmers, as well as lobbying for their interests. Mweni Kiio is the Food Rights Campaign co-ordinator at Action Aid Kenya. In our next report she tells Eric Kadenge about the kind of support her organisation is giving to Kenya?s farmers, and her passionate belief that farmers need to make their voices heard. IN:		?We have a two-pronged approach ? OUT:		?both nationally and internationally. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 18 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mweni Kiio of Action Aid Kenya, on the need for farmers? voices to be heard by policy makers. Transcript Kiio	We have a two-pronged approach. Our regional offices, that are working with farmers to provide for them some of the services that the government used to provide, like better seeds, or even working with the government to provide extension services. And also providing some kind of credit, in that we support their farmer groups so that they can be able to assist the farmer, to keep him in business. Then we also have the second bit which is the policy aspect, where we lobby for better policies. Like we have been challenging some of these policies under the WTO. That is, there is a certain agreement called ?Agreement on Agriculture? which we believe, if Kenya is to adopt everything that is in that agreement as it stands, then our farmers stand to lose more than to gain. So we are making some proposals within that agreement, that we hope will benefit the farmers by the end of the day. Because within that agreement there is a certain provision which says that a country should withdraw subsidies or domestic support to its farmers. Kenya has done that, but that is not the same case with developed countries, because developed countries are still carrying on with increasing their domestic support to their farmers. The most recent case is the US government, which just increased its support to its farmers. And by the end of the day, you find that farmers from developed countries are able to produce more cheaply than farmers from developing countries, and then they are able now to sell their products in the international markets, and products from developing countries cannot compete. Kadenge	And at the moment what progress have you been able to make in this lobbying? Kiio	We have been working very closely with the Ministry of Trade, where we have shared our concerns. And the government delegation that actually represents Kenya in the negotiations in this ?Agreement on Agriculture?, they have taken in our views, and it?s part of their position, the Kenyan government position to the negotiations. And the beauty of it is that Kenya is not negotiating alone; it?s part of what they call the ?African group?. So in the negotiations under WTO, whatever concerns we have raised have been tabled through that group. And the greatest achievement, I think, is a proposal on what we call the ?development box?. Under the ?Agreement on Agriculture?, there are various boxes that are given, where governments are allowed to support their farmers. And what we did is look at all those boxes, and saw that there are some issues that are just relevant to developing countries, that have not been addressed in their available boxes; there are three of them. Now we are proposing a ?development box?, where we are saying, developing countries need to be allowed to support rural development initiatives and food security issues in their countries, because those are the kind of things that we are facing. And these are not issues that are of concern really to the developed countries, but we think they are of major concern to us. Kadenge	Now where would you like to see the small-scale farmer in future, as we try to battle <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>issue</b> that is affecting them? Kiio	I would like to see the farmer in the forefront, advocating for his issues. I would like to see a farmer who is engaging the government actively, both at the local level, national level and international level, and instead of I speaking for the farmers, like it has been in the past, I would like to see the farmer doing it for himself, and being engaged in every decision-making process that affects him, by the end of the day. I would also like to see a strong farmer movement in this country, because I strongly believe by the end of the day that even now we are not listening to our farmers; they contribute very much to the economy - you know that agriculture is the backbone of this country - and it is only right to involve such important people in decision-making, because they are the only ones who really know the problems they are facing. And they are the only ones who can come up with the right solutions to solve their own problems. And decisions should not be made for them, both nationally and internationally. End of track.

At this time two key issues are dominant in many people’s minds. These are the care of the environment and energy. It is against this background that we have commissioned this special issue of J. Catal. on “Photocatalysis and Photoelectrocatalysis”. We have put together an issue that provides insights into how photocatalysed processes can address environmental protection issues as well as renewable energy. In addition, several of the papers focus on fundamental understanding of photocatalysis that we consider will aid new developments in this important topic. Taken as a <b>whole</b> <b>this</b> special <b>issue</b> gives the reader a real representation of the current state of this emerging field of catalysis...|$|R
