25|$|The 1928 {{campaign}} {{was the first}} of Thomas's six consecutive campaigns as the presidential nominee of the Socialist Party. As an articulate and engaging spokesman for democratic socialism, Thomas had considerably greater influence than the typical perennial candidate. Although most upper and middle class Americans viewed socialism as an unsavory form of political thought, the well-educated Thomas—who often wore three-piece suits and looked and <b>talked</b> <b>like</b> a president—gained grudging admiration.|$|E
25|$|Borrell II of Barcelona {{was facing}} major defeat from the Andalusian powers so {{he sent a}} {{delegation}} to Córdoba to request a truce. Bishop Atto {{was part of the}} delegation that met with Al-Hakam II of Cordoba, who received him with honor. Gerbert was fascinated by the stories of the Mozarab Christian Bishops and judges who dressed and <b>talked</b> <b>like</b> the Arabs, well-versed in mathematics and natural sciences like the great teachers of the Islamic madrasahs. This sparked Gerbert's veneration for the Arabs and his passion for mathematics and astronomy.|$|E
500|$|... "Lola" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Ray Davies and {{performed}} by English rock band the Kinks on their album Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One. The song details a romantic encounter between {{a young man and}} a [...] possible [...] transvestite, whom he meets in a club in Soho, London. In the song, the narrator describes his confusion towards a person named Lola who [...] "walked like a woman but <b>talked</b> <b>like</b> a man". Although Ray Davies claims that the incident was inspired by a true encounter experienced by the band's manager, alternate explanations for the song have been given by drummer Mick Avory.|$|E

500|$|For me, I {{was a new}} {{actor to}} Los Angeles, didn’t know the TV {{business}} very well so I was just excited to work and play a vampire. I had no clue what I {{was going to do}} or how I was going to be scary. Until that is, they put the vampire makeup on me and I went into the trailer and smiled, which I thought was creepy. Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and <b>talked</b> <b>like</b> me was like the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|E
500|$|A. O. Scott {{identifies}} the script's precise {{use of force}} and adept use of language, including a memorable line created by Fletcher for the adaptation: a [...] "risky, remarkable film adaptation, written by Geoffrey Fletcher, the facts of Precious's life are also laid out with unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail). But just as Push achieves an eloquence that makes it {{far more than a}} fictional diary of extreme dysfunction, so too does Precious avoid the traps of well-meaning, preachy lower-depths realism. It howls and stammers, but it also sings...Inarticulate and emotionally shut down, her massive body at once a prison and a hiding place, Precious is also perceptive and shrewd, possessed of talents visible only to those who bother to look. At its plainest and most persuasive, her story is that of a writer discovering a voice. 'These people <b>talked</b> <b>like</b> TV stations I didn't even watch,' she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence even as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{interview}} Sachs {{also had}} a funny anecdote about the casting of Arye Gross who played gang member Turbo in the movie: [...] "He came in and read for me, and he was <b>talking</b> <b>like</b> Marlon Brando, through his nose. It was fantastic, so I gave him the part. And when we did the scene, he didn’t <b>talk</b> <b>like</b> that.

2500|$|Stalin, {{the second}} major contender, and future leader of the Soviet Union, was the least known, {{and he was not}} a popular figure with the masses. Even though he was a Georgian, and he opposed Georgian nationalism, he <b>talked</b> <b>like</b> a Slavophile, which was an advantage. The Communist Party was his {{institutional}} base; he was the General Secretary – another advantage. But there was a problem; Stalin was known for his brutality. As one Party faithful put it, [...] "A savage man... a bloody man. You have to have swords like him in a revolution but I don't like that fact, nor like him."
