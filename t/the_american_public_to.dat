5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>to</b> real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|According to William Cohn, {{television}} programs are typically {{the main source}} used by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>to</b> know about and interpret the past. The Soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history. Khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the story. Cuba was no longer portrayed as a heroic David against the American Goliath. One contradiction that pervaded the Soviet media campaign was between the pacifistic rhetoric of the peace movement that emphasizes the horrors of nuclear war and the militancy {{of the need to}} prepare Soviets for war against American aggression.|$|E
25|$|The high {{production}} and consumption of beef cattle in the United States made the meat industry increasingly powerful {{by the end of}} the 19th century. Corruption problems soon arose in the meat industry, problems that endangered both quality and hygiene. At the beginning of the 20th century, Upton Sinclair published The Jungle, a novel about conspiracies and corruption in the American meat industry, intended as a veiled criticism of the industry itself. The book raised popular awareness about the safety of meat processing and helped lead to the creation of the Pure Food and Drug Act, which was sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration. The Jungle was a milestone in the subsequent history of the hamburger, as it led <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>to</b> force restaurant chains to prove the safety of their cooked meat. In 1933, Arthur Kallett published a similar book, entitled 100 million guinea pigs; Dangers in Everyday foods, drugs, and cosmetics, which warned consumers specifically about the content preservatives in hamburgers.|$|E

500|$|Within {{weeks of}} the Chinese attack, MacArthur was forced to retreat from North Korea. Seoul fell in January 1951, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to {{contemplate}} the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely. European countries did not share MacArthur's world view, distrusted his judgment, and were afraid that he might use his stature and influence with <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>to</b> re-focus American policy away from Europe and towards Asia. They were concerned that this {{might lead to a}} major war with China, possibly involving nuclear weapons. Since in February 1950 the Soviet Union and China had signed a defensive alliance committing each to go to war if the other party was attacked, the possibility that an American attack on China would cause World War III was considered to be very real at the time. [...] In a visit to the United States in December 1950, the British prime minister, Clement Attlee, had raised the fears of the British and other European governments that [...] "General MacArthur was running the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Critically, {{the book}} was well-received, albeit controversial. Erika Milvy from Salon praised it as [...] "beautifully written, startling and heart wrenching". Tony Sims from Wired Magazine wrote that the book [...] "reveals the beauty and agony of a tormented nation as it {{tells the story of}} an {{improbable}} friendship between two boys from opposite ends of society, and of the troubled but enduring relationship between a father and a son". Amelia Hill of The Guardian opinionated, [...] "The Kite Runner is the shattering first novel by Khaled Hosseini" [...] that [...] "is simultaneously devastating and inspiring." [...] A similarly favorable review was printed in Publishers Weekly. Marketing director Melissa Mytinger remarked, [...] "It's simply an excellent story. Much of it based in a world we don't know, a world we're barely beginning to know. Well-written, published at the 'right time' by an author who is both charming and thoughtful in his personal appearances for the book." [...] Indian-American actor Aasif Mandvi agreed that {{the book was}} [...] "amazing storytelling.... It's about human beings. It's about redemption, and redemption is a powerful theme." [...] First Lady Laura Bush commended the story as [...] "really great". Said Tayeb Jawad, the 19th Afghan ambassador to the United States, publicly endorsed The Kite Runner, saying that the book would help <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>to</b> better understand Afghan society and culture.|$|E

2500|$|Printing of the 100-page thick Soviet Military Power was {{traditionally}} {{handled by}} the Government Printing Office — the 1981's run numbered 36,000 copies, printed {{at a cost of}} $40,000.

At the time of initial publication, Soviet Military Power constituted the largest release of declassified data in Pentagon history. According to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, Soviet Military Power did not constitute any form of propaganda aimed at supporting the increasing defense budgets of the Reagan Administration but was designed instead to alert <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>to</b> a growing imbalance between the military capabilities of the United States and the Soviet Union.

Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus....

King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question.

2500|$|Without {{waiting for}} the end of World War II, the Irgun {{declared}} an open revolt against British rule in Palestine. To assist in recruiting and propaganda efforts, Kook established the Hebrew Committee for National Liberation and the American League for a Free Palestine, both of which were involved in lobbying U.S. and other diplomats and in trying to attract <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>to</b> support the Irgun's rebellion. Kook remained strongly affiliated with the Revisionist camp after the war during the creation of the state of Israel. While he was unquestionably loyal to the cause, his position as the Irgun's leading American activist was not free from conflict. In 1946 Kook received a letter from Menachem Begin, who had become chief of the Irgun in 1943. Begin admonished Kook for various policy positions that strayed from the official Irgun party-line. These included Kook focusing on the transportation of illegal immigrants to Palestine instead of a [...] "primary" [...] assignment - arms shipments to Irgun fighters, as well as a (rather common) usage of the term [...] "Palestine". At the time Kook was in the habit of saying [...] "Palestine Free State", which Begin thought left too much potential for bi-nationalism. Begin demanded that instead that Kook in public refer to the future Jewish state as the [...] "Free State of Eretz Israel". Begin criticized Kook for keeping too high a profile, angrily reminding him that the Irgun was an underground organization; {{he was supposed to be}} using his resources to help the revolt in Palestine, not organizing parades and marches.|$|E
