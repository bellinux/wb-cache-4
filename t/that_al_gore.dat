25|$|Edwards {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{formally}} announce his candidacy for the presidency, on December 28, 2006. This run would be his second attempt at the presidency. Clinton announced intentions to run in the Democratic primaries on January 20, 2007. Obama announced his candidacy on February 10 in his home state of Illinois. None of the candidates received a significant bounce in their poll numbers after their official announcements. Through most of 2007, even after it was evident <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> would not run, he and Edwards each hovered between the third and fourth place spots in the polls behind Clinton and Obama.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2000, at {{the largest}} Super Rally of his {{campaign}}, held in New York City's Madison Square Garden, 15,000 people paid $20 each to hear Nader speak. Nader's campaign rejected both parties as institutions dominated by corporate interests, stating <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> and George W. Bush were [...] "Tweedledee and Tweedledum". A {{long list of}} notable celebrities spoke and performed at the event including Susan Sarandon, Ani DiFranco, Ben Harper, Tim Robbins, Michael Moore, Eddie Vedder and Patti Smith. The campaign also had some prominent union help: The California Nurses Association and the United Electrical Workers endorsed his candidacy and campaigned for him.|$|E
2500|$|The ACT Party {{went into}} the 2008 {{election}} with a policy that in part stated [...] "New Zealand is not warming" [...] and that their policy goal was to ensure: [...] "That no New Zealand government will ever impose needless and unjustified taxation or regulation on its citizens in a misguided attempt to reduce global warming or become a world leader in carbon neutrality" [...] In September 2008, ACT Party Leader Rodney Hide stated [...] "that the entire climate change – global warming hypothesis is a hoax, that the data and the hypothesis do not hold together, <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> is a phoney and a fraud on this issue, and that the emissions trading scheme is a worldwide scam and swindle". In October 2012, {{in response to a}} speech on climate change by Green Party MP Kennedy Graham, ACT leader John Banks said he had [...] "never heard such claptrap in this parliament... a bogeyman tirade, humbug." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, a {{consortium}} of news organizations, assisted by professional statisticians , examined numerous hypothetical ways of recounting all the Florida ballots. The study was conducted {{over a period of}} 10 months. The consortium examined 175,010 ballots that vote-counting machines had rejected. In each alternative way of recounting the rejected ballots, the number of additional votes for Gore was smaller than the 537-vote lead that state election officials ultimately awarded Bush. Under the strategy <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> pursued {{at the beginning of the}} Florida recount — filing suit to force hand recounts in four predominantly Democratic counties — Bush would have kept his lead, according to the ballot review conducted by the consortium. Likewise, if Florida's 67 counties had carried out the hand recount of disputed ballots ordered by the Florida Supreme Court on December 8, applying the standards that election officials said they would have used, Bush would have emerged the victor by 493 votes. On the other hand, the study also found that if the official vote-counting standards had not rejected ballots containing overvotes (where a voter selects more than one candidate in a race where each voter may only choose one candidate) a statewide tally would have resulted in Gore emerging as the victor by 60 to 171 votes. These tallies conducted by the NORC consortium are caveated with the statement: [...] "But no study of this type can accurately recreate Election Day 2000 or predict what might have emerged from individual battles over more than 6 million votes in Florida's 67 counties." ...|$|E

5000|$|Film critic Prairie Miller {{was skeptical}} of the film's premise: <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore's</b> {{environmental}} activism is motivated by a desire for money and power. She criticized the direction of Shayne Edwards, writing that it's [...] "really a case of wagging the dog with smug narrator Phil Valentine calling the shots."

50|$|In 2007 TCPR {{issued a}} report asserting <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore's</b> {{residence}} in the Nashville area used more than 20 times the energy of a typical home in the United States. Reporters who followed up on the allegations found that Gore's house did use more electricity than a typical home, but {{they also found that}} it was about 12 times the average for Nashville (not 20 times, as reported by TCPR), pointed out that the building functioned both as a residence and a business office for both <b>Al</b> and Tipper <b>Gore,</b> it was much larger than a typical home, and that Gore made substantial improvements to the home during 2007 that reduced its electricity consumption. Drew Johnson, TCPR's president at that time, later said that the widespread attention to its report resulted in TCPR's receiving death threats.|$|R
50|$|The 1988 presidential {{campaign}} of <b>Al</b> <b>Gore,</b> U.S. Senator of Tennessee and former House Representative began on April 11, 1987. He campaigned for President of the United States as a Democratic {{candidate in the}} 1988 presidential election, against Democratic candidates Joe Biden, Dick Gephardt, Paul Simon, Jesse Jackson, and Michael Dukakis (who eventually won the Democratic nomination). Despite eventual defeat, Gore (with a strong third place) {{was one of the}} front-runners <b>that</b> year. <b>Al</b> <b>Gore,</b> at <b>that</b> time, represented the Southern Democrats and some of the Conservative Democrats in 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Not Evil Just Wrong is a 2009 {{documentary}} film by Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer <b>that</b> challenges <b>Al</b> <b>Gore's</b> An Inconvenient Truth {{by suggesting that}} the evidence of global warming is inconclusive and that the impact global warming legislation will have on industry is much more harmful to humans than beneficial. The movie was filmed in 2008 and was screened at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam and at the RightOnline conference in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Another theory {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> attempted {{to run a}} populist campaign but failed to separate himself from the abuses of the Clinton presidency.

50|$|The 2000 U.S. Presidential {{election}} {{is often cited}} {{as an example of}} the spoiler effect.

In the state of Florida, the final certified vote count showed Bush with just 537 more votes than Gore. Because Bush defeated Gore in Florida, he won the state, received more votes in the electoral college, and became president of the United States.|$|R

IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning did {{not enjoy}} the green theme in the episode, reasoning that it [...] "just seemed {{to get in the}} way of everything else happening in 'Sun Tea'." [...] He was not thrilled with Jack and Tracy's storyline, noting it was missing heart and emotion, and overall it felt [...] "flat". Canning felt <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore's</b> cameo was [...] "fun but wholly unnecessary." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave [...] "Sun Tea" [...] a mixed review, noting [...] "I don't know how funny it was, though. I mean, sure, there was still a ton of great lines tonight... but not all of them hit the mark like they usually do." [...] Nonetheless, Sassone concluded [...] "...any 30 Rock episode with Dr. Spaceman and a couple of digs at NBC's Green Week is still a pretty good one." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said this episode of 30 Rock was [...] "even more of a comedy drag race than usual." ...|$|R

But when she checked the county's Web site for an update half an hour later, she found a startling development: Gore's count had dropped by 16,000 votes, while an obscure Socialist candidate had picked up 10,000--all because of a single precinct with only 600 voters." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an outline and {{critique}} of William Nordhaus’ book A Question of Balance (2008), {{in which he}} proposes his optimal policy for dealing with global climate change. Nordhaus finds that the proposals of the Stern Review and <b>that</b> of <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> are inefficient and costly. The critique of Nordhaus is focused on (1) the structure of his model, which requires marginal costs be equal to marginal benefits everywhere and at all time periods, and that (2) the rate of discount {{be based on the}} opportunity cost of private capital, and (3) his failure to treat climate change as a global public good. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{difficulty}} is sometimes summed up, in an extreme form, as [...] "All votes for {{anyone other than}} the second place are votes for the winner", because by voting for other candidates, they have denied those votes to the second place candidate who could have won had they received them. It is often claimed by United States Democrats <b>that</b> Democrat <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> lost the 2000 Presidential Election to Republican George W. Bush because some voters on the left voted for Ralph Nader of the Green Party, who exit polls indicated would have preferred Gore at 45% to Bush at 27%, with the rest not voting in Nader's absence.|$|R
