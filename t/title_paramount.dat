They agreed and spent over a year obtaining the film rights from Paramount Pictures, New Line and Crystal Lake Entertainmentthe latter run by Friday the 13th creator Sean S. Cunningham. Paramount executives gave Platinum Dunes producers a license to use anything from the original films, including the <b>title.</b> <b>Paramount</b> was given the rights to distribute the film internationally and New Line retained U.S. distribution rights. Fuller and Form said {{they did not want to}} make Friday the 13th Part 11 or 12, but wanted to rework the mythology. They liked elements from the first four filmssuch as plot points and ways particular characters are killedand planned to use these in their remake, which they did with Paramount's approval. Fuller said, [...] "I think there are moments we want to address, like how does the hockey mask happen. It’ll happen differently in our movie than in the third one. Where is Jason from, why do these killings happen, and what is Crystal Lake?"

2500|$|Coppola shot The Godfather Part II {{parallel}} to The Conversation {{and it was}} the last major American motion picture to be filmed in Technicolor. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: [...] "You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young Vito Corleone and the other of his son Michael. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use [...] "Part II" [...] in its <b>title.</b> <b>Paramount</b> was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie The Godfather Part II. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen The Godfather, there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of The Godfather Part II began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director.|$|E

50|$|In April 1980, Paramount (then {{owned by}} Gulf+Western), MCA/Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures and 20th Century Fox partnered with Getty Oil to jointly develop a pay cable service called Premiere.

Displeased that the venture would likely give the four studios disproportionate control of the pay television marketplace, Time-Life, Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment and Viacom/TelePrompTer (the then respective owners of HBO, The Movie Channel and Showtime) to file an antitrust lawsuit against the studios with the U.S. Justice Department later that year. After reviewing the case, the Justice Department issued an injunction blocking Premiere's planned January 1, 1981 launch, deeming the venture to be an illegal boycott of the existing pay services that would subject them to possible financial damage if its presence resulted in price fixing of film <b>titles.</b> <b>Paramount,</b> MCA, Fox and Columbia decided to scrap the venture after the ruling was handed down.|$|R

50|$|While Aro Ure II {{was still}} the {{paramount}} chief of Kabadi, he bore only women; and by tradition, women could not hold the <b>title</b> of <b>paramount</b> chief. Nonetheless, after his death, title of chieftaincy was transferred to and briefly held by Boi Ure, his cousin, eldest son of Ure Vado II. Ure Vado II had married a Magabaira woman who bore him two children Boi and Eu. When Boi Ure passed on, the title was transferred to Ao Ure, who is Ure Vado IIs son from another wife from the Ivei clan. Ao Ure ruled briefly, but tragedy struck again leaving him without a male heir; consequently, transferred to Boi Ures only son Korosi Boi. The title was then transferred to Ure Vado III, Ure Vado IIs last son, {{as soon as the}} latter realized he had no male heirs. More recently, the process continued with the title transferred on to Aro Ure III. Today, the <b>title</b> of <b>paramount</b> chief is held by Aro Ure III, who was initiated in the mid 1970s by the former chief late Korosi Boi, and late Oala Varia; a remo. This process is well entrenched in Kabadi society and will continue as long as the Kabadi people live and prosper into the future.|$|R
