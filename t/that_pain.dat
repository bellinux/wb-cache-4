5|$|Pain was {{too young}} to serve King William Rufus, but {{according}} to the later 12th-century writings of Walter Map he may have been a chamberlain—one of the officials in charge of the royal household—for William's brother, King Henry I (reigned 1100–1135). There is no contemporary evidence for Pain having held that office and nor is it likely, given Map's story, <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> was involved with Henry's financial affairs; rather it appears that if indeed he was a chamberlain, he was a body servant. Map relates a story about Pain serving the king personally at night, providing Henry with wine if the king called for it. The story continues <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> once drank the wine and was caught out by Henry when the king subsequently demanded his nightcap. Map finishes the story by saying that the king then ordered <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> should be given wine every night while awaiting the king's pleasure. Although the story is unlikely to be true in all details, it suggests that Pain's service to the king was personal as well as judicial and governmental. Other evidence against Map's claim <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> was a chamberlain is that he never attested a royal charter in that office.|$|E
5|$|All {{accounts}} agree <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> {{married in}} 1115 {{and that his}} wife was named Sybil, although the identity of Sybil's parents is unclear. Pain's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry states that he married Sybil Talbot, the niece of Hugh de Lacy. The Complete Peerage states that he married Sybil, the daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Talbot's wife Agnes, who was herself probably the daughter of Walter de Lacy. The historian K. S. B. Keats-Rohan states <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> married Sybil de Lacy, the daughter of Hugh de Lacy, a view shared by fellow historians Judith Green and Paul Dalton. Others such as Bruce Coplestone-Crow and David Crouch agree with the Oxford Dictionary of National Biographys designation of Sybil as Hugh's niece, and daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Agnes, the sister of Hugh de Lacy.|$|E

5|$|Pain is {{experienced}} by 53 {{percent of all}} people diagnosed with malignant cancer, 59 percent of people receiving anticancer treatment, 64 percent of people with metastatic or advanced-stage disease, and 33 percent of people after completion of curative treatment. Evidence for prevalence of pain in newly diagnosed cancer is scarce. One study found pain in 38 {{percent of people who}} were newly diagnosed, another found 35 percent of such people had experienced pain in the preceding two weeks, while another reported <b>that</b> <b>pain</b> was an early symptom in 18–49 percent of cases. More than one third of people with cancer pain describe the pain as moderate or severe.|$|E
5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, a belief <b>that</b> <b>pain</b> is inevitable, {{an aversion to}} treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom that is important for monitoring progress of the illness. People {{may be reluctant to}} take adequate pain medicine because they are unaware of their prognosis, or may be unwilling to accept their diagnosis. Failure to report pain or misguided reluctance to take pain medicine can be overcome by sensitive coaching.|$|E
5|$|The 1130 Pipe Roll noted <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> was a royal {{justice in}} Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke. Besides the {{ordinary}} court, Pain also heard cases {{relating to the}} forest law in those counties. The Pipe Roll does not record Pain as sheriff in Shropshire, but this is likely because the Shropshire returns for that year are missing from it. Also in 1130, Pain was consulted by the king about the appointment to a vacant bishopric. The Diocese of Hereford had been vacant {{since the death of}} Richard de Capella in August 1127, and the king consulted with Pain and the constable of Hereford before accepting their candidate—Robert de Bethune, the prior of Llanthony Priory. In 1132 Pain was present, along with his brother, at the Christmas court held by King Henry. Subsequently Caus Castle, which was under Pain's control, was burnt by the Welsh in 1134. As lord of Caus, Pain was involved in efforts to suppress Welsh raiding. Although Pain held Caus, his title to the fortification was unclear, as it had earlier been held by Robert Corbet.|$|E
40|$|This chapter defends an {{axiological}} {{theory of}} pain {{according to which}} pains are bodily episodes that are bad in some way. Section 1 introduces two standard assumptions about <b>pain</b> <b>that</b> the axiological theory constitutively rejects: (i) <b>that</b> <b>pains</b> are essentially tied to consciousness and (ii) <b>that</b> <b>pains</b> are not essentially tied to badness. Section 2 presents the axiological theory by contrast to these and provides a preliminary defense of it. Section 3 introduces the paradox of <b>pain</b> and argues <b>that</b> since the axiological theory takes the location of pain at face value, it needs {{to grapple with the}} privacy, self-intimacy and incorrigibility of pain. Sections 4, 5 and 6 explain how the axiological theory may deal with each of these...|$|R

25|$|Nociception (physiological pain) signals nerve-damage {{or damage}} to tissue. The {{three types of}} pain receptors are {{cutaneous}} (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed <b>that</b> <b>pain</b> was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research {{in the first half}} of the 20th century indicated <b>that</b> <b>pain</b> is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show <b>that</b> <b>pain</b> is registered in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the brain. The main function of pain is to attract our attention to dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts. Without pain, people could do many dangerous things without being aware of the dangers.|$|E

40|$|Five years ago, we {{published}} a commentary in theCanadian Medical Association Journalarguing <b>that</b> inadequately managed <b>pain</b> in {{children should be}} considered an adverse event, a harmful patient outcome.

In this article, we reflect on the progress made in both moving this proposition forward and testing out the concept. We {{then move on to}} look at what still {{needs to be done to}} ensure <b>that</b> children's <b>pain</b> is managed effectively...|$|R
25|$|Further {{arguments}} {{revolve around}} the ability of animals to feel pain or suffering. Suffering implies consciousness. If animals can be shown to suffer in a way similar or identical to humans, many of the arguments against human suffering could then, presumably, be extended to animals. Others have argued <b>that</b> <b>pain</b> can be demonstrated by adverse reactions to negative stimuli that are non-purposeful or even maladaptive. One such reaction is transmarginal inhibition, a phenomenon observed in humans and some animals akin to mental breakdown.|$|E
25|$|Rivers {{spends his}} last day at the clinic saying goodbye to his patients, then travels to London and meets Dr. Yealland from the National Hospital, who will be his {{colleague}} in his new position. Dr. Yealland uses electro-shock therapy to force patients to quickly recover from shell-shock; he believes that some patients {{do not want to}} be cured and <b>that</b> <b>pain</b> is the best method of treatment for such reluctant patients. Rivers questions whether he can work with a man who uses such techniques. Soon Sassoon is released for combat duty; Willard is able to overcome his psychosomatic paralysis and walks again; Anderson is given a staff job. The novel ends with Rivers completing his notes, meditating on the effect that the encounter with Sassoon, and the last few months, have had on him.|$|E
25|$|Impulsive {{behavior}} is common, including substance or alcohol abuse, eating disorders, unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with multiple partners, reckless spending, and reckless driving. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury. People with BPD act impulsively {{because it gives}} them the feeling of immediate relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions. A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve <b>that</b> <b>pain,</b> feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain. As time goes on, impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain.|$|E

On June 22, 2009, Mike Portnoy announced <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> of Salvation and Beardfish would not be touring the North American leg of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour because of record label complications. In the same announcement, Portnoy stated that the bands Scale the Summit and Bigelf would replace Pain of Salvation and Beardfish on the tour. This lineup change has put Bigelf on both the North American and European legs of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour. The tour's North American leg ran throughout July and August 2009.

25|$|Pain during {{receptive}} {{anal sex}} among gay men (or {{men who have}} sex with men) is formally known as anodyspareunia. In one study, 61% of gay or bisexual men said they experienced painful receptive anal sex and that it was the most frequent sexual difficulty they had experienced. By contrast, 24% of gay or bisexual men stated that they always experienced some degree of pain during anal sex, and about 12% of gay men find it too painful to pursue receptive anal sex; it was concluded that the perception of anal sex as painful is as likely to be psychologically or emotionally based as it is to be physically based. Factors predictive of pain during anal sex include inadequate lubrication, feeling tense or anxious, lack of stimulation, as well as lack of social ease with being gay and being closeted. Research has found that psychological factors can in fact be the primary contributors to the experience of pain during anal intercourse and that adequate communication between sexual partners can prevent it, countering the notion <b>that</b> <b>pain</b> is always inevitable during anal sex.|$|E
500|$|Pain {{was one of}} Henry's [...] "new men", who owed their {{positions}} and wealth to the king. The medieval writer Orderic Vitalis described them as a group as [...] "of base stock who had served him [...] well, raised them, so to say, from the dust" [...] and that the king [...] "stationed them above earls and famous castellans". Although Orderic stated that the families of these men were not considered high status, this was probably an exaggeration on the chronicler's part. Pain's family was respectable enough, as his father held a number of properties directly from the king. It appears <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> did not always take the king's side; the historian C. Warren Hollister has argued <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> was not among the supporters of Henry's only surviving legitimate child, Matilda, in 1126, when Henry had his nobility swear that they would recognise her as his heiress. Hollister feels that the removal of Waleran from Pain's custody was a sign <b>that</b> <b>Pain</b> had not supported Matilda.|$|E
