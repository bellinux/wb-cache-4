He played down his medal chances, saying [...] "The best guys are between 26 and 36 years old, I'm 18, any skier's dream {{is to go to}} the Olympics and ski with <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> <b>You</b> learn a lot from these experiences; Morocco, this is not a country where people expect medals at the Winter Games.

500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producer was series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who also functioned as the series' showrunner. During production of the previous season, Nickelodeon picked up a second season for SpongeBob SquarePants on August 31, 1999. The season premiered more than a year later, on October 26, 2000. Season production assistant and then-staff writer Derek Iversen commented, [...] "We hoped it would go one season. We hoped it would go two seasons. I figured you do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can and you hope." ...|$|E
500|$|Crew {{members have}} also reacted {{positively}} towards the episode. Carter {{said of the}} episode: The Erlenmeyer Flask' brings back nothing but good memories. It just has terrific images in it; it really brought the series {{in its first year}} full circle. It was successful in doing what we wanted to do, which was to close down the X-Files. It shocked a lot of people". Goodwin commented: [...] "Everything about that episode is absolutely first class. The acting, the art direction, the camera work. There's nothing in it that isn't <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can get, and that's really a credit to a lot of very talented people". The episode introduced many concepts and themes that would appear in the mythology episodes for the show throughout the years including genetic experiments, alien-human hybrids, toxic alien blood, government conspiracies, alien fetuses and deadly assassins.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{described}} the album as a [...] "fine balancing act" [...] of [...] "emo-edged" [...] tracks and [...] "wallop-packed rockers." [...] Steve Hochman of The Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Those graduating from teen tastes could well turn to this album {{as a first}} step to adulthood." [...] Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine praised the maturity the band showed through the album, noting that it had the capability to attract a wide-ranging audience. Rolling Stone reviewer Barry Walters stated that [...] "Bleed American sports the tender turbulence that insular emo kids have been enjoying in private for years," [...] with the album appealing to fans of Creed and Blink-182 as well as new wave music. Blender gave the album a mixed review, saying that the album's mainstream potential was [...] "undercut by guitars, which are neither as gleefully blaring as Weezer’s nor as cleanly melodic as the Knack’s." [...] Writing for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau stated [...] "if this band can't be maturity's answer to 'N Sync, it can be patriotism's answer to Travis." [...] Pitchfork, however, gave a much more negative and sarcastic review of the album. Reviewer Ryan Schreiber ended his review with [...] "So do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can, listen to your favorite band, bury your head in the sand, before it all begins again. Hey, I just wrote a Jimmy Eat World song!" ...|$|E
500|$|The rescuers {{concealed}} {{the fate}} of the snowshoe party, informing the rescued immigrants only that they did not return because they were frostbitten. Patty and Tommy Reed were soon too weak to cross the snowdrifts, and no one was strong enough to carry them. Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a Mason that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, [...] "Well, mother, if you never see me again, do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can." [...] Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed. Upon hearing his voice, Margret sank into the snow, overwhelmed.|$|E

2500|$|Yorke wrote many of Kid As lyrics {{by cutting}} up {{words and phrases}} and {{assembling}} them at random. Many were everyday cliches and banal observations, such as [...] "Where'd you park the car?"; others are violent ("cut the kids in half"). The chorus lyric of [...] "How to Disappear Completely" [...] was inspired by Yorke's friend Michael Stipe of R.E.M., who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself: [...] "I'm not here, this isn't happening". Another line came from a dream Yorke had {{in which he was}} running down the River Liffey. The chorus lyric of [...] "Optimistic" [...] ("try <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can / <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can is good enough") was an assurance by Yorke's partner, Rachel Owen, when he felt that [...] "nothing we'd done was releasable". Radiohead used Yorke's lyrics [...] "like pieces in a collage, pierced something together and [...] an artwork out of a lot of different little things". They did not publish Kid As lyrics in the liner notes, as they felt they could not be considered independently of the music.|$|E
