25|$|All the {{handwriting}} recognition, speech recognition and pen & ink features from Windows XP <b>Tablet</b> <b>PC</b> Edition {{as well as}} accessories like <b>Tablet</b> <b>PC</b> Input Panel, Windows Journal, Sticky Notes and InkBall have been included. New features include gestures and pen flicks. There is intrinsic support for handwriting and ink, via the Ink Analysis API. A new control, the InkCanvas is made available by the API to add ink support to applications. Ink support can not only recognize handwriting and formatting, but also hand-drawn shapes which are converted to vector-graphics, rendered as the shape that {{was intended to be}} drawn. An update for Windows XP <b>Tablet</b> <b>PC</b> Edition containing Ink Analysis and StylusInput API support is also available. Windows Vista also supports handwriting personalization, which allows the recognizer to identify a user's handwriting. To improve recognition accuracy, users can correct individual characters or words, or submit handwritten samples; an opt in data collection feature is also available. Support for touchscreens is also included.|$|E

25|$|In early 2004, {{while on}} the {{paperback}} tour in Denver for her novel Oryx and Crake, Atwood conceived {{the concept of a}} remote robotic writing technology, what would later be known as the LongPen, that would enable a person to remotely write in ink anywhere in the world via <b>tablet</b> <b>PC</b> and the Internet, thus allowing her to conduct her book tours without being physically present. She quickly founded a company, Unotchit Inc., to develop, produce and distribute this technology. By 2011, Unotchit Inc. shifted its market focus into business and legal transactions and was producing a range of products, for a variety of remote writing applications, based on the LongPen technologies and renamed itself to Syngrafii Inc. As of September 2014, Atwood is still Co-founder and a Director of Syngrafii Inc. and holder of various patents related to the LongPen technology.|$|E

40|$|Tablet {{technology}} {{has been shown to}} support learner-centred mathematics education when this technology is available to both the lecturer and the students. However, cost is often the barrier to students’ use of <b>tablet</b> <b>PCs</b> for their university studies. This article argues that more affordable netbook <b>PCs</b> with <b>tablet</b> capabilities can be viable alternatives to full-sized <b>tablet</b> <b>PCs</b> to enhance active and collaborative learning in mathematics and statistics. For a whole teaching semester, netbook <b>tablet</b> <b>PCs</b> were given to volunteer students from two different cohorts. Students were enrolled in nursing mathematics or introductory statistics in non-mathematics majors at an Australian university. The aims were to gauge the suitability of this technology and to identify what active and collaborative learning emerged in these first-year classes. While the netbook <b>tablet</b> <b>PCs</b> were actively promoted in their tutorials, of additional interest was students’ use of the technology for any aspect of their studies {{both inside and outside the}} classroom. The outcome of this study was to inform a university decision to provide inexpensive tablet technology to larger cohorts of students. The results highlight different approaches required in the mathematics and statistics classes to achieve collaborative and active learning facilitated through the technology. Environmental variables such as the tutor, student, learning space, availability of other technologies and subject content had an impact on the nature of learning. While learner-centred education can be facilitated by inexpensive netbook <b>tablet</b> <b>PCs,</b> we caution that the savings may come at the expense of computing power...|$|R
