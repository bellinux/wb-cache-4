25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which was the story of the day matched the champions in every aspect and looked a better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a measly 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get some movement on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 and outs on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory there was a sense that a big play needed to be made on Defence if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team and everyone else knew that was the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E

Hans Richter speaks of a [...] "pleasure of letting fly at the bourgeois, which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence" [...] (see Épater la bourgeoisie). In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized {{that they were going to}} fight a duel in Rehalp, near Zürich, and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the popular novelist Jakob Christoph Heer for their witness. Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the Allies and Central Powers against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective propaganda efforts. While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 Vingt-cinq poèmes ("Twenty-five Poems").|$|E

[...] In {{the late}} 1950s, {{it became apparent}} to Street & Smith that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to raise prices again. [...] During 1959, Astounding was priced at 50 cents in some areas {{to find out what}} the impact would be on circulation. [...] The results were apparently satisfactory, and the price was raised with the November 1959 issue. [...] The following year, Campbell finally achieved his goal of getting rid of the word [...] "Astounding" [...] in the magazine's title, changing it to Analog Science Fact/Science Fiction. The [...] "/" [...] in the title was often replaced by a symbol of Campbell's devising, resembling an inverted U pierced by a horizontal arrow and meaning [...] "analogous to".

500|$|This {{brought the}} {{regiment}} into contact {{for the first}} time with someone it would later meet more seriously, Brigadier Bernard Law Montgomery (often referred to as [...] "Monty"), then commanding the 9th Infantry Brigade in Portsmouth. In 1937, the brigade was on an exercise in Wiltshire and RWY was attached to it for their two-week annual camp. The brigade major wrote that [...] " [...] was run like so much of the TA those days on rather feudal lines...when they heard <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> those tremendous exercises – three nights out at a time – they jibbed violently....Most of them had looked forward to exercises all day and then going out for a bit of jollity at night." [...] The upshot was that the regiment was banished to a distant part of the camp where their socialising would not be disturbed by the Regulars. However, apparently the Yeomanry were so intrigued by Monty's exercises that their Commanding Officer (CO) approached him, asking to be included in the last brigade exercise.|$|E
500|$|During {{a typical}} Polish {{coronation}} ceremony {{in the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the king-elect received Szczerbiec after his anointment and before being crowned and enthroned. The primate of Poland, that is the archbishop of Gniezno, picked up the unsheathed sword from the altar {{and handed it to}} the kneeling king. At the same time, he recited a formula which asked the monarch to use the sword to rule justly, defend the Church, fight evil, protect widows and orphans, and to [...] "rebuild what is damaged, maintain what is rebuilt, avenge what is unjust, reinforce what is well managed," [...] etc. Then, the king handed the sword to the Crown sword-bearer (miecznik koronny), who slid it into the scabbard and passed on to the primate. The primate, aided by the Crown and Lithuanian sword-bearers, fastened the scabbard to the king's belt. The king stood up and, facing onlookers, withdrew Szczerbiec, made three times {{the sign of the cross}} with it, and wiped it against his left arm before replacing it in the scabbard. The king's sword-wielding abilities were closely watched by his new subjects during this part of the ritual. When Augustus III betrayed his poor fencing skills at his coronation, nobles joked that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> [...] "a peaceful lord". After Szczerbiec, a bishop handed the sovereign the Grunwald Swords symbolizing the monarch's reign over the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{his career}} as player and journalist, Fingleton {{persistently}} came into personal conflict with Don Bradman, one of the captains under whom Fingleton played, damaging the reputations of both. Bradman characteristically held his silence during Fingleton's lifetime. Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, he gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with those of Irish descent such as Fingleton being Catholic and Anglo-Australians such as Bradman being predominantly Protestant, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. During the 1936–37 Ashes series in Australia, four Catholics, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, leading batsman and vice-captain Stan McCabe along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. When Bradman was dismissed in his final Test innings in 1948 for a duck, Fingleton and O'Reilly were reported to be laughing hysterically in the pressbox. E W Swanton said that [...] "I thought <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stroke". Bradman later wrote after both had died: [...] "With these fellows out of the way, the loyalty of my 1948 side was a big joy and made a big contribution to the outstanding success of that tour".|$|E

[...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman.

[...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now.

I really wanted this to be a literal 'third season' of the show. Bob told me they really wanted to get away from the high school setting, so after the resolution of the Cooper-BOB-possession plot point, they would have cut to something like 'Ten Years Later', and then shown us a Twin Peaks where Cooper had quit the FBI and had become the town pharmacist, Sheriff Truman had become a recluse, etc. He also mentioned <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Sheryl Lee come back, this time as a redhead, and probably have her character killed by BOB again. There were also some vague ideas about BOB and Mike being from a planet made of creamed corn, something about Truman driving Mike backwards through the portal into the Black Lodge (which I think would have been a really nice cinematic scene)." [...] Lynch vetoed the project, stating that he respected the effort but did not want to continue the story of Twin Peaks in any way.|$|E
2500|$|These events {{known as}} the Haymarket Riots angered many people and gave a bad {{impression}} of the labor unions due to the violence that they had incurred. [...] However, protests such as these helped to make an impression upon the industrial heads. [...] It made them start to realize that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to make changes for the workers or suffer the consequences. [...] The Haymarket Riots {{were one of the}} things that set the era of worker reform into motion to help millions of people improve their lives. [...] Working to reform the eight-hour day paid off eventually and continues on today. [...] This showed the people in charge that laborers were no longer willing to be treated so inhumanely and that they would do what needed to be done in order to change what they wanted. [...] Because of this push for the eight-hour day, doors were open for reform of other unfair treatments of laborers. [...] It helped to work towards a more just labor system in general. [...] Young Jay Fox had been a part of this at the age of sixteen; he had helped in a cause to make a difference. [...] Not only this but he was able to leave behind writings that let future generations know what had happened in his account of the event “I Was At Haymarket.” [...] Through this piece of writing he showed what was going on at the time, what people decided to do about the unfair treatment, and the injustice of the authorities handling the situation.|$|E
2500|$|Athens' {{strength}} in the Peloponnesian War came from its navy, whereas Sparta's came from its land-based Hoplite army. As the war progressed however the Spartans {{came to realize that}} if they were to undermine Pericles' strategy of [...] outlasting the Peloponnesians by remaining within the walls of Athens indefinitely (a strategy made possible by Athens' Long Walls and fortified port of Piraeus), <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to do something about Athens superior naval force. Once Sparta gained Persia as an ally, they had the funds necessary to construct the new naval fleets necessary to combat the Athenians. Sparta was able to build fleet after fleet, eventually destroying the Athenian fleet at the Battle of Aegospotami. The Spartan General Brasidas summed up the difference in approach to naval warfare between the Spartans and the Athenians: [...] "Athenians relied on speed and maneuverability on the open seas to ram at will clumsier ships; in contrast, a Peloponnesian armada might win only when it fought near land in calm and confined waters, had the greater number of ships in a local theater, and if its better-trained marines on deck and hoplites on shore could turn a sea battle into a contest of infantry." [...] In addition, compared to the high-finesse of the Athenian navy (superior oarsmen who could outflank and ram enemy triremes from the side), the Spartans (as well as their allies and other enemies of Athens) would focus mainly on ramming Athenian triremes head on. It would be these tactics, in combination with those outlined by Brasidas, that led to the defeat of the Athenian fleet at the Second Battle of Syracuse during the Sicilian Expedition.|$|E
