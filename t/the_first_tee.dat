25|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of an approaching}} severe storm with lightning Saturday afternoon, the R announced Friday that the third round would be played off both the 1st and 10th tees in threesomes. Normal play is from only <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>tee</b> in pairs. This {{was the first time}} that play went off both tees at The Open.|$|E
25|$|The {{match was}} eagerly {{anticipated}} {{as a head}} to head between the two leading players at the time, and contested over 18 holes in a matchplay format. Woods won the match 2&1 to collect a check for $1,100,000, with Duval picking up $400,000. Both players donated $200,000 to charity, split between <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Tee</b> initiative and charities of their choice. The match {{proved to be a}} ratings success, drawing a 6.9 national Nielsen rating, higher than what had been predicted by broadcasters ABC Sports.|$|E
25|$|The Memorial Tournament {{continues}} the PGA Tour's philanthropic focus through its relationships with Central Ohio charities. The most significant {{of which is}} its relationship with Nationwide Children's Hospital since 1976. Contributions generated through the support of over 2,600 volunteers are distributed each year to the Hospital's unrestricted giving fund. This fund assists in ensuring Central Ohio continues {{to have one of}} the best children's hospitals in the United States. The Memorial Tournament has raised more than $5.7million to support the programs and services at Nationwide Children's Hospital in those 30-plus years. In 2005 the Memorial made a pledge that will elevate its level of giving to more than $11million in the coming years. Unique and successful relationships also exist with Fore Hope, James Cancer Hospital, Wolfe Associates, <b>The</b> <b>First</b> <b>Tee,</b> Central Ohio Junior Golf Association, Shriners, Lions Club and many more.|$|E

2500|$|Less than a {{week after}} his passing, Palmer's life was also celebrated by both teams at the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota, just outside the Twin Cities. The celebration {{included}} a video tribute and a moment of silence during the opening ceremony, which also included tributes from the opposing captains - Davis Love III for Team USA and Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke for Team Europe - and the opposing honorary captains - Nicklaus for Team USA and England's Tony Jacklin for Team Europe. During the matches, the players paid tribute to Palmer, which included wearing a special logo, button and pin.

At some courses, electric golf carts are used to travel between shots, which can speed-up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round. On other courses players generally walk the course, either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap or using a [...] "golf trolley" [...] for their bag. These trolleys {{may or may not}} be battery assisted. At many amateur tournaments including U.S. high school and college play, players are required to walk and to carry their own bags, but at the professional and top amateur level, as well as at high-level private clubs, players may be accompanied by caddies, who carry and manage the players' equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course. A caddie's advice can only be given to the player or players for whom the caddie is working, and not to other competing players.|$|E
2500|$|One of Louis's other passions was {{the game}} of golf, in which he also played a {{historic}} role. He was a long-time devotee of the sport since being introduced to the game before the first Schmeling fight in 1936. In 1952, Louis was invited to play as an amateur in the San Diego Open on a sponsor's exemption, becoming the first African American to play a PGA Tour event. Initially, the PGA of America was reluctant to allow Louis to enter the event, having a bylaw at the time limiting PGA membership to Caucasians. However, Louis's celebrity status eventually pushed the PGA toward removing the bylaw, but the [...] "Caucasian only" [...] clause in the PGA of America's constitution was not amended until November 1961. It {{paved the way for}} the first generation of African-American professional golfers such as Calvin Peete. Louis himself financially supported the careers of several other early black professional golfers, such as Bill Spiller, Ted Rhodes, Howard Wheeler, James Black, Clyde Martin and Charlie Sifford. He was also instrumental in founding <b>The</b> <b>First</b> <b>Tee,</b> a charity helping underprivileged children become acquainted with {{the game of}} golf. His son, Joe Louis Barrow, Jr., currently oversees the organization.|$|E

5000|$|The word tee {{is derived}} from the Scottish Gaelic word [...] meaning house and is related to the 'house' (the {{coloured}} circles) in curling. This would make sense, as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> golf <b>tees</b> were within a circle of one golf club length round the hole. Nowadays, modern courses have separate, designated tee boxes for each hole. For example, the ninth hole of a course is played from the ninth tee to the ninth green, and similarly for the other holes.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{golf tees}} rested {{flat on the}} ground and had a raised portion to prop up <b>the</b> ball. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> patent for this kind of tee is dated 1889, and was issued to Scotsmen William Bloxsom and Arthur Douglas. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> known <b>tee</b> to pierce the ground was a rubber-topped peg sold commercially as the [...] "Perfectum." [...] This was patented in 1892 by Percy Ellis of England. In 1899, an African-American dentist, Dr. George Franklin Grant, obtained a patent for an [...] "improved golf tee". This tee consisted of a wood cone with a rubber sleeve to support the ball, but it is not known to have ever been marketed.|$|R
50|$|Some mature {{trees from}} the {{original}} landscaped setting remain around the former Clubhouse. A chain wire fence on a tuff base sits on the retaining wall to the rear. Housings in the tuff base suggest that this was formally a timber fence. Concrete steps and a buggy ramp from the tram/bus stop in Herston Road provide smooth access for golfers and buggies from the roadway to the Course. Access from Course to Clubhouse is provided by a similar set of concrete steps and buggy ramp adjacent to <b>the</b> former <b>first</b> <b>tee.</b> A low painted stone wall with two sets of steps to the old Clubhouse forms an edge to the carpark. Approximately half way along <b>the</b> former <b>first</b> fairway a substantial set of stairs arrives on the Course from Gilchrist Avenue. The stairs are of concrete and hammered tuff with a concrete plaque bearing the date 1936.|$|R
