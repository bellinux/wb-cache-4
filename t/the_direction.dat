In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.|$|E

This difference appears to be mainly due to an asymmetry in the effect of retinal image motion direction on localization during smooth pursuit...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction.

This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
