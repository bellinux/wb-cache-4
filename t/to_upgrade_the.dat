5|$|In 1961, the British Transport Commission, {{together}} with the British Iron and Steel Federation and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce considered plans <b>to</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>the</b> navigation to handle 250-tonne barges, and work started on new wharfs and warehouses at Rotherham. Control of the navigation passed on again in 1963, this time to the British Waterways Board, who submitted a proposal to the government for a £2.5million upgrade, covering the stretch from Bramwith to Rotherham. This would have involved the construction of ten new locks, each , to replace the existing 12 locks. The new main line would then {{have been the same}} size as the Aire and Calder Navigation, although some of the bridges would have had less clearance. In 1972, a further proposal for a £2million scheme <b>to</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>the</b> waterway to handle 700-tonne barges up to Mexborough, and 400-tonne barges from there to Rotherham was submitted to the Department of the Environment.|$|E

As {{it passes through}} the Stonehenge World Heritage Site and the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, attempts <b>to</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>the</b> road in those areas have been controversial. In particular, the Stonehenge tunnel, which would see the A303 rerouted underground, has been proposed and delayed several times. Nevertheless, the road remains a popular alternative to motorway driving, and was commemorated in a book and BBC Four television documentary by Tom Fort in the early 2010s.|$|E

Subsequently, the depression maintained a northward track, due to its location along the northwest periphery of a near-equatorial ridge, {{as well as the}} presence of a tropical upper tropospheric trough.
