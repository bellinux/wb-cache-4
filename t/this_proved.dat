5|$|Forming {{three-dimensional}} lattices of DNA was {{the earliest}} goal of DNA nanotechnology, but <b>this</b> <b>proved</b> {{to be one}} of the most difficult to realize. Success using a motif based on the concept of tensegrity, a balance between tension and compression forces, was finally reported in 2009.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>proved</b> to be Gatting's last match as captain. He had captained England in 23 Test matches {{since taking}} charge against India in 1986, but won only two.|$|E

5|$|With Fustat no {{more than}} a dying suburb, the center of {{government}} moved permanently to nearby Cairo. Saladin later attempted to unite Cairo and Fustat into one city by enclosing them in massive walls, although <b>this</b> <b>proved</b> to be largely unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|A Jo Tessem {{equaliser}} for Southampton {{earned the}} visitors a point against Arsenal on 2 February 2002; in hindsight <b>this</b> <b>proved</b> {{to be the}} last time they dropped points in the league season. Wiltord scored the winning goal against Everton and Arsenal moved back to second place, which was obtained by Liverpool, following a 4–1 win at home to Fulham.|$|E
5|$|A {{landscaped}} {{park with}} lakes and statues {{was laid out}} around the house, and the drive to the house was along a semicircular avenue of trees. Sir Edward died in 1766. Sir Gregory Page-Turner, 3rd Baronet considered the house too large, so in 1767 he sought to demolish part of it to create a smaller house. <b>This</b> <b>proved</b> impossible so in 1768 he had the entire house demolished.|$|E

5|$|After {{just over}} an hour, Gemmell {{finally managed to}} equalise for Celtic when Craig passed {{to him from the}} right wing and he scored with a {{powerful}} 25 yard shot. The balance of play remained the same with Inter defending deeply against sustained Celtic attacking. With about five minutes remaining, a long-range shot from Bobby Murdoch was diverted by Stevie Chalmers past a wrong-footed Sarti. <b>This</b> <b>proved</b> to be the winning goal.|$|E
5|$|Although Bomis began {{a search}} for experts to vet Nupedia articles, <b>this</b> <b>proved</b> tedious. In August 2000 Nupedia had more than 60 {{academics}} contributing to the peer-review process on the site, most with doctor of philosophy or doctor of medicine degrees. Scholars wishing to contribute to Nupedia were required to submit their credentials via fax for verification. At that time, Bomis was attempting to obtain advertising revenue for Nupedia and the company was optimistic that it could fund the project with ad space on Nupedia.com.|$|E
5|$|Although Velvet Revolver {{worked on}} new {{material}} and auditioned new singers following Scott Weiland's departure, the band has not released any new material and only performed publicly once since 2008, when they reunited with Weiland for a one-off reunion show on January 12, 2012 at a benefit concert. <b>This</b> <b>proved</b> {{to be their}} last performance together before Weiland's death on December 3, 2015. Slash and McKagan have since rejoined Guns N' Roses.|$|E

5|$|Although the LWF {{program called}} for a {{structural}} life of 4,000 flight hours, capable of achieving 7.33g with 80% internal fuel; GD's engineers decided to design the F-16's airframe life for 8,000 hours and for 9-g maneuvers on full internal fuel. <b>This</b> <b>proved</b> advantageous when the aircraft's mission changed from solely air-to-air combat to multi-role operations. Changes in operational use and additional systems have increased weight, necessitating multiple structural strengthening programs.|$|E
5|$|Before the flyby of Voyager 2, astronomers {{suspected}} that Triton might have liquid nitrogen seas and a nitrogen/methane atmosphere with a density {{as much as}} 30% that of Earth. Like the famous overestimates of the atmospheric density of Mars, <b>this</b> <b>proved</b> incorrect. As with Mars, a denser atmosphere is postulated for its early history.|$|E
5|$|Cook then {{ordered that}} the ship be {{lightened}} to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out. The crew attached buoys to the discarded guns {{with the intention of}} retrieving them later, but <b>this</b> <b>proved</b> impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.|$|E

5|$|Due to delays with {{delivery}} of jet engines {{and production of}} the XP-84A, the Thunderjet had undergone only limited flight testing by the time production P-84Bs began to roll out of the factory in 1947. In particular, the impact of wingtip tanks on aircraft handling was not thoroughly studied. <b>This</b> <b>proved</b> problematic later.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the formation of a partner school in Qatar, the school came under fire from current and former pupils, as well as concerned members of the public, due to the country's poor human rights record. An online petition was started by a former pupil in April 2016 challenging the decision to open the school, however, <b>this</b> <b>proved</b> unsuccessful and The Royal Grammar School Guildford in Qatar (RGSGQ) opened for pupils on 19 September 2016.|$|E
5|$|For {{several decades}} after the uprising, Chiprovtsi and the region {{remained}} desolate. In 1699, the Ottomans attempted to settle 1,238 anti-Habsburg Hungarian rebels in those lands and provided them with 5-year tax exemptions, but <b>this</b> <b>proved</b> unsuccessful as in 1717 the same Hungarians were moved to the Rousse barracks and sent to fight at Niš.|$|E

5|$|Geologists {{feared that}} a large {{earthquake}} that shook Borah Peak, Idaho's tallest mountain, in 1983 would restart volcanic activity at Craters of the Moon, though <b>this</b> <b>proved</b> {{not to be the}} case.

5|$|HMS Hotspur was {{inspired}} by a series of French coast-defence ships with the ram as their primary weapon. The layout of Glatton was modified with a fixed turret and her freeboard was increased over that of the older ship. The single 12-inch gun was mounted on a turntable and could pivot at each gun port to maximise its arc of fire. It was nominally capable of firing forward, but <b>this</b> <b>proved</b> to damage the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|However, the Guatemalan {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the Comité. Nevertheless, the Comité was able to conduct personal searches of exiles {{as they left the}} country. <b>This</b> <b>proved</b> to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing.|$|E
