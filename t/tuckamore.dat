5000|$|Krummholz or krumholtz (German: krumm, [...] "crooked, bent, twisted" [...] and Holz, [...] "wood") — {{also called}} knieholz ("knee timber") — {{is a type}} of stunted, {{deformed}} vegetation encountered in subarctic and subalpine tree line landscapes, shaped by continual exposure to fierce, freezing winds. Under these conditions, trees can only survive where they are sheltered by rock formations or snow cover. As the lower portion of these trees continues to grow, the coverage becomes extremely dense near the ground. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the formation is known as <b>tuckamore.</b>|$|E
50|$|Point Verde {{is located}} just {{southwest}} of Placentia, {{which is known}} as the old French capital of Newfoundland. While Placentia was built on a stony beach, Point Verde (Green Point) possesses fine grasslands. One striking feature of Point Verde is the large ponds located near the headland. The two bodies of water used to be joined before a causeway was put in for the road that extends to the point. The first settlers at Point Verde were John and Robert Greene, who acquired the peninsula from Placentia merchants Saunders and Sweetman in 1803. The Greenes fished and cleared <b>tuckamore</b> to create extensive gardens and pastureland for their livestock. By {{the time of the first}} census in 1836, the community had a population of seventy-two.|$|E

40|$|The Glover Island Area {{of western}} Newfoundland spans the Humber-Dunnage Zone Boundary at the {{northern}} end of the Appalachian Orogen. Here a deformed ophiolitic pluton separates schists and gneisses (west) from mafic volcanic rocks (east). To the west, quartzo-feldspathic gneisses of the Cobble Cove Gneiss are structurally overlain by the Keystone Schist. To the east, the ophiolitic Grand Lake Complex is structurally juxtaposed against the Keystone Schist and unconformably overlain by volcanic rocks of the Glover Group. Farther east the Glover Group is unconformably overlain by the Corner Pond Formation and to the south, volcanic rocks and dykes of the Otter Neck Group are unconformably overlain by the Red Point Formation. [...] The Cobble Cove Gneiss consists of granodioritic gneiss and metasomatized mafic dykes. It is followed eastward by metamorphosed greywackes, quartzites, conglomerates and mafic volcanics of the Keystone Schist. Intruded by mafic dykes and trondhjemite, cumulate ultramafic and mafic rocks of the Grand Lake Complex are structurally juxtaposed against the Keystone Schist. The Glover Group unconformably overlies the Grand Lake Complex and is divided into a lower metasedimentary unit termed the Kettle Pond Formation which contains abundant clasts derived from the underlying ophiolite, and an upper metavolcanic unit termed the <b>Tuckamore</b> Formation. Pillow basalts and mafic tuffs of the <b>Tuckamore</b> Formation are similar to low-K tholeiites. The Otter Neck Group consists of tholeiitic sheeted dykes and aquagene tuffs intruded by porphyries geochemically comparable to the <b>Tuckamore</b> Formation. It is unconformably overlain by metasediments of the Red Point Formation which are correlated with the Corner Pond Formation. Arenig conodants have been recovered from a newly discovered fossil locality within the Corner Pond Formation. [...] The Cobble Cove Gneiss is interpreted as Grenvillian basement overlain by a Paleozoic metaclastic cover represented by the Keystone Schist. The Grand Lake Complex and Otter Neck Group are interpreted to represent Iapetus Ocean crust obducted during Taconic Ordgenesis. Exhumation during ophiolite obduction {{led to the formation of}} unconformities upon which the Glover Group, Red Point Formation and Corner Pond Formation were deposited. Similarities in lithology and structural sequence between Glover Island and Baie Verte indicate that the Baie Verte-Brompton Line is continuous between these two localities...|$|E
40|$|This {{past summer}} {{my family and}} I {{set out on a}} {{challenging}} trek in Gros Morne National Park. We would hike the park’s namesake, a foreboding 800 -meter dome of ancient seabed, the highest point in the Long Range Mountains of western Newfoundland. We walked an hour through gnarled <b>tuckamore</b> – centuries old white spruce tortured and twisted to form an impenetrable canopy just a few feet over our heads. The thin peat at our feet was veined with a network of hardened roots. Shards of white granite scree pushed through the black loam like skeletal remains – a charnel house to commemorate the millennia of unimaginable geological forces. The shadows were deep and silent; the wind swept over us, but was unable to find a way in. It was a series of these elvin gullies interspersed with spongy open bogs that brought us to the base of Gros Morne Mountain. We began our ascent through a chute on the western face. Car-sized angular boulders of pink granite emblazoned with rosettes of rusty lichen made the going tough. At first the children, aged 9 and 11, were excited and chattered incessantly. In short time, however, they fell silent. Each of us peered up – concentrating on choosing the best path – the one of least resistance. The tight single file into which we had naturally fallen on the trail to the base was now diffused by the challenge of a rocky chute. We were four, united in goal, determined to move forward, yet each individual forging his own way. Then an interesting pattern emerged. The climb was frequently interrupted when one of us would turn an...|$|E
40|$|An 800 cm core from a lake (104 m; 50 ° 46. 08 'N, 55 ° 31 'W) on the Grey Islands, {{situated}} in the Labrador Sea 20 km east of Newfoundland's Northern Peninsula, provides a nearly complete Holocene pollen sequence with a distinct maritime influence. By 9800 BP (705 cm), the site had emerged from the postglacial Daly Sea and a herb-shrub tundra was established. Tundra persisted until 7800 BP when spruce and fir invaded to form boreal forest. Fire at 7300 BP resulted in a brief resurgence of herbs and shrubs, primarily alder, followed by forest re-establishment by 6800 BP. Paludification led {{to an increase in}} Sphagnum and greatly decreased pollen influx after 3000 BP, followed by an increase in shrubs and herbs at the expense of trees after 1000 BP. Today the Grey Islands are dominated by <b>tuckamore</b> (dwarf shrub barrens) with patchy areas of black spruce forest and sphagnum bog. [...] Timing of initial forest development at the expense of shrub tundra (7800 BP) coincides with other sites on the Northern Peninsula, though as much as 1 ka later {{than the rest of the}} island and slightly earlier than in southeastern Labrador. Increasing tree birch between 7000 and 4500 BP is indicative of higher summer temperatures and a longer growing season, while also signalling the weakening of a cold ocean influence which, in pollen and dinoflagellate cyst records from the Labrador sea, is dated about 7000 BP. A major forest fire in the record falls within the 8000 to 6500 BP period of increased fire frequency on the Northern Peninsula. Water temperature in the Labrador Sea reached a maximum around 6000 BP, coincident with the start of the hypsithermal period on the Grey Islands.
