The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the effects of different N applications at sowing using Entec (N source with nitrification inhibitor) and urea (traditional N source) at covering, on four wheat cultivars. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design in a factorial scheme, with four replications, at the Experimental Station of the Faculdade de Engenharia de Ilha Solteira - UNESP, on a dystrophic, epi-eutrophic alic Red Latosol with loamy texture, formerly under savannah vegetation. Four N rates (0, 60, 120, and 180 kg ha- 1) were tested, applied at sowing in the case of Entec and <b>top-dressed</b> 40 days after plant emergence in the case of urea, and the four wheat cultivars E 21, E 22, E 42, and IAC 370.

There was no significant difference between Entec (applied at sowing) and urea (<b>top-dressed)</b> in terms of grain yield and yield components. Nevertheless, urea resulted in a higher N leaf content, and Entec in a larger number of undeveloped spikelets.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryChristopher D. ReinhardtThree {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine nutritional and management strategies for different segments of the beef industry. The first experiment {{examined the effects of}} feeding traditional step-up diets (STEP) vs. limit-feeding (LIMIT) the finishing diet to adapt cattle to high-concentrate diets. When all cattle reached ad libitum intake of the finishing diet there was a trend (P = 0. 09) for DMI to be different between treatments. During week 1, STEP cattle had higher total VFA concentrations (P = 0. 02), while LIMIT cattle had higher valerate absorption (P = 0. 02) and disappearance (P = 0. 08). During week 4, LIMIT cattle had higher total VFA concentrations (P = 0. 03) and lower valerate disappearance and absorption (P = 0. 05) than STEP cattle. These results indicate that limit-feeding the finishing diet may inhibit nutrient absorption from the rumen or this method may cause increased production of valerate by lactate utilizing bacteria due to a more acidotic rumen environment. The second experiment examined the effects of feeding 5 % (DM basis) dried, full-fat corn germ (GERM) on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of naturally raised yearling steers and heifers. Carcass-adjusted ADG was higher for GERM cattle (P = 0. 04). There were no other differences in performance or carcass characteristics. Total incidence of liver abscesses and the incidence of severe liver abscesses were decreased by 12 and 8. 2 % (P = 0. 01 and 0. 02, respectively) when GERM was added to the diet. Corn germ can be added to finishing diets at 5 % without affecting performance and carcass characteristics. Producers raising natural cattle may also be able to benefit from the reduced incidence of liver abscesses. The third experiment examined concurrent metaphylactic treatment of high-risk calves with tulathromycin and chlortetracycline. Calves were placed on 1 of 3 treatments: 1) no <b>top-dress</b> pellets; 2) diet <b>top-dressed</b> with pellets containing chlortetracycline; or 3) diet <b>top-dressed</b> with pellets containing no chlortetracycline.

Their having got a religion to themselves must have intensified them much as the having a god of their own did the Jews. The exhilaration of relief after the long tension of anxiety, when the Spanish Armada was overwhelmed like the hosts of Pharaoh, while it confirmed their assurance of a provincial deity, must also have been like sunshine to bring into flower all that there was of imaginative or sentimental in the English nature, already just in the first flush of its spring.|$|E
