25|$|While it is {{possible}} to do some types of research using an irradiator much like that used for gamma sterilization, it is common in some areas of science to use a time resolved experiment where a material is subjected to a pulse of radiation (normally electrons from a LINAC). After <b>the</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> radiation, the concentration of different substances within the material are measured by emission spectroscopy or Absorption spectroscopy, hence the rates of reactions can be determined. This allows the relative abilities of substances to react with the reactive species generated by the action of radiation on the solvent (commonly water) to be measured. This experiment is known as pulse radiolysis which is closely related to Flash photolysis.|$|E
25|$|The first {{percutaneous}} supraclavicular {{block was}} performed in 1911 by German surgeon Diedrich Kulenkampff (18801967). Just as his older colleague August Bier (18611949) had done with spinal anesthesia in 1898, Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block. Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a percutaneous approach to the brachial plexus from the axilla. In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications. They described their technique with the patient in the sitting position or in the supine position with a pillow between the shoulders.

These ideas were powerful connections to colonialism, and may {{have played a role in}} the creation of the 'other' and the literature that many used to justify taking advantage of less advanced nations.

500|$|Angelou {{recognized}} that although [...] "On <b>the</b> <b>Pulse</b> <b>of</b> Morning" [...] {{was a better}} [...] "public poem" [...] than a great poem, her goal of conveying the message of unity was accomplished.

Plumpp found Angelou's performance [...] "brilliant", but was [...] "not as enthusiastic about it as a text". Burr stated that the negative reviews of Angelou's poem, like {{the majority of the}} reviews about her other poetry, was due to their elitism and narrow views of poetry, which were limited to written forms rather than spoken ones like [...] "On <b>the</b> <b>Pulse</b> <b>of</b> Morning", which was written to recite aloud and perform.
