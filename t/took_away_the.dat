5|$|In {{response}} to this cancellation and rumors of an anti-Protestant alliance between Catholics and Native Americans, Protestant settlers formed an association to defend themselves. In July 1689, they marched on the colonial capital, St. Mary's City. Led by John Coode, the Protestant associators were quickly able to capture St. Mary's and the other major towns of the colony. The Governor {{and a number of}} other Calvert allies fled to Virginia. Charles Calvert turned for relief to the Lords of Trade and eventually to the Privy Council, but these groups sided with the Protestants and <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> power of the Calvert family to govern the colony. Soon thereafter, the new leaders of the colony barred Catholics from holding office, bearing arms, or serving on juries.|$|E
5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie. When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality it was on the right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay {{remained}} largely similar to Press Your Luck, with contestants accumulating cash and prizes {{and attempting to}} avoid landing on a Whammy, who <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> winnings of any contestant who landed on it. At {{the start of the}} game, each of the three contestants was spotted $1,000 and took turns taking one spin at a time on the board. After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or prizes, and contestants chose to spin again or freeze with their score at that point. Landing on a Whammy in round one reduced that contestant's score to $0 and eliminated that contestant from further play in the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze or hit a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100–$1,500 in round one, and prizes of similar values also appeared.|$|E

The banks of the river were denuded, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river. After the Civil War, major floods swept down the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882. Such floods regularly overwhelmed levees damaged by Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those constructed after the war. In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for southern counties.|$|E

In 1932 after the state <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> entire harvest from the {{recently}} collectivised Butka peasants, the Yeltsin family moved as far away as they could, to Kazan, more than 1,100 kilometres from Butka, where Boris' father, Nikolai, found work on a construction site. Growing up in rural Sverdlovsk, he studied at the Ural State Technical University (now Urals Polytechnic Institute), and began his career in the construction industry. In 1934 Nikolai Yeltsin was convicted of anti-Soviet agitation and sentenced to hard labour in a gulag for three years.|$|E

Under Cottrell Nyaden participated {{in at least one}} and possibly two actions during the Anglo-Russian War. In June 1809 her boats, under the command of her senior lieutenant, A. Wells, participated in a night raid on Kildin Island that wiped out a Russian garrison. Boats from the Nyaden also captured some 22 or 23 coastal trading vessels in the Kola River, many upriver from the present city of Murmansk. The landing party <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> fort's guns or threw them into the Kola River.|$|E
25|$|Paris {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} wars of religion of the 16th century; {{a third of the}} Parisians fled, many houses were destroyed, and the grand projects of the Louvre, the Hôtel de Ville, and the Tuileries Palace were unfinished. Henry IV <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> independence of the city government and ruled Paris directly through royal officers. He relaunched the building projects and built a new wing of the Louvre along the Seine, the galerie du bord de l'eau, which connected the old Louvre with the new Tuileries Palace. The project of making the Louvre into a single great palace continued for the next three hundred years.|$|E

As a first step, the government <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> responsibility for {{water supply and sanitation}} from local governments and, for the areas outside the capital, transferred it to two state-owned Limited Liability Companies, Western Water and Eastern Water. In 2010 they were merged into one company, the United Water Supply Company of Georgia (UWSCG). Investments to improve the infrastructure in the services area of UWSCG were financed primarily by foreign donors through loans and grants implemented by the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia, while UWSCG is in charge of operating the water and sewer systems.|$|E
25|$|The St. Paul's Cathedral {{community}} is explicitly welcoming of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. The cathedral works actively for equality by hosting conferences and movie screenings. In 2005, St. Paul's held the funeral service for a gay Catholic man, John McCusker, who was denied a funeral by the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego. St. Paul's fields {{one of the}} biggest groups marching in the annual San Diego Gay Pride Parade, and in 2010 received the Stonewall Service Award from the San Diego Gay Pride organization. The cathedral was outspoken in opposition to California's ballot initiative Proposition 8 in 2008, which <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> right of same-sex couples to marry. After the passage of Proposition 8, St. Paul's held an ecumenical healing service so that LGBT people and their allies could grieve together.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April 1916, a {{decision}} was made by the German admiralty to halt indiscriminate attacks by submarine on merchant shipping. This followed protests from neutral countries, notably the United States, that their nationals had been the victims of attacks. Germany agreed that future attacks would only take place in accord with internationally agreed prize rules, which required an attacker to give a warning and allow the crews of vessels time to escape, and not to attack neutral vessels at all. Scheer believed {{that it would not be}} possible to continue attacks on these terms, which <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> advantage of secret approach by submarines and left them vulnerable to even relatively small guns on the target ships. Instead, he set about deploying the submarine fleet against military vessels.|$|E

25|$|Ori and Sein {{come across}} two beings in their quest: Gumo, the last {{survivor}} of the spider-like Gumon clan and whose home supports the Wind element; and Kuro, a giant owl who is hostile toward Ori. Her hostility and the forest's cataclysm are explained in flashbacks. When Ori was lost, the Spirit Tree released {{a flash of light}} to look for them, which killed all of Kuro's recently hatched offspring. To prevent this from happening to her yet unborn child, Kuro <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> core on top of the Spirit Tree, which is actually Sein. Without the Spirit Tree's support, the three elements cannot be sustained, and Nibel lost its balance. As the element of Wind is rekindled, Gumo, realizing what Ori and Sein intend to do, uses his clan treasure that stores the light from the Spirit Tree to revive Naru, and takes her to where Ori is.|$|E
25|$|The power {{struggle}} between the empress Maria Theresa and Jesuits escalated in 1765. Until then, the position of University's Rector Magnificus was automatically {{in the hands of}} the rector of the Jesuit order. Firstly, the Empress <b>took</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> Jesuit's monopoly over the position by imposing that the Rector Magnificus was to be elected by academia. As a theologian was elected Rector Magnificus in 1765, the empress assumed the power and appointed her own favourite, secular professor of law Johann Heinrich Bösenselle, as the head of university in 1766. Meanwhile, the Empress decided to fortify the town heavily, in line with contemporary practice and reflecting the increased military threat from Prussia. The consequence of constraining the city within its upgraded fortifications was that scope for commercial development became very restricted. Olomouc's experience was in stark contrast with that of Brno to the south, which was further away from the Silesian war zones, and which became the centre of the Moravian Industrial Revolution.|$|E
