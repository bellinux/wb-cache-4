A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.

25|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement. The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and <b>temperature</b> <b>measurements</b> in Celsius or Fahrenheit), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.|$|E

The claim that ZETA had produced fusion had to be publicly withdrawn, an embarrassing event that cast a chill over the entire fusion establishment.

When using the pulsed ruby laser this was unreliable due to the short pulse.

It was with the first use of YAG lasers that Bassett used an optical pyrometer to measure temperatures {{in the range of}} 1000°C to 1600°C. The first <b>temperature</b> <b>measurements</b> had a standard deviation of 30°C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50°C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200°C higher than that of the brightness measurement.

The energy of the emitted radiation could be compared to known black body radiation spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by resistive heating.|$|E
