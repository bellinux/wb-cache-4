500|$|The {{role was}} the most {{difficult}} to cast, and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese, noting [...] "Who would you rather make the argument [...] for mankind than John Cleese?" [...] Stoff, a producer, had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect. The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him, and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age. He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns. Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters. Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard: [...] "The trouble is, I {{had to be able to}} write the equation, because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years. I learned to carefully copy things down that mean nothing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> In A Fish Called Wanda, I spoke a lot of Russian without having any idea what it means." ...|$|E

I wanted Christian to leave his signature on this album simply because I love his stuff, {{and he has a}} similar story to ours. He's not at home in his own genre. That [...] "harsh" [...] noise stuff does not appeal <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> It lacks the fingerspitzengefühl that turn songs like Christian's [...] "Chateau Rouge" [...] or [...] "A Year in a Minute" [...] into something special. He makes white noise sound like sunlight dappling in the Mediterranean.” ...|$|E

60|$|As for the Democratic journals, {{they are}} not human enough <b>to</b> affect <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> I do not feel indignation at {{anything}} they may say.|$|R
60|$|If she's made up {{her mind}} <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> costs she might have saved herself the trouble of ringing up to find out if it was convenient.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--a little. She was {{kindness}} itself <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> events, {{then and}} afterwards. That was {{the charm of}} the weeks at Malvern." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let me tell my story, father, {{and then}} you shall judge. Before you had spoken <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> Marie had given me her troth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do what I can for you," [...] said Mr. Stokes, [...] "but I don't s'pose your missis'll come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> She saw you plain enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] she continued, still {{watching}} {{him in a}} puzzled fashion, [...] "you made that extraordinary voyage through the air to catch this steamer. That doesn't seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>at</b> <b>all</b> {{the sort of thing}} a nervous person would do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, some of {{the papers}} do. It does not seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>at</b> <b>all</b> probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was {{not the sort of}} man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was his chief defect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It feels awful rum <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> first, <b>all</b> this," [...] said Kipps [...] "'Aving a 'ouse {{of my own}} and all that. It's strange, you know. 'Aving all day. Reely I don't 'ardly {{know what}} to do with my time.|$|R
6000|$|... "THAT Sister," [...] said Susan, as {{they drove}} away, [...] "does not seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the person to have the charge of Henry's poor little girl!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, if {{you call}} me cruel I will not allow you to come and talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Cruel indeed! What is your idea of cruelty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't trust {{too much}} to me, Marian. Remember, {{it will be a}} generous thing in Gerald if he attends <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> He is not obliged to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'God will guard her, I know,' said Malcolm; 'and oh! my own dear lord, I {{need not}} {{ask you to}} be the brother to my poor sister you have been <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>At</b> least <b>all</b> will be clear for her and Patie!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want it <b>to</b> help <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> What have I {{done that}} Lord Rufford can {{complain}} of? I have not abandoned Lord Rufford {{for the sake}} of Mr. Morton. Lord Rufford ought only to be too proud if he knew it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the little}} ould Frinchman he niver beginned <b>to</b> suspict <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> and disperate {{hard it was}} he made the love to her leddyship.

6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} {{importance}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> Mr. Spooner; and I won't {{hear anything}} about it. If all the parish belonged to you, it would not make any difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your idyll {{with that}} fellow Jolyon Forsyte is known <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> events. If you pursue it, {{understand}} that I will leave no stone unturned {{to make things}} unbearable for him. 'S. F.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well," [...] Pamela said, {{stirring}} her tea, [...] "but I cannot help asking once more why you come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all?</b> What have I {{to do with any}} proposition you may have to make?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't think that! I {{know what}} an effort {{it was to}} you <b>to</b> answer <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Yes, indeed! I wonder whether I may ask something. The sorrow you have just told me of {{is not the only}} one--is it? You have had other troubles?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I freely concede, as I {{continue}} my record, that <b>to</b> follow <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>at</b> this point, gave proof on Lady John's part of {{a faculty}} that should have prevented my thinking of her as inordinately backward.

60|$|Well, let me {{tell you}} how it first came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> to create an artistic {{movement}} in England, a movement to show the rich what beautiful things they might enjoy and the poor what beautiful things they might create.|$|E
6000|$|... "His words set me thinking, and for {{the first}} time it struck me that I didn't want the bird--that it was of no use <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> I was going down to spend the {{holidays}} with my young lady's people in Kent." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{he never}} {{mentioned}} the subject <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> nor has he spoken to me since that memorable night. To one of his colleagues he once said that no words in his vocabulary could possibly be adequate to express his feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come <b>to</b> consult <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all?</b> You tell <b>me</b> {{in the same breath}} that it is useless to {{investigate}} Sir Charles's death, and that you desire <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no, she did not," [...] I replied, feeling rather perplexed. [...] "But I {{am quite}} sure that, if she meant <b>to</b> trust <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> she meant <b>to</b> trust to my {{discretion}} {{in the whole}} matter; and--Jack Lumley," [...] I added, getting up and grasping my friend's hand, [...] "if I cannot trust you I can trust nobody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mrs. Buncomhearst {{to one of}} her friends, in {{describing}} how she had met him, [...] "I never saw a more striking man. Such power in his face! Mr. Boulder introduced him <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on the avenue, and he hardly seemed <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> simply scowled! I was never so favourably impressed with any man." ...|$|R
60|$|To his {{obviously}} preparatory {{question whether}} our Steward {{had spoken to}} me that day I said he hadn't. And what's more {{he would have had}} precious little encouragement if he had tried to. I didn't want the fellow to speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, I had {{forgotten}}. I {{had forgotten}} {{that the letter}} was written <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> I thought it was to Lily, and she had got to thinking so too. Well, then, I won't do anything about it." [...] He drew a breath of relief.|$|E
6000|$|... "His looks must be wonderfully expressive. He did {{not look}} it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> He simply told me, {{as one of the}} {{managers}} of the theatre, I was to let you have whatever money you wanted. And he did whisper to me,--may I tell you what he whispered?" ...|$|E
