When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not even think about that). Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner wrote it down, and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> why, giving it two weeks to respond if it had any objections.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći {{was not much}} different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, {{and to be able to}} communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E

50|$|Stage 3 Violent Performances: The subject {{continues}} {{to act out}} violently and {{they feel that they}} get inner confidence by acting like this and that in turn builds their self-esteem. With their actions being executed, they feel like they get a knack for it and they incorporate it into their daily activity. In this stage they feel most comfortable with what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> not feel like <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> anything wrong. The subject feels like they have gained celebrity status to what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>and</b> within this stage is the defining moment of whether or not they will continue to <b>do</b> what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|R

25|$|The U.S. UPN network {{presented}} two one-hour {{episodes of}} Iron Chef USA hosted by William Shatner around Christmas 2001. These shows were neither a critical nor popular success, {{perhaps because the}} show focused little on cookinga {{major part of the}} Japanese programme. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused to say what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>and</b> the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.|$|E

The English explained that trade had bought them to Turkey and were returning home to England. De Leyva then demanded to acknowledge their duty and obedience to the Spanish king but this was flatly refused by Wilkinson. After more demands were refused De Leyva then sent an ultimatum they would, 'either be sunk or be escorted into port' but he was rebuffed once more and the two fleets prepared for battle.|$|E

25|$|Howlers - A race of killers artificially {{created by}} Crayak and {{deployed}} as shock troopers against {{the inhabitants of}} various worlds. Seven of them were selected by Crayak to be pitted against the Animorphs and Erek the Chee in a contest between the Ellimist and Crayak concerning the fate of {{an offshoot of the}} Yeerk race who had found an alternative means of living. Jake eventually discovered that the Howlers were children, too young to understand what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> seeing it all as a game, and the Animorphs managed to infect their collective memory with a flashback of Jake and Cassie kissing. The Howlers were thus ruined as a soldier race.|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{presidency}} of Valdas Adamkus, Lithuania actively promoted democracy in the formerly Soviet Eastern European and Asian nations. President Adamkus, together with President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Javier Solana, Boris Gryzlov and Ján Kubiš, served as a mediator during Ukraine's political crisis, when two candidates in the 2004 presidential election, Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko, each claimed victory. President Adamkus recalled {{in an interview that}} [...] "when I asked what we could do to help, Kuchma said the friends of the Ukrainian people should drop whatever <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> come to Kiev immediately.". The next day international mediators met in Ukraine. The crisis was resolved after a new election was held.|$|E

Early in November 2010, Patrick Söderlund, Senior Vice President of EA Games Europe, said this of the collaboration: [...] "I {{think the most important}} thing, when you have two high-quality developers working together, for it to work, they need to have mutual respect.

2500|$|At {{the time}} the anthem was written, Mexico was still facing {{the effects of a}} bitter defeat in the Mexican-American War at the hands of [...] the United States. The country felt {{demoralized}} and also divided, due to the cession of more than half of its territory due to its defeat to the United States. According to historian Javier Garciadiego, who spoke at a 2004 ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of the anthem's adoption, the anthem disregards divisions and strife and encourages national unity. On that same date, Mexico City {{and other parts of the}} country stopped what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> performed a nationwide singing of the anthem. Individuals from other nations participated, mostly at diplomatic offices or at locations where a high concentration of Mexican expatriates are found.

40|$|Faculty {{members in}} {{planning}} schools operate with the inherent {{assumption that the}} education <b>they</b> <b>are</b> providing {{is essential to the}} adequate preparation of future planning professionals. Yet, public-sector positions continue to require a 'degree in planning or related field'. Many advertisements state that work experience will be accepted as a direct substitute for education. If there is not a widespread recognition of the value of a formal planning education as a prerequisite for practicing in the field, how can planning educators continue to justify what it <b>is</b> that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> teaching? This paper is focused on three related issues: (1) What should be the value of a formal planning education? (2) How can the actual value of a formal planning education in general, and more specifically of that education provided by individual planning schools, be assessed?

Luo Tong was very worried about this and his appetite decreased. His elder sister, who was widowed and had no children, was known for being very kind.

[...] His sister replied, [...] "You're right. Why do you suffer in silence and not tell me about this?"

"The {{photographs}} stretch our credulity, even numb {{our minds}} and senses to {{the full extent of}} the horror, but they must be examined if we are to understand how normal men and women could live with, participate in, and defend such atrocities, even reinterpret them so they would not see themselves or be perceived as less than civilized. The men and women who tortured, dismembered, and murdered in this fashion understood perfectly well what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> thought of themselves as perfectly normal human beings. Few had any ethical qualms about their actions. This was not the outburst of crazed men or uncontrolled barbarians but the triumph of a belief system that defined one people as less human than another. For the men and women who composed these mobs, as for those who remained silent and indifferent or who provided scholarly or scientific explanations, this was the highest idealism in the service of their race. One has only to view the self-satisfied expressions on their faces as they posed beneath black people hanging from a rope or next to the charred remains of a Negro who had been burned to death. What is most disturbing about these scenes is the discovery that the perpetrators of the crimes were ordinary people, not so different from ourselves – merchants, farmers, laborers, machine operators, teachers, doctors, lawyers, policemen, students; they were family men and women, good churchgoing folk who came to believe that keeping black people in their place was nothing less than pest control, a way of combating an epidemic or virus that if not checked would be detrimental to the health and security of the community." ...|$|E
