5|$|Well {{before the}} design was finalised, four ships were ordered in July 1943. Africa was {{originally}} ordered as an unnamed Audacious-class carrier, but {{the order was}} modified to a Malta-class ship on 12 July 1943. Malta, New Zealand and Gibraltar were all ordered three days later. New Zealand was originally ordered from Cammell Laird, but the contract was transferred to Harland and Wolff on 22 July 1944. The Admiralty ordered Vickers not to order any more material on 27 April 1944 and given that final drawings were never issued to the builders, {{it is unlikely that}} any of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> did more than preliminary work. None of the ships were ever laid down and all of them were cancelled before the end of 1945.|$|E
25|$|Sea urchins {{can also}} be {{infected}} by many parasites, be they internal or external. Pedicellaria are a good means of defense against ectoparasites, but not a panacea as some of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> feed on it. The hemal system ensures against endoparasites.|$|E

25|$|The last public {{hanging on}} the island {{happened}} in its courtyard. It has been visited by four U.S. presidents, and three of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> gave a speech from the City Hall's front balcony: Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt. George H. W. Bush visited, as well.|$|E
25|$|After {{seven weeks}} of {{evidence}} the judge instructed the jury, emphasising that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for {{a finding of}} guilt, and that if two individuals {{take part in a}} murder, the law considers them equally guilty regardless of which of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> did the deed.|$|E

25|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{was covered}} by a mixed division-sized unit called “Mackay Force” at Klidi Pass. Mackay Force’s failure to hold the German advance long enough meant that the Greek units {{did not have time}} to reach and organize their assigned positions—some of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> being cut off by the German advance and never reaching them.|$|E
25|$|For {{over half}} of the {{inhabitants}} of the province of Friesland, 55% (c. 354,000 people), West Frisian is the native language. In the central east, West Frisian speakers spill over the province border, with some 4,000–6,000 of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> living in the province of Groningen, in the triangular area of the villages Marum (West Frisian: Mearum), De Wilp (De Wylp), and Opende (De Grinzer Pein).|$|E
25|$|In 1966 Sagan was {{a member}} of the AdHoc Committee to Review Project Blue Book, the U.S.Air Force's UFO {{investigation}} project. The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the Condon Committee (1966–68), led by physicist Edward Condon, and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> were, did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security.|$|E

25|$|Americans {{generally}} {{viewed the}} Issei as a crude, ill-educated lot. Possible {{reasons for this}} may be the fact that most Japanese were forced to work in menial jobs in the U.S., such as farming. Since there were many immigrants working in the U.S., Americans were relatively predisposed to have a negative view toward the immigrants. In fact, most of the Issei were well-educated. Most of them were better educated than the general Japanese public, and also compared with the average American population back then. Sixty percent of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> completed middle school, and 21 percent were high school graduates.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} {{evidence for the}} construction of ancient galleys is fragmentary, particularly in pre-Roman times. Plans and schematics in the modern sense did not exist until the 17th century and nothing like them has survived from ancient times. How galleys were constructed has therefore been a matter of looking at circumstantial evidence in literature, art, coinage and monuments that include ships, some of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> in natural size. Since the war galleys floated even with a ruptured hull and virtually never had any ballast or heavy cargo that could sink them, not a single wreckage of one has so far been found. The only exception has been a partial wreckage of a small Punic liburnian from the Roman era, the Marsala Ship.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 9 November, Lord Eldon was {{anchored}} off the Needles, and almost home. A brig approached her in the dark and the fog; seeing her, the crew fled below deck as they feared she was an English naval vessel come to try and press <b>them.</b> <b>Actually,</b> the brig was a French privateer, and the lack of a deck crew made it easy for the privateer’s men to board. Captain Young heard unusual sounds, went on deck, and raised the alarm. The crew returned to the deck and killed five privateers. Young himself then with a single blow of his sword, beheaded one man who was at the helm, {{who turned out to be}} the privateer’s boatswain. In the confusion the privateer escaped.|$|E

25|$|After {{waking up}} back in the {{research}} station, however, the Doctor deduces that they haven't truly woken up – they are simply in a different layer of a multi-faceted dream and have been since the initial attack when they arrived. In reality, none of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> escaped it. The Doctor proves this by having the scientists individually read copies of the base's manual that each had been issued. They find that the first word of any chosen page is different for each of them, rather than identical as it should be. The Doctor further explains that the Dream Crabs could not stop their subconscious minds from fighting back, which manifested {{in the form of}} Santa Claus. Santa himself clarifies the entire situation to the group, and he aids them in waking up.|$|E
25|$|The First Cavalry Army's {{experience}} and elevation of its commanders {{to the top}} of the military significantly influenced development of Soviet war doctrine in the interwar period. Although the cavalry armies were disbanded after the Russian Civil War, Red Cavalry reached 14 divisions and 7 independent brigades in 1929 and peaked at 32 divisions and two brigades in 1938, although few of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> deployed to nominal strength. 1939 and 1940 were spent in massive reorganizations of the troops into mechanized and tank corps, their formation influenced by the Spanish Civil War and the Battle of France and their disbandment forced by the inability to properly supply and manage large formations. The role of cavalry was unexpectedly boosted by the setbacks suffered by mechanized forces in 1939 in Poland and in 1939–1940 in Finland.|$|E
25|$|The {{chronology}} of this era is particularly uncertain due to difficulties {{in our understanding}} of the text, our understanding of the material culture of the Early Dynastic period and a general lack of radiocarbon dates for sites in Iraq. Also, the multitude of city-states made for a confusing situation, as each had its own history. The Sumerian king list is one record of the political history of the period. It starts with mythological figures with improbably long reigns, but later rulers have been authenticated with archaeological evidence. The first of these is Enmebaragesi of Kish, c. 2600 BC, said by the king list to have subjected neighboring Elam. However, one complication of the Sumerian king list is that although dynasties are listed in sequential order, some of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> ruled at the same time over different areas.|$|E

25|$|Fifteen Italian police {{officers}} and doctors were sentenced to jail for brutally mistreating detainees at the Bolzaneto holding camp. However, none of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> served prison terms because the convictions and sentences were wiped out by a statute of limitations. Those found guilty, including the camp commander, Biagio Gugliotta, were given jail sentences ranging from five months to five years. However, none served any portion of their sentence. While the verdict {{did not lead to}} the punishment of the offenders, it did help victims claim compensation. Since torture is not present in Italy’s code, officers alleged to have tortured demonstrators have never been charged with torture. On April 7, 2015, the European Court of Human Rights condemned Italy for the violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights in the Cestaro v. Italy trial and found the Italian legislation against torture to be inadequate.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, Shindo, then {{living with}} his brother in Onomichi, was {{inspired}} by a film called Bangaku No Isshō to want to start a career in films. He saved money by working in a bicycle shop and in 1934, with a letter of introduction from his brother to a policeman in Kyoto, he set off for Kyoto. After a long wait he was able to get a job in the film developing department of Shinkō Kinema, which he joined because he was too short to join the lighting department. He was one of eleven workers in the developing department, but only three of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> worked, the others being members of the company baseball team. At this time he learned that films were based on scripts because old scripts were used as toilet paper. He would take the scripts home to study them. His job involved drying 200-foot lengths of film on a roller three metres long and two metres high, and he learned the relationship between the pieces of film he was drying and the scripts he read.|$|E
25|$|Most {{distress}} {{calls from}} the 131st went unanswered, as other army groups were either unprepared or, strangely, celebrating the New Year. The second and third battalions of the brigade responded to the call for help, but were blasted at close quarters before even reaching the station. Both battalions were ordered {{to stay away from}} the Presidential Palace; this only added more to the trouble as the armored columns tried cutting down alleyways, only to be further cut down. When a small element of the 503rd Motor Rifle Regiment finally received their orders to move in during the early hours of the day, they immediately came under friendly fire from the other Russian forces already bogged down under heavy fire; they fought each other for six hours (there were more such incidents reported, some of <b>them</b> <b>actually</b> prepared by the Chechens). The 8th Corps reached the city center from the north but was unable to save the units that had fallen into the trap because of stiff resistance. No reinforcements ever reached the railway station.|$|E
