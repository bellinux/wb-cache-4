Foram entrevistados <b>turistas</b> brasileiros visitando a cidade do Rio de Janeiro e cariocas saindo de viagem. Os depoimentos foram analisados segundo as dimensões de vulnerabilidade; informação; prevenção e assistência em saúde, das quais a vulnerabilidade emergiu como categoria de análise.

The means of transport determines the trajectory of tourists and their security alternatives. Traveling in groups and visiting tourist attractions are seen as protective factors, which reinforces the role of information and social support networks as resources used by tourists in the absence of specific policies geared to this highly mobile and vulnerable population group...|$|R
