In the 2007 state elections, Democrats regained {{control of the}} State Senate, and narrowed the Republican majority in the House of Delegates to eight seats. Yet elections in 2009 resulted in the election of Republican Bob McDonnell as Governor by a seventeen-point margin, {{the election of a}} Republican Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, as well as Republican gains of six seats in the House of Delegates. In 2011, the Republican caucus took over two-thirds (68–32) of the seats in the House of Delegates, and a majority of the Senate based on the Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling as the tie-breaker. Following the 2013 elections, Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected Governor by <b>two</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>points,</b> and Democrat Ralph Northam was elected Lieutenant Governor by double digits. Republicans, however, maintained their super-majority (68–32) in the House of Delegates. State election seasons traditionally start with the annual Shad Planking event in Wakefield.|$|E

30|$|For both EPZ and nonEPZ sectors, {{there is}} a small {{advantage}} of size – about a <b>two</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> lower risk of death per year relative to smaller firms in the same sector. However, the difference is only statistically significant for the nonEPZ sector. In addition, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of a uniform firm survival probability above and below the threshold in the EPZ sector. Therefore, survival probability does not change significantly by firm size in the EPZ, but small nonEPZ firms do face a higher probability of failure compared to other nonEPZ firms. However, the biggest and most significant differences in survival probability is the higher exit rate in nonEPZ relative to EPZ firms of equal initial size and vintage.|$|R

40|$|Using data {{on stock}} {{purchases}} individual investors made through a discount broker from 1991 to 1996, we study information diffusion effects {{the relation between}} household investment choices and those made by their neighbors.

Upon controlling for aggregate trading patterns, households' and neighbors' investment style preferences, and the industry composition of local firms, we attribute approximately one-third to one-half of the overall diffusion effect to word-of-mouth communication. Disentangling the overall diffusion effect suggests that the significant relation between our measures of information diffusion and subsequent industry-level returns appears to be driven by its word-of-mouth component. ...|$|R

40|$|What factors {{caused the}} {{persecution}} of minorities in medieval and early modern Europe? We build a model that predicts that minority communities {{were more likely to}} be expropriated in the wake of negative income shocks. We then use panel data consisting of 785 city-level expulsions of Jews from 933 European cities between 1100 and 1800 to test the implications of the model. We use the variation in city-level temperature to test whether expulsions were associated with colder growing seasons. We find that a one standard deviation decrease in average growing season temperature in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was associated with a one to <b>two</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in the likelihood that a Jewish community would be expelled. Drawing on our model and on additional historical evidence we argue that the rise of state capacity was one reason why this relationship between negative income shocks and expulsions weakened after 1600. ...|$|R

The 1991 budget, {{in which he}} seized the {{opportunity}} presented by Thatcher's resignation to restrict mortgage interest tax relief to the basic rate of income tax and also cut the rate of corporation tax by <b>two</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>points,</b> was greeted by positive coverage in The Economist which dubbed him a Nimble Novice. In the 1992 budget his proposal to advance to a 20% basic rate of income tax {{through a combination of}} a narrow initial band, a cut in tax on deposit interest and curtailment of tax allowances was hailed as an elegant way of combining populism with progressivism, though events were later to lend support to Nigel Lawson's view that this approach was strategically inept. His final budget in 1993 was more sympathetically received by financial specialists than John Major's 1990 budget or Kenneth Clarke's budget of November 1993. Lamont attributes the large public sector borrowing requirement (i.e. fiscal deficit) of these years to the depth of the recession triggered by his inability to cut interest rates sooner within the ERM.|$|E
25|$|For example, assume an {{investor}} {{had to choose}} between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, {{with a standard deviation of}} 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, {{an investor}} may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional <b>two</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to −10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).|$|E

Given that the Shorrocks index is expressed as an equal equivalent spell duration, these results mean that unemployment rates of 6 % and 8 % of are equivalent to respectively 14 % and 17 % of 132 months of unemployment of the entire labor force (of males and females, respectively) in terms of the welfare loss involved. The gender gap in unemployment according to this unemployment index is 0.03 (21 %) compared to a gap of 0.02 (33 %) for the unemployment rate.

He also uses the data to add additional levels of differencing that strengthen identification, such as subtracting out differences between disabled and non-disabled non-veterans that would meet the unemployment criterion, or disabled and non-disabled veterans who {{do not meet the}} discharge or unemployment criteria. The evidence points roughly to a <b>two</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> relative increase in employment for disabled veterans who were eligible for the credit.

40|$|In recent years, as {{longer time}} series of {{cross-sectional}} household surveys have become available, {{it has become}} possible {{to look at the}} consumption and saving behavior of birth cohorts in a number of developing and developed economies. The cohort evidence is singularly appropriate for the analysis of life-cycle models of consumption because, at least in its simpler forms, the life-cycle hypothesis (LCH) predicts that the cohort average of the logarithm of consumption in any year can be additively decomposed into a time-invariant cohort effect and an age effect, both of which can be readily recovered from the cohort data by linear regression on dummy variables. The results of these cohort level analyses have not been favorable for the LCH interpretation of the international correlation between growth and saving. According to this, higher rates of economic growth drive up rates of national saving by expanding the lifetime resources of younger generations, who are saving, relative to the lifetime resources of older generations, who are dissaving. While it is typically possible to interpret the cohort results {{in a way that is}} consistent with the LCH, it is a good deal harder to rescue the prediction that higher growth means higher national saving rates, or at least that the effect is large enough to be consistent with the international relationship in which a one <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in the rate of per capita growth is associated with a roughly <b>two</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in the saving rate. In Section 1, we review existing cohort studies from a range of rich and poor countries, and also present new results for Indonesia. This evidence shows no strong negative relationship between saving rates and age, so that when higher growth redistributes lifetime resources towards the young, the effect on savings is modest, and in some cases even negative. ...|$|R
