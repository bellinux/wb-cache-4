40|$|We {{will discuss}} <b>tangle</b> decompositions of tunnel number one links, {{and show that}} any <b>tangle</b> {{composite}} tunnel number one link can be obtained as the union of a quasi Hopf <b>tangle</b> and a trivial <b>tangle.</b> We also consider the uniqueness of <b>tangle</b> decompositions of such links, and show that there are innitely many tunnel number one links that admit non-isotopic essential <b>tangle</b> decompositions...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} real <b>tangle</b> and its operations, as a {{generalization of}} rational <b>tangle</b> and its operations, to enumerating <b>tangles</b> {{by using the}} calculus of continued fraction and moreover we study the analytical structure of <b>tangles,</b> knots, and links by using new operations between real <b>tangles</b> which need not have the topological structure. As applications of the analytical structure, we prove the generalized Hyers-Ulam stability of the Cauchy additive functional equation fx⊕y=fx⊕fy in <b>tangle</b> space which {{is a set of}} real <b>tangles</b> with analytic structure and describe the DNA recombination as the action of some enzymes on <b>tangle</b> space...|$|R

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on September 13, 1910. The film had a wide release, with theater advertisements known in Kansas, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. Some later advertisements for the film may have been referring to the Kalem Company's <b>Tangled</b> Lives released in May 1911. The Kalem film is extant. Rare typographical errors also resulted in the Reliance Film Company having a film of this name in some advertisements, {{but this is an}} error on <b>Tangled</b> Lines. The film was released in Britain on December 22, 1910.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that there are 21 ribbon knots with 10 {{crossings}} or fewer. We show that for every ribbon knot, there exists a <b>tangle</b> that satisfies two properties associated with the knot. First, under a specific closure, the closed <b>tangle</b> is equivalent to its corresponding knot. Second, under a different closure, the closed <b>tangle</b> {{is equivalent to the}} unlink. For each of these 21 ribbon knots, we present a 4 -strand <b>tangle</b> that satisfies these properties. We provide diagrams of these <b>tangles</b> and also express them in planar diagram notation.

5|$|Leaf {{morphology}} is {{also very}} diverse in this large genus. Some leaves are very thin, almost needle-like (S. affine), while others are short, stubby, and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme). Another group of species, such as S. scandens (climbing triggerplant) form scrambling, <b>tangled</b> mats typically propped up on aerial roots.|$|E

Realising the attempt was now a danger to himself and the balloon, L'Estrange set out the grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring the balloon down. However the ropes had become <b>tangled</b> and the hooks were too short.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lieutenant Colonel Eyre's {{force of}} 800 men {{landed on the}} east side of the Thames River, but they were slowed by <b>tangled</b> {{woodlands}} and swamplands. The New Jersey Loyalists landed after the initial wave of regulars, also delayed by the difficulty in moving the artillery through rough conditions, and they did not participate in the assault.|$|E
40|$|This paper gives two new {{combinatorial}} topological proofs of {{the classification}} of rational <b>tangles.</b> Each proof rests on an elegant lemma showing that rational <b>tangles</b> are isotopic to canonical alternating rational <b>tangles.</b> The first proof defines the <b>tangle</b> fraction from the canonical form and uses flyping to prove invariance. The second proof defines the fraction of a rational <b>tangle</b> via integral coloring of the <b>tangle.</b> The coloring method is then used to prove the Kauffman-Harary coloring conjecture for alternating knots and links {{in the case of}} rational knots and links (closures of rational <b>tangles).</b> This paper forms the basis for a sequel on {{the classification of}} rational knots and links.

40|$|A <b>tangle</b> {{is a pair}} (B, T), where B is a 3 -ball, T {{is a pair of}} {{properly}} embedded arcs. When {{there is}} no ambiguity we will simply say that T is a <b>tangle.</b> Let E(T) = B − IntN(T) be the exterior of T, usually called the <b>tangle</b> space. T is simple if E(T) is a simple manifold, that is, it is irreducible, ∂-irreducible, atoroidal, and anannular. By Thurston’s geometrization theorem, simple <b>tangle</b> spaces admit hyperbolic structures with totally geodesic boundary. When embedding the <b>tangle</b> space into S 3 in the natural way, the complement is a handlebody of genus two. Hence, detecting simple <b>tangles</b> is the same as detecting embedded genus two handlebodies with simple complement. In general, {{it is difficult to determine}} if a <b>tangle</b> is simple. The first simple <b>tangle</b> (see Figure 1. 5 (a)) was suggested by Jaco [7, P 194], and was verified by Myers [8] with a rather lengthy argument. Due to the nature of the problem, such kind of argument seems unavoidable before a general theory of detecting simple <b>tangles</b> is developed. A similar <b>tangle</b> is the one in Figure 1. 5 (b), which was proved simple by Ruberman [10]. Another simple <b>tangle</b> is the one in Figure 1. 6. Its <b>tangle</b> space was called the tripos manifold, and was proved to be hyperbolic by Thurston [12, Chapter 3]. These have been used by Adam...|$|R

5|$|Members of {{the family}} Theridiidae weave irregular, <b>tangled,</b> {{three-dimensional}} webs, popularly known as cobwebs. There {{seems to be an}} evolutionary trend towards a reduction in the amount of sticky silk used, leading to its total absence in some species. The construction of cobwebs is less stereotyped than that of orb-webs, and may take several days.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{also have}} an {{excellent}} sense of touch. The octopus's suction cups are equipped with chemoreceptors so the octopus can taste what it touches. Octopus arms do not become <b>tangled</b> or stuck to each other because the sensors recognise octopus skin and prevent self-attachment.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming <b>tangled</b> in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became <b>tangled</b> again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the recall.|$|E
50|$|The key {{technical}} value of <b>tangles</b> and string links {{is that they}} have algebraic structure. Isotopy classes of <b>tangles</b> form a tensor category, where for the category structure, one can compose two <b>tangles</b> if the bottom end of one equals the top end of the other (so the boundaries can be stitched together), by stacking them - they do not literally form a category (pointwise) because there is no identity, since even a trivial <b>tangle</b> takes up vertical space, but up to isotopy they do. The tensor structure is given by juxtaposition of <b>tangles</b> - putting one <b>tangle</b> {{to the right of the}} other.|$|R

5000|$|In Conway notation, the <b>tangles</b> are {{generally}} algebraic 2-tangles. This means their <b>tangle</b> diagrams consist of 2 arcs and 4 {{points on the}} edge of the diagram; furthermore, they are built up from rational <b>tangles</b> using the Conway operations.|$|R

5|$|A nucleus {{typically}} contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2µm and 2.0µm {{depending on}} the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of <b>tangled</b> thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs {{are involved in a}} number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>tangle,</b> a, is {{reflected}} on the NW-SE line, it is denoted by −a. (Note that this is different from a <b>tangle</b> with a negative number of crossings.)Tangles have three binary operations, sum, product, and ramification, however all can be explained using <b>tangle</b> addition and negation. The <b>tangle</b> product, a b, is equivalent to −a+b. and ramification or a,b, is equivalent to −a+−b.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The antihyperlipidemic and {{antioxidant}} {{activities of}} dietary supplementation of sea <b>tangle</b> from Goseong and the alginate-free residue of sea <b>tangle</b> were investigated in Sprague Dawley rats {{treated with a}} high-fat diet, streptozotocin, poloxamer 407, and bromobenzene. The alginate-free residue of Goseong sea <b>tangle</b> induced {{a significant reduction in}} triglycerides and total cholesterol levels, as well as a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Alginate-free Goseong sea <b>tangle</b> residue reduced the activities of the phase I enzymes aminopyrine N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase, which had been increased by intraperitoneal injection of bromobenzene. Pretreatment with Goseong sea <b>tangle</b> residue prevented a bromobenzene-induced decrease in epoxide hydrolase activity. Bromobenzene reduced hepatic glutathione content and increased hepatic lipid peroxide levels. Pretreatment with alginate-free Goseong sea <b>tangle</b> residue prevented lipid peroxidation induced by bromobenzene, but pretreatment with Goseong sea <b>tangle</b> did not. These results suggest that Goseong sea <b>tangle</b> residue exerted antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant activities that were higher than those induced by alginate-containing sea <b>tangle.</b> Therefore, the alginate-free residue may contain physiologically unknown active components, other than alginic acid, which may potentially be used to prevent hyperlipidemic atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} topological objects in the 3 -sphere S^ 3 which will be called n-punctured ball <b>tangles.</b> Using the Kauffman bracket at A=e^i π/ 4, an invariant for a special type of n-punctured ball <b>tangles</b> is defined. The invariant F^n takes values in PM_ 2 × 2 ^n(Z), that is the set of 2 × 2 ^n matrices over Z modulo the scalar multiplication of ± 1. This invariant leads to a generalization of a theorem of D. Krebes which gives {{a necessary condition for}} a given collection of <b>tangles</b> to be embedded in a link in S^ 3 disjointly. Furthermore, we provide the general formula to compute the invariant of the k_ 1 + [...] . + k_n-punctured ball <b>tangle</b> determined by n,k_ 1, [...] .,k_n-punctured ball <b>tangles,</b> respectively. Also, we consider various connect sums among punctured ball <b>tangles</b> and provide the formulas to compute their invariants. We also address {{the question of whether the}} invariant F^n is surjective onto PM_ 2 × 2 ^n(Z). We will show that the invariant F^n is surjective when n= 0. When n= 1, n-punctured ball <b>tangles</b> will be also called spherical <b>tangles.</b> We show that det F^ 1 (S) ≡ 0 or 1 mod 4 for every spherical <b>tangle</b> S. Thus, F^n is not surjective when n= 1. In addition, we introduce monoid structures on the class of 0 -punctured ball <b>tangles</b> and the class of spherical <b>tangles</b> and show that the group generated by the elementary operations on PM_ 2 × 2 (Z) induced by those on the spherical <b>tangles</b> is isomorphic to a Coxeter group.
