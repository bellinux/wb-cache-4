25|$|An {{elaborate}} fourteen-day {{period of}} mourning followed the cremation, {{during which the}} family performed various symbolic acts around the pyre and were regarded to be highly polluted in ritual terms, thus necessitating not only that they took regular baths but also that any other Nair who might <b>touch</b> <b>them</b> must also take a bath. The period {{was followed by a}} feast and by participation in sports events, which also involved Nairs from nearby villages. Subsequently, the family stayed in mourning while one male member undertook a diksha, during which time he had to maintain a pure life. This involved him living with a Brahmin, bathing twice daily and desisting from cutting either his hair or his fingernails, as well as being prevented from speaking with or indeed even seeing women. In some cases the diksha might last for a year rather than the more usual forty-one days, in which case there would be considerable celebration at its end.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Carrington takes the Doctor {{to meet the}} astronauts a {{criminal}} named Reegan has organised their abduction, killing the soldiers and scientists guarding them. When the Doctor and Liz examine the site, they realise that human tissue could not have withstood the degree of radiation being emitted by the mysteriously irradiated astronauts. The Doctor believes the real astronauts are still in orbit, and that the three space suits contain alien beings. Reegan engineers the kidnapping of Liz Shaw to aid his own scientist, Lennox, a disgraced Cambridge professor, in keeping the alien astronauts alive. Reegan has even been supplied with a device {{to communicate with the}} aliens, and sends them to the Space Centre to kill Quinlan. It now becomes clear to UNIT that the aliens are emitting radiation like walking reactors, and that to <b>touch</b> <b>them</b> brings instant death. It is also evident, to Liz, that Reegan is taking orders from someone else. She helps Lennox escape, and he tries to reach the Brigadier, but his bid for freedom is cut short by Reegan’s merciless revenge.|$|E
25|$|Both of the lovers' fates are {{interwoven}} {{yet they}} deceive {{the other in}} a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely {{what is going on in}} the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was a small price to pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could <b>touch</b> <b>them</b> were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E

[...] "I just want to be known as a clown", he said, [...] "because to me that's the height of my profession. It means you can do everything—sing, dance and above all, make people laugh."

500|$|The rating {{may affect}} the {{proposed}} merger of OCX with the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX), which succeeded the Orlando Orange County Expressway Authority (OOCEA) in 2014. The state legislature has considered merging the two agencies to form a regional expressway authority that would also include Lake and Seminole Counties. In early 2014, prior {{to the creation of}} the CFX, OOCEA bonds had identical [...] "A"/"A2" [...] (from Fitch/Moody's) credit ratings and there was concern that the poorly-rated OCX bonds would impact the finances of a combined agency and OOCEA bondholders. The OOCEA's chairman Walter Ketcham remarked that the OCX bonds were so poorly rated [...] "we wouldn't <b>touch</b> <b>them</b> with gloves". In September 2016, CFX agreed to study future road projects in Osceola County, in order to determine which are viable for financing and construction, on behalf of OCX for an 18-month period. Legislation passed by the Florida legislature in 2014 envisions the CFX and OCX merging by 2018 and the agreement is a step towards that plan.|$|E

[...] Johnson spoke positively about [...] "Mama Don't Forget to Pray for Me", which was written and originally recorded by Larry Cordle, and the impact that it had on fans.

[...] Some of his stylistic markers include slash chords, key modulations, [...] "stepwise falloffs", the use of minor seventh chords drawn from Burt Bacharach, piano triads [...] "hammered" [...] in eighths, and a tendency for his harmonic progressions to wander far from the tonal center. Musicologist Daniel Harrison notes that [...] "even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone." [...] Lyrics were usually written by an outside collaborator after the melody and chord patterns were established.|$|E
