5|$|Beadle's de jure {{recognition}} of the post-UDI government in 1968 outraged the Wilson administration and drew accusations from <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister and others that he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; he was almost removed from the Privy Council, but kept his place following Wilson's electoral defeat soon after. Beadle retired in 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences. He died in Johannesburg on 14 December 1980, aged 75.|$|E

The city established its own university in 1900.|$|E
5|$|From Russia, with Love {{received}} broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister Anthony Eden to Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in Life, which listed From Russia, with Love as one of US President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the second film in the Bond series, starring Sean Connery.|$|E

5|$|In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway {{to protect}} {{shipments}} of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies {{were attempting to}} cut off by unilaterally mining neutral Norwegian waters. Denmark capitulated after a few hours, and despite Allied support, during which the important harbour of Narvik temporarily was recaptured from the Germans, Norway was conquered within two months. British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the replacement of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister, Neville Chamberlain, with Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.|$|E

The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Airborne Division was an {{airborne}} {{infantry division}} of the British Army during the Second World War.

5|$|The Calais migrant crisis led to {{escalating}} {{tension between}} the UK and France {{in the summer of}} 2015. The UK blamed France for not doing enough to stop migrants from entering the tunnel or making attempts to scale fences built along the border. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister David Cameron released a statement saying that illegal immigrants would be removed from the UK even if they reached the island. To discourage migrants and refugees from jumping on train shuttles at Calais, the UK government supplied fencing to be installed in the Eurotunnel where the vehicles are loaded onto train shuttles in Calais.|$|E

The strike was called off after ten prisoners had starved themselves to death—including Sands, whose funeral was attended by an estimated 100,000people. The strike radicalised Irish nationalist politics, and was the driving force that enabled Sinn Féin to become a mainstream political party.|$|E
