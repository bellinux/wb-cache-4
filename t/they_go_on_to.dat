5|$|To {{ensure that}} the game goes ahead, glee club members Rachel (Lea Michele), Mercedes (Amber Riley), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Lauren (Ashley Fink) join the {{football}} team. The game begins badly for the McKinley side, and when Tina is injured during a play, captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) takes control of the situation. He has club member Puck (Mark Salling) convince the former football players to return, and convinces cheerleaders Santana (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris) and his ex-girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron) to quit the cheer squad and perform at the halftime show. Only Karofsky refuses to participate, but {{when he sees the}} positive reaction the crowd has to the routine, he joins in himself. Beiste welcomes the football players back, and <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> win the game by intimidating the opposing side, dressed as zombies from the halftime routine.|$|E

Defeat to the West Indies dented the team's confidence, and <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> lose to India 2–0. In 1986 Mickey Stewert was appointed the first full-time England coach. England beat New Zealand, {{but there was little}} hope of them retaining the Ashes in 1986/87.

25|$|Recent {{research}} into ectomycorrhizal plants in boreal forests {{has indicated that}} mycorrhizal fungi and plants have a relationship {{that may be more}} complex than simply mutualistic. This relationship was noted when mycorrhizal fungi were unexpectedly found to be hoarding nitrogen from plant roots in times of nitrogen scarcity. Researchers argue that some mycorrhizae distribute nutrients based upon the environment with surrounding plants and other mycorrhizae. <b>They</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> explain how this updated model could explain why mycorrhizae do not alleviate plant nitrogen limitation, and why plants can switch abruptly from a mixed strategy with both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots to a purely mycorrhizal strategy as soil nitrogen availability declines.|$|E

Socrates tells a brief legend, {{critically}} commenting on the gift of writing from the Egyptian god Theuth to King Thamus, who was to disperse Theuth's gifts to the people of Egypt. After Theuth remarks on his discovery of writing as a remedy for the memory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, he says, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with.|$|E
25|$|Further {{evidence}} supporting {{the importance of}} these texts discussing hells lies in Buddhists' further investigation of the nature of hell and its denizens. Buddhavarman's fifth century Chinese translation of the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra (Ch. āpídámó pípóshā lùn 阿毘曇毘婆沙論) questions whether hell wardens who torture hell beings are themselves sentient beings, what form they take, and what language they speak. Xuanzang's 玄奘 seventh century Chinese translation of the Abhidharmakośa śāstra (Ch. āpídámó jùshè lùn 阿毘達磨倶舍論) too is concerned with whether hell wardens are sentient beings, as well as how <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> receive karmic retribution, whether they create bad karma at all, and why are they not physically affected and burned by the fires of hell.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} courses {{leading to the}} Staatsexamen (state examination). These did usually not {{transition}} to bachelor's and master's degrees. For future doctors, dentists, veterinarians, pharmacists, and lawyers, the Staatsexamen is required {{to be allowed to}} work in their profession. For teachers, judges, and public prosecutors, it is the required degree for working in civil service. Students usually study at university for 4–8 years before they take the First Staatsexamen. Afterwards, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> work in their future jobs for one or two years (depending on subject and state), before they are able to take the Second Staatsexamen, which tests their practical abilities. While it is not an academic degree formally, the First Staatsexamen is equivalent to a master's degree and qualifies for doctoral studies. On request, some universities bestow an additional academic degree (e.g., Diplom-Jurist or Magister iuris) on students who have passed First Staatsexamen.|$|E

25|$|Bart Ehrman, Robert Eisenman {{and others}} {{critical}} of traditional Christian views, {{in assessing the}} problems involved in conducting historical Jesus research, say the Gospels are full of discrepancies, were written decades after Jesus' death, by authors who had not witnessed any events in Jesus' life. <b>They</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> say the Gospels were authored not by eyewitnesses who were contemporary with the events that they narrate but rather by {{people who did not}} know Jesus, see anything he did, or hear anything he taught, and that the authors did not even share a language with Jesus. The accounts they produced are not disinterested; they are narratives produced by Christians who actually believed in Jesus, and were not immune from slanting the stories in light of their biases. Ehrman points out that the texts are widely inconsistent, full of discrepancies and contradictions in both details and larger portraits of who Jesus was.|$|E

And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about churning out our records like motorcars —that sense of industrial.
