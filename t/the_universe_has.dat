5|$|The Universe is {{composed}} almost completely of dark energy, dark matter, and ordinary matter. Other contents are electromagnetic radiation (estimated {{to be from}} 0.005% to close to 0.01%) and antimatter.

5|$|Third, the {{curvature}} index k determines {{the sign of}} the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, {{the curvature}} is positive and <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was long}} {{believed}} that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang, recent observations of the redshift-distance relationship using Type Ia supernovae have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> begun to accelerate.|$|E

25|$|In medieval philosophy, {{there was}} much debate over whether <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>had</b> a finite or {{infinite}} past (see Temporal finitism). The philosophy of Aristotle held that <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>had</b> an infinite past, which caused problems for medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophers who were unable to reconcile the Aristotelian conception of the eternal with the Abrahamic view of creation. As a result, a variety of logical arguments for <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>having</b> a finite past were developed by John Philoponus, Al-Kindi, Saadia Gaon, Al-Ghazali and Immanuel Kant, among others.|$|R

5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E

5|$|If the {{large-scale}} universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle {{can be derived}} from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB. <b>The</b> <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.|$|E
5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} {{to be very}} nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy {{throughout most of the}} Universe. Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology, in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|The initial hot, dense {{state is}} called the Planck epoch, a brief period {{extending}} from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, where gravitation {{is believed to have}} been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> been expanding to its present form, possibly with a very brief period of cosmic inflation which caused the Universe to reach a much larger size in less than 10−32 seconds.|$|E

50|$|The {{religious}} practises of Ayyavazhi largely {{differ from}} traditional Hinduism. Akilam says that previous practices were not wrong, {{but that they}} were distorted because of the abnormal, cruel nature of Kaliyan and his boons, which <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>had</b> experienced before. Akilattirattu Ammanai says that the whole acts and rules of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>had</b> changed by <b>the</b> advent of Kaliyan. Thiru Nadana Ula, a part of Akilam eight discusses this change in detail.|$|R
5|$|The more matter {{there is}} in the Universe, the {{stronger}} the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass density of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, the fact that <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), {{the density of the}} universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that {{when the universe was}} young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.|$|E

5|$|This {{cosmology}} {{was accepted}} by Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens and later scientists. Edmund Halley (1720) and Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux (1744) noted independently that the assumption of an infinite space filled uniformly with stars {{would lead to the}} prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the Sun itself; this became known as Olbers' paradox in the 19th century. Newton believed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities causing the matter to be crushed inwards under its own gravity. This instability was clarified in 1902 by the Jeans instability criterion. One solution to these paradoxes is the Charlier Universe, in which the matter is arranged hierarchically (systems of orbiting bodies that are themselves orbiting in a larger system, ad infinitum) in a fractal way such that <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> a negligibly small overall density; such a cosmological model had also been proposed earlier in 1761 by Johann Heinrich Lambert.
