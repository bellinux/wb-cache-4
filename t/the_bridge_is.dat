50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{owned by}} <b>the</b> county, and in 2005 when the {{contracts}} were let {{to clean the}} Big Monon Ditch <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> in <b>the</b> way of the dredging equipment. The commissioners discussed demolishing <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> and it <b>was</b> decided that removal of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> necessary.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> also bedecked with 28 flagpoles, usually {{flying the}} flags of the United States, Illinois and Chicago. On special {{occasions}} other banners may be displayed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> tolled for {{eastbound}} travel, with {{a discount}} available via an electronic payment scheme.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} by a wealthy merchant named Müslihidddin in 1442 {{during the reign}} of Murat II of the Ottoman Empire. Its architect was probably Architect Timurtaş. During the 1855 Bursa earthquake <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> partially damaged. During the Turkish War of Independence Bursa was occupied by the Greece. In 1922, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> bombed by <b>the</b> retreating Greek army. It was closed to traffic. In 1949 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> reconstructed by <b>the</b> municipality albeit with minor modifications. After 2004, following another restoration <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> opened to traffic.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Parsons Brinckerhoff in 1995. It {{was built in}} 1998 replacing the old Main Street <b>Bridge</b> that <b>was</b> built in 1923. In September 2012, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> closed for repairs because of rust problems. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> reopened in November 2012.|$|R
5|$|The shops on {{the north}} side have {{cantilevered}} rear extensions. Consequently, the northern external façade of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> asymmetrical, much altered and of no architectural merit, whereas the southern external side clearly shows the hand of Robert Adam.|$|E
5|$|Beyond <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> Bodiam railway station, {{the western}} {{terminus}} of the Kent and East Sussex Railway since 2000. On the north {{bank of the}} river is Bodiam Castle, built soon after 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge. Lord Curzon restored the ruins in 1919 and gave them to the National Trust six years later. The buildings are grade I listed, and the landscaped grounds, which include a millpond and a Second World War pillbox, are a scheduled ancient monument.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{begins in}} 1566, {{and five years}} later <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> completed, {{together}} with a caravanserai (or han). The bridge replaces the unreliable ferry transport that was once {{the only means of}} traversing the river and comes to represent an important link between the Bosnia Eyalet {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman Empire. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> built by serfs, who intermittently stage strikes and sabotage the construction site in protest against the poor working conditions. The Ottomans respond harshly, impaling the one caught saboteur. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> wider across the middle portion, known as the gate (or kapija), and this section becomes a popular meeting place. Every important moment in the lives of the local residents comes to revolve around the bridge, with Christian children crossing it to be baptized on the opposite bank, and children of all religions playing around it. As time progresses, legends develop around the history of the bridge. The locals tell of two Christian infants who were buried alive inside the bridge to placate the fairies (vile) that thwart its construction. They come to regard two holes on the side of the bridge as places where the infants' mothers would come to suckle them while they were entombed. About a century later, the Habsburg Monarchy reclaims much of Central Europe and the northern Balkans from the Ottomans, triggering a crisis within the empire. Due to lack of state funds, the caravanserai is abandoned and falls into disuse. The bridge, on the other hand, stands for centuries without maintenance because of how well it was constructed. The residents of Višegrad—Turks, Serbs, Sephardic Jews, and Roma—stand in solidarity with one another during the Drina's regular floods.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{badly damaged}} by the {{collision}} of a river barge in 1870. Although part of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> subsequently replaced, soon <b>the</b> entire <b>bridge</b> would <b>be</b> demolished.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> new <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by architects Vasily Stasov, Domenico Adamini, and engineer E.A. Adam. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> opened on 24 October 1840. The first user of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> Nicholas I himself, who solemnly crossed <b>the</b> new <b>bridge</b> in his horse-drawn coach. The main decoration of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>are</b> beautiful cast iron railings, with numerous frills, the main repeating elements being fan-like palmettos.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2006 {{one third}} of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} and <b>the</b> first train was initially expected to run through <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in <b>the</b> second half of 2007. However, in spring of 2007, cracks <b>were</b> discovered in <b>the</b> <b>bridge's</b> structure, delaying its construction. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> opening <b>was</b> then scheduled for March 2008. On May 7, 2010 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> tested with first electrified train traffic. On September 27, 2010 the railroad segment of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> officially opened; on March 31, 2011, road traffic opened. As of the last government notice, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> expected to be fully completed in 2012.|$|R
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> {{built on}} a gravel bed covered by {{shifting}} sand. The north end by the swing bridge section is next to the rock of Figle Fawr {{at the base of}} the Rhinogydd Range of mountains and the river channel here can flow up to 9 knots (16.7km/h). The first two spans here are built directly onto the rock.|$|E
5|$|Much like in {{its early}} days, the bridge still carries a lot of traffic related to the fruit {{production}} industry, especially during picking and harvesting seasons. Bridge lifts are timed to try and avoid traffic delays. Some in the local community consider that the capacity of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> inadequate and impedes commercial activity.|$|E
5|$|Named {{for energy}} firm BP, which donated $5million toward its construction, {{it is the}} first Gehry-designed bridge to have been completed. BP Bridge is {{described}} as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear a heavy load without structural problems caused by its own weight, it has won awards for its use of sheet metal. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction.|$|E
5000|$|From 1981 to 1991, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> named"Youth Bridge" [...] (Most mladosti). In 1991, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> renamed {{to current}} name. It was damaged in the Croatian War of Independence, during the Battle of Osijek, and {{underwent}} repair in 1993. In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> completely renovated.|$|R

It is a grade I listed building and forms part of the B3129 road.|$|E
5|$|The Indian River Inlet Bridge {{crosses the}} Indian River Inlet {{connecting}} the Atlantic Ocean {{to the east}} and the Indian River Bay to the west. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> located within Delaware Seashore State Park and carries DE 1 between Dewey Beach to the north and Bethany Beach to the south. It carries four 12-foot (3.7-meter) lanes of traffic (two northbound and two southbound), a 4-foot (1.2-meter) interior and 10-foot (3-meter) exterior shoulder in each direction, and a 12-foot (3.7-meter)-wide sidewalk {{on the east side of}} the bridge for pedestrians and bicycles.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> resurrected as {{a result}} of Janice Peaslee's efforts, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> renamed in her honor in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Loys Station Covered <b>Bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{built in}} 1848. [...] Between 1929 and 1930 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> reinforced with a concrete pier and steel beams. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> gets {{its name from}} a Western Maryland Railroad station that stopped nearby <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in Loys. In 1978 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> added to <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places. In 1991 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> burned down by an arsonist {{who was trying to}} fraudulently collect insurance money. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> took three years and $300,000 to rebuild and was rebuilt to match <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> as it <b>was</b> in 1930 after having been reinforced. Most of the cost of reconstructing <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> covered by insurance. On 4 July 1994 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> officially reopened for the public.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> at {{the mouth}} of Coal Mine Hollow, and the road it was on was used by the lumber and coal {{industries}} that were active in Plunketts Creek Township during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Creeks in the township supplied water power to 14 mills in 1861, and by 1876 there were 19 sawmills, a shingle mill, a woolen factory, and a tannery. By {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, these industries supported the inhabitants of two villages in Plunketts Creek Township.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> {{believed}} to be the first steel box girder bridge built in the United States, and is considered a prototype of the cable-stayed bridge of which a very similar design by the Germans was completed, the Stroemsund Bridge in Sweden. Similar bridges include a timber-stayed bridge designed in Germany in 1784, the wrought-iron stayed Albert Bridge in London designed in 1873, and the Chow Chow Bridge in Grays Harbor County. The bridge was listed on the Washington Heritage Register on January 25, 2002.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> both a {{connector}} and a viewing {{platform for the}} park. It was designed to link the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and the entire Loop to the west with the Lake Michigan lakefront to the east. It was also {{designed to be a}} berm noise barrier blocking noise on the eight-lane Columbus Drive from the Park's outdoor band shell (Jay Pritzker Pavilion), by deflecting traffic sounds upward.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 180.60 m <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{manufactured}} by Kelle & Hildebrandt in Dresden. Construction took place from 1904 until 1905 {{at a cost}} of 130,109 German gold marks. It featured a 6 ft blast fence, therefore the view from <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> rather limited. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> a landmark of the Thumer Netz. After the Schönfeld-Wiesa-Thum railroad was closed on August 15, 1967, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> not used for 10 years, until it was torn down in October 1977. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> cut and pulled down via bulldozer, and cut into smaller pieces on the ground.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Cheonho <b>Bridge</b> crosses <b>the</b> Han River in South Korea and {{connects the}} districts of Gangdong-gu and Gwangjin-gu. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} on July 5, 1976. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> built to relieve the heavy traffic on <b>the</b> Gwangjin <b>Bridge,</b> but by 1986 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> experiencing much traffic itself. This was resolved by building <b>the</b> Olympic <b>Bridge</b> in 1988.|$|R
50|$|The river flooded in 1927. The {{resulting}} damage to <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> not major, so <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> soon back in operation.|$|R
