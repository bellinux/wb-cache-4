In {{this short}} period, {{practically}} unlimited access to the hitherto unimaginable physical power which oil so easily provides has changed the world and transformed modern man’s concepts {{of the economic and}} ecological conditions of life. As this era is now coming to an end, we face global technological, ecological, economic, and, hence, political challenges unparalleled to those of any other cultural transition in the history of mankind. The technological and ecological nature of these challenges cannot be apprehended within the framework of concepts inherent in the mind-set of the cheap-oil era.

40|$|Biodiversity {{offsetting}} is transforming conservation practice {{around the}} world. Development activities that degrade or destroy biodiversity at one location are now increasingly acceptable because of compensatory environmental gains generated elsewhere. This change represents {{a major shift}} in how nature is protected, and yet its philosophical justification has received little attention. We argue that biodiversity offsetting aligns most easily with a utilitarian ethic, where outcomes rather than actions are the focus. However, offsetting schemes often neglect to account for the multiple values that people assign to biodiversity including unique, place-based values. Furthermore, the implications of defining nature as a <b>tradeable</b> <b>commodity</b> may affect our sense of obligation to protect biodiversity. Ironically, offsetting may exacerbate environmental harm because it erodes ethical barriers based on moral objections to the destruction of biodiversity. By failing to consider the ethical implications of biodiversity offsetting, we risk compromising the underlying motivations for protecting nature...|$|E
40|$|Productivity often {{increases}} {{in a part}} of an industry while remaining unchanged {{in the rest of the}} industry. In assessing the social gain from a productivity increase {{in a part of}} an industry producing a <b>tradeable</b> <b>commodity</b> it is necessary to consider the relationships between the part of the industry affected, the industry in the rest of the country concerned and the industry in the rest of the world. In this paper an attempt to assess the social benefits of serrated tussock control on the tablelands of New South Wales is critically reviewed and found wanting. An analytical framework is outlined that is conceptually appropriate to that task, and to other situations where cost per unit of output is reduced in a part of an industry. The social gains from the control of serrated tussock on the New South Wales tablelands are recalculated. A discussion is also presented of some issues in the distribution of the gains from research.

Genetic materials developed and distributed through ICRISAT are used in Australia to increase productivity. The price-reducing effects of successful research are incorporated into the analysis of spill-over impacts on productivity. The net effects on welfare for producers and consumers of sorghum and chickpeas in Australia and the Rest of the World (ROW) are identified.

The various elements of MOC for water, namely marginal production or private cost (MPC); marginal user or depletion cost (MUC); and marginal environmental or external cost (MEC) are described and some numerical examples provided. The relevance of border prices in determining the MOC of <b>tradeable</b> <b>commodities</b> is also considered. The paper then reviews {{some of the key}} issues involved in actual implementation of MOC pricing. These include the treatment of externalities, measurement, financial and fiscal, income distributional and second best matters. The paper concludes by listing some possible research topics relating to MOC pricing. While the focus of the paper is on estimation and implementation of MOC as applied to municipal water supply, the approach and techniques employed are of general relevance. Other resources, such as coal and forests are referred to when they provide better illustration of some of the generic issues covered in the paper. Water supply...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} general {{equilibrium}} model that encompasses the endogenous selection {{of a set of}} <b>tradeable</b> <b>commodities.</b> At its foundation we introduce the notion of a trade infrastructure as a set of social institutions describing the trade and production technologies available to the agents in the economy. Our model bridges the analyses of economies with a finite number of commodities and those with an infinite number, and it provides a general framework for investigating a very large class of possible applications. We discuss in detail a simple example on the development of a guild economy into a market based economy. We introduce an equilibrium concept that describes the pricing of trade infrastructures, based on the notion of valuation equilibrium for economies with abstract public goods, as in Diamantaras and Gilles (1996, International Economic Review, 37, 851 - 860). Through this concept we are able to price the tradeability of a commodity by itself. As our main results we obtain the existence as well as the decentralization of Pareto efficient allocations using the concept of valuation equilibrium.

40|$|Digital {{technology}} significantly {{changes the}} balance in society and economic relationships, offering new opportunities for innovative business models. This raises challenging questions affecting several aspects of the law. For a functioning market economy, private law has to provide a general framework and efficient tools. The realisation of a connected Digital Single Market {{is one of the}} ten priorities of the European Commission, which aims to react appropriately to the challenges of the digital revolution in order to use this opportunity for economic growth. In the framework of its Digital Single Market Strategy, the European Commission announced a set of measures aiming to create better access to digital goods and services across Europe for both consumers and businesses, underlining that the absence of consistent EU-wide criteria creates barriers to entrance, hinders competition and reduces predictability for investors throughout Europe. The paper addresses the impact of digital technology on private law relationships, the status of information as a <b>tradeable</b> <b>commodity</b> and the new instruments to protect it, the legislative instruments for a Digital Single Market concerning consumers’ and users’ rights when buying goods, services or digital content online, the new features of standard contracts in the digital market, online intermediary platforms and online dispute resolution platforms...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, {{the matter}} of {{indigenous}} peoples’ rights {{has emerged as a}} priority {{in the context of the}} development of international law. The growing attention for the rights and dignity of indigenous peoples has eventually translated into a number of legal instruments, which take into account the cosmologies (visions of life) of the peoples concerned, as well as the specificity of their legal structures and customary laws. This has led to the need to reconsider certain legal concepts, which were traditionally structured on the sole basis of the western point of view and firmly focused on individual rights. Among these concepts, the legal understanding of cultural heritage is included. In fact, in the context of indigenous peoples’ cosmologies, cultural heritage is the bedrock of the identity of the peoples concerned, attaining spiritual and cultural values and going much beyond its usual western-based connotation as a <b>tradeable</b> <b>commodity.</b> This reality translates into a situation where traditional legal parameters, to a large extent, are not able to grasp or take into account the significance and peculiarities of indigenous cultural heritage, especially when it comes to international trade in such heritage. The contribution explores in detail the specificity of trade in indigenous cultural heritage, with special attention to the particular aspects not currently addressed by international law, and also suggests some possible solutions de lege ferenda...|$|E
40|$|For {{irrigation}} farmers, {{the deregulation}} of water markets and consequent emergence of {{water as a}} <b>tradeable</b> <b>commodity</b> calls for a method of comparing traditional on-farm water options (growing crops) with off-farm market options (selling water seasonally, or selling water licences permanently). The option to diversify farm income {{in this way is}} a desirable future adaptation strategy in response to decreased and more variable water supplies. We demonstrate a method for comparing such options based on their risk-return characteristics. A framework commonly used in the finance sector is adapted to agricultural water decisions, and illustrated using a case-study farm from Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Riverina region. In our example, a range of potential farm management practices are examined for several future water availability scenarios, and then compared with a fixed-return option (selling water entitlements to the Australian Government 2 ̆ 7 s current water buy-back scheme). We demonstrate how the attractiveness of the scheme for farmers depends on future water availability levels. For any future allocation level, the best way to use water on-farm varies with the value of the fixed-return option. The farmer 2 ̆ 7 s decision on what portion of their water entitlement to sell provides them with the opportunity to tailor their operation 2 ̆ 7 s risk-return performance. This method is universally applicable wherever there is a mix of variable and fixed-return options, and offers a framework to assist farmers in conceptualizing comparisons between traditional on-farm uses for water and newer, market-based options...|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{attention}} has been devoted {{in the last two decades}} to assessing the economic consequences of agricultural research. The biotechnology revolution (see, for example, Hueth and Just, 1986; Kalter and Tauer, 1986) may provide a further stimulus to study of the size and distribution of the benefits and costs of research. The present paper is in two parts. The first part outlines the approach used by Edwards and Freebairn [1981, 1984] to study the benefits from cost-reducing research. The approach is a simple, partial equilibrium one, but it incorporates the tradeabi 1 ity of commodities and the fact that research may reduce costs in the country of primary concern and/or in the rest of the world. Some results obtained with this approach are summarized, and an illustration gives estimates of the benefits to Australia and the rest of the world from research-induced cost reductions in the wheat industry. The second part of the paper contains observations on some additional issues that are relevant in assessing the economics of research for <b>tradeable</b> <b>commodities.</b> The issues are: choice of objective function in cost-benefit analysis of agricultural research; disaggregation into more than two sectors; effect of market distortions on benefits from research; property rights and trade in inputs; equity in distribution of the benefits and costs of research; and demand-shifting research and promotion. Most of these appear to be issues on which further research is appropriate. Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|R

40|$|Universities in {{the twenty-first}} century {{experience}} numerous competing drivers that shape their sense of purpose and role in society, their perspectives of knowledge and its production and their overall sense of being in the world. One major force is marketplace discourse, in particular neo-liberalism and competition, which is discordant with the discourse of academic collaboration and collegial sharing. This review essay examines what it means to ‘be’ a university in light of these overarching discourses and what is envisioned for universities of the future. In particular, the essay focuses on how universities around the world respond to the tensions of competition agendas in local contexts. How are global policies on education as a <b>tradeable</b> <b>commodity</b> shaping university policies, discourses and practices? How is competition moulding the overall notion of a university education? What is imagined for the future of universities, given the dissonance between competition and collaboration agendas and practices in higher education? These questions are explored through reviews of two recent books that focus on  global shapings of higher education institutions: ‘‘Being a University’’ by Ronald Barnett (2011) and ‘‘Higher Education, Policy and the Global Competition Phenomenon’’ (Portnoi et al. 2010) edited by Laura Portnoi, Val Rust and Sylvia Bagley. Barnett’s book is used primarily to outline the characteristics of various universities’ being and becoming. Portnoi et al’s work provides clear illustrations of the lived experience of higher education in the current globally competitive age. Three broad questions frame this review: • How do universities currently see themselves as being in a globally competitive market? • How does the globally competitive agenda operate in practice in different universities? • What could universities ‘become’ in the future?</div...|$|E

40|$|Forests provide {{wildlife}} habitat, {{water and}} air purification, climate moderation, and timber and nontimber products. Concern {{about climate change}} has put forests in the limelight as sinks of atmospheric carbon. The C stored in the global vegetation, mostly in forests, is nearly equivalent to the amount present in atmospheric CO{sub 2 }. Both voluntary and government-mandated carbon trading markets are being developed and debated, some of which include C sequestration resulting from forest management as a possible <b>tradeable</b> <b>commodity.</b> However, uncertainties regarding sources of variation in sequestration rates, validation, and leakage remain significant challenges for devising strategies to include forest management in C markets. Hence, the need for scientifically-based information on C sequestration by forest management has never been greater. The consequences of forest management on the US carbon budget are large, because {{about two-thirds of the}} {approx} 300 million hectare US forest resource is classified as 'commercial forest. ' In most C accounting budgets, forest harvesting is usually considered to cause a net release of C from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere. However, forest management practices could be designed to meet the multiple goals of providing wood and paper products, creating economic returns from natural resources, while sequestering C from the atmosphere. The shelterwood harvest strategy, which removes about 30 % of the basal area of the overstory trees in each of three successive harvests spread out over thirty years as part of a stand rotation of 60 - 100 years, may improve net C sequestration compared to clear-cutting because: (1) the average C stored on the land surface over a rotation increases, (2) harvesting only overstory trees means that a larger fraction of the harvested logs can be used for long-lived sawtimber products, compared to more pulp resulting from clearcutting, (3) the shelterwood cut encourages growth of subcanopy trees by opening up the forest canopy to increasing light penetration. Decomposition of onsite harvest slash and of wastes created during timber processing releases CO{sub 2 } to the atmosphere, thus offsetting some of the C sequestered in vegetation. Decomposition of soil C and dead roots may also be temporarily stimulated by increased light penetration and warming of the forest floor. Quantification of these processes and their net effect is needed. We began studying C sequestration in a planned shelterwood harvest at the Howland Forest in central Maine in 2000. The harvest took place in 2002 by the International Paper Corporation, who assisted us to track the fates of harvest products (Scott et al., 2004, Environmental Management 33 : S 9 -S 22). Here we present the results of intensive on-site studies of the decay of harvest slash, soil respiration, growth of the remaining trees, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO{sub 2 } during the first six years following the harvest. These results are combined with calculations of C in persisting off-site harvest products to estimate the net C consequences to date of this commercial shelterwood harvest operation. Tower-based eddy covariance is an ideal method for this study, as it integrates all C fluxes {{in and out of the}} forest over a large 'footprint' area and can reveal how the net C flux, as well as gross primary productivity and respiration, change following harvest. Because the size of this experiment precludes large-scale replication, we are use a paired-airshed approach, similar to classic large-scale paired watershed experiments. Measurements of biomass and C fluxes in control and treatment stands were compared during a pre-treatment calibration period, and then divergence from pre-treatment relationships between the two sites measured after the harvest treatment. Forests store carbon (C) as they accumulate biomass. Many forests are also commercial sources of timber and wood fiber. In most C accounting budgets, forest harvesting is usually considered to cause a net release of C from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere. However, it might also be possible for commercial use of forests to contribute to terrestrial sequestration of C. The objective of the our research project is to determine whether shelterwood cutting regimes now being adopted in the commercial forests of Maine and other areas of the country can achieve these multiple goals...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Concerns {{about the}} poor {{performance}} of the smallholder agricultural {{sector of the economy}} has led to a proposal to create a parastatal organization {{to be known as the}} Crop Marketing Authority (CMA). The major crop marketing problems faced by Zambia’s small-scale farmers are perceived by many to be low prices and low production of staples, leading to problems of low real incomes of smallholder households and food shortages perceived to result from inadequacies of the markets for staple crops and agricultural inputs. The CMA is envisioned to help smallholders overcome perceived problems of (1) high costs of marketing, (2) poor access to markets, (3) market concentration leading to exploitative practices by traders, and (4) low prices that result from points 1 - 3. OBJECTIVES: This policy synthesis highlights some of the key messages contained in the full report with the same title. 1 It aims to summarize the rationale and objectives of the CMA and the possible consequences of adopting the proposed legislation. We also identify alternative or additional measures that the government could take to overcome constraints in crop marketing. Although the CMA Concept Note refers to food crops in general, and highlights the importance of not focusing entirely on maize, we realize that maize will inevitably be the biggest <b>tradeable</b> food <b>commodity</b> that the CMA will handle. For that reason, the analysis focuses on maize marketing...|$|R
