5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host cells <b>to</b> <b>replicate,</b> {{they are}} difficult to eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccinations to provide immunity to infection, and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with viral replication.|$|E

40|$|Guinea pig {{brain cell}} {{cultures}} were established from fetuses at 25, 31, and 37 days of gestation (DG). After 7 days in vitro, the cultures were infected with guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV). Based on cytopathic effect, immunofluorescence staining for GPCMV by using virus-specific antiserum, {{and the amount}} of virus recovered, cultures established from fetuses at 25 DG were least susceptible <b>to</b> <b>replicating</b> infection, and cultures established from fetuses at 37 DG were most susceptible.

40|$|Mismatch Repair (MMR) {{is closely}} linked to DNA {{replication}}; however, other than {{the role of the}} replicative sliding clamp (PCNA) in various MMR functions, the linkage between DNA replication and MMR has been difficult to investigate. Here we use an in vitro DNA replication system based on simian virus 40, to investigate MMR recruitment <b>to</b> <b>replicating</b> DNA. Both DNA replication and MMR proteins are recruited <b>to</b> <b>replicating</b> DNA in an origin-dependent fashion. Primer synthesis is required for recruitment of both PCNA and MMR proteins, but not for recruitment of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (RPA). Blocking PCNA recruitment <b>to</b> <b>replicating</b> DNA with a p 21 -based polypeptide blocks PCNA and MMR, but not RPA recruitment. Once PCNA and subsequent proteins required for replication are loaded onto DNA, addition of p 21 leaves PCNA on the replicating DNA, but actively displaces MMR proteins. These findings indicate that the MMR machinery is recruited <b>to</b> <b>replicating</b> DNA through its interaction with PCNA, and suggests that this occurs via binding of the MMR proteins to the multi-protein interaction sites on PCNA. These studies demonstrate the utility of this system for further investigation of the role of DNA replication in MMR...|$|R

5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell <b>to</b> <b>replicate</b> chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E
