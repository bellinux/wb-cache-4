5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> knew—and they knew <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E

5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> {{to do something with}} the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At the time of its demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E

5|$|However, Bell was {{speaking}} only {{for himself and}} without the auspices of <b>the</b> <b>owners.</b> At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote that required a super-majority. Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> to permit the NFLPA {{to act as a}} bargaining agent for the players. However, he did reach a compromise with <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the NFLPA {{declared}} itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968 after official discussions with <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> stalled. <b>The</b> <b>owners</b> countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. <b>The</b> <b>owners</b> agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E

Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said action would be taken against <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> of the factory and house, and Superintendent of Police of South 24 Parganas S. N. Gupta said that <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> of the building would be arrested. Investigation {{has shown that the}} Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) issued notices to the building on three separate occasions, in 1988, 1989, and 1992, yet took no further action. It has been shown, however, that the KMC also approved trade licences for two businesses to operate from the building. The owner of the building, Khurshid Alam, has had a police complaint filed against him by the fire department for illegal construction charges. Mohammed Sagir Ahmed and Mohammed Asif, <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> of Tenex Exports, also face related charges. Both investigations are ongoing.|$|E

5|$|After the season, <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> {{asked the}} NHL {{for a second}} time for {{permission}} to suspend operations. This time, the NHL refused the request. Instead, the league bought back the franchise, halted its operations, and dispersed its players among the remaining teams.|$|E
50|$|The {{major problem}} with {{design-build}} contracts is an inherent conflict of interest. In a standard contract the architect works for <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> and is directly responsible to <b>the</b> <b>owner.</b> In design-build <b>the</b> architect {{works for the}} design-builder, not <b>the</b> <b>owner,</b> therefor <b>the</b> design-builder may make design and construction decisions that benefit the design-builder, but that do not benefit <b>the</b> <b>owner.</b> During construction, <b>the</b> architect normally acts as <b>the</b> <b>owner's</b> representative. This includes reviewing the builder's work and ensuring that the products and methods meet specifications and codes. The architect's role is compromised when the architect works for the design-builder and not for <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> directly. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> may get a building that is over-designed to increase profits for the design-builder, or a building built with lesser-quality products to maximize profits.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the engineering, the {{formation}} of a typical principal-agent relationship is formed between <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> and <b>the</b> engineering-construction supervisor. <b>The</b> <b>owner</b> entrusts <b>the</b> supervisor with the construction management and monitors his work. <b>The</b> <b>owner's</b> question is how to choose the right commission model {{on the basis of his}} monitoring capacity and design an optimal contract to encourage the supervisor to choose action which meets <b>the</b> <b>owner's</b> maximal interest. By comparing the supervisor’ s optimal behavior choices under the incentive contract which only contains sharing the result and under the incentive-monitoring contract which contains sharing the result and monitoring the process, this article proves that when the level of <b>the</b> <b>owner's</b> monitoring capacity is higher than a critical value, <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> should choose partial commission model and design the incentive-monitoring contract,and keep improving his level of monitoring capacity in order to pursue the higher level of the supervisor's effort. When the level of <b>the</b> <b>owner's</b> monitoring capacity is lower than the critical value, <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> should choose complete commission model and design the incentive contract which only contains sharing the result. In view of the engineering practice, we point out that the competence of <b>the</b> <b>owner's</b> representative will impact <b>the</b> <b>owner's</b> optimal choice...|$|R

5|$|By 2004, <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> were {{claiming}} that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, {{and that the}} league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> again locked the players out {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994–95 lockout, <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> were again demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries.|$|E

5|$|By September 25, 24 {{exhibition}} {{games were}} canceled and training camps were postponed indefinitely {{as a result}} of stalled talks. Further negotiating sessions took place in October and November, but no agreement was reached. The season's first two weeks were officially canceled on October 13, and 99 games scheduled for November were lost as a result. It {{was the first time in}} NBA history that games were canceled due to a labor dispute. On October 20, arbitrator John Feerick ruled that <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> did not have to pay players with guaranteed contracts during the lockout. Feerick's decision gave <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> leverage in bargaining talks. Another factor favoring <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> was that their teams received money from the NBA's television broadcasters, whose contracts with the league called for payments to be made if games were not played.|$|E
5|$|Chandler's {{contract}} {{as baseball}} commissioner was {{not due to}} expire until April 1952, but he asked for <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> to extend it in December 1949. <b>The</b> <b>owners</b> voted against offering the extension at that time, but promised to consider the request again in December 1950. The vote in 1950 was nine votes for Chandler and seven against, leaving him three votes short of the necessary three-fourths majority. Chandler asked that the extension be considered again at the owners' meeting on March 12, 1951, but the vote was again 9–7. Upset that his contract was not extended, Chandler resigned effective July 15, 1951.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the players}} were locked out by <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> {{because of a lack}} of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The 1994–95 NHL lockout lasted 104days and {{resulted}} in the season's being shortened from a planned 84 games to 48. <b>The</b> <b>owners</b> insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries, the union instead proposed a luxury tax system. Just as the entire season seemed to be lost, an 11th-hour deal was agreed on. <b>The</b> <b>owners</b> failed to achieve a full salary cap but the deal was initially hailed as a win for <b>the</b> <b>owners.</b> The deal was not enough to save two teams in Canada's smallest NHL markets. The revenue disparity between large and small market teams, exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian Dollar, forced the Quebec Nordiques to move to Denver and become the Colorado Avalanche in 1995; the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, becoming the Coyotes, the next year. The Hartford Whalers followed, moving to Greensboro, NC and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The NHL continued its expansion into cities in the Southern United States. In 1998, the Nashville Predators joined the league, followed by the Atlanta Thrashers the following year. To further market their players, the NHL decided to have its players play in the Winter Olympics, starting in 1998, at the Nagano Games. In 2000, the league added two franchises, boosting the total number to 30. The NHL returned to Minnesota with the Wild and added the Blue Jackets in Columbus, Ohio.|$|E
