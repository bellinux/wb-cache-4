5|$|Determined Egyptian {{resistance}} {{made progress}} extremely slow for <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> who suffered heavy losses. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> were repeatedly reinforced with armor but {{were unable to}} make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering {{from a lack of}} infantry, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.|$|E
5|$|At around 10:00am, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> renewed the attack, {{moving toward}} Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. The paratroopers at Jebel Mariam became engaged in intense {{fighting}} but, with their advantageous position, {{were able to}} repel the attack by late afternoon. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> concentrated artillery and mortar fire against the Sa'iqa positions at Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. At noon, advance Israeli elements engaged with a Sa'iqa reconnaissance unit, and <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> lost two tanks and a half-track. At 1:00pm, an Israeli paratrooper company attacked Abu 'Atwa without first scouting ahead, and was ambushed and annihilated. The attack ended after paratroopers suffered over fifty casualties and lost four tanks.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, 1973, an air battle {{took place}} between Syrian and Israeli fighters. It was an {{alarming}} skirmish in which twelve Syrian aircraft were shot down while <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> lost only one fighter. Tension ran high between both countries. The Egyptians in particular were very concerned; on April 7, 1967, an air battle between Syria and Israel had escalated the military situation {{and was one of}} the causes of the Six Day War. Aware that war was to be launched only days later, the Syrians chose not to retaliate. The air battle aided the Syrians in concentrating their forces for the war, as <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> interpreted it to be a defensive reaction on the part of the Syrians. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> closely monitored this buildup near the front, but their intelligence remained adamant that Syria would not go to war without Egypt, which <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> believed was currently occupied with internal issues.|$|E

5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E

5|$|Despite the debacle, Reshef {{remained}} {{determined to}} seize the junction, giving the task to the division's reconnaissance battalion attached to his brigade. To achieve surprise, the battalion maneuvered to attack at 3:00 AM from the west, as the Egyptians were preparing for further attacks {{from the south and}} east. As <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> attacked, Lieutenant Colonel Brom was killed barely thirty meters from Egyptian positions, disrupting his battalion's assault. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> sustained losses, but managed to retreat. Soon after, a tank company attacked the crossroads at 4:00 AM on October 16, but also withdrew after losing three tanks.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Operation Asuta {{was mounted}} against a few smaller guerrilla bases {{south of the}} Dead Sea, near Safi, where the school bus had struck the mine. The bases were raided by Israeli ground forces with close air support. About 20 Jordanian {{soldiers}} and policemen and 20 Fatah fighters were killed, and 27 were taken prisoner. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> suffered no casualties. Frustrated in their hope to entrap the entire PLO force, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> soon pulled out, but had to fight {{their way back to}} Israeli territory. At 11:00 <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> began to withdraw, with Sikorsky H-34 helicopters evacuating the troops. Because orders came down to recover as many vehicles as possible, they only completed their withdrawal by 20:40. They had planned a rescue for its two tanks which were left in Jordan, but later withdrew the plan.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians, {{under heavy}} and {{effective}} fire from <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> inside the bunkers, ceased entering the fort. The Sa'iqa company to the east, under concentrated Israeli tank fire and aerial bombardment, was finally {{overwhelmed by the}} Israeli reinforcements, which proceeded towards the fort, opening fire on the main force. Consequently, all Egyptian forces east of the fort attempted to retreat through the marshes. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> attempted to hamper the retreat by dropping smoke capsules over the area from four A-4 Skyhawks. The lack of visibility caused injuries as men tripped and were trampled during the retreat through the marshes.|$|E

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Egyptian artillery strikes alerted <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> who attacked the strong point at the pumping station with armor and seized it. Instead of concentrating forces for a counter-attack, the battalion commander used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a counter-attack to regain it, which inevitably failed due to the paucity of forces. Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses, mainly at a position south of the railway station, at a hill called Orcha by <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b> At this point, only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon's division and the Ismailia Canal.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} still not lost for <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> {{although}} the wake was coming, and Laskov considered that his men could not hold {{in front of a}} Legion's counter-attack and he preferred to order the retreat. It was also time for the Jordanians to regroup, their 4th Regiment was completely out of ammunition. 73rd Battalion suffered 50% losses and the whole of the engaged forces had counted 44 deaths and twice that number injured. According to the sources, the Legion suffered between 12 and 20 deaths, including the lieutenant commanding the fort. In contrast, the Jordanians reported 2 just deaths on their side, and 161 of <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The coastal column shelled the Israeli {{positions}} and inflicted enormous damage; <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> were either dug in within shallow trenches made for infantry warfare with no head cover, or in Samakh's clay houses that were vulnerable to heavy weapons. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> were eventually forced {{to abandon their}} posts and concentrate in the police station, where they brought the wounded.

5|$|The losses {{suffered}} {{by both the}} Egyptians and <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> in the battle were severe. Israeli units suffered heavy casualties in men and equipment; Reshef's armored losses during {{the first night of}} the battle alone were comparable to Egyptian armored losses on the disastrous October 14 offensive. For their part, the numbers of Egyptian armored forces within 16th Division's bridgehead severely dwindled. As of 18 October the 21st Armored Division had no more than 40 tanks remaining of an original 136 tanks available {{at the start of the}} battle (not counting 21 tanks received as reinforcements), while the 16th Infantry Division had just 20 tanks remaining in its organic tank battalion. This attrition served Egypt's war strategy of inflicting maximum casualties on <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> even though, from another perspective, the initiative had passed to <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> during the battle.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{criminal}} inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists {{to photograph the}} scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation {{because there was no}} doubt that <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.|$|E

Within the next two hours, Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against Jordanian defenses on the Musri-Karameh road, the Salt road, and east of Abdullah Bridge. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes and artillery, and began demolishing the camp.
