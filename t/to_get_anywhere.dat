The subdivision is located at the intersections of Interstate 84, Idaho 21, and Federal Way (former U.S. Highway), which are all major arteries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anywhere</b> in Boise. The subdivision, a baseball complex, and swimming pools were developed around the Simplot Sports complex. The fields are built over an old landfill and dump, and the fields and gravel parking lot allow radon gases to escape through the ground.|$|E

[...] According to Portisch, for Black, [...] "The {{root of the problem}} is that very few people know which are the openings where Black is really OK. Those who find these lines have nothing to fear, as Black is indeed OK, but only in those variations!" [...] Rowson considers this an important point, noting that [...] "1.d4players struggle <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anywhere</b> against main-line Slavs and 1.e4players find the Najdorf and [...] particularly tough." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon publication, {{reviews of}} Marching Men were {{moderate}} {{with a small}} number of reviewers taking strong negative stances. In one such [...] review, an anonymous critic from the New York Times Book Review noted that the beginning of the novel was [...] "sufficiently well done to lead the reader to expect a novel of possibly a trifle more than average interest and average merit" [...] but ultimately concludes that neither McGregor, [...] "nor the book ever seems <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anywhere</b> in particular". Other reviewers too did not hesitate to mention the novel's stunted character development and anti-climactic ending. Aside from these faults, several critics also commented on Marching Mens [...] "deliberate vagueness", calling the book a [...] "generous if misty vision of the future".|$|E

500|$|In Part I, this meditative poem {{begins with}} the narrator {{trying to focus on}} the present moment while walking through a garden, {{focusing}} on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. In Part II, the narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach [...] "the still point" [...] in which he doesn't try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anywhere</b> or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing [...] "a grace of sense." [...] In Part III, the meditation experience becomes darker as night comes on, and by Part IV, it is night and [...] "Time and the bell have buried the day." [...] In Part V, the narrator reaches a contemplative end to his/her meditation, initially contemplating the arts ("Words" [...] and [...] "music") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating [...] "Words [...] strain,/Crack and sometimes break, under the burden , under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [...] will not stay in place, /Will not stay still." [...] By comparison, the narrator concludes that [...] "Love is itself unmoving,/Only the cause and end of movement,/Timeless, and undesiring." [...] For this reason, this spiritual experience of [...] "Love" [...] is the form of consciousness that most interests the narrator (presumably more than the creative act of writing poetry).|$|E
500|$|The Motion Picture {{met with}} {{negative}} reviews from critics; a 2001 retrospective for the BBC described {{the film as}} a critical failure. As of October 2017, the film holds a 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews with the consensus stating: [...] "Featuring a patchwork script and a dialogue-heavy storyline whose biggest villain is a cloud, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a less-than-auspicious debut for the franchise." [...] Gary Arnold and Judith Martin of The Washington Post felt that the plot was too thin to support {{the length of the}} film, although Martin felt that compared to such science-fiction films as , Star Wars and Alien, The Motion Pictures pretense was [...] "slightly cleverer". Times Harold Livingston wrote that the film consisted of spaceships that [...] "take an unconscionable amount of time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anywhere,</b> and nothing of dramatic or human interest happens along the way". Livingston also lamented the lack of [...] "boldly characterized" [...] antagonists and battle scenes that made Star Wars fun; instead, viewers were presented with lots of talk, [...] "much of it in impenetrable spaceflight jargon". David Denby said that the slow movement of ships through space was [...] "no longer surprising and elegant" [...] after films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, and that much of the action consisted of the crew's reacting to things occurring on the viewscreen, which the New York Magazine critic considered to be [...] "like watching someone else watch television". Variety disagreed, calling the film [...] "a search-and-destroy thriller that includes all of the ingredients the TV show's fans thrive on: the philosophical dilemma wrapped in a scenario of mind control, troubles with the space ship, the dependable and understanding Kirk, the ever-logical Spock, and suspenseful take with twist ending". Scott Bukatman reviewed Star Trek - The Motion Picture in Ares Magazine #1. [...] Bukatman commented that [...] "With Star Trek, Roddenberry's trick has been to wear the mask of the humanist as he plays with his Erector set. The scale of the television series arrested his vision at a comfortable and still interesting level, but the new film has finally removed the mask." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Gardiner {{was only}} {{allowed to vote}} in Metro Council to break ties, he was a voting member of all four policy {{committees}}. The committees would do the early work of working through proposals preparing them for Council. Gardiner prided himself on his work ethic, the same style he had used since his days at high school. [...] "I {{was not going to}} change my way of proceeding. It was more necessary than ever. My diagnosis was that if I was going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anywhere</b> I had to know more about any given subject than any individual councillor, and more about metropolitan business as than all the members of council combined." [...] Gardiner would wait to speak on important resolutions after others had spoken. When a close vote was anticipated, Gardiner went around the council table, rebutting objections one by one.|$|E

In Switzerland, it peaked at number 4 and spent four weeks in the top 10.

2500|$|The 1906 Springboks became [...] "the first {{national}} team {{to utilize the}} 3-4-1 formation". South Africans credit Springbok Fairy Heatlie for developing the 3-4-1 formation in 1901 at the Villagers Rugby Club in Cape Town, fellow Villager Paddy Carolin for applying it on the 1906 South African tour of Britain, and Stellenbosch coach [...] "Oubaas Mark" [...] Markötter for perfecting it afterwards. [...] Under Markötter's instigation, {{and that of his}} protegé Danie Craven, South Africa had by 1949 perfected the 3-4-1 scrum formation. The hooker bound very loosely, and could swing his body so that he could get his feet to the ball {{as soon as it was}} fed into the scrum. The two locks would not push on the hooker, but their props, to make this easier. This made it very difficult for the opposition <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anywhere</b> near the ball before it was hooked to the back of the scrum. It was at this time the terms loosehead and tighthead entered rugby terminology. Ever since the team feeding the ball has had a significant advantage, and won their own ball much more frequently.|$|E
