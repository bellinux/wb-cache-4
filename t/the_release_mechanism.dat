40|$|This thesis explores further <b>the</b> drug <b>release</b> from {{hydrophilic}} matrices {{in three}} parts {{by means of}} dissolution in paddle apparatus, using matrices with different shapes such as the dome shape, cylindrical shape, matrices with one base flat and the other concave and matrices with one base flat and the other convex. The first part involves surface area increase of the “dome” matrix {{during the process of}} swelling. The swelling area of single dome and cylindrical matrices, partially coated with an impermeable film, was calculated during dissolution experiments. In the second part of this work <b>the</b> <b>release</b> patterns of <b>the</b> dome and cylindrical hydrophilic matrices were compared to matrices of the same shape containing a non-swelling polymer. In the third part a new method of assembling dome matrices units by the use of ultrasound was explored. Drug <b>release</b> kinetics and <b>mechanisms</b> were studied for all the different matrices prepared, applying the Ritger-Peppas equation An approximation of the swollen surface area of the hydrophilic matrices was found. It was in addition found that the shape of the matrices used in these experiments did not significantly affect <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>release</b> patterns were slightly changed.

40|$|Poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used biodegradable polymer in <b>the</b> controlled <b>release</b> of encapsulated drugs. Understanding <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> as well as which factors that affect drug release, is important {{in order to be able}} to modify drug release. Drug release from PLGA-based drug delivery systems is however complex. This review focuses on <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and provides a survey and analysis of the processes determining <b>the</b> <b>release</b> rate, which may be helpful in elucidating this complex picture. <b>The</b> term <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> and <b>the</b> various techniques that have been used to study <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are discussed. <b>The</b> physico-chemical processes that influence the rate of drug <b>release</b> and <b>the</b> various <b>mechanisms</b> of drug <b>release</b> that have been reported in the literature are analyzed in this review, and practical examples are given. The complexity of drug release from PLGA-based drug delivery systems can make the generalization of results and predictions of drug release difficult. However, this complexity also provides many possible ways of solving problems and modifying drug release. Basic, generally applicable and mechanistic research provides pieces of the puzzle, which is useful in the development of controlled-release pharmaceuticals...|$|R

30|$|While {{these studies}} qualitatively {{interpret}} the fluid–rock interactions {{responsible for the}} observed changes in physicochemical water properties and ion <b>release,</b> <b>the</b> differentiation and quantification of <b>the</b> individual <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as mineral dissolution and desorption, remain difficult. Since knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is necessary to understand and predict reactions of the aquifer chemistry to changes in environmental parameters induced by ATES system operation, such as temperature or solute oxygen, this study utilizes extraction experiments and numerical simulations to quantify the reactivity of aquifer rocks under these conditions. It focuses on siliciclastic rocks at temperatures between 25 and 90  °C and under shifting redox conditions due {{to the introduction of}} dissolved oxygen into normally oxygen-depleted aquifers. In this context, pyrite (FeS 2) is the most important mineral, since it is ubiquitous and occurs in many sedimentary rocks used for ATES storage. It has a high sensitivity to changes under redox conditions and the potential to acidify the surrounding groundwater upon dissolution (Nordstrom 1982). The short-term reactivities of two siliciclastic rocks with synthetic, saline groundwater under controlled laboratory conditions that mimic conditions in a thermal aquifer storage system were investigated to study their dependence on temperature. Experimental results were complemented by numerical simulations to help explain and quantify <b>the</b> observed <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms.</b>|$|R

40|$|The taurine {{transport}} of flounder erythrocytes {{is associated with}} a cell volume regulation in anisosmotic media. An osmolality reduction leads to a cell volume increase, which is followed by a volume readajustment towards the original level. A 75 mosM reduction is accompanied by a 33 mumol g dry wt. - 1 reduction in the cellular taurine content. The reduction in osmolality activates <b>the</b> taurine <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> by transiently increasing the rate coefficient for taurine efflux. The rate coefficient for taurine influx is similarly stimulated. This influx is mediated by a Na+-independent transport system. The concomitant activation of influx and efflux suggests a coupling between these two systems. Higher taurine efflux and influx rate coefficients which decayed more slowly with time were measured in cells suspended in Na+-free (choline replacement) media than in the presence of Na+. This suggests that Na+ {{may play a role in}} <b>the</b> taurine <b>release</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Noradrenaline induced a cellular swelling at normal osmolality (330 mosM), but had only a minor effect on the taurine efflux and influx and the cellular taurine content. Urea-induced cellular swelling at normal osmolality initiated a volume regulatory process and activated <b>the</b> taurine <b>release</b> <b>mechanism,</b> similarly to an osmolality reduction. These results show that osmolality reduction and cellular swelling are no prerequisites for the activation of <b>the</b> taurine <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> and <b>the</b> cell volume readajustment. It is suggested that the dimension of an intracellular solute compartment determines the activation level of this mechanism...|$|R
