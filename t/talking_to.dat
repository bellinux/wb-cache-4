40|$|This study {{examined}} the relation between child distress, parent distraction behaviors, and parent other nonprocedural talk during pediatric cancer procedures. Participants were 72 children with cancer (age 5 to 13 years old) and their mothers. Cancer procedures were videotaped and coded for parent behaviors and child distress. Contrary to hypotheses, child distress {{was positively related to}} parent verbal distraction and nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the child and negatively related <b>to</b> nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult in the room. Sequential analyses suggested that verbal distraction and nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the child were more likely to occur after crying, while nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult was less likely to occur after crying. Crying was less likely to occur after nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult. Results suggest that nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult functions differently than nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the child; however, given the low frequency of behaviors, results should be interpreted with caution...|$|R

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round.

The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail stopped <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions.
