40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>torque</b> and velocity <b>ripple</b> elimination in AC permanent magnet (PM) motor control systems. The <b>torque</b> <b>ripples</b> caused by DC offsets that {{are present in the}} current sensors of the motor driver and the digital-to-analog converters of the motion controller are studied and formulated mathematically. These <b>torque</b> <b>ripples</b> eventually generate velocity ripples at the speed output and degrade the system performance. In this paper the <b>torque</b> <b>ripples</b> are modeled as a sinusoidal function with a frequency depending on the motor speed. The internal model principle (IMP) is then used to design a controller to eliminate the <b>torque</b> and velocity <b>ripples</b> without estimating the amplitude and the phase values of the sinusoidal disturbance. A gain scheduled (GS) robust two degree of freedom (2 DOF) speed regulator based on the IMP and the pole-zero placement is developed to eliminate the <b>torque</b> and velocity <b>ripples</b> and achieve a desirable tracking response.

Indeed, PMSMs are characterized by their important torque density, light weight, high air gap flux density, high acceleration, high efficiency and strong power-to-weight ratio.

50|$|The {{switched}} {{reluctance motor}} (SRM) {{is a type of}} a stepper motor, an electric motor that runs by reluctance torque. Unlike common DC motor types, power is delivered to windings in the stator (case) rather than the rotor.

With modern electronic devices, precisely timed switching is not a problem, and the SRM is a popular design for modern stepper motors. Its main drawback is <b>torque</b> <b>ripple.</b> However, motor company Striatech developed controller technology that limits <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> with the same high torque at low speeds shown in switched reluctance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The unique {{performance}} {{features of}} harmonic drives, such as highs gear ratios and high torque capacities in a compact geometry, justify their widespread industrial application especially in many electrically actuated robot manipulators. In many robotic control strategies {{it is assumed}} that the actuator is acting as a torque source, and in order to implement such algorithms it is necessary to accurately measure the transmitted torque by the harmonic drive. In this paper a built-in torque sensor for harmonic drive systems is developed and examined in detail, in which strain-gauges are directly mounted on the harmonic drive flexspline. To minimize sensing inaccuracy, four Rosette strain gauges are used employing an accurate positioning method. To cancel the <b>torque</b> <b>ripples,</b> the oscillation observed on the measured torque and caused mainly by gear teeth meshing, Kalman filter estimation is used. A simple fourth order harmonic oscillator proved to accurately model the <b>torque</b> <b>ripples.</b> Moreover, the error model is extended to incorporate any misalignment torque. By on line implementation of the Kalman filter, {{it has been shown that}} this method is a fast and accurate way to filter <b>torque</b> <b>ripples</b> and misalignment <b>torque.</b> Hence, the intelligent built-in torque sensor is a viable and economical way to measure the harmonic drive transmitted torque and to employ that for torque feedback strategies.

50|$|Also, {{direct-drive}} mechanisms need a {{more precise}} control mechanism. High speed motors with speed reduction have relatively high inertia, which helps smooth the output motion. Most motors exhibit positional <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> known as cogging torque. In high speed motors, this effect is usually negligible, as the frequency at which it occurs is too high to significantly affect system performance; direct drive units will suffer more from this phenomenon, unless additional inertia is added (i.e. by a flywheel) or the system uses feedback to actively counter the effect.|$|E

However an operational characteristic is the occurrence of <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> at low speeds. For demanding direct drive applications like machine tools, robot arms or aerospace applications {{it is necessary to}} reduce the level of <b>torque</b> <b>ripple.</b> This thesis presents an in depth investigation into the production and nature of <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> in brushless machines. Different <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> reduction strategies are evaluated and one reduction strategy using Park's transform as a tool is identified as the promising strategy. The unified machine theory is checked to clarify the theory behind Park's transform; in particular assumptions made and general validity of the theory. This <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> reduction strategy based on Park's transform is extended to include the effect of armature reaction. A novel adaptive <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> reduction algorithm is designed. The ineffectiveness of the conventional approach is demonstrated. Further a novel <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> reduction strategy using direct measurements of the <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> is suggested, reducing implementation time and allowing higher accuracies for <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> reduction. Extensive measurements from the experimental system show the validity of the novel <b>torque</b> <b>ripple</b> reduction strategies. The experimental results allow derivation of a formula for all load situations.
