He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a [...] "wave of electricity", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it.

Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction.

If the current drawn by an active device changes, voltage drops from power supply to device will also change due to these impedances. If several active devices share a common path to the power supply, changes in the current drawn by one element may produce voltage changes large enough to affect the operation of others - voltage spikes or ground bounce, for example - so the change of state of one device is coupled to others through the common impedance to the power supply.

50|$|Undesired or {{unintended}} electric arcing {{can have}} detrimental effects {{on electric power}} transmission, distribution systems and electronic equipment. Devices which may cause arcing include switches, circuit breakers, relay contacts, fuses and poor cable terminations. When an inductive circuit is switched off, the current cannot instantaneously jump to zero: a transient arc will be formed across the separating contacts. Switching devices susceptible to arcing are normally designed to contain and extinguish an arc, and snubber circuits can supply a path for <b>transient</b> <b>currents,</b> preventing arcing. If a circuit has enough current and voltage to sustain an arc formed outside of a switching device, the arc can cause damage to equipment such as melting of conductors, destruction of insulation, and fire. An arc flash describes an explosive electrical event that presents a hazard to people and equipment.|$|E

Additionally, if the timing of interrupter operation is unfavorable {{with respect to the}} ac voltage waveform, when the arc has extinguished but the contacts are still moving and ionization has not yet dissipated in the interrupter, the applied voltage may exceed the withstand voltage of the gap. This can cause reignition of the arc and abrupt <b>transient</b> <b>currents.</b> In either of these cases, oscillations are introduced in the system, and may result in significant overvoltage. Manufacturers of vacuum interrupters address these concerns by selection of contact materials and contact designs selected to minimize current chopping. To protect apparatus from overvoltages, vacuum switchgear assemblies will usually include surge arrester components to prevent damaging over voltage.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{reducing}} the external sodium concentration, [Na]o, on resting potential, action potential, membrane <b>current,</b> and <b>transient</b> <b>current</b> reversal potential in Myxicola giant axons was studied. Tris chloride {{was used as a}} substitute for NaCl. Preliminary experiments were carried out to insure that the effect of Tris substitution could be attributed entirely to the reduction in [Na]o. Both choline and tetramethylammonium chloride were found to have additional effects on the membrane. The <b>transient</b> <b>current</b> is carried largely by Na, while the delayed current seems to be independent of [Na]o. <b>Transient</b> <b>current</b> reversal potential behaves much like a pure Nernst equilibrium potential for sodium. Small deviations from this behavior are consistent with the possibility of some small nonsodium component in the <b>transient</b> <b>current.</b> An exact PNa/PK for the <b>transient</b> <b>current</b> channels could not be computed from these data, but is certainly well greater than unity and possibly quite large. The peak of the action potential varied with [Na]o as expected for a sodium action potential with some substantial potassium permeability at the time of peak. Resting membrane potential is independent of [Na]o. This finding is inconsistent with the view that the resting membrane potential is determined only by the distribution of K and Na, and PNa/PK.

50|$|The {{common and}} simple {{approach}} to current sensing {{is the use}} of a shunt resistor. The voltage drop across the shunt is proportional to its current flow. Both alternating currents (AC) and direct currents (DC) can be measured with the shunt resistor.The high performance coaxial shunt have been widely used for many applications fast rise-time <b>transient</b> <b>currents</b> and high amplitudes but, highly integrated electronic devices prefer low-cost surface mounted devices (SMDs), because of their small sizes and relatively low prices.The parasitic inductance present in the shunt affects high precision current measurement. Although this affects only the magnitude of the impedance at relatively high frequency, but also its effect on the phase at line frequency causes a noticeable error at a low power factor. The low cost and high reliability make the low resistance current shunt a very popular choice for current measurement system. The major disadvantage of using the shunt is that fundamentally a shunt is a resistive element, the power loss is thus proportional to the square of the current passing through it and consequently it is a rarity amongst high current measurements.Fast-response for measuring high-impulse or heavy-surge currents is the common requirement for shunt resistors. In 1981 Malewski, designed a circuit to eliminate the skin effect and later in 1999 the flap-strap sandwich shunt (FSSS) was introduced from a flat-strap sandwich resistor. The properties of the FSSS in terms of response time, power loss and frequency characteristics, are the same as the shunt resistor but the cost is lower and the construction technique is less sophisticated, compared to Malewski and the coaxial shunt.|$|E

While the feed-motor current is related to many physical variables, such as the cutting force and tool wear, we can indicate it as the key variables to monitoring the conditions of the milling process.

The mechanism of transport coupling and voltage dependence in ClC- 5 is unclear. Recently, a transport-deficient ClC- 5 mutant (E 268 A) was shown to exhibit transient capacitive currents.

Even though the <b>transient</b> <b>currents</b> are modulated by extracellular pH, we could exclude that they are generated by proton-binding/unbinding reactions. In contrast, the charge movement showed a nontrivial dependence on external chloride, strongly supporting a model inÂ which the movement of an intrinsic gating charge {{is followed by the}} voltage-dependent low-affinity binding of extracellular chloride ions.
