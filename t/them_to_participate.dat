5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive. Petty {{suspects}} that Eric actually kills women for his snuff films, a suspicion further exacerbated when Rost {{says that he}} will relay Petty's contact information to the women instead of giving their contact information to Petty. It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context. However, {{it is known that}} he spies on them {{for a long period of}} time before asking <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate.</b>|$|E

After Sam's death, Jack clashed with his surviving older brothers, Harry and Albert Warner. He assumed exclusive control of the film production company in the 1950s, when he secretly purchased his brothers' shares in the business after convincing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in a joint sale of stocks.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they are}} members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the {{question}} of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13. The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in politics.|$|E
5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 2013, he {{was named}} in Italy's squad for the 2013 Confederations Cup. In Italy's opening match on 16 June, Balotelli scored a late-winner, helping Italy to beat Mexico 2–1. In Italy's next group match with Japan, Balotelli scored a penalty to make it 3–2 after being 2–0 down in the first half; this was also his tenth goal for Italy, making him the second-youngest player after Giuseppe Meazza to achieve this tally. Italy {{went on to win}} the match 4–3, which allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the semi-finals of the Confederations Cup for the first time in their history. In Italy's final group match against hosts and {{eventual}} champions Brazil, Balotelli set up Emanuele Giaccherini's equaliser with a back-heel, although Italy eventually lost the match 4–2. Prior to the semi-final, Balotelli suffered a thigh injury, preventing him from playing in the remainder of the tournament. Italy finished the tournament in third place after defeating Uruguay in a play-off.|$|E

5|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{predicted}} differences between unbinilium and the other alkaline earth metals is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. The SO interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster—at velocities comparable to the speed of light—than those in lighter atoms. In unbinilium atoms, it lowers the 7p and 8s electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, {{but two of the}} 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The effect is called subshell splitting, as it splits the 7p subshell into more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. Thus, the outer 8s electrons of unbinilium are stabilized and become harder to remove than expected, while the 7p3/2 electrons are correspondingly destabilized, perhaps allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in chemical reactions. This stabilization of the outermost s-orbital (already significant in radium) is the key factor affecting unbinilium's chemistry, and causes all the trends for atomic and molecular properties of alkaline earth metals to reverse direction after barium.|$|E
