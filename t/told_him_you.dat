60|$|BRODIE (same attitude). I {{spoke of}} you as I have found you. (I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> were a disreputable hound, and that Moore had crossed a fight.) I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> were a drunken ass, and Moore an incompetent and dishonest boxer.|$|E
60|$|BENNET. I don't think so. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> {{would be}} here about eleven.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> weren't, he beamed. Honestly, you've {{only got}} to lift your little finger and--Oh, good Lord, there's Algie!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He ses <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>’im</b> <b>you</b> p’isoned ’im," [...] said Henshaw, solemnly, [...] "and ’e {{give you}} two shillings to get {{something}} to cure ’im. It’s too late now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He ses <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> <b>you</b> p'isoned 'im," [...] said Henshaw, solemnly, [...] "and 'e {{give you}} two shillings to get {{something}} to cure 'im. It's too late now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Show <b>him</b> how <b>you</b> can jump," [...] {{interrupted}} Danny Meadow Mouse. [...] "He wouldn't {{believe me}} when I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> didn't fly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, he knew {{exposure}} to the frost would be very dangerous for you; you <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> had been ill," [...] Lucy interposed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought he}} was {{interested}} in you, but I may have been mistaken. Anyway, I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> were taking a siesta {{in a corner of the}} lounge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody except your grandfather: {{he looked}} out of doors once for 'ee. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> were walking round upon the hill {{to look at the}} other bonfires." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doyle was inconsolable when I came {{on board}} {{yesterday}} and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> were going home in the Spartane, and that I {{was to have the}} command." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Nell, look here! You {{ought to}} have shown up your cards without even a call. You {{ought to have}} <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> danced at the Casino." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means, sir," [...] the man replied. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> {{would not}} be back until three or four o'clock, and he is quite content to wait." ...|$|R
60|$|FAG Sir, while I {{was there}} Sir Anthony came in: I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> had {{sent me to}} inquire after his health, and {{to know if he}} was at leisure to see you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew I could {{depend on}} you. I told Emil he needn't think I hadn't got {{somebody}} to go to. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> was a gentleman {{in every sense of}} the word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's an outrage!" [...] was Martell's comment, when Slugger {{had told}} {{of what had}} occurred. [...] "I wouldn't stand for it! No wonder you <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't play on the eleven any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a gentleman}} here, Mr. Coulson, been asking after you," [...] he announced. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> {{generally}} came in about this time. You'll find him sitting over there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear mother, sir, thought well of him." [...] The Duke {{uttered a}} deep sigh and turned again round to the fire. [...] "I always <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> would never consent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And at {{the very}} time was almost living with this woman who says that she is {{divorced}} from her husband in America! Have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> will see <b>him</b> no more?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Papa and mamma {{were both}} as kind as {{possible}} to Philip,' continued Amabel; 'but they {{could not bear to}} enter on that. So I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> had told all, and he was very glad.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; the cabin-boy <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>You</b> see, we are dreadful gossips on the Aroostook,--though {{there are}} so few ladies--" [...] It had slipped from him, but it seemed to have no {{personal}} slant for Lydia.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{first mate}} made me change the course," [...] {{said the man}} who had been at the wheel. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> had said {{southwest}} by south, and he made it south by west." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> what <b>you</b> said, sir, that 'e {{was to give}} me {{something}} to counteract the effects of vegetable poisoning. And that {{it was to be}} very strong, and enough for four." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Fiorsen {{has done}} us the honour to wish to marry <b>you.</b> I've <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> decide such things for yourself. If <b>you</b> accept <b>him,</b> {{it will be}} against my wish, naturally." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For you to dispel, Aunt Kitty. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> {{were the}} best dissipation, and Virginia was of the same mind. Isabel, she says Dynevor Terrace {{is the only place}} she ever wishes to see again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This {{comes from}} your seeing your master {{for two minutes}} on the beach. You are acting now under his orders. No doubt he came with the purpose. Had you <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> were to be here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't alarm yourself. He is a gentleman, {{and when}} I told him I was pledged to secrecy, he made but one inquiry--he asked {{if you were}} a rich man. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> had {{eighteen}} thousand a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} will give you {{anything}} to do, in the evening, Bob. Of course, the Spanish is the principal thing, and I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> {{will have to work}} at that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Glover; {{this will}} be a sort of family party. I have warned Duchesne not to throw himself on your neck, and have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> are to be looked at and not touched." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, miss; I said I was to {{have shown}} <b>him</b> in, if <b>you</b> had been at home. Perhaps I did wrong; I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me when you went out this morning--I said you had gone to read at the Museum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He's had a {{dispatch}} from Government {{to return}} without delay. The fly-boat that brought {{it has gone}} on to Virginia. So Sir Charles has been waiting for you, as I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> were due before the rains." ...|$|E
60|$|My friend Attley, {{who would}} give away {{his own head}} if you <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> had lost yours, was giving away a six-months-old litter of Bettina's pups, and half-a-dozen women were in raptures at the show on Mittleham lawn.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{said that}} nothing--was--going on, when Mr. Gibson--was--. If {{you choose to}} suspect me, Aunt Stanbury, I'll go away. I won't stay here if you suspect me. When Brooke spoke to me, I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right. I just rang up to explain. The fact is, old man, I {{know you}} won't mind, but I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> were {{the author of}} those books I've been reading to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Primeau went on, [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of <b>you</b> and I {{think his}} mind is turned to other things. I {{asked him to come}} to see you this afternoon. Perhaps he will. Perhaps I have lifted his mind from his sorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|A slouching figure, {{supporting}} {{a heap of}} greasy rags, drew near, and a low voice drawled, weakly: [...] "Jack's been here since Friday. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> where <b>you</b> was, but he thought he'd druther lay by my fire than hunt ye." ...|$|R
