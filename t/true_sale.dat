40|$|This paper uses firm-level {{survey data}} matched with {{official}} tax records {{to estimate the}} <b>true</b> <b>sales</b> of formal firms in Mongolia using a multiple-indicators, multiple-causes model (MIMIC). Underreporting in sales to the tax office is calculated by the difference of predicted <b>true</b> <b>sales</b> and tax office sales. A direct approach and an indirect approach are also used to estimate the size of underreporting in sales. The direct approach is based on reported firm-level perceptions of underreporting by the “typical establishment ” in the survey firm’s area of activity. It appears to give a reasonable estimate of mean percent of firm-level underreporting, but is may be less useful {{as an indicator of}} underreporting by individual firms. The indirect approach compares the survey sales with tax office sales and suggests low levels of underreporting to the tax office due to measurement error and underreporting in the survey sales. The MIMIC approach does not rely on perception data, explicitly controls for measurement error, and allows for underreporting in both tax and survey data. According to the MIMIC approach, 37. 7 % (38. 7 %) of aggregate (firm-level) sales is underreported to the tax office and the extent of underreporting varies across firms. Moreover, the evidence shows that also the firm-level survey data suffer from significant underreporting, suggesting that more attention should be paid to measurement error bias in the literature using firm-level survey data...|$|R

Normal repo transactions consisted of selling assets with the obligation of repurchase within a few days. Considered a financing event, these [...] "sold" [...] items stayed on the bank's balance sheet. Repo 105 made use of an accounting rule where, if the assets sold were valued at more than 105% of cash received, the transaction could be called a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> and the assets removed from Lehman's books. $50 billion of assets were removed from the balance sheet in this way, improving their leverage ratio from 13.9 to 12.1 at the time.|$|E

In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments. Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not <b>true</b> <b>sales</b> and should have been treated instead as loans.|$|R

The parties cannot, by the insertion of any mere words, defeat the effect of the transaction as appearing from the whole of the agreement into which they have entered. ... you must look at the agreement as a whole and see what its substantial effect is." [...] In this case, at trial, the Vice Chancellor has been concerned that the clauses in the master agreement under the headings [...] "the right of redemption" [...] and [...] "the discount" [...] were consistent with a mortgage, but not with a <b>true</b> <b>sale.</b> [...] However Dillon LJ took the view that it was wrong to take those clauses in isolation and they needed to be read together with the other clauses relating to sale. He then reviewed various cases which considered the difference between charging interest on a loan, and sales made on a discounted basis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{holder of}} a legal {{mortgage}} also has a power of sale over the assets. Every mortgage contains an implied power of sale. [...] This implied power exists even if the mortgage is not under seal. [...] All mortgages which are made by way of deed also ordinarily contain a power of sale implied by statute, but the exercise of the statutory power {{is limited by the}} terms of the statute. Neither implied power of sale requires a court order, although the court can usually also order a judicial sale. The secured party has a duty to get the best price reasonably obtainable, however, this does not require the sale to be conducted in any particular fashion (i.e. by auction or sealed bids). What the best price reasonably obtainable will be will depend upon the market available for the assets and related considerations. The sale must be a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> - a mortgagee cannot sell to himself, either alone or with others, even for fair value; such a sale may be restrained or set aside or ignored. [...] However, if the court orders a sale pursuant to statute, the mortgagee may be expressly permitted to buy.|$|E
40|$|There are two {{principal}} {{ways in which}} a firm that is owed money payable in the future but needs the money now may use its rights to payment (“receivables”) to obtain the needed financing. It might sell its receivables, or it might borrow and use the receivables as collateral to secure the loan. Different legal consequences follow {{depending on whether the}} transaction is a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> or is a security interest that secures an obligation (a “SISO”). These legal consequences are particularly salient when the firm enters bankruptcy. If the transaction is a sale, then the buyer can collect the receivables as if no bankruptcy had ensued. If, however, the transaction is a SISO, then the receivables can be used by the firm during the bankruptcy and cannot be collected by the secured party unless the bankruptcy court orders otherwise. The bankruptcy consequences of the distinction between a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> and a SISO form the cornerstone of securitization transactions. If the firm enters bankruptcy, creditors have an incentive to argue that a transaction that is structured and documented as a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> creates a SISO in substance and so should be recharacterized as a SISO and treated as such in the bankruptcy. But unless the bankruptcy court treats a securitization transaction as a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> of the receivables, the transaction will not accomplish its intended purpose and the value of the transaction will be diminished. Because a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> and a SISO share many attributes, the distinction between them has proven difficult to draw in securitization and other complex transactions. The existing case law is confused and confusing, and none of the commentators has found an approach to characterization that has been wholly successful. This Article offers a property-based methodology for determining whether a transaction is a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> or a SISO. One must first identify the specific allocation of rights between the purported buyer and seller and then determine whether the seller has retained any meaningful economic interest in the receivables. The property-based approach builds on the analysis of the <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> issue by others and borrows directly from the existing learning, literature, case law, and codification concerning an analogous determination: whether a true lease of goods should be recharacterized as a SISO. By focusing on the essential attributes of a sale and a SISO, the property-based methodology provides a workable way in which to give effect to the policy underlying recharacterization...|$|E

40|$|In May 2014, it was {{discovered}} that Dezheng Resources, a Chinese trading company, had multiple warehouse receipts issued for metal stored in the ports of Qingdao and Penglai in Shandong province. Approximately 400 ’ 000 tons of alumina, aluminium and copper worth around $ 380 million were used to obtain $ 4. 2 billion in financing from 18 Chinese and 7 international banks. The fraud {{was discovered}} {{in the course of a}} government corruption investigation of a Party official. The warehouses have been put under lockdown and have not reopened since. A large part of the financing had been done in the form of commodity repurchase agreements, or repos. These instruments are ownership structures, in which title to the goods and risks pass from the trader to the financier for the duration of the transaction, as opposed to secured lending, in which the goods are pledged to the lender who has a security interest in them. Among the many lawsuits that followed the scandal, the most prominent one was Mercuria v Citibank that was expected to be a test of a key principle of repos, that of the <b>true</b> <b>sale.</b> The objective of this report is to study the consequences of the scandal for commodity repo financing. We start by examining the functioning of these instruments and the context in which the scandal happened. Based on that knowledge, we analyze how Qingdao has affected the use of repos and draw up recommendations regarding the legal and operational aspects of setting up these deals. We find that while in Mercuria v Citibank the issues of <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> and whether it is possible to contract out of attornment to effect delivery were not considered by the judge, the repo structure as such was upheld and remains fundamentally viable. In addition to complying with <b>true</b> <b>sale,</b> the structures should be reviewed by lawyers to ensure that they work across the jurisdictions governing the sale and repurchase contracts and that of the country where the goods are located. In order to reduce the risk of fraud, the lenders should have visibility over the goods’ origin and engage in financing of trading flows that serve to satisfy a real industrial or commercial demand, conduct due diligence on counterparties and warehouses, make use of collateral management agreements and actually visit the storage locations. It is critical not to deal on documentary basis only, but to be aware of the reality of the goods one acquires and the risks to which they are exposed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the economics of financial institutions risk management by exploring how loan securitization a. ects their default risk, their systematic risk, and their stock prices. In a typical CDO transaction a bank retains through a first loss piece a very high proportion of the expected default losses, and transfers only the extreme losses to other market participants. The size of the first loss piece is largely driven by the average default probability of the securitized assets. If the bank sells loans in a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> transaction, it may use the proceeds to to expand its loan business, thereby incurring more systematic risk. We find an increase of the banks' betas, but no significant stock price e. ect around the announcement of a CDO issue.

40|$|Repurchase Agreements (repos) have {{received}} increasing scrutiny {{as a result}} of their involvement in the recent financial crisis. While viewed as an important part of the ‘shadow banking system’ allowing non-banks to access liquidity and expand leverage, the legal and accounting status of most ‘repos’ is still unclear. Meanwhile, the usage of ‘repos’ in the development of emerging financial markets continues to expand, playing a pivotal role in monetary operations and fixed income markets. In this briefing, I discuss the main issues surrounding ‘repos’ in relatively undeveloped markets (EMs 1) including the legal status of the first leg of the ‘repo’ as a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> and the distinction between ‘repos’ and ‘sell-buybacks. ’ I also discuss aspects of EMs that are relevant to the adoption of ‘repos. ’ Primary among these is the thinness of markets, the legal status of ‘repos,’ accounting practices, monetary policy.

40|$|Both {{accounting}} and regulatory treatments classify securitizations as a “sale ” of assets, therefore allowing the issuer {{to remove the}} assets from their books. This “off-balance sheet” treatment relies crucially {{on the concept of}} “true ” sale. The concept most diametrically opposed from a <b>true</b> <b>sale</b> is a “financing. ” The assets do not leave the firm’s books in a financing, so the transaction is exclusively “on-balance sheet. ” The present paper analyzes investor reactions to firms ’ first securitization announcements, postulating that those first announcements are accompanied by investor reactions and changes to firm operating results that are not present in follow-on securitizations. The negative short-term equity returns and negative long-term operating performance following initial securitizations constitute classic evidence suggesting that securitizations are more similar to financings than asset sales. Additional analysis shows that securitization is also associated with increased systematic risk, suggesting that the rapid growth fueled by securitization is similar to taking on substantial additional leverage. The effect is more pronounced for banks than non-banks, suggesting that there is substantial value to regulatory capital arbitrage. Such results suggest securitization is more akin to a financing than a sale...|$|E
