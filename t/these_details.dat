5|$|January 7, 2007: Essjay posts autobiographical {{details on}} his user page at Wikia, giving his {{supposed}} real name (Ryan Jordan), age, and previous employment history from age 19, and his positions within various Wikimedia Foundation projects. <b>These</b> <b>details</b> differ sharply from previous assertions on Essjay's Wikipedia user page about his academic and professional credentials.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{what was}} {{included}} in the committee's report consisted of numerous details that the Convention had never discussed but which the committee correctly viewed as uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged; and as such, much of the committee's proposal would ultimately be incorporated into {{the final version of the}} Constitution without debate. Examples of <b>these</b> <b>details</b> included the Speech and Debate Clause, which grants members of Congress immunity for comments made in their jobs, and the rules for organizing the House of Representatives and the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The second {{adaptation}} of the Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk trilogy, Sang Penari required two years of research to better present the historical context, including the 30 September Movement and ensuing anti-communist actions; <b>these</b> <b>details,</b> censored in the original trilogy by the New Order government, were more explicit than in the novels. Although the film was set and shot in Purwokerto, Central Java, neither of the leads was ethnic Javanese. Nasution, cast in her debut role, is Batak, while Antara is Balinese.|$|E

5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of <b>these</b> <b>details</b> suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|Initially, experts {{determined}} the manuscript was genuine, as the date Horse picked matched {{the time period}} Horne had been alive and active, and the manuscript's topics matched the poet's interests. Horse had written the manuscript without knowing any of <b>these</b> <b>details.</b> After his hoax was discovered, Horse held onto the text for the next decade, until he played Myst and 7th Guest and decided the point-and-click adventure genre was a good match for his conspiracy theory-inspired ideas. He later {{said that while the}} story of Myst did not interest him, the game's artwork and the sense of immersion inspired him to immediately begin working on Drowned God in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Next came {{a career}} as chief purser on cargo and {{passenger}} ships travelling to South America, Europe, and Asia. In the 1930s, German and British passengers expressed fears about the Nazis, and military officers told him that Germany was equipping for war. Buckles witnessed antisemitism and its effects firsthand while ashore in Germany, and he warned acquaintances in Germany that their country would be brought down by Adolf Hitler, whom he encountered at a German hotel. Employed at sea during the Great Depression, he forwarded an $800 Army bonus to his father who was struggling as a farmer in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl (Buckles provided <b>these</b> <b>details</b> many decades later).|$|E

5|$|Numerous easter {{eggs and}} secrets {{were added to}} the game to fuel the {{exploration}} efforts and wild speculation of many gamers. One of the most notable features is the pieces of cheese hidden on every level. These were deliberately placed by one of the game's artists as a graphical oddity for the player's confusion. The face of actor Robin Williams was used for Daniel Carrington, while the face of Shigeru Miyamoto along with faces of other Nintendo executives and game journalists can be seen on enemy guards and as selectable avatars in the multiplayer mode. The ranking system of the Combat Simulator awards a special username and password to skilled players. Rare had originally intended <b>these</b> <b>details</b> to allow access to password-protected parts of the official Perfect Dark website, but these sections were never implemented.|$|E
5|$|Pennant's next publication, in 1774, was {{his account}} of the second journey to Scotland. This was in two volumes with the second {{appearing}} in 1776. These works include so much detail of the countryside, its economy, natural history and the customs of the inhabitants that they are still of interest today by way of comparison with the very different state of things now. While these volumes were in preparation, he started some new projects. In 1773 he returned to Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire to visit the parts of them that he had missed previously. As with all his tours, he travelled on horseback, keeping his daily journal and accompanied by Moses Griffith who made copious sketches on the way. Pennant seems to have been an unpretentious man of simple tastes, who was welcomed into the homes of strangers wherever he went. He also made tours in Northamptonshire and the Isle of Man. Whenever he travelled to London he took a slightly different route, again recording what he saw and did and on the basis of <b>these</b> <b>details,</b> some years later he wrote his Journey from Chester to London. On one of these journeys, the church he visited at Buckingham in the morning collapsed into ruins that evening.|$|E
5|$|The other {{text that}} seems to support the case for Arthur's {{historical}} existence is the 10th-century Annales Cambriae, which also link Arthur with the Battle of Badon. The Annales date this battle to 516–518, and also mention the Battle of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) were both killed, dated to 537–539. <b>These</b> <b>details</b> have often been used to bolster confidence in the Historias account and to confirm that Arthur really did fight at Badon. Problems have been identified, however, with using this source to support the Historia Brittonums account. The latest {{research shows that the}} Annales Cambriae was based on a chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales. Additionally, the complex textual history of the Annales Cambriae precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it even that early. They were more likely added {{at some point in the}} 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals. The Badon entry probably derived from the Historia Brittonum.|$|E

5|$|The {{severing}} of workers' hands achieved particular international notoriety. These {{were sometimes}} {{cut off by}} rogue Force Publique soldiers who were made to account for every shot they fired by bringing back {{the hands of their}} victims. <b>These</b> <b>details</b> were recorded by Christian missionaries working in the Congo and caused public outrage when they were made known to the public in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the United States and elsewhere. An international campaign against the Congo Free State began in 1890 and reached its apogee after 1900 under the leadership of the British activist E. D. Morel. In 1908, as a result of international pressure, the Belgian government annexed the Congo Free State to form the Belgian Congo, and ended many of the systems responsible for the abuses. The size of the population decline during the period is the subject of extensive historiographical debate, and there is an open debate as to whether the atrocities constitute genocide.|$|E

25|$|Another theory {{explaining}} {{the existence of}} the seacoast in Bohemia offered by C. H. Herford is suggested in Shakespeare's chosen title of the play. A winter's tale is something associated with parents telling children stories of legends around a fireside: by using this title, it implies to the audience that <b>these</b> <b>details</b> should not be taken too seriously.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Greek names also {{follow the}} pattern, with epithets (similar to second names) only used {{subsequently}} by historians to avoid confusion, {{as in the}} case of Zeno the Stoic and Zeno of Elea; likewise, patronymics or other biographic details (such as city of origin, or another city the individual was associated with, borough, occupation) were used to specify whom one was talking about, but <b>these</b> <b>details</b> were not considered part of the name.|$|E
25|$|In 1963 Martin {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of creating a computer data bank of apologetics information. The concept was subsequently framed under the acronym SENT/EAST (Electronic Answering Search Technology). In 1968 a symposium of scholars was convened in Austria where the plans for CRI's computerised apologetics data bank were presented in lectures by Martin and John Warwick Montgomery. Much of <b>these</b> <b>details</b> were reported in Christianity Today and then in Montgomery's book Computers, Cultural Change and the Christ.|$|E
25|$|Seaxwulf (before 676– c. 692) was the {{founding}} abbot of the Mercian monastery of Medeshamstede, {{and an early}} medieval bishop of Mercia. Very little is known of him beyond <b>these</b> <b>details,</b> drawn from sources such as Bede's Ecclesiastical History. Some further information was written down in the 12th century at Peterborough Abbey, as Medeshamstede was known by that time. This suggests that {{he began his career}} as a nobleman, and that he may have had royal connections outside Mercia.|$|E
