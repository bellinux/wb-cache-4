5|$|In 1998, Duncan was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} last two players for the United States national team for the World Basketball Championship. However, this team was later replaced with CBA and college players because of the NBA lockout. Duncan's first chance at playing for the national team came in 1999 when he was called up to the Olympic Qualifying Team. He averaged 12.7 ppg, 9.1 rpg and 2.4 bpg and led the team to a 10–0 finish en route to a qualifying berth for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but a knee injury forced him <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Olympic Games themselves.|$|E
5|$|It was {{becoming}} clear that federal intervention {{was required to}} settle the dispute, despite the general policy of the Grant administration <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who requested help from federal troops to combat regular waves of election year violence, with little compassion for the issues they faced. Grant and the United States Attorney General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred the dispute back to the State Legislature.|$|E
5|$|Many {{emerging}} {{nations of}} Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected {{the pressure to}} choose sides in the East-West competition. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War. The consensus reached at Bandung culminated {{with the creation of}} the Belgrade-headquartered Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states. Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.|$|E

5|$|On May 1, 2009, Paul {{said that}} if Bunning, whose {{fundraising}} in 2009 matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election, declined to seek a third term, he would almost certainly run in the Republican Party primary to succeed him, and formed an exploratory committee soon after, while still promising <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race if Bunning ultimately {{decided to run for}} reelection.

5|$|The border war {{escalated}} in 1777 after British {{officials in}} Detroit began recruiting and arming Indian war parties to raid the frontier American settlements. An {{unknown number of}} American settlers in present Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania were killed during these raids. The intensity of the conflict increased in November 1777, after enraged American militiamen murdered Cornstalk, the leading advocate of Shawnee neutrality. Despite the violence, many Ohio Indians still hoped <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, which proved difficult because they were located directly between the British in Detroit and the Americans along the Ohio River.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks. To discourage {{the spread of the}} uprising, Cass promptly invited Native Americans in the region to come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance {{that the only way to}} avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with other Native leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Quackenbush {{became a}} fan {{favourite}} upon {{his arrival in}} Boston, where his offensive style of play was compared to former Bruin (and fellow Hall of Famer) Eddie Shore. In his first season in Boston, Quackenbush scored 8 goals and 25 points. He continued <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penalty box, registering only 4 penalty minutes. However, it {{marked the first time}} in three seasons that he was not named to the NHL All-Star Team. The Bruins defence core was depleted by injury in 1950–51, forcing the team to use several first year players. While this resulted in Quackenbush having to play more minutes, including a game where he played 55 minutes, it also gave him the opportunity to play with his brother Max. It was the only time the two played professionally together. He also set a career high in points with 29 and was again named a First Team NHL All-Star. Over the next five seasons Quackenbush hovered around the 20 point mark and was never assessed more than 8 penalty minutes in a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was tasked with {{the protection of}} the oil fields at Ploiești, which were vital to the German war effort. They trained some Romanian officers in German Panzer tactics. Apart from training and maintaining their equipment, the soldiers had nothing to do and became bored. In March 1941 Strachwitz was sent back to Cosel in Germany where a new replacement unit was to be founded. He returned via his home town and 24 hours later a telegram from Hube called him back. This was preceded by a series of events in Belgrade. On 25 March 1941, the government of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia had signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'état led by Air Force commander General Dušan Simović. As a result, Hitler chose not only to support Mussolini's ambitions in Albania and in the Greco-Italian War but also to attack Yugoslavia. For this purpose the mobilized forces of Panzergruppe I (1st Panzer Group) under the command of Generaloberst Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist were ordered to attack Belgrade in what would become the Invasion of Yugoslavia.|$|E
