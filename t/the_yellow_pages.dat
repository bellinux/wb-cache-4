500|$|Prior to acting, LaBeouf practiced comedy {{around his}} {{neighborhood}} as an [...] "escape" [...] from a hostile environment. At age 10, he began performing stand-up at comedy clubs, describing his appeal as having [...] "disgustingly dirty" [...] material and a [...] "50-year-old mouth on the 10-year-old kid." [...] He subsequently found an agent through <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>Pages</b> {{and was taken}} on after pretending to be his own manager. LaBeouf {{has said that he}} initially became an actor because his family was broke, not because he wanted to pursue an acting career, having originally gotten the idea from a child actor he met who had things he wanted.|$|E
500|$|Hutcherson's {{interest}} in acting {{developed as a}} child despite his parents' concerns about the profession. According to the actor himself, he had [...] "loved the entertainment industry" [...] {{from the age of}} four. His father said that his son was compelled to perform for people from a very young age, possessing a personality that attracted people's attention. His mother said that he [...] "bugged us so much" [...] into becoming an actor, but believed it was a phase he was going through and would grow out of. Aged eight, Hutcherson went through <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>pages</b> and contacted an acting agency. In January 2002, he and his mother met acting coach Bob Luke, who travelled from New York City to Kentucky to meet them. Luke advised them to go to Los Angeles and begin auditioning Hutcherson for TV pilots. At the time, his only acting experience had been in a Kroger television commercial and a Vacation Bible School training film. For three years, Hutcherson and his mother lived in Los Angeles' Oakwood apartments, a housing community that accommodates young child actors and their families.|$|E

500|$|He {{looked through}} <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>Pages</b> {{for jobs and}} played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Germany, due to {{its high}} number of {{registered}} users, PlanetRomeo is often called the [...] "Gay Registry Office" [...] (schwules Einwohnermeldeamt) or [...] "The Blue pages" [...] (Die blauen Seiten), referring to the well known telephone directories <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>pages</b> and the white pages. In a satirical reference to the Nazis' compilation of lists of homosexual men in the 1930s, the German newspaper [...] "Taz" [...] announced: [...] "The pink lists are back".|$|E

2500|$|When Numan was 15 years old, {{his father}} {{bought him a}} Gibson Les Paul, which he regards as his most treasured possession.

60|$|They {{both of them}} passed {{much time}} in Europe. They lived just {{on the verge of}} that Old World from which we are {{drifting}} away so swiftly. They were familiar with many varieties of men and fortune. Their lot brought them into contact with personages of whom we read only in books, who seem alive, as I read in the Virginians' letters regarding them, whose voices I almost fancy I hear, as I read <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>pages</b> written scores of years since, blotted with the boyish tears of disappointed passion, dutifully despatched after famous balls and ceremonies of the grand Old World, scribbled by camp-fires, or out of prison; nay, there is one that has a bullet through it, and of which a greater portion of the text is blotted out with the blood of the bearer.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} he was up, bright and early, poring over the {{manuscript}} with the sharpened wits of the new day, peering into its night, into its old, blurred, forgotten dream; and, indeed, he had been dreaming about it, and was fully possessed with the idea that, in his dream, he had taken up the inscrutable document, and read it off as glibly as he would the page of a modern drama, in a continual rapture with the deep truth that it made clear to his comprehension, and the lucid {{way in which it}} evolved the mode in which man might be restored to his originally undying state. So strong was the impression, that when he unfolded the manuscript, it was with almost the belief that the crabbed old handwriting would be plain to him. Such did not prove to be the case, however; so far from it, that poor Septimius in vain turned over <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>pages</b> in quest of the one sentence which he had been able, or fancied he had been able, to read yesterday. The illumination that had brought it out was now faded, and all was a blur, an inscrutableness, a scrawl of unintelligible characters alike. So much did this affect him, that he had almost a mind to tear it into a thousand fragments, and scatter it out of the window to the west-wind, that was then blowing past the house; and if, in that summer season, there had been a fire on the hearth, it is possible that easy realization of a destructive impulse might have incited him to fling the accursed scrawl into the hottest of the flames, and thus returned it to the Devil, who, he suspected, was the original author of it. Had he done so, what strange and gloomy passages would I have been spared the pain of relating! How different would have been the life of Septimius,--a thoughtful preacher of God's word, taking severe but conscientious views of man's state and relations, a heavy-browed walker and worker on earth, and, finally, a slumberer in an honored grave, with an epitaph bearing testimony to his great usefulness in his generation.|$|E
