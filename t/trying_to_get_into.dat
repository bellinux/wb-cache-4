25|$|Also in 2012, Disney Mobile {{launched}} a mobile game titled Where's My Perry? for iOS and Android. It {{was based on}} Disney's popular Where's My Water? game, using similar physics. In this game, Agent P is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> O.W.C.A. headquarters but the transport tubes are out, so he needs water for the backup underground hydrogenerators. If you struggle or get stuck, Major Monogram and Carl will offer encouragement while Doofenshmirtz will taunt him. Phineas and Ferb never appear in the game except in the opening splash screen. The game was expanded to include levels featuring Doofenshmirtz and other animal agents. The game has a 4.0 rating on iTunes, but has not been updated {{in more than a}} year.|$|E
25|$|After {{the game}} at Northam the MCC preceded to Perth where Yardley led them in a one-day game against the Western Australian Colts, mostly 20-year-olds <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the Western Australian team. The Colts won the toss and put the MCC into bat. Cyril Washbrook made 25 before he was lbw to William Alderman, the father of Terry Alderman. The wicketkeeper Paul Gibb opened with Washbrook as Hammond wanted him to bat at number three in the Tests and made 51, adding 63 for the first wicket. Laurie Fishlock (50) and Norman Yardley (31 not out) added 73 for the fourth wicket and the MCC {{declared}} at 197/4. Dick Pollard and Bill Voce had the Colts 7/2, but they recovered, with Wally Langdon making 48 and though wickets fell steadily they survived the day on 138/6.|$|E

He's a force of nature, like Patrick." [...] Writer Jay Lender said, describing Fagerbakke in the recording studio, [...] "Bill Fagerbakke is the most thoughtful performer I've ever seen in the booth—he was always asking questions and really <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the mindset, such as it is, of Patrick." [...] Writer Kent Osborne said of Fagerbakke, [...] "He is this big guy, and he plays Patrick so well. He's just this big guy, and he lumbers around." [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "I'm clumsy. I'm goofy. I make mistakes all the time" [...] and agreed that [...] "I guess I'm a lot of Patrick." ...|$|E

500|$|Greer was {{notified}} {{of the position}} by her agent while shooting for a separate film. [...] "I'd been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> voiceovers," [...] she explained, [...] "so they called {{and said it was}} a pilot they were doing for FX, and I could record the part on my day off in 10 minutes." [...] The actress read the script and recorded her lines at a recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona; upon first glance, Greer suggested that the raunchy and risque nature of the script would prevent any television stations from picking up the series. [...] "So when I found out it was picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' And I went, 'Really?' So then I recorded a bunch of them, and the scripts were the funniest scripts that I've ever read, and so crazy." ...|$|E

[...] "God Send Death" [...] and [...] "Deviance" [...] take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on serial killers, Hanneman came to the conclusion he could only kill someone if they really [...] "pissed him off", and decided he was unable to kill someone he did not know just for power. He later admitted he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> that person's mind; [...] "why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. I just wanted to get into that mindset." ...|$|E

Lorelei, a model who did public {{appearances}} for WLUP and who was very popular in Chicago that summer for her sexually provocative poses in the station's advertisements, threw out the first pitch. As the first game began, Mike Veeck got word that {{thousands of people were}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the park without tickets. [...] He sent his security personnel to the stadium gates to keep the would-be gate crashers at bay. This left the field unattended, and fans began throwing the uncollected disco LPs and singles from the stands. [...] Tigers designated hitter Rusty Staub remembered that the records would slice through the air, and land sticking out of the ground. [...] He urged teammates to wear batting helmets when playing their positions, [...] "It wasn't just one, it was many. [...] Oh, God almighty, I've never seen anything so dangerous in my life." [...] Attendees also threw firecrackers, empty liquor bottles, and lighters onto the field. The game was stopped several times because of the rain of foreign objects.|$|E

500|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the [...] season, two 90-minute practice sessions were held on Friday and another 60-minute session was held before qualifying on Saturday. In {{the first session}} on Friday morning, Nico Rosberg set the fastest time at 1:07.373. The projected fast lap times were confirmed as Rosberg's time was faster than the previous fastest time set on the track by Michael Schumacher in 2003. Rosberg finished more than three-tenths of a second clear of teammate Lewis Hamilton, with Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen third and fourth respectively, the only other drivers within a second of Rosberg. There were several minor incidents during the session, including Hamilton spinning at turn 3, causing Romain Grosjean {{to go into a}} spin behind him when trying to avoid hitting him. Rosberg also went off the track at the same corner later in the session. Daniel Ricciardo posted the fifth-fastest time, but was lucky to escape a situation in which Marcus Ericsson got sideways while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the pitlane entry at turn 8. The revised kerbs of the track caught several drivers out, among them Max Verstappen who lost parts of his front wing when leaving the track at turn 8. Later on, he made contact with the kerbs again in turn 6, damaging his suspension, causing him to end the session early.|$|E
500|$|At 20:00, Phát and Thảo met Kỳ in {{a meeting}} at Bien Hoa Air Base {{organized}} by the Americans, and insisted on Khánh's removal from power. The coup collapsed when, between midnight and dawn, anti-Thảo forces swept into the city from the south along with some components of the 7th Airborne Brigade loyal to Kỳ from Bien Hoa in the north. Whether the rebels were genuinely defeated by the overwhelming show of strength or whether a deal was struck to end the revolt in exchange for Khánh's ouster is disputed, although a large majority support the latter. According to the second version, Phát and Thảo agreed to free {{the members of the}} Armed Forces Council they had arrested and withdraw in exchange for Khánh’s complete removal from power. Possibly as a means of saving face, Phát and Thảo were also given an appointment with the figurehead chief of state Sửu, who was under the close control of the junta, to [...] "order" [...] him to sign a decree stripping Khánh of the leadership of the military and organizing a meeting of the junta and Prime Minister Quát's civilian cabinet. During the early morning, while the radio station was still {{in the hands of the}} rebels, a message attributed to Sửu was read out; it announced Khánh's removal. However, the authenticity of the announcement was put into doubt when paratroopers wrested control of the station from the rebels and Sửu then spoke in person, saying he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> contact with both factions and convince them to eschew bloodshed. Later the radio station played a pre-recorded speech by Khánh claiming he had regained control of the situation. There were no injuries or deaths in the coup.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{different}} versions {{on how the}} shooting began: some say it began when [...] "Mama Maquín" [...] -an important peasant leader- pushed a soldier who was in her way; others argue that it started because people kept pushing <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the municipality, which was interpreted by the soldiers as an aggression. The mayor at the time, Walter Overdick, said that [...] "people of {{the middle of the}} group pushed those who in front."

2500|$|Hancock re-recorded {{the tune}} for Head Hunters (1973), {{combining}} synthesizers with a Sly Stone and James Brown funk influence, adding an eight-bar section. Hancock described his composition [...] "Chameleon", also from Head Hunters, to Down Beat magazine in 1979: [...] "In the popular forms of funk, which I've been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into,</b> the attention {{is on the}} rhythmic interplay between different instruments. The part the Clavinet plays has to fit with the part the drums play and the line the bass plays and the line that the guitar plays. It's almost like African drummers where seven drummers play different parts"; [...] "Watermelon Man" [...] shares a similar construction. A live version was released on the double LP Flood (1975), recorded in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|At sixteen, then {{living on}} her own, Streisand's youth and {{ambition}} worked in her favor, but she lacked a mature woman's physical features which were needed for serious female roles. She therefore took various menial jobs {{to have some}} income. At one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping {{at the home of}} friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around to save on rent expense. When desperate, she would return to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother would be horrified by her daughter's [...] "gypsy-like lifestyle," [...] wrote biographer Karen Swenson, and again begged her to give up <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> show business; but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: [...] "My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to my mother that I could be a star." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hitchens was an antitheist, {{and said}} that a person [...] "could be an atheist and wish that belief in God were correct," [...] but that [...] "an antitheist, a term I'm <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> circulation, is someone who is {{relieved}} that there's no evidence for such an assertion." [...] He often spoke against the Abrahamic religions. When asked by readers of The Independent (London) what he {{considered to be the}} [...] "axis of evil", Hitchens replied [...] "Christianity, Judaism, Islam—the three leading monotheisms." [...] Hitchens was raised nominally Christian, and went to Christian boarding schools, but from an early age declined to participate in communal prayers. Later in life, Hitchens discovered that he was of Jewish descent on his mother's side. Hitchens's Jewish-born ancestors were immigrants from Eastern Europe (including Poland). In a 2010 interview at New York Public Library, Hitchens stated that he was against infant circumcision.|$|E
2500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{the second}} single {{released}} from the album.

It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how that one thing you can keep returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song she was thinking about The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the people on that show, and that they are desperate enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E
2500|$|Britvic, who had {{acquired}} the Tango brand in 1988, {{were looking to}} radicalize Tango's image and advertising. They hired London-based advertising agency Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners (HHCL) to create a brand new television advertisement for the brand, which would {{form the basis of}} a new advertising campaign. HHCL, who had been operating since 1987, had earned a reputation in the business for breaking several norms in advertising and established a avant-garde theme in 1989, when, in launching the direct banking service, First Direct, aired two advertisements simultaneously on ITV and Channel 4, interrupting an Audi advert, one offering an optimistic and the other a pessimistic view, and a number of short, surreal spots in which the visual had little or {{nothing to do with the}} message. Orange Man was created by HHCL, using their staff Trevor Robinson OBE as art director, Al Young as copywriter, John Leach as planner, Axle Chaldecott and Steve Henry as creative directors and Matt Forrest as director. Production company Limelight also worked on the project. Robinson and Young were creative partners, and were [...] "pretty anti-advertising in [...] mindsets" [...] at the time because of their boredom and frustration with the industry norm of [...] "cause and effect advertising", and were desperate to make a name for themselves after [...] "spending what felt like eons <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a West End agency." ...|$|E
