5|$|In the 1968–69 season, third-year defenceman Bobby Orr scored 21goals {{to set an}} NHL {{record for}} goals by a defenceman en route to winning his first of eight {{consecutive}} Norris Trophies as the league's top defenceman. At the same time, Orr's teammate, Phil Esposito, became the first player in league history to score 100 points in a season, finishing with 126points. A gifted scorer, Orr revolutionized defencemen's impact on the offensive part of the game, as blue-liners began to be judged on how well they created goals in addition <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> they prevented them. Orr twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading scorer, the only defenceman in NHL history to do so. Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career; he played 12seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in 1978. Orr finished with 270goals and 915points in 657games, and he won the Hart Memorial Trophy as league Most Valuable Player thrice.|$|E

He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States {{to be a part}} of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate. Biden was given an 85percent lifetime approval rating from AFL-CIO, and he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E

According <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> a person does in sanctioned play, a player is given a rating that is {{adjusted}} periodically to maintain competitive matches. For example, the United States Tennis Association administers the National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP), which rates players between 1.0 and 7.0 in 1/2 point increments. Average club players under this system would rate 3.0–4.5 while world class players would be 7.0 on this scale.|$|E
25|$|As {{an attempt}} to correct some of the error due to a non-zero , the usage of local linear {{weighted}} regression with ABC to reduce the variance of the posterior estimates has been suggested. The method assigns weights to the parameters according <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> simulated summaries adhere to the observed ones and performs linear regression between the summaries and the weighted parameters {{in the vicinity of}} observed summaries. The obtained regression coefficients are used to correct sampled parameters in the direction of observed summaries. An improvement was suggested in the form of nonlinear regression using a feed-forward neural network model. However, {{it has been shown that}} the posterior distributions obtained with these approaches are not always consistent with the prior distribution, which did lead to a reformulation of the regression adjustment that respects the prior distribution.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{resolution}} of an fMRI study refers <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> it discriminates between nearby locations. It {{is measured by}} the size of voxels, as in MRI. A voxel is a three-dimensional rectangular cuboid, whose dimensions are set by the slice thickness, the area of a slice, and the grid imposed on the slice by the scanning process. Full-brain studies use larger voxels, while those that focus on specific regions of interest typically use smaller sizes. Sizes range from 4 to 5mm to 1mm. Smaller voxels contain fewer neurons on average, incorporate less blood flow, and hence have less signal than larger voxels. Smaller voxels imply longer scanning times, since scanning time directly rises with the number of voxels per slice and the number of slices. This can lead both to discomfort for the subject inside the scanner and to loss of the magnetization signal. A voxel typically contains a few million neurons and tens of billions of synapses, with the actual number depending on voxel size and the area of the brain being imaged.|$|E

25|$|The {{acids in}} wine are an {{important}} component in both winemaking and the finished product of wine. They are present in both grapes and wine, having direct influences on the color, balance and taste of the wine {{as well as the}} growth and vitality of yeast during fermentation and protecting the wine from bacteria. The measure of the amount of acidity in wine is known as the “titratable acidity” or “total acidity”, which refers to the test that yields the total of all acids present, while strength of acidity is measured according to pH, with most wines having a pH between 2.9 and 3.9. Generally, the lower the pH, the higher the acidity in the wine. However, there is no direct connection between total acidity and pH (it is possible to find wines with a high pH for wine and high acidity). In wine tasting, the term “acidity” refers to the fresh, tart and sour attributes of the wine which are evaluated in relation <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> the acidity balances out the sweetness and bitter components of the wine such as tannins. Three primary acids are found in wine grapes: tartaric, malic and citric acids. During the course of winemaking and in the finished wines, acetic, butyric, lactic and succinic acids can play significant roles. Most of the acids involved with wine are fixed acids with the notable exception of acetic acid, mostly found in vinegar, which is volatile and can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity. Sometimes, additional acids, such as ascorbic, sorbic and sulfurous acids, are used in winemaking.|$|E
