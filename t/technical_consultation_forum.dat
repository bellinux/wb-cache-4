Police-public <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> can ‘civilize’ policing – in the sense Loader and Walker (2007) use the term – by contributing to police reform, democratic policing, and police legitimacy. Using the case of Edinburgh, Scotland, the achievements of police-public <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> for reform, democratic policing, and legitimacy, are examined and an argument made that <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> can make positive contributions {{in each of these}} areas. However, the example of <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> also reveals significant conceptual and structural limitations to the ideas of reform, democracy, and legitimacy when applied to the police. These limitations are articulated using the social theory of Simmel, Weber, and Lukes: Simmel and Weber reveal the inflexibility and non-negotiable aspects of the police that defies reform and democratic ambitions; Lukes provides an important precautionary perspective on the ‘democraticness’ of democratic devices; and, comparing Lukes with the work of Weber provides a view on legitimacy that reveals advanced complexities to ‘police legitimacy’. In sum, police-public <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> contribute to ‘civilizing policing’, but it is also useful to reflect and consider the non-negotiable limits the ‘form’ of the police applies to possible positive change...|$|R
