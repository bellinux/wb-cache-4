60|$|Look, gentlemen, to the WHOLE TENOUR of your member's conduct. Try {{whether his}} {{ambition}} or his avarice have jostled {{him out of}} the straight line of duty; or whether that grand foe of the offices of active life, that master vice in men of business, a degenerate and inglorious sloth--has made him flag and languish in his course. This is the object of our inquiry. If our member's conduct can bear this <b>touch,</b> <b>mark</b> it for sterling. He may have fallen into errors; he must have faults; but our error is greater, and our fault is radically ruinous to ourselves, if we do not bear, if we do not even applaud, the whole compound and mixed mass of such a character. Not to act thus is folly; I had almost said it is impiety. He censures God, who quarrels with the imperfections of man.|$|E
60|$|But {{it is no}} reason, {{because there}} is a bad mode of inquiry, {{that there should be no}} {{examination}} at all. Most certainly it is our duty to examine; it is our interest, too: but it must be with discretion, with an attention to all the circumstances and to all the motives; like sound judges, and not like cavilling pettifoggers and quibbling pleaders, prying into flaws and hunting for exceptions.

60|$|The {{pigs and}} poultry were already {{at work on the}} game that was so liberally thrown in their way, and Mark felt indebted to these {{scavengers}} for aiding him in what he perceived was now a task indispensable to his comfort. After going to the ship, and breaking his fast, he returned to the crater, obtained a wheelbarrow, and set to work in earnest to collect the fish, which a very few hours' exposure to the sun of that climate would render so offensive as to make the island next to intolerable. Never in his life did our young friend work harder than he did all that morning. Each load of fish, as it was-wheeled into the crater, was thrown into a trench already prepared for that purpose, and the ashes were hauled over it, by means of the hoe. Feeling the necessity of occupation to lessen his sorrow, {{as well as that of}} getting rid of pestilence, which he seriously apprehended from this inroad of animal substances, Mark toiled two whole days at this work, until fairly driven from it by the intolerable effluvium which arose, notwithstanding all he had done, on every side of the island. It is impossible to say what would have been consequences had not the birds come, in thousands, to his relief. They made quick work of it, clearing off the fish in numbers that would be nearly incredible. As it was, however, our young hermit was driven into the ship, where-he passed a whole week, the steadiness of the trades driving the disagreeable odours to leeward. At the end of that time he ventured ashore, where he found it possible to remain, though the Reef did not get purified for more than a month. Finding a great many fish still remaining that neither hog nor bird would <b>touch,</b> <b>Mark</b> made a couple of voyages to Loam Island, whence he brought two cargoes of the deposit, and landed at the usual place. This he wheeled about the Reef, throwing two or three-shovels full on each offensive creature, thus getting rid of the effluvium and preparing a considerable store of excellent manure for his future husbandry. It may be as well said here, that, at odd times, he threw these little deposits into large heaps, and subsequently wheeled them into the crater, where they were mixed with the principal pile of compost that had now been, for months, collecting there.|$|E

5000|$|Alongside the building, James {{had another}} venture. In 1802, his sister Susanna had married Samuel Cocks, a master Pewterer in the City of London.

2500|$|Gallup {{expanded}} {{the study by}} manipulating the chimpanzees' appearance and observing their reaction to their reflection in the mirror. [...] Gallup anaesthetised the chimpanzees and then painted a red alcohol-soluble dye on the eyebrow ridge and on {{the top half of}} the opposite ear. [...] When the dye dried, it had virtually no olfactory or tactile cues. [...] Gallup then returned the chimpanzees to the cage (with the mirror removed) and allowed them to regain full consciousness. [...] He then recorded the frequency with which the chimpanzees spontaneously <b>touched</b> the <b>marked</b> areas of skin. After 30 minutes, the mirror was re-introduced into the room and the frequency of <b>touching</b> the <b>marked</b> areas again determined. [...] The frequency of touching increased to 4–10 with the mirror present, compared to only 1 when the mirror had been removed. [...] The chimpanzees sometimes inspected their fingers visually or olfactorily after <b>touching</b> the <b>marks.</b> [...] Other mark-directed behaviour includes turning and adjusting of the body to better view the mark in the mirror, or tactile examination of the mark with an appendage while viewing the mirror.|$|R

2500|$|In a MSR test, animals may not {{recognise}} {{the mark}} as abnormal, or, {{may not be}} sufficiently motivated to react to it. [...] However, {{this does not mean}} they are unable to recognise themselves. For example, in a MSR test conducted on three elephants, only one elephant passed the test but the two elephants that failed still demonstrated behaviours that can be interpreted as self-recognition. The researchers commented that the elephants might not have <b>touched</b> the <b>mark</b> because it was not important enough to them. [...] Similarly, lesser apes infrequently engage in self-grooming, which may explain their failure to <b>touch</b> a <b>mark</b> on their head in the mirror test.|$|R

Olive had recovered herself, reminded herself that she was safe, that her companion in New York had repudiated, denounced her pursuer; and, as a proof to her own sense of her security, as well as a <b>touching</b> <b>mark</b> to Verena that now, after what had passed, she had no fear, she felt that a certain light mockery would be effective.|$|R

25|$|Some {{disagree}} with these findings, {{arguing that the}} results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can <b>touch</b> the <b>mark</b> or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely <b>touch</b> the <b>mark</b> on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.|$|R

Critics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting social responses to another dolphin.
