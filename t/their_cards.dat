5|$|Counterfeit {{copies of}} cards issued by {{legitimate}} publications can be made. Issuers of cards have taken measures to prevent counterfeiting of <b>their</b> <b>cards,</b> creating cards with holographic foil blocking, signature strips, and tamper-resistant lamination.|$|E
5|$|Effective October 1, 2013, {{the price}} of the card was reduced to $2, the rebate program was discontinued, and the maximum {{permitted}} negative balance upon exit was set at $1.50, with riders who would exceed this being required to use the Exitfare machines to add value to <b>their</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2015, at {{the initial}} stage, card holders of first {{generation}} cardholder may voluntarily replace <b>their</b> <b>cards</b> at Octopus Service Point without charge. In 2017, the final call on card replacement is launched by Octopus company, or first generation card will be unusable by stages starting from 2018 January. Cardholder can replace these cards without charge at MTR or KMB Customer Service Centre, and Octopus Service Point.|$|E
5000|$|Riders {{are allowed}} to share <b>their</b> <b>card</b> with other users, {{provided}} they tap the fare gate's card reader repeatedly for each person that is using the card.This can lead to single riders being double-charged a fare if they tap <b>their</b> <b>card</b> multiple times by mistake[...]|$|R
50|$|Metrobus users {{only have}} to tap <b>their</b> Easy <b>Card</b> or Easy Ticket once on a fare {{validator}} when boarding a bus. Metrorail users have to tap <b>their</b> <b>card</b> or ticket when entering the faregates for a Metrorail station, as well as when leaving them. Tri-Rail users have to tap <b>their</b> <b>card</b> or ticket on ticket validators found at every Tri-Rail station platform prior to entering and after exiting a train.|$|R
5000|$|To find <b>their</b> <b>card,</b> {{you take}} <b>their</b> number and {{subtract}} 1 {{to get the}} number on the card. The suite is based on the second number. 4 for Spades, 3 for Hearts, 2 for Clubs, and 1 for Diamonds. For example, if their number is 64, then <b>their</b> <b>card</b> would be the 5 of Spades.|$|R
5|$|Starting September 1, 2012, Metro began {{offering}} $3 rebates to customers who registered <b>their</b> <b>cards</b> online after purchase. The cards still cost $5, but a $3 credit was refunded to the card {{five days after}} first use. Also starting Sep 1, riders have been required to have a minimum balance of $1.20 on their SmarTrip cards (35¢ for half-fare senior/disabled cards) in order to enter the Metrorail system, which reduced the possible negative balance upon exit.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007 it {{was found}} that when {{customers}} added value to <b>their</b> <b>cards</b> at self-service add-value points located in MTR and Light rail stations, their bank accounts were debited even if the transactions had been cancelled. Octopus Cards Limited claimed that the fault was due to an upgrade of communication systems. Initially, two cases were reported. The company then announced that the use of the payment system, Electronic Payment Services (EPS), at add-value service points would be suspended until further notice, and that it had started an investigation into the reasons for the problem.|$|E
5|$|Making or {{recording}} a payment using the card for public transport or purchases at Octopus-enabled retailers {{can be done}} by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away. The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card. Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second. When using the MTR system, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate <b>their</b> <b>cards</b> again at the exit point.|$|E
5000|$|A {{customer}} {{must have}} enough credit on <b>their</b> Leap <b>card</b> {{to pay for}} the maximum distance when tagging on: when they tag-on this maximum amount is deducted from <b>their</b> <b>card</b> and only when tagging-off the actual journey price is calculated and the [...] "overpay" [...] is returned to <b>their</b> <b>card.</b> If one forgets to tag-off they will pay the maximum fare. To allow for this one has a hidden credit on the card: this 'hidden credit' allows one to tag-on whenever they have any visible credit on <b>their</b> <b>card.</b> For example, when a terminal shows that one has 25 cents on the card they can still use it for a Luas journey. The next time the card is reloaded, it starts with a negative balance.|$|R

5000|$|In this round, Monkhouse asked toss-up {{questions}} on the buzzer, open to all. A correct answer allowed a player to light up the number {{in one corner of}} <b>their</b> <b>card,</b> while a miss caused them to become penalized, or [...] "wallied" [...] - in this case, unable to buzz-in on the next question. The first player to light all four corners of <b>their</b> <b>card</b> won the round.|$|R
5|$|Octopus {{card reader}} {{includes}} a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction {{when more than}} one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending <b>their</b> <b>cards</b> have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E
5|$|SmarTrip cards {{comply with}} the ISO/IEC 14443 Type B standard. A {{microchip}} contained within the card stores its value, {{as well as the}} rider’s most recent entry and exit points, and a unique identifier. However, the unique identifier is not linked to a person’s name or identity, unless one registers the card online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should the card be lost, stolen, or damaged. The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers to subsidize employee transportation costs tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to <b>their</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enemies appear on-screen, and can {{be engaged}} by {{clicking}} on them. During the player's turn, three cards are randomly drawn from a deck of nine, each resulting in an attack. If the cards' combined strength and attached skills are insufficient to exhaust the enemy's HP, the heartless will counterattack. If the player survives this attack, or continues by spending additional AP, a new turn begins. Upon defeating an enemy, the player earns Lux (which unlocks rewards as it accumulates, but resets weekly), experience points (through which the player advances in level), and Munny (an in-game currency). The player also earns Fragments, cards based on the characters original to the Kingdom Hearts series and those from Disney and Final Fantasy franchises: the fragments are imbued with different properties depending on the character, such as physical or elemental strikes. Players can level up <b>their</b> <b>cards</b> to improve their attack and defense. Players can strengthen their Keyblade using materials found in each world, and new Keyblades are acquired as the story progresses. Each strengthens different types of cards; for example, Starlight is an all-around Keyblade offering boosts for Power-, Speed- and Magic-type cards, while the Snow White-inspired Treasure Trove is Power-type focused.|$|E

5|$|When {{all four}} cards of the trick {{are on the}} table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards {{of the other two}} suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the {{declarations}} are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare <b>their</b> <b>cards,</b> the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt {{at the start of the}} next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands.|$|E
25|$|All {{cars are}} also {{equipped}} with Clipper card readers near each entrance, which riders may use to tag <b>their</b> <b>cards</b> {{to pay their}} fare. The cards themselves are then used as proof of payment; fare inspectors carry handheld card readers that can verify that payment was made. In subway stations, riders instead tag <b>their</b> <b>cards</b> on the faregates {{to gain access to}} the platforms.|$|E
25|$|Nil In The Dark: A {{player who}} bids Nil In The Dark shuffles <b>their</b> <b>cards</b> {{and puts them}} face {{down in front of}} them in a stack. When it is their play, they take the top card and throw it into the pile. The scoring counts the same as Blind Nil. A player may also go Blind Nil In The Dark where they never even look at <b>their</b> <b>cards.</b> This is scored the same as a Big Mo. Nil In The Dark is usually only bid if they have no trump cards.|$|E

25|$|Boston On Fire: Also {{known as}} Blind Moon or a Grand Slam. This is a blind bid {{to take all}} tricks in a hand, made before either partner has looked at <b>their</b> <b>cards.</b> Again, {{the first team to}} bid either Double Blind Nil or Blind Moon has precedence.|$|E
25|$|Blind 6: This must be {{declared}} by a side before either partner looks at <b>their</b> <b>cards.</b> It scores 120 points if the side takes exactly six tricks. If they take some other number of tricks they lose 120. It is also commonly played that the side must win {{at least six}} tricks and overtricks are not counted, or that failing to make six tricks only loses 60.|$|E
50|$|If {{a player}} forgets or hesitates {{to draw a}} card after they have played, the next player may quickly play <b>their</b> <b>card</b> and draw, {{preventing}} the player from drawing and thus eliminating a <b>card</b> from <b>their</b> hand. This can greatly harm the player, {{especially if they are}} already holding O'No 99 cards. A player may correct their error and draw a card at any point before the next player draws <b>their</b> <b>card,</b> even if that player has already played.|$|R
