During the same year, NBN began a <b>teletext</b> service and also purchased the free local newspaper, the Newcastle Star. In 1981, Hadjoin Pty.

5|$|National {{legislation}} {{requires that}} all television programmes broadcasts in Croatia {{are made in}} Croatian language or with appropriate translations either using dubbing or subtitling. In general, all foreign programming is subtitled, except for cartoons and narrated parts of documentaries and similar programmes. An attempt to change this was made by Nova TV in 2006, when a soap opera was dubbed, but the move provoked negative response from viewers and critics, causing the experiment to be abandoned. The legislation does not provide for mutually intelligible languages. That led to formal requests made by the Electronic Media Council demanding language localisation of television programmes made in Serbian language. Ultimately, that issue was resolved through subtitling using <b>teletext</b> service normally used for closed captioning.|$|E
5|$|The Zagreb TV centre {{became a}} member of the Yugoslav Radio Television (JRT) (an {{umbrella}} organization of television stations in Yugoslavia), acting as Eurovision Technical Centre for the JRT. In 1972 Television Zagreb began broadcasting of its second channel, and switched to airing its programming in color in 1975. The third Television Zagreb channel was introduced in 1988, and <b>teletext</b> service was launched in 1990. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, Television Zagreb was renamed Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) and it {{became a member}} of the European Broadcasting Union; however, HRT suffered significant war damage to its infrastructure as 80 percent of its transmitters and 30 relay stations were damaged, destroyed or occupied. In October 1999 all three nationwide HRT channels started broadcasting around the clock, but in 2002 the third HRT channel ceased operation. Nova TV, the first privately owned television station in Croatia, began operating in 2000. It was followed by another privately owned broadcaster, RTL Televizija, on 30 April 2004. Both Nova TV and RTL Televizija aired a single analog TV channel each.|$|E

25|$|A <b>Teletext</b> capable {{television}} was usually required to receive <b>Teletext.</b> With {{the arrival of}} digital television services such as Freeview, <b>Teletext</b> could be received through a Freeview decoder.

25|$|It {{is closely}} linked to the PAL {{broadcast}} system used in Europe. Other <b>teletext</b> systems have been developed to work with the SECAM and NTSC systems, but <b>teletext</b> failed to gain widespread acceptance in North America and other areas where NTSC is used. In contrast, <b>teletext</b> is nearly ubiquitous across Europe as well as some other regions, with most major broadcasters providing a <b>teletext</b> service. Common <b>teletext</b> services include TV schedules, regularly updated current affairs and sport news, simple games (such as quizzes) and subtitles (or closed captioning).|$|E
50|$|Despite the band's {{confidence}} {{that it would}} place in the top 10, the single entered the charts on October 29, 2006, at number 35. <b>Teletext's</b> Planet Sound reported on November 6, 2006, that the band had split up after confrontation with their record company.|$|R
50|$|Digitiser frequented courted controversy, inspiring {{criticism}} {{both from}} outside groups and <b>Teletexts</b> own editorial team, who viewed the writers as troublemakers but {{were unable to}} axe them due to the magazines popularity.

25|$|The first <b>teletext</b> test {{transmissions}} {{were made}} by Ceefax in 1973. After proliferation of the BBC system in the UK, it was adopted in Europe and standardised as World System <b>Teletext</b> (WST). The World Wide Web began to take {{over some of the}} functions of <b>teletext</b> from the late 1990s and many broadcasters have ceased broadcast of teletext—CNN in 2006 and the BBC in 2012. In the UK the decline of <b>teletext</b> has been hastened by the introduction of digital television, though an aspect of <b>teletext</b> continues in closed captioning. In other countries the system is still widely used on standard-definition DVB broadcasts.|$|E

25|$|TVNZ began a <b>teletext</b> {{service in}} 1984 {{originally}} {{with the intention}} to help New Zealand's deaf community get improved access to news and information. A captioning service was available for certain television shows and could be accessed by browsing to page 801. The TVNZ <b>Teletext</b> service could be received on all TVNZ channels and the TVNZ service could be received on TV3 including captioning of some TV3 shows. Trackside also operated a <b>Teletext</b> service called TAB Text which only displayed the racing pages of <b>Teletext.</b>|$|E

Nothing emerged from this rumour.|$|R
5000|$|Gossi the Dog - Perhaps Digitisers most {{controversial}} character, Gossi hosted a regular gaming gossip page. On one occasion, the Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld a complaint about the Gossi page, which alluded to Gossis master thrashing the talking cartoon {{dog with a}} belt. Gossis page also led to the dismissal of Tim Moore, who - while Rose was away on paternity leave - printed an unsubstantiated rumour about a fellow games journalist Dave Perry. [...] <b>Teletexts</b> editors allegedly used the absence of Rose (who remained useful to the company for his graphic design abilities), and the journalists complaint, {{as an excuse to}} fire Moore.|$|R

[...] "The Agent" [...] was Number 6 in Planet Sound's top 50 singles of 2006. The band played acoustic sets at several HMV stores around the UK to promote the single. It reached number 117 in the official UK Singles Chart on sales of the 7" [...] vinyl alone.|$|R
25|$|Despite this, {{the system}} never caught {{on in the}} USA partly due to EIA-608 being {{deployed}} for captioning before <b>Teletext</b> was introduced and the higher cost of <b>Teletext</b> receivers.|$|E
25|$|Adoption in the United States was {{hampered}} {{due to a}} lack of {{a single}} <b>teletext</b> standard and consumer resistance to the high initial price of <b>teletext</b> decoders. Throughout the period of analogue broadcasting, <b>teletext</b> or other similar technologies in the US were practically non-existent, with the only technologies resembling such existing in the country being closed captioning, TV Guide On Screen, and Extended Data Services (XDS).|$|E
25|$|Mode 7 was a <b>Teletext</b> mode, {{extremely}} economical {{on memory}} and an original requirement {{due to the}} BBC's own use of broadcast <b>teletext</b> (Ceefax). It also made the computer useful as a Prestel terminal. The <b>teletext</b> characters were generated on board, for use with monitors and TV sets without a <b>Teletext</b> receiver. Train time displays at UK stations were driven by BBC Master computers in this mode until around the late 1990s. Mode 7 used only 1 KB for video RAM by storing each character as its ASCII code, rather than its bitmap image as was needed for the other modes.|$|E
50|$|Earls {{became a}} writer for <b>Teletext's</b> music section, Planet Sound, 18 months after joining the company.

With a suitable adapter, the computer could receive and display <b>teletext</b> pages, as well as software over the BBC's Ceefax service, for a time. The Philips P2000 homecomputer's video logic was also based on a chip designed to provide <b>teletext</b> services in TVs.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} <b>teletext</b> {{services}} have been syndicated to web viewers, which mimic {{the look and}} feel of broadcast <b>teletext.</b> RSS feeds of news and information from the BBC are presented in Ceefax format in the web viewer at PagesFromCeefax.net.|$|E
25|$|United Kingdom: {{the founder}} of the world's first <b>teletext</b> service, the BBC which closed its Ceefax service in 2012 when Britain adopted a fully digital {{television}} broadcast system. Elsewhere in the country the full service is no longer carried on any digital television services, although many channels on Sky still broadcast <b>teletext</b> subtitles and may still have a small number of active pages. <b>Teletext</b> ended in each region after analogue broadcasts finished. See Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} a more complex type of {{television}} remote control came in 1973, {{with the development of}} the Ceefax <b>teletext</b> service by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off. This type of control did not meet the needs of <b>teletext</b> sets, where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control to select <b>teletext</b> pages would need buttons for each numeral from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text to picture, and the normal television controls of volume, channel, brightness, colour intensity, etc. Early <b>teletext</b> sets used wired remote controls to select pages, but the continuous use of the remote control required for <b>teletext</b> quickly indicated the need for a wireless device. So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers, which led to early prototypes in around 1977–1978 that could control many more functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication.|$|E
25|$|Various {{other kinds}} of {{information}} are sent over the <b>teletext</b> protocol. For instance, Programme Delivery Control signals—used by video recorders for starting/stopping recording at the correct time even during changes in programming—are sent as <b>teletext</b> packets. A similar, but different, standard Video Programming System is also used for this purpose.|$|E
