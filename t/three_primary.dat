5|$|Over {{time the}} festival has had various {{financial}} supporters, <b>three</b> <b>primary</b> locations and one name change.

5000|$|The {{coefficients}} {{represent the}} measured intensity perception of typical trichromat humans, {{depending on the}} primaries being used; in particular, human vision is most sensitive to green and least sensitive to blue. To encode grayscale intensity in linear RGB, each of the <b>three</b> <b>primaries</b> can be set to equal the calculated linear luminance [...] (replacing R,G,B by Y,Y,Y to get this linear grayscale). Linear luminance typically needs to be gamma compressed {{to get back to}} a conventional non-linear representation.

5|$|The Panavia Tornado is {{a family}} of twin-engine, variable-sweep wing multirole combat aircraft, which was jointly {{developed}} and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom, and West Germany.

5|$|The {{original}} music {{score was}} written by Danny Elfman, a frequent collaborator with director Tim Burton. Elfman's score is based around <b>three</b> <b>primary</b> themes: a gentle family theme for the Buckets, generally set in upper woodwinds; a mystical, string-driven waltz for Willy Wonka; and a hyper-upbeat factory theme for full orchestra, Elfman's homemade synthesizer samples and the diminutive chanting voices of the Oompa-Loompas.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{color is}} defined as the {{wavelengths}} of the emitted light, combining RGB colors means adding light (thus the term [...] "additive color"), and the combinations are brighter.

5|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; McPherson writes that it {{is something of a}} national myth to Americans as a people.

The Heart of a Woman has <b>three</b> <b>primary</b> settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.|$|E
5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. This portion of the planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its <b>three</b> <b>primary</b> planet-finding missions.|$|E
5|$|As he {{developed}} the series, Kishimoto created the <b>three</b> <b>primary</b> characters {{as a basis for}} the designs of the other three-person teams. He also used characters in other shōnen manga as references in his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications. The characters that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous shōnen characters, although many publications lamented the perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of the characters was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto's work in the manga and anime adaptations.|$|E

A massless fourth body moves under the Newtonian gravitational law due to the <b>three</b> <b>primaries,</b> as in the Restricted three-body problem (R 3 BP), the fourth mass {{does not affect the}} motion of the <b>three</b> <b>primaries.</b> In this paper we explore symmetric periodic orbits of the restricted four-body problem (R 4 BP) for the case of two equal masses where they satisfy approximately the Routh's critical value.

All three airports opened on 4 May 1963, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Services were at first operated by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). At first the airline used 56-passenger Convair CV-440 Metropolitan aircraft, which flew flights south to Oslo in combination with flights to Alta and Kirkenes—from 1964 also to Tromsø. The general route scheme of flying multi-legged flights from Oslo to Finnmark would remain until 1990.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} {{methods that}} rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the <b>three</b> <b>primary</b> fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods. Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 {{there were}} only <b>three</b> <b>primary</b> schools in Bintulu. These schools {{provided}} classes until Primary3 level. There were no secondary schools. Villagers could pursue their secondary school studies at either Miri or Kuching by using small boats as there were no roads connecting Bintulu to either Miri or Kuching. Bintulu Government Secondary School was opened in 1964. In 1967 Bintulu celebrated the first 100 years of the Council Negri meeting (Sarawak State Legislative Assembly). A stone monument was built {{in front of a}} government rice storeroom to commemorate the event. Bintulu was a sub-district of Miri Division in the 1970s.

Dr. Feldheim, a psychiatrist, uses hypnosis to help Nemo recall some of his memories, while Nemo relates other memories to a journalist. As he is prodded, Nemo makes contradictory statements. He recounts his life at <b>three</b> <b>primary</b> points: at age 9, when his parents divorced, at age 15 when he fell in love, and at age 34 as an adult.

Austrian Michael Gspurning was brought in as Keller's replacement in 2012. After two seasons Gspurning and the Sounders FC front office were unable {{to come to an}} agreement on a contract and Gspurning was released. Toronto FC traded Stefan Frei to the Sounders in December 2013. Frei would be the first choice goalkeeper for the Sounders from the 2014 season to present.|$|E
