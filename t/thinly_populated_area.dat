The highway heads a short distance to the north, passing a <b>thinly</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> in Shoreham, as intermittent forest yields to fields and farmlands. After [...] from the border, VT74 intersects with VT73 before encountering Barnum Hill Road. [...] Near the Barnum Hill intersection, VT74 passes developed areas and bends more toward the north. VT74 then turns to the northeast at Smith Street and enters a patch of forest. Afterward VT74 climbs a hill and intersects with Harrington Hill Road where it turns northward once again.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundBreastfeeding {{rates are}} lower among infants living {{in rural areas}} of the United States, yet there are limited data on whether {{hospital}} breastfeeding support differs between rural and urban areas. ObjectiveThis study aimed to describe whether maternity care practices supportive of breastfeeding vary by level of urbanization. MethodsWe linked data from the 2007, 2009, and 2011 Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) surveys with Rural-Urban Continuum Codes to categorize hospital counties as metropolitan urbanized, nonmetropolitan urbanized, less urbanized, and <b>thinly</b> <b>populated.</b> ResultsFrom 2007 to 2011, the average hospital mPINC score, a composite quality score ranging from 0 to 100, increased from 64 to 71 in metropolitan urbanized counties and from 54 to 65 in <b>thinly</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas.</b> Scores were lowest in <b>thinly</b> <b>populated</b> counties in 2007 and 2009 and in less urbanized counties in 2011. Examination of 2011 mPINC scores by 7 domains of care revealed that hospitals in less urbanized counties had lower scores than those in metropolitan urbanized counties for feeding of breastfed infants, breastfeeding assistance, staff training, and structural and organizational aspects of care delivery; for 3 of these practices, scores were 10 or more points lower 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 dbreastfeeding assistance, structural and organizational aspects of care, and staff training. In contrast, hospitals in <b>thinly</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> had higher scores than in metropolitan areas for mother 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cinfant contact and facility discharge care; differences were less than 10 points. ConclusionInterventions that specifically target rural hospitals may reduce the gap in access to hospital maternity care practices supportive of breastfeeding by population density.

50|$|The <b>thinly</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> brought little {{traffic to}} the railway and tourist traffic {{declined}} {{also in the}} middle {{decades of the twentieth}} century. The rise of motor buses accelerated the loss of passenger business, and on 1 October 1951 the line closed between Balquhidder and Comrie. However the track remained in situ until 1959 as the line was used sporadically throughout the 1950s to transport materials to the Glen Lednock hydro-electric schemes under construction in the area.|$|E

50|$|Route 58 between Santa Margarita and Buttonwillow is {{a winding}} {{mountain}} road through a <b>thinly</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area.</b> From its westernmost terminus at US 101 near Santa Margarita, Route 58 heads east along the former US 101 (El Camino Real) for one mile, where Route 58 splits from El Camino Real. Route 58 then heads east {{and up the}} winding mountain road, passing through <b>thinly</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> and an intersection with State Route 229. Alternatives such as State Route 46 to the north or State Route 166 to the south are recommended, as much of this section of Route 58 is prohibited to truck traffic. However, this section of SR 58 does pass through the Carrizo Plain, which {{is known for its}} scenic beauty and geological features, including the San Andreas Fault. Route 58 then takes another winding road before joining with State Route 33 {{in the small town of}} McKittrick. Route 33 then splits at the north end of McKittrick before Route 58 then enters another, but brief winding road. Route 58 then proceeds northeast for several miles before changing to an east-west alignment and reaching Buttonwillow. A few miles later, Route 58 has an interchange with Interstate 5. Approximately 7 mi east of Interstate 5, Route 58 briefly joins State Route 43 before continuing east and eventually reaching the Bakersfield city limits.|$|E
