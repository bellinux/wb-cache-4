40|$|EMPLOYER MOBILITY PLANS: ACCEPTABILITY, EFFICIENCY AND COSTS The {{concentrated}} {{and repeated}} nature of commuting traffic offers action potentials to control or {{reduce the number}} of single-occupant vehicles commuting during the peak hours. As source of the home-to-work journeys, the companies have a ringside seat to promote sustainable mobility and the last years paid an always growing attention to that mobility issue. Though, the research literature have brought only few attention to the employer mobility plans (EMPs) implemented by the companies. The question about the effectiveness of the measure taken by the companies remains so open, as well as questions about their costs and benefits to the company. What is the impact of EMPs? Do they change the commuting behaviour of the workers? What are their costs and benefits for a company? Hence, the main objective of this paper is twofold: first evaluating the effectiveness of policy measures making up EMPs, and secondly assessing their costs and benefits at the company level. To achieve this aim 60 employees <b>transport</b> <b>coordinators</b> (ETCs) will be interviewed. Even if the literature is almost silent about this topic, the paper starts with a state of the art of the literature. This will help top define the different concepts and to classify the policy measures companies can take. The latter are called either push or pull measures. The Belgian home to work travels survey conducted every 3 years by the FPS Mobility and Transport will then be presented. This survey is focused on the companies located in Belgium and employing at least 100 workers. The database contains 8820 workplaces. Each record describes the commuting behaviour of the employees as well as the mobility policy that is implemented by the firm. The database will be used to identify clusters of companies, based on the success of the implemented EMP. Considering this criteria, it comes out that only few EMPs can be considered as successful. ETCs of the latter will then be interviewed to lead to an in-depth understanding of the causes and effects of EMPs...|$|R

30|$|The {{results from}} the Alltransport–Onninen case {{indicate}} that green dimensions are basically not {{taken into account in}} the relationship. The <b>transport</b> <b>coordinator</b> at Onninen mentions that the shipper has demands on environmentally high-quality vehicles, which is closely related to the previously identified green practice vehicle technologies. Further, Onninen wants Alltransport to be environmentally certified according to ISO 14001, i.e. have an environmental management system, which is the corresponding general environmental practice. The Alltransport representatives, however, do not mention any environmental demands from Onninen. Similarly to the Alltransport–Holmen case, the findings from the Alltransport–Onninen case also suggest that Onninen are convinced that Alltransport works with environmental issues and that, in addition, Onninen to some extent take environmental practices as given, since they believe them to also decrease Alltransport’s costs.|$|E
40|$|The renewed {{interest}} for sustainable transport in Europe is often labelled as mobility management. With this, major attention goes towards {{the role of}} employers in the commuting behaviour of their employees. Indeed, employers can encourage a more sustainable commuting by the promotion of alternative modes, like public transport, carpooling and/or cycling, by the designation of an Employee <b>Transport</b> <b>Coordinator,</b> through their location policy, and/or by adapting work schedules and the organisation of telework. An overview of these measures is followed by {{an analysis of the}} Belgian situation. The Belgian 2005 questionnaire Home-to-Work-Travel (HTWT) enables us to make an inventory of mobility management in Belgium. The database HTWT contains information on 7460 worksites. Besides having data on modal split, work regimes and accessibility problems, 38 different mobility management measures ar...|$|E
40|$|Lessons {{learned of}} {{developed}} countries present that essential factor of economic develop- ment is the rationalization of supplies flow organization supported by information and finances flow. It concerns both to Micro and Macrosystems and covers all the economy. The need for continuous improvement {{of a system}} of supplies, information and money flow is perceived in these countries, whereas special point is made of the organization of these flow within effective logistics systems. The logistics as a field of study and a practice researching, developing and implementing the latest solution in this field is effective tool for making companies and the whole economy more efficient. Logistics system is designated organized and integrated – in the scope of economy system – flow of goods and products through configurations of nodes and routes. Nationwide logistics system covers the whole economy and the whole country territory. Visible elements of such system are logistics center that forms organized nodes (platforms) or sections of broadly defined scope of services and contractors where router and warehouse-transport terminals cross as well as telemetry sources of market information. The OCL GET is for sure the most interesting initiative of great importance for a town but most of all for the modernization of logistics infrastructure on the territory of Poland. Its formation shall contribute to the improvement of transport and communication problems. The OCL holding the position of <b>transport</b> <b>coordinator</b> shall influence on better relations between vehicle and rail transport and increase in the application of Odra transport capabilities. There is lots of arguments to undertake such actions. There are examples of positive relations in Europe. It should be an incentive for supporting such initiatives that attempt to change quite poor image of logistics infrastructure in Poland where logistics centers do not meet European standards...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{travel plan}} {{designed}} for the O 2 is described in this case study as the teaching materials to help student understand {{how to make a}} travel plan for a newly developed leisure venue and the factors to be considered in making the plan. It illustrates how to design multimode transportation and mode split for passenger travel. It also allows students to consider environmental protection issues when developing a green travel plan for a new area. Design/methodology/approach This case is mainly secondary research and compiled from published resources about The O 2, survey outcomes and monitoring reports provided by Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) (2006, 2007), as well as other relevant literature. Findings The travel plan is developed with comprehensive targets and a monitoring programme to encourage environmentally sustainable travel choices by visitors to the O 2, and devised a coordinated approach {{for the benefit of the}} environment around the O 2. Key strategies proposed in the travel plan include the appointment of a full time <b>transport</b> <b>coordinator</b> to work with partnership organisations, including the London Borough of Greenwich (LBG), Transport for London (TfL) and other transport operators, improvements to bus and underground services and a new river service from central London. What is original/value of paper The travel plan endeavours to encourage environmentally sustainable travel choices by visitors to the O 2. The value of describing the travel plan in the case brings the readers a coordinated approach for the benefit of the environment around the O 2. This seeks to encourage visitors to the O 2 to use alternative modes to the private car or make more efficient use of existing modes and to introduce the health benefits of more sustainable travel...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presented}} in this thesis investigates the impact of using Social Justice Pedagogy in teaching Practical Numeracy to Diploma Foundation Students, in Abu Dhabi Women’s College (ADWC), of the Higher Colleges of Technology, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Gutstein’s (Gutstein, 2003, 2006 a, 2007) framework for teaching mathematics for Social Justice was utilised. His framework had both social justice goals and mathematics goals. Productive Pedagogical principle (Mills, et al., 2009) was utilised as a framework to reflect on teaching practices in this study. In order to achieve credibility and validity in data collection and interpretation of results, triangulation method was utilised in accordance with (Cooper 2001), and grounded theory for analysis, in accordance with Strauss and Corbin (1998), and Charmaz (2008). There were twenty participants in this research. Their ages ranged from sixteen top thirty-six years {{and all of them}} were among the body of students whom I taught (class DF 203). Three students’ projects were completed in this research work, namely Time of Travel (TT), Career Aspirations (CA) and Car Parking (CP). The topics were chosen based on individual participant’s interest after brain-storming sessions in my class and all dealt with one or more issues that have social justice implications. The TT project group investigated ways in which the transport, provided by the college, could be improved – they utilised mathematics as a tool to understand the challenges they face and made recommendations to the college <b>Transport</b> <b>Coordinator</b> on how to change and / or improve this very important aspect of their college life. The action taken by the TT project group contributed to a change in college start times from 7 : 30 am to 8 : 30 am for the students at Abu Dhabi Women’s College (ADWC). The CP project group thought the parking allocation at ADWC was unfair (teachers have more space per head than students). Therefore, they used mathematics as a tool to investigate the car parking space allocation at ADWC. It was also {{as a result of the}} actions taken by the CP project group that students’ car parking space was significantly increased at ADWC. The CA project group used mathematics as a tool to investigate and inform the College Career Coordinator on how informed, or otherwise, the students in the Diploma Foundations (DF) at ADWC were, with regard to the career opportunities available to them. Similarly, as a result of the action taken by the CA group, Career Fairs at ADWC now feature information on part-time jobs and not only on full-time jobs as was the case before this project. For my students the Social Justice Pedagogy employed within their classroom gave them unprecedented insight into their learning processes. For the first time they took responsibility for learning outcomes rather than have them dictated by their teacher mentor or, equally common, their reference to the answer section at the back of a text book! By applying mathematics to their everyday lives it suddenly became relevant to them and they realised the potential which it could have for changing often long-established norms. Equally, it was both interesting and salutary for me, the researcher, to be made aware, through frequent discussion with the students, just how limiting the social and cultural constraints are within the society of which the students are a part (McIntosh, 14 th November, 1990). It is reasonable to assert that, limited in scope though the research has been; it has, nonetheless, supported the assertions of those who had hitherto engaged in the same field and it has also added to the limited literature available on the teaching of Mathematics for Social Justice...|$|E
