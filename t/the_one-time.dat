5|$|Berkman {{was born}} in Vilna in the Russian Empire (present-day Vilnius, Lithuania) and emigrated to the United States in 1888. He lived in New York City, where he became {{involved}} in the anarchist movement. He was <b>the</b> <b>one-time</b> lover and lifelong friend of anarchist Emma Goldman. In 1892, undertaking an act of propaganda of the deed, Berkman made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate businessman Henry Clay Frick, for which he served 14 years in prison. His experience in prison was the basis for his first book, Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles (born April 30, 1983) is {{a common}} chimpanzee, known for being <b>the</b> <b>one-time</b> {{companion}} animal of American recording artist Michael Jackson, who bought the primate from a Texas research facility in the early 1980s. The animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and, among other factors, a public perception of Jackson as eccentric. During the Bad world tour, for example, Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan, where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} season, Bowen started in all 82 regular season {{games for the}} second time in his career and {{averaged}} 7.1 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 31.3 minutes per game. Again, he was voted into the All-Defensive Second Team and was a member of the Spurs team which won the 2003 NBA Finals. At age 31, <b>the</b> <b>one-time</b> journeyman Bowen had won his first championship ring as a starter. In the following three seasons, Bowen established a reputation as one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA, earning three straight All-Defensive First Team elections and ending as runner-up in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award votings twice, losing to post defender Ben Wallace.|$|E

5|$|The East Germanic Goths and Gepids, {{who lived}} in {{sedentary}} communities, were the first new arrivals. The Goths dominated Moldavia and Wallachia from the 290s, and parts of Transylvania from the 330s. Their power collapsed under attacks by the nomadic Huns in 376. The Huns controlled Eastern and Central Europe from around 400, but their empire disintegrated in 454. Thereafter the regions west of the Carpathian MountainsBanat, Crişana, and Transylvaniaand Oltenia were dominated by the Gepids. Within a century, the lands east of the mountains became important centers of the Antes and Sclavenes. Hydronyms and place names of Slavic origin also prove <b>the</b> <b>one-time</b> presence of Early Slavs in the regions west of the Carpathians.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 2013, Hooper scored {{his first}} Premier League goal from the penalty spot against West Ham United at Carrow Road {{to level the}} scores at 1–1. Norwich City won the match 3–1, with Hooper being voted as Man of the Match. Due to this goal, {{he became the first}} player to score in the top 4 {{divisions}} of the English league, the top division of the Scottish League and two cup competitions in each country, as well as the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. Hooper scored his second Premier League goal and fourth goal in all competitions in just his seventh start for Norwich City, on 30 November 2013 against Crystal Palace, which Norwich City won 1–0 for a vital 3 points. On 7 December, Hooper scored his fifth Norwich City goal and third Premier League goal against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, a first time angled shot across goalkeeper Boaz Myhill into the corner after a through ball from Leroy Fer, the match ended in a 0–2 Norwich City victory. On 15 December, Hooper scored in consecutive Premier League matches, <b>the</b> <b>one-time</b> Scunthorpe United frontman took one touch on his chest after a Johan Elmander lay off, before hitting a superb volley 30 yards out over Michel Vorm and into the roof of the net, levelling the score at 1–1. Hooper would score again on the Boxing Day fixture against Fulham as his shot deflected off of Aaron Hughes and past goalkeeper David Stockdale, thus making Hooper the first ever Norwich City player to score in four successive Premier League matches at Carrow Road.|$|E

One-time {{transaction}} numbers have been recently proposed to enhance the security in credit card payment. Following this idea, we use a hash function in generation of one-time credit card numbers: <b>The</b> next <b>one-time</b> number is computed by hashing <b>the</b> current <b>one-time</b> number with a secret that is known only by card holder and issuer.

25|$|Gilbert Vernam {{tried to}} repair the broken cipher (creating the Vernam-Vigenère cipher in 1918), but, {{no matter what he}} did, the cipher was still {{vulnerable}} to cryptanalysis.

5000|$|<b>The</b> next <b>one-time</b> pad {{system was}} electrical. In 1917, Gilbert Vernam (of AT&T Corporation) invented and later {{patented}} in 1919 (...) a cipher based on teleprinter technology. Each {{character in a}} message was electrically combined with a character on a paper tape key. Joseph Mauborgne (then a captain in the U.S. Army and later chief of the Signal Corps) recognized that the character sequence on the key tape could be completely random and that, if so, cryptanalysis would be more difficult. Together they invented <b>the</b> first <b>one-time</b> tape system.|$|R
