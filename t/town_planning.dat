5|$|Following {{the quake}} {{a program of}} {{rebuilding}} was rapidly put into action, but before it began in earnest some important decisions would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments. The Viceroy, the Duke of Camastra, aware of new trends in <b>town</b> <b>planning,</b> decreed that rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets, the new rebuilding would offer piazze and wider main streets, often on a rational grid system. The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a perfect square or a hexagon, typical of Renaissance and Baroque <b>town</b> <b>planning.</b> The city of Grammichele represents an example of these new cities rebuilted with a hexagonal plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{exceeded the}} acceptable plot ratio in the <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> scheme, however the Perth City Council pre-approved the plans nonetheless, {{on the condition}} that Bond Corporation kept the Palace Hotel operating as a hotel.|$|E
5|$|While the {{movement}} had its greatest {{level of success}} in Sweden, {{there were a number}} of other important Danish proponents including Ivar Bentsen, Kaare Klint, Arne Jacobsen, Carl Petersen and Steen Eiler Rasmussen. Bentsen, with the assistance of Thorkild Henningsen, designed Denmark's first terraced houses in the Bellahøj district of Copenhagen. Very appropriately Klint, working with Bentsen, adapted the design of Frederiks Hospital to serve as the Danish Museum of Art & Design. Carl Petersen's main achievement was the Faaborg Museum built for collections of art from Funen. Steen Rasmussen is remembered above all for his <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> activities and for his contributions to the Dansk Byplanlaboratorium (Danish <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> laboratory).|$|E

25|$|The first <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> {{had been}} drawn up by Assistant Surveyor Dixon in 1828, but the site was moved, as it was subject to flooding. The new <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> was drawn up by Surveyor Hoddle and was gazetted in 1833.|$|R
5|$|Chamberlain {{was made}} {{chairman}} of the <b>Town</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee. Under Chamberlain's direction Birmingham soon adopted {{one of the first}} <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> schemes in Britain. The start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans. In 1915, Chamberlain became Lord Mayor of Birmingham. Apart from his father Joseph, five of Chamberlain's uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity: they were Joseph's brother Richard Chamberlain, William and George Kenrick, Charles Beale, who had been four times Lord Mayor and Sir Thomas Martineau. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 {{approval}} of the redevelopment by the Perth City Council was controversial.

5|$|Enugu city covers three local {{government}} areas: Enugu East, Enugu North and Enugu South. A Local Government Council exists {{for each of}} these seats that manages sectors including primary education and health; an elected Executive Chairman and a group of elected Councillors form the Local Government Council that heads each Local Government Area. Enugu South is split between its rural and urban parts when electing an Executive Chairman. The Executive Chairmen include Paul Ogbe for Enugu South Urban, Theresa Egbo for Enugu South Rural, Emeka Nnamani for Enugu North, and Christopher Ugwu for Enugu East; these chairmen represent their LGA's in the Enugu State House of Assembly. The Ministry of Lands, Survey and <b>Town</b> <b>Planning</b> (at the state level) and the Local Planning Authority (at the {{local government}} level) are responsible for the administration of urban lands and <b>town</b> <b>planning.</b> Government House, Enugu is where the government of the state is based. On the federal level, the city of Enugu is split between two congressional areas; Enugu North/South represented by Chukwuegbo Ofor and Enugu East represented by Gilbert Nnaji; both representatives are in the People's Democratic Party (PDP) as is Sunday Chukwuebuka Agbo, the governor of Enugu State.|$|E
40|$|W artykule w sposób praktyczny przedstawiono możliwości zastosowania narzędzi GIS podczas przeprowadzania analizy planu miasta pod kątem morfologicznym. Krok po kroku scharakteryzowano poszczególne etapy takiej analizy, wskazując na korzyści, jakie niesie za sobą wykorzystanie tychże narzędzi. Zwrócono również uwagę na mogące pojawić się trudności i pokazano sposoby minimalizowania ich wpływu na przebieg badań. Urban {{morphology}} is {{a scientific}} discipline which studies the external structure (i. e. shape and physiognomy of buildings) {{and the internal}} structure (i. e. layout) of the town, {{as well as the}} genesis and evolution of its various parts (their morphogenesis). The main research method in urban morphology is the <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> analysis. It is based on observation of changes in the urban space of the study area by comparing chronologically listed <b>town</b> <b>plans.</b> GIS tools may be applied in urban morphology at all stages of <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> analysis: from the selection of source materials (especially archival <b>town</b> <b>plans),</b> through a proper analysis of morphology and morphogenesis of the study area, to the presentation of the results of these analyses. The paper shows the possibilities of using these tools. It also identifies a number of advantages and benefits related with the introduction of GIS to urban morphology. Attention is also paid to difficulties which may arise at each stage of research. It seems that rectification of archival <b>town</b> <b>plans</b> is the most troublesome task. The older a plan is, the harder it is to register. Another disadvantage is the necessity of arduous digitization of all archival maps. Overcoming these difficulties opens the way to all advantages of GIS. The greatest advantage of applying GIS to the <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> analysis is the improvement of comparison of <b>town</b> <b>plans</b> from the same area but from different periods of time. Adding georeferences to archival maps, and converting them to one coordinate system, facilitates unification of the scale of all <b>town</b> <b>plans,</b> and allows overlapping of one <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> with another. In turn, the digitization of archival maps enables the introduction of uniform signs and uniform naming for thematic vector layers in all analysed periods of time, which facilitates tracing the evolution of the <b>town</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1935, a <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> {{report for}} the City of Perth noted traffic {{congestion}} on Albany Road in Victoria Park. As widening the existing road would have left the council liable for compensation from affected businesses and properties, the provision of bypass routes was recommended instead. To provide the bypasses, parallel roads would be upgraded and extended: Berwick Street to the south-west, and Shepparton Road to the north-east.|$|E
5|$|Much {{like many}} architects of his generation, {{following}} the British victory Hollamby pursued {{a career in}} local authority offices. He first worked as an architect for the Miners' Welfare Commission from 1947 to 1949, in this position designing pithead baths and a colliery extension at Lofthouse, Yorkshire. After gaining further qualifications from the Royal Institute of British Architects, he proceeded with a three-year evening course in <b>town</b> <b>planning,</b> run by William Holford and Arthur Ling at the Bartlett School of Architecture, London.|$|E
5|$|Pick's {{interest}} in design {{led to his}} involvement in the founding, in 1915, of the Design and Industries Association. The organisation aimed to bring manufacturers and designers together {{to improve the quality of}} industrial design. Through his improvements in the UERL's advertising and branding, Pick was considered by many of its members to be taking a practical lead in achieving the organisation's aims and he was soon lecturing on the subject, giving talks during 1916 and 1917 at the Art Workers Guild in London, at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh and elsewhere. After the First World War, Pick continued to give talks regularly and published articles on design. He also began to set out his ideas on reconstruction and <b>town</b> <b>planning,</b> an area of design he became interested in through its connection to transport planning. He wrote and lectured extensively on this subject during the 1920s and 1930s including presenting a 14,000 word paper to the Institute of Transport in 1927 and addressing the International Housing and <b>Town</b> <b>Planning</b> Congress in 1939. Concerned about the uncontrolled and unchecked growth of London, partly facilitated by the new lines that London Underground was building, Pick was a strong supporter of the need for a green belt around the capital to maintain open space within reach of urban areas.|$|E

5|$|The German {{influence}} {{brought into}} Norway by neo-classicism abated when Norway gained full independence in 1905. A {{new generation of}} Norwegian architects educated in Sweden {{took the lead in}} developing a distinctly national architecture, endeavouring to break the German historicist tradition. However, German modernism and <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the Norwegian Institute of Technology was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in Trondheim, there also emerged a distinctly Norwegian collegium of architects that has contributed to a Norwegian regional architecture, discussed by the art historian Sigfried Giedeon.|$|E
5|$|The {{approval}} of the tower was controversial due to the plot ratio concessions made by the Perth City Council to the developers. These concessions enabled the developers to construct a tower {{more than twice the}} height which would otherwise be allowable on the site. There was also opposition to the Council's decision to ignore its own <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> experts in allowing a large car park to be constructed underneath the site.|$|E

5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court.

Other works refer the general <b>town</b> <b>planning,</b> fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E
