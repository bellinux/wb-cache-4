40|$|In {{this paper}} a robust method is {{developed}} {{for the analysis of}} data consisting of repeated binary observations taken at up to <b>three</b> fixed <b>time</b> points on each subject. The primary objective is to compare outcomes at the last time point, using earlier observations to predict this for subjects with incomplete records. A score test is derived. The method is developed for application to sequential clinical trials, as at interim analyses there will be many incomplete records occurring in non-informative patterns. Motivation for the methodology comes from experience with clinical trials in stroke and head injury, and data from one such trial is used to illustrate the approach. Extensions to more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>time</b> points and to allow for stratification are discussed. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

5|$|Nine Atlantic hurricanes—Camille, Allen, Andrew, Isabel, Ivan, Dean, Felix, Irma and Maria—reached Category5 {{intensity}} on {{more than}} one occasion; that is, by reaching Category5 intensity, weakening to a Category4 or lower, and then becoming a Category5 again. Such hurricanes have their dates shown together. Camille, Andrew, Dean, Felix, Irma, and Maria each attained Category 5 status twice during their lifespans. Allen, Isabel, and Ivan reached Category 5 intensity on three separate occasions. However, no Atlantic hurricane has reached Category5 intensity more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> during its lifespan. The November 1932 Cuba hurricane holds the record for most time spent as a Category5 (although it took place before satellite or aircraft reconnaissance, so this record may be somewhat suspect).

Its opening weekend take beat the $3.3 million opening weekend gross of Pegg and Wright's previous film, Shaun of the Dead. In its second weekend of release, Rogue Pictures expanded the film's cinema count from 825 to 1,272 and it grossed $4.9 million, representing a 17% dip in the gross.
