50|$|Castlecomer Fire Station {{is located}} on the Kilkenny Road. Castlecomer's fire service began in the 1940s when Kilkenny County Council {{supplied}} a fire service in the late 1940s with the <b>trailer</b> <b>pump</b> based at Pat Hetherington's shed in Market Sq now Cunninghams Green Grocer. The Original Mining Company <b>trailer</b> <b>pump,</b> was given to Castlecomer Fire Service and was based in the mining office yard (Avalon Inn). Later in 1954, a newer fire station was built in Love Lane. In late 2009, construction began on a new state-of-the-art fire station on the Kilkenny Road and this opened officially in May 2010. It houses a Class B Fire Water Tender/Ladder appliance, call-sign, KK12A1 (07-KK-5211) and serves Castlecomer and much of North-East Kilkenny.|$|E
50|$|Wainuiomata has a {{volunteer}} fire brigade, established in 1944 following a major house-fire in 1943. The first superintendent was Mr J.S. Dunn. The first station {{was built in}} 1945 on land opposite Wainuiomata Primary School. The Wainuiomata Development Company donated land and timber to the brigade, with other brigades and companies donating hose, standpipes and ladders. The Stokes Valley brigade supplied a Gwynne <b>Trailer</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In {{the past}} {{there had been}} several contenders in this field, Ford, for instance, {{offering}} a choice of no less than three different engines for their 1939 15 cwt van, , [...] and [...] These {{were some of the}} vehicles chosen to tow <b>trailer</b> fire <b>pumps</b> {{at the start of the}} war, no doubt because of their performance potential in an emergency situation.|$|R
40|$|This {{engineering}} evaluation compares five alternative {{schemes for}} maintaining emergency annulus pumping equipment in a reliable condition. The five schemes are: (1) continue status quo; (2) periodic pump removal and run-in; (3) periodic in-place limited maintenance; (4) uninstalled ready spares; and (5) expanded mission of Single-Shell Tank Emergency <b>Pumping</b> <b>Trailer.</b> Each alternative is described, {{the pros and}} cons identified, and rough order of magnitude life-cycle costs computed. The alternatives are compared using weighted evaluation criteria. The evaluation concludes that staging adjustable length submersible pumps in the Single-Shell Tank Emergency <b>Pumping</b> <b>Trailer</b> has the best cost-benefit characteristics...|$|R
50|$|The Fire Station - the 3rd version {{built in}} the 1990s - is manned by a {{part-time}} crew with a modern appliance. The original 1960s station was a wooden hut adjacent to Riverview containing equipment and a <b>trailer</b> <b>pump</b> with Kirkmichael Garage providing a towing vehicle as required. The second station was on the present site in Bannerfield and was a basic tin Nissen Hut shed housing a Karrier Gamecock appliance but with no crew facilities. The current station is fitted and equipped to a high standard with office and training facilities.|$|E
50|$|The town did {{not have}} any sort of formal or {{professional}} fire brigade. Although the stand-pipes connected to the public water main had recently been improved and increased, the apparatus for delivering water was wholly unsuitable - little more than a cart and a hose pipe (which, according to the inquiry, may have been faulty). The Council had attempted to obtain a <b>trailer</b> <b>pump,</b> but this had been delayed by the war emergency. There was no pumping equipment and formal, organised structure of fire officers. On the night of the fire, the Brigade in Dundalk was summoned by telephone. By the time the Dundalk Fire Brigade (which was a professional unit) had covered the forty-five or so miles of twisting road, {{there was nothing to be}} done. Enniskillen is about ten miles closer to Cavan than Dundalk and the roads are more direct. However, there is nothing to suggest that the Enniskillen Fire Brigade was summoned, even though Northern fire brigades had in the past crossed the border to assist in the South.|$|E
50|$|The Torrington Foreman, Torrington, Connecticut, 1949.UNITED COMMINITY SPIRIT: The East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Department. Little or no ballyhoo has {{accompanied}} {{two years}} of outstanding accomplishment in a neighboring town through united community spirit. So {{this is the story}} of the East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Department. First a little history. East Litchfield was a busy town many years ago, and until railroad came to Litchfield. Then the East Litchfield Depot was closed and the town became completely rural. World War II, however, caused the picture to change. New homes were built — the population increased. In fact, it even occurred to the Litchfield Civilian Defense Council that a <b>trailer</b> <b>pump</b> housed in East Litchfield might be a mighty handy piece of equipment to augment the fire protection from Litchfield. East Litchfield Community leaders were naturally very much interested in this proposal and agreed to assume responsibility for the <b>trailer</b> <b>pump</b> to secure better protection for East Litchfield's families and property. As disappointing as it may have seemed at the time, the <b>trailer</b> <b>pump</b> never did materialize. However, something more valuable was gained, for awakened to a community need, united effort to secure fire protection resulted. In January, 1947, East Litchfield residents met with Martin Iffland and Edward J. Wilson to discuss ways and means of reaching the objective. The response was so enthusiastic that by spring, the East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Department was duly incorporated, officers elected and the company formally launched. The Litchfield Fire Chief, representatives of other volunteer fire companies and Attorney Thomas F. Wall were most helpful in the organizing process. The Fire Department's membership had reached a total of 60. The organization completed, the next objective was a treasury. No time was lost for the entire community to go to work to raise needed funds. Volunteers worked with a will many a Saturday at the back-breaking job of collecting tons of scrap steel and iron — some of it secured from points as far away as New Hartford. Dances and card parties were sponsored and one person became the proud owner of a new car as a result of fund raising efforts. Cooperation was the keynotes in all of these activities, as every member helped in two or three capacities. And — during this time, the other half of the neighborhood — the half that sits on the other side of the breakfast table — decided that it should pitch in too. So the Ladies auxiliary was formed in April. Bakery sales, rummage sales and a highly successful auction sponsored by the ladies — contributed materially to both the treasury and to the morale of the department. And so, in July 1947 the <b>trailer</b> <b>pump,</b> that never did materialize, finally resulted in a second-hand American LaFrance 750 gallon pumper rebuilt to carry a 200-gallon water supply and 2,000 feet of hose, ladders, hand pumps, nozzles, a gasoline auxiliary pump and other equipment. Mr. Wilson generously made one of his barns available for a temporary fire house. Meanwhile, the officers of the company received instructions in fire-fighting methods from Captain Rougeot of Torrington and first aid instruction from Harold Lacore. After the equipment was available, regular weekly drills were instituted so that other members of the department could receive training. As it turned out, the equipment and the instruction came none too soon. That fall, forest fires broke out near the Torrington dump and spread towards East Litchfield and Litchfield. For three chilly nights, the East Litchfield Volunteer Firemen worked until the early hours helping to check the fires over a broad front. Thousands of gallons of water were pumped over the hills and the woods saving much of the forest and presenting the flames from reaching several homes in their path. The East Litchfield Company had proved its value to the community and at the same time, partially repaid the neighboring fire departments for all the help they had given. “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,” so the saying goes. And this could be true of a volunteer fire department. In fact, one of the purposes of the company, as stated in its constitution to promote the social activity of the community. To this end, public dances, card parties and an annual outing in August for the whole family and a ball in the fall is on the department's social calendar. Early in 1948 it was learned that the temporary firehouse would have to be vacated. So once again the volunteer workers sprang into action with a new firehouse as their goal. A parcel of land was donated by George Sawyer and plans for a two-story building, thirty by sixty feet was decided upon. Fund raising activities were stepped up with the gratifying result that construction was started late this summer. United community spirit was in action again. Virtually all of the labor is being contributed by the members in the hope that the saving would make it possible to complete the building sufficiently to house the truck before snowfall. The finishing of the interior and second floor will very likely have to wait until further funds are available. At that time it will make the hall upstairs large enough so that in the future it will be a source of income as well as a meeting place for the community. And so — through the united effort of the people of East Litchfield — in less than two years the community has acquired a trained fire company with adequate equipment, and will soon have a major public improvement without taxation. But of even more importance, every member of the community has gained through the lessons learned in cooperation and good fellowship. Hats off to the East Litchfield Volunteers, outstanding examples of United Community Spirit.|$|E

50|$|The new DA 30 DT was {{launched}} in 1957. Offered as 8 variants, this model was the replacement for the DA 25. During this period, SAME also introduced and manufactured a range of specific implements such as ploughs (single blade, double blade, disc and reversible ploughs), spring tine cultivators, disc harrows, rototillers, backhoes, cutter bars, tipper <b>trailers,</b> irrigation <b>pumps</b> and auger drills. The first DA 30 DT models were painted orange with green wheels, while {{towards the end of}} the 1950s. The colour scheme was changed to red for the bodywork and wheels and dark grey for the engine.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Inglis {{entered the}} {{consumer}} products business, producing fishing tackle, house <b>trailers,</b> oil burner <b>pumps</b> and domestic heaters and stoves. In 1946 they licensed {{production of a}} wringer washer being manufactured in the US by the Nineteen Hundred Corporation (now Whirlpool Corporation). A fully automatic washer was added in 1950, and the line continued to expand to include electric and gas dryers, and dishwashers.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{structure}} is reinforced concrete. Putzmeister created a new, super high-pressure <b>trailer</b> concrete <b>pump,</b> the BSA 14000 SHP-D, for this project. Burj Khalifa's construction used [...] {{of concrete and}} 55000 t of steel rebar, and construction took 22 million man-hours. In May 2008 Putzmeister pumped concrete with more than 21 MPA ultimate compressive strength of gravel that would surpass the 600 meters weight of the effective area of each column from the foundation to the next fourth level, {{and the rest is}} by metal columns jacketed or covered with concreted to a then world record delivery height of 606 m, the 156th floor. Three tower cranes were used during construction of the uppermost levels, each capable of lifting a 25-tonne load. The remaining structure above is constructed of lighter steel.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} performed and {{presented in this}} paper is based on an agricultural business in the Călărași County, namely S. C. Auger Petrus S. R. L. The basic activity of the company is represented by cultivating cereals ecologically, on an area of 700 ha of wheat, maize, sunflower, peas, lucerne, etc. The analysed company expanded its ecologically cultivated area by purchasing new land, as well as by leasing new areas of land. Also, the company has its own silo made up of three units with a capacity of 3, 000 metric tons each, a laboratory where to analyse the cereals on entering and leaving the silo, as well as good technical equipment, namely: tractors, combine harvesters, seeders, agricultural combiners, plows, <b>trailers,</b> irrigation <b>pumping</b> station. From the data processed and presented in the company’s financial balance, we noticed the evolution of the efficiency level correlated with strategies employed by the company...|$|R
50|$|Companies {{that had}} a {{significant}} presence in the city include Dana Holding Corporation, Falstaff Brewing Corporation, Fruehauf Corporation, General Electric, International Harvester, Magnavox, Old Crown Brewing Corporation, and Tokheim, among several others, producing goods such as refrigerators, washing machines, automatic phonographs, meat packing products, televisions, garbage disposals, automotive parts and motors, <b>trailers,</b> gasoline <b>pumps,</b> trucks, beer, tents and awnings. Magnet wire production became an especially vital component to the city's economy. In 1960, Fort Wayne {{was at the center}} of the United States magnet wire industry, home to New Haven Wire and Cable Company, Phelps Dodge, Rea Magnet Wire, Superior Essex, and an operation at General Electric, producing nearly 90 percent of North America's magnet wire.The 1970s and 1980s were times of economic depression in Fort Wayne, when much of the city's manufacturing foundation eroded and the blue-collar workforce shrank. Fort Wayne joined several other cities reeling economically within the Rust Belt. At the same time, General Electric also downsized much of its more than 10,000-person workforce. Amid other area plant closures and downsizing, coupled with the early 1980s recession, the city lost 30,000 jobs and reached a 12.1 percent unemployment rate. The arrival of General Motors in 1987 helped fill the void from shuttered manufacturers and aided in the area's recovery, employing 3,000 at its Fort Wayne Assembly. In 2017, General Motors was the largest manufacturer in the city, employing 4,100 assembling Chevrolet Silverado regular and double cab light- and heavy-duty pickup trucks.|$|R
50|$|It {{all began}} {{one evening in}} 1957 when Garth Young {{was sitting at the}} table playing crib with friends. His sister ran in and said she could see flames in a window upstairs as she was driving down the road. Garth and his father each grabbed a bucket of water and ran upstairs, but there was nothing they could do. There was no fire {{department}} in Musquodoboit Harbour. They called Lands and Forests (now called the Department of Natural Resources) who showed up later with a portable pump and some hose. But by now, the two story house was in flames and the dozen family members who lived there could only watch helplessly as it burned to the ground. The loss motivated Garth Young and other people in the community to establish their own fire department. By 1960 Garth Young was clearing land for the new station. A year later the Musquodoboit Harbour Volunteer Fire Department was born and he became one of its original members. The Musquodoboit Harbour Volunteer Fire Department formed in 1961 with the fire hall opening on October 6, 1964. The first piece of equipment they had was a <b>trailer</b> with a <b>pump</b> on it. It had compartments on each side into which they were able to put extra equipment, such as hoses. The first truck they had was a 1957 milk truck that they bought in 1963 from a farmer. The Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary formed in February 1967.|$|R
40|$|The North endcap {{calorimeter}} {{vessel was}} recieved on July 1, 1990. A cooldown {{of the pressure}} vessel with liquid nitrogen was performed on July 10 - 11 to check the vessel's integrity. With the pressure vessel cold, the insulating vacuum was monitored for leaks. Through out the testing, the insulating vacuum remained good and the vessel passed the test. The cold test was carried out per the procedures of D-Zero engineering note 3740. 220 -EN- 250. The test was {{very similar to the}} cold test performed on the Central Calorimeter in October of 1987. Reference D-Zero engineering notes 3740. 210 -EN- 122, 3740. 000 -EN 107, and 3740. 210 -EN- 110 for information about the CC cold test. The insulating vacuum space was pumped on while equipment was being connected to the pressure vessel. Two hours after starting to pump with the blower the vacuum space pressure was at about 210 microns. Pumping on the vacuum space for the next 15 hours showed no progress and a leak detector was connected to the pumping line. A leak check showed a leak in a thermocouple feedthru on the vacuum space relief plate. After fixing the leak, the pressure dropped to 16 microns in less than one hour. A rate of rise test was performed starting at a pressure of 13 microns. The pressure rose to 39 microns within 8 minutes and then only rose to 43 microns in 2. 5 hours (1. 6 microns/hour). After all connections were made to the pressure vessel, a vacuum pump with an estimated effective pumping speed of about 70 scfm was valved on. The lowest pressure achieved after 2 days of pumping was 80 microns. Valving out the pump for 30 minutes resulted in a 5 micron per minute rate of rise. The rate of rise was considered acceptable since there were known leak paths through the bolts of the signal ports. The EC North vessel was rolled outside of Lab A in preparation for a 5000 gallon liquid nitrogen trailer which arrived July, 10 at 8 : 00 am. Before filling the vessel, the vacuum space pump was valved off. The pressure in the vacuum space was 12 microns at that point. During the next 24 hours of the test, the vacuum space pressure decreased to 5 microns. A plot of the vacuum space pressure with time is included {{at the end of this}} note. The liquid nitrogen was pressure transferred from the trailer at 29 psig to the pressure vessel at 1 psig for ten hours. At that time there was sufficient (16 -inch) of liquid nitrogen in the vessel to turn the LN 2 <b>trailer</b> delivery <b>pump</b> on. Thirteen and one half hours after starting the fill, the vessel had 50 -inch of LN 2 collected. During the latter part of the filling, about twelve loud metallic bangs were heard. The noises came at random intervals with sometimes five minutes between and other times an hour between. The best way to describe the sound is to imagine the sound made if someone was trapped inside the vessel with a baseball bat and took a good swing. The trailer was disconnected and the the vessel was left overnight for ten hours. Due to the slow LN 2 fill rate, the temperature gradient in the pressure vessel shell was not very large, only about 25 kelvin difference was found from a RTD in the warm-up nozzle of the vessel and the resistors of the liquid level probe. A temperature versus time graph is included at the end of this note...|$|R
40|$|This {{engineering}} note is {{a collection}} of pipe pressure testing documents for various sections of piping for the D-Zero cryogenic and gas systems. High pressure piping must conform with FESHM chapter 5031. 1. Piping lines with ratings greater than 150 psig have a pressure test done before the line is put into service. These tests require the use of pressure testing permits. It is my intent that all pressure piping over which my group has responsibility conforms to the chapter. This includes the liquid argon and liquid helium and liquid nitrogen cryogenic systems. It also includes the high pressure air system, and the high pressure gas piping of the WAMUS and MDT gas systems. This is not an all inclusive compilation of test documentation. Some piping tests have their own engineering note. Other piping section test permits are included in separate safety review documents. So if it isn't here, that doesn't mean that it wasn't tested. D-Zero has a back up air supply system to add reliability to air compressor systems. The system includes high pressure piping which requires a review per FESHM 5031. 1. The core system consists of a pressurized tube trailer, supply piping into the building and a pressure reducing regulator tied into the air compressor system discharge piping. Air flows from the trailer if the air compressor discharge pressure drops below the regulator setting. The tube <b>trailer</b> is periodically <b>pumped</b> back up to approximately 2000 psig. A high pressure compressor housed in one of the exterior buildings is used for that purpose. The system was previously documented, tested and reviewed for Run I, except for the recent addition of piping to and from the high pressure compressor. The following documents are provided for review of the system: (1) Instrument air flow schematic, drg. 3740. 000 -ME- 273995 rev. H; (2) Component list for air system; (3) Pressure testing permit for high pressure piping; (4) Documentation from Run I contained in D-Zero Engineering note 3740. 214 -EN- 268, John Urbin 11120 / 90; (5) Pressure test procedure; (6) Schematic for pressure test; and (7) List of component pressure ratings. The goal of this independent review is to: (1) Reviewer makes recommendation to the Division/Section Safety Officer to approve the testing permit; and (2) Reviewer is satisfied the FESHM 5031 is met, and recommends to the division head that approval to operate be granted...|$|R
