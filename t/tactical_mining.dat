2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{laid down by}} the Nederlandse Droogdok Maatschappij ("Dutch Drydock Company") at [...] Amsterdam, on 18 January 1938, and {{launched}} on 15 December 1938. After sea trials the ship was commissioned on 21 August 1939, just before {{the outbreak of the}} war. On 3 September 1939 the Willem van der Zaan commenced wartime operations by laying 98 mines near Den Helder, adding another 97 mines on 22 September. Minelaying operations continued until 10 May 1940, when the German invasion began. As the Dutch attempted to fight off the overwhelming German invasion forces Willem van der Zaan was deployed in the anti-aircraft role, and laid a <b>tactical</b> <b>mine</b> barrage of the Scheldt estuary with Jan van Brakel and Nautilus. On 13 May she sailed from Den Helder for the UK, arriving at Portsmouth on the 14th, carrying 10 torpedoes and other equipment for the cruiser Sumatra, and four Luftwaffe prisoners from a downed aircraft.|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the Streak Tube Imaging LIDAR (STIL) project {{is to develop a}} mine {{identification}} capability, specifically to use STIL technology to demonstrate the technical feasibility of providing a <b>tactical</b> <b>mine</b> identification capability to airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) forces. The projected payoff is a decrease in mine clearance time, an increase in clearance effectiveness, and a reduction in the cost per mine cleared. The resulting system must be is compatible and interchangeable with the AN/AQS- 20 volume search sonar (VSS) section. OBJECTIVES The overall objective of this three year collaborative effort between Arete Associates and Coastal Systems Station (NSWCCSS), Panama City, FL is to directly demonstrate the capability of STIL to perform electro-optic identification (EOID) of bottom and close tethered mines from an underwater towed vehicle (AN/AQS- 20) at tactically significant speeds, swath widths, and standoff ranges. The objective of this first year’s effort is to (i) directly demonstrate high resolution 3 -D imaging in the ocean at tactically significant ranges, and in parallel (ii) perform system engineering and design to address the integration of the STIL-EOID sensor into the AN/AQS- 20 towed body (TB) ...|$|R

25|$|Into this divided community, {{the mine}} owners hired spies {{to monitor and}} {{undermine}} the union. Spies supplied {{thousands of pages of}} daily reports on the internal workings of the CCMU; its divisions, its plans, its weaknesses. Although everyone knew that there were spies in the union (the details of secret union leadership meetings were printed the following day in the Leadville Herald Democrat), they never guessed their identities. Spies were entrusted with union security responsibilities, even with the responsibility of detecting possible spies. The spies faithfully recorded information about ethnic rivalries and philosophical disputes among die-hard and disillusioned unionists, militants and pacifists, optimists and pessimists, and the spy agencies passed that information on to the mine operators. With comprehensive daily reports on secret union meetings and the union's <b>tactical</b> plans, <b>mine</b> owners were able to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlast the strikers.|$|R
40|$|The {{future success}} of Navy-Marine Corps {{operations}} in the extended littoral battlespace will depend critically on organic mine countermeasure capabilities. A battlegroup commander will require tools to rapidly detect, classify, and identify mines and form a <b>tactical</b> picture of <b>mined</b> areas, so a decision {{can be made to}} punch through the minefield, avoid it, or wait for dedicated mine countermeasures forces to clear it. We introduce here a command and control framework for mine countermeasures based on probabilistic classification and multicriteria path planning under uncertainty. Data from probabilistic mine classifiers can be used by a path planning tool to generate information comparing the relative utility and risk associated with different routes through a minefield. We are developing a dynamic path planning tool that can be adjusted to manage safety versus time to objective, constructing alternate paths of varying time and risk through a minefield. It will evaluate alternative routes while searching for low risk paths. A risk management framework can be used to describe the relative values of such different factors as risk versus time to objective, giving the capability to balance path safety against other mission objectives. We are also adding visualization techniques to display mines with uncertain locations and highlight alternative routes through minefields and obstacles. Our goal is to present a commander the most useful <b>tactical</b> picture of <b>mined</b> areas for decision-making...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tactical</b> <b>mine</b> {{planning}} {{is the process}} of determining the sequence and schedule of activities that will best achieve the value generated through the strategic mine plan. These objectives are generally based on the maximisation of Net Present Value (NPV). The scheduling process over both the medium and short term is still largely a manual process as current mathematical optimisation models contain a number of limitations. This is particularly the case for underground mining methods such as sublevel stoping which generally involves selecting production from the next available highest cashflow stope. In most cases, the scheduling problem is too complex to guarantee that the optimal result will be achieved through manual scheduling. The solution to the medium term schedule will traditionally form the starting point from which to commence short term scheduling. Due to the segregation between the two phases only a local optima is possible. While maximising NPV is generally the primary objective of medium term scheduling, short term scheduling tends to focus on value improvements gained through the operational efficiencies resulting from consistently meeting production targets. This thesis describes and presents three mathematical optimisation models utilising mixed integer programming that have been developed for application to new and existing sublevel stoping operations. The locally optimal medium term production scheduling model optimises the production schedule over the medium term by maximising NPV. The locally optimal short term scheduling and machine allocation model generates optimal short term production schedules with all corresponding machine allocations for the purpose of minimising deviation to a target mill feed grade. These models are finally integrated to produce the globally optimal integrated production scheduling model, for the purpose of maximising final NPV while considering each activity across both scheduling horizons. A conceptual sublevel stoping operation comprising of 100 stopes is used for trialling three scheduling approaches incorporating the newly developed models. An initial ‘first pass’ manual scheduling approach achieves an NPV of $ 109, 486, 627. Segregated medium and short term schedule using the newly developed models achieve an NPV of $ 120, 165, 839. The final scheduling approach involved integrating the two scheduling horizons using the globally optimal integrated production scheduling model to achieve an NPV of $ 121, 031, 325...|$|R
50|$|North Korea did {{not sign}} CWC and is {{believed}} to have maintained an extensive chemical weapons program since mid-1950s. The program includes research, production, stockpiling and weaponisation of large quantities of chemical agents (perhaps as many as 5000 tons), including blister, nerve, choking, psychoincapacitant, vomiting and riot control agents. Several dozen facilities has been identified as likely involved in the offensive program. The production capability of these facilities is estimated as 4500 tons of chemical agents per year. North Korean armed forces have also large quantities of delivery systems that could carry chemical warheads, including different artillery systems, aerial bombs, <b>mines,</b> <b>tactical</b> ballistic missiles (SCUD), and long-range ballistic missiles (Nodong and Taepodong-2 systems). However, the technological advancement of this program is uncertain, and some sources doubt whether North Korea is able to produce large quantities of nerve agents or to fit the chemical warheads on its long-range ballistic missiles.|$|R

In this paper, an architecture for three-dimensional underwater sensor networks is considered, {{and a model}} characterizing the acoustic channel utilization efficiency is introduced, which allows investigating some fundamental characteristics of the underwater environment. In particular, the model allows setting the optimal packet size for underwater communications given monitored volume, density of the sensor network, and application requirements. Moreover, the problem of data gathering is investigated at the network layer by considering the cross-layer interactions between the routing functions and {{the characteristics of the}} underwater acoustic channel. Two distributed routing algorithms are introduced for delay-insensitive and delaysensitive applications. The proposed solutions allow each node to select its next hop, with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption taking the varying condition of the underwater channel and the different application requirements into account.

It is a transmitter-based code division multiple access scheme that incorporates a novel closed-loop distributed algorithm to set the optimal transmit power and code length. It aims at achieving high network throughput, low channel access delay, and low energy consumption. Finally, an efficient cross-layer communication solution tailored for multimedia traffic (i. e., video and audio streams, still images, and scalar sensor data) is introduced. Ph. D.
