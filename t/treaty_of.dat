5|$|The Danish {{province}} of Øsel was ceded to Sweden under the 1645 <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Brömsebro, which ended the Torstenson War, one theatre of the Thirty Years' War. It was retained after the Peace of Oliva and the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Copenhagen, both in 1660. The situation remained unchanged until 1710 when Estonia and Livonia capitulated to Russia during the Great Northern War, an action formalised in the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Nystad (1721).|$|E
5|$|The Polish treaty (signed in June 1919, as {{the first}} of the Minority Treaties, and serving as the {{template}} for the subsequent ones) {{is often referred to as}} either the Little <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Versailles or the Polish Minority Treaty; the Austrian, Czechoslovak and Yugoslavian treaties are referred to as <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> St Germain-en-Laye (1919); the Romanian treaty as the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Paris (1919), the Greek as the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Sèvres (1920); the Hungarian as the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Trianon (1920), the Bulgarian as the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Neuilly-sur-Seine (1919), and the Turkish as the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Lausanne (1923). In most of the above cases the minority treaties were only one of many articles of the aforementioned treaties.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Rapallo of 1920, Rijeka became an {{independent}} city-state known as the Free State of Fiume. That {{marked the beginning of}} the port's decline, as it lost a large portion of its major market, Hungary. Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Rome, and the port became peripherally located, with no modern railway or road links to the rest of the country, further adding to the already obvious economic decline.|$|E
5|$|By the Peace of Westphalia, {{which ended}} the Thirty Years' War in 1648, Brandenburg gained Minden and Halberstadt, also the {{succession}} in Farther Pomerania (incorporated in 1653) and the Duchy of Magdeburg (incorporated in 1680). With the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Bromberg (1657), concluded during the Second Northern War, the electors were freed of Polish vassalage for the Duchy of Prussia and gained Lauenburg–Bütow and Draheim. The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679) expanded Brandenburgian Pomerania {{to the lower}} Oder.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, Bombay began to grow into a major trading town, and {{received}} a huge influx of migrants from across India. Later, the British occupied Salsette on 28 December 1774. With the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Surat (1775), the British formally gained control of Salsette and Bassein, resulting in the First Anglo-Maratha War. The British were able to secure Salsette from the Marathas without violence through the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Purandar (1776), and later through the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Salbai (1782), signed to settle the outcome of the First Anglo-Maratha War.|$|E

5|$|In 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry led the Perry Expedition, a {{squadron}} of four ships which sailed to Japan to establish normal relations with Japan. Perry's two technologically advanced steam-powered ships and calm, firm diplomacy convinced Japan to end three centuries of isolation and sign <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Kanagawa with the U.S. in 1854. Nominally a <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> friendship, the agreement soon {{paved the way for}} the opening of Japan and normal trade relations with the United States and Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Roskilde {{two years}} earlier, Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} to cede the Danish provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge, the island of Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces Trøndelag and Båhuslen. The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Copenhagen reaffirmed the Swedish rule over Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, while Bornholm and Trøndelag were returned. It was a {{significant}} victory for Denmark-Norway, but it did not result in a reversal of the costly earlier peace. The <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present.|$|E

5|$|Louis XVIII {{signed the}} <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Paris on 30 May 1814. The treaty gave France her 1792 borders, which {{extended}} {{east of the}} Rhine.

Following the war, a private force of demobilized Italian soldiers seized Rijeka {{and set up}} the Italian Regency of Carnaro—seen as a harbinger of Fascism—to force the recognition of Italian claims to the city. After sixteen months of the Regency's existence, the 1920 <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Rapallo redefined the Italian–Yugoslav borders, among other things transferring Zadar and the islands of Cres, Lastovo, and Palagruža to Italy, securing the island of Krk for Yugoslavia, and establishing the Free State of Fiume; this new state was abolished in 1924 by the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Rome that awarded Rijeka to Italy and Sušak to Yugoslavia.|$|E

The 1936 treaty was {{designed}} to counter Benito Mussolini's ambition to link Libya to Ethiopia via Sudan in a new Italian empire. The treaty recognized Egyptian claims of sovereignty in Sudan in return for British rights in the Nile valley and the Suez Canal. It allowed for unrestricted immigration of Egyptians to Sudan and {{for the return of}} Egyptian troops. The Sudanese were not consulted.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{formally}} transferred {{ownership of}} the vessel to the Turkish government on 2 November. According {{to the terms of}} the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Sèvres between the Ottoman Empire and the Western Allies, Yavuz was to have been handed over to the Royal Navy as war reparations. After the Turkish War of Independence, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Sèvres was discarded, and the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Lausanne was signed in its place in 1923. Under this treaty, the new Turkish republic regained possession of much its fleet, including Yavuz.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{invasion}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth {{in the following year}} started the Second Northern War. Frederick William offered protection to the Royal Prussian towns in the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Rinsk, but had to yield Swedish military supremacy and withdraw to his Prussian duchy. Pursued by Swedish forces to the Prussian capital, Frederick William made peace and allied with Sweden, taking the Duchy of Prussia and Ermland (Ermeland, Warmia) as fiefs from Charles X Gustav of Sweden in the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Königsberg in January 1656. The alliance proved victorious in the Battle of Warsaw in June, enhancing the elector's international reputation. Continued pressure on Charles X Gustav resulted in him conceding full sovereignty in Ducal Prussia and Ermland to Frederick William by the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Labiau in November to ensure the maintenance of the alliance. The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Radnot, concluded in December by Sweden and her allies, further awarded Greater Poland to Brandenburg-Prussia in case of a victory.|$|E
