Juno is horrified by this revelation, with Mark asking Juno [...] " [...] How do you <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>me?</b> [...] ", revealing Mark is starting to develop feelings for Juno. Vanessa arrives home, and Mark tells her he does not feel ready {{to be a father}} and there are still things he wants to do first.

500|$|In 1990, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Dick Tracy as Breathless Mahoney—a new role {{introduced}} for her—with Warren Beatty, her boyfriend at the time, playing the titular character. After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs by Stephen Sondheim for the film—"Sooner or Later", [...] "More" [...] and [...] "What Can You Lose"—which {{would be part of}} the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to her previous releases. She produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. [...] "I want people to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> as a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me.

Cosmo reported that Manning was optimistic about recent progress but said that not being allowed to grow her hair long was [...] "painful and awkward … I am torn up.

[...] Manning said it was [...] "very much a relief" [...] to announce {{that she is a}} woman and did not fear the public response. [...] "Honestly, I'm not terribly worried about what people out there might <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I just try to be myself." [...] According to Cosmo, Manning had her own cell with [...] "two tall vertical windows that face the sun", and could see [...] "trees and hills and blue sky and all the things beyond the buildings and razor wire". Manning denied being harassed by other inmates and claimed some had become confidantes.|$|E
500|$|Beatty had {{realized}} several {{positive aspects of}} hiring Madonna as an actress for the film. She would be inclined to develop the soundtrack for Dick Tracy and the film studio would {{see this as a}} promotional opportunity before the release of their product, since Madonna was popular as a recording artist. This would also benefit Warner Bros. Records, who would get a reason to release a new Madonna record. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , by the 1980s record labels started to release albums which were closely associated with a film, thereby gaining double promotion. These were mostly termed as soundtracks although many of them were not related to the film. After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack.

500|$|The {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Carter Burwell, {{a veteran of}} all the Coen Brothers' films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers' [...] "Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)", the Gipsy Kings' cover of [...] "Hotel California", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind. They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, [...] "T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac." [...] Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan's [...] "The Man in Me" [...] (from New Morning). However, he {{had a tough time}} securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Dead Flowers", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, [...] "It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful." [...] Burnett was going to be credited on the film as [...] "Music Supervisor", but asked his credit to be [...] "Music Archivist" [...] because he [...] "hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> as management".|$|E

500|$|With Barrett {{seemingly}} {{detached from}} proceedings, {{it came down}} to Waters and Wright to provide adequate material. The opening, [...] "Let There Be More Light", penned by Waters, continues the space rock approach established by Barrett. [...] "Let There Be More Light" [...] evolved from a bass riff that was part of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive". Both [...] "Remember a Day" [...] and [...] "See-Saw" [...] use the childlike approach that was established on their debut. Wright remained critical of his early contributions to the band. [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" [...] was first performed with Barrett in 1967. The success of the track was such that it remained in their live setlist until 1973 where it appeared in a greatly extended form. Waters later performed the track during solo concerts from 1984 and later. Waters borrowed the lyrics from a book of Chinese poetry from the Tang Dynasty, like Barrett had used in [...] "Chapter 24". [...] "Corporal Clegg", is the first Pink Floyd song to address issues of war, a theme which would endure throughout the career of Waters as a songwriter for the band, culminating on the 1983 album The Final Cut. [...] "A Saucerful of Secrets" [...] was originally written as a new version of [...] "Nick's Boogie". The track is titled as four parts, on Ummagumma. A staple in the band's live set until summer 1972, a live version of the song was recorded on 27 April 1969 at the Mothers Club in Birmingham for inclusion on Ummagumma. [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] refers to Barrett's departure from the group ("It's awfully considerate of you to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> here / And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here"). A promotional video was recorded for the track. The band's management wanted to release the song as a single, before being vetoed by both the band and producer Norman Smith.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1989, Whitley {{approached}} Sony Music Nashville chairman Joe Galante {{with the}} intention of releasing [...] "I Never Go Around Mirrors" [...] as a single. Galante approved of the musical flexibility that Whitley achieved with the song; however, he suggested that Whitley record something new and more upbeat. The result was a song Whitley had optioned for his previous album called I Wonder Do You <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>Me,</b> and was to result in his next album release.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Whitley's death, his {{influence}} on country music has persisted.

They instead traveled to Afghanistan to meet with Osama bin Laden and train for terrorist attacks. Immediately afterwards, Atta, al-Shehhi, and Jarrah reported their passports stolen, possibly to erase travel visas to Afghanistan. After their training, the hijackers began to attempt to hide their radicalism. al-Shehhi shaved his beard and seemed to his old friends like he had become less religious. After the attacks, a librarian in Hamburg reported that al-Shehhi boasted to her [...] "There will be thousands of dead. You will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> ...
