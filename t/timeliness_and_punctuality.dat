Across academic and organizational contexts, {{and a variety of}} ways of assessing procrastination, the authors found assessment to be positively related to procrastination and locomotion to be negatively related to procrastination.

The results of an online survey on all existing organic market data collection methods in Europe were compiled and assessed. Subsequently the quality of existing data collection and processing approaches was evaluated using the following data quality dimensions: relevance, accuracy, comparability, coherence, accessibility and clarity, and <b>timeliness</b> <b>and</b> <b>punctuality.</b> The quality assessment was carried out exemplary to determine some good examples of data collection and processing. These cases were chosen because they delivered a very holistic and comprehensive presentation of their approaches regarding data collection methods, analyses, quality checks, and publication...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to set out the {{framework}} for the European Statistical System (ESS) and {{to lay a foundation}} for the following Chapters of the Leadership Group’s Report which deals with specific aspects of quality management the ESS in more detail. The Chapter discusses concepts and definitions relevant to quality and quality management. It discusses total quality management, process and data quality management and also quality measurement and reporting. It also discusses how model frameworks such as the European Foundation for Quality Management Model (EFQM) which can be used in statistical organisations and what benefits this approach brings about. The Chapter presents the Leadership Group’s vision of the framework for managing quality in the ESS in future and discusses key components of it: user need assessment, focus on data quality, the attributes of data quality list developed for the ESS, addressing user needs and priorities, assessment of quality standards reached and dissemination of results and metadata and user support. The vision is set against summary information on the frameworks which currently operate within the ESS and which were surveyed by the Leadership Group in the course of its work. Continuous improvement in statistics and services, measurement of dataquality standards against the criteria of relevance, accuracy, <b>timeliness</b> <b>and</b> <b>punctuality</b> in disseminating results, accessibility and clarity of results, comparability, coherence and completeness are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Sets out {{the results}} of recent work on the {{accuracy}} of IoP estimates, based on an analysis of sampling error. In recent times the key measure of quality used for the Index of Production (IoP) has been the revisions performance of key aggregates. This is published {{as a set of}} revisions triangles alongside the monthly IoP release on the National Statistics website. Additionally, the IoP homepage on the website has a link to a Summary Quality Report which describes other aspects of quality of the series, for example, their <b>timeliness,</b> <b>punctuality</b> <b>and</b> relevance. This article sets out {{the results of}} recent further work on another dimension of the quality of these series: the accuracy of the estimates, based on an analysis of their sampling error. Additionally the article introduces an approach to defining quality bands for each series, to allow users to compare the relative quality of different IoP components.

40|$|Manufacturing firms buy {{transport}} services {{with the aim}} of minimizing their total logistics cost. There is a large amount of literature analyzing how shippers value the various characteristics of a transport service, mostly performed by collecting stated-preference data and estimating discrete choice models. Most of the empirical studies specify the deterministic part of the utility functions as linear in the observed attributes. This implicitly constrains the characteristics of the analyzed transport service to be perfect substitutes, and to have a constant substitutability ratio. Such an assumption is inconsistent with the standard microeconomic theory, typically assuming inputs’ decreasing marginal productivity, and may not be realistic. The paper tests the linearity assumption for freight rate, travel time, probability of having damaged and lost freight, frequency, flexibility, mode <b>and</b> <b>punctuality</b> on a sample of Italian small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SME). Our findings suggest that the linearity-in-the-attributes assumption should be rejected and that the marginal impact on the utility-of-profit of the attributes is not constant. More specifically travel time and freight rate produce decreasing marginal reductions of the utility-of-profit; while safety (percentage of not damaged or lost shipments) <b>and</b> <b>punctuality</b> (percentage of shipments on time) are responsible for increasing marginal contributions to the utility-of-profit. The substitutability ratios between (a) freight rate and loss and damage, (b) freight rate and travel time, (c) freight rate <b>and</b> <b>punctuality,</b> (d) travel time and damage and loss and (e) travel time <b>and</b> <b>punctuality</b> are estimated <b>and</b> found not constant. Finally, it is found that the willingness to pay for the qualitative attributes obtained with a linearly specified model tend to be overestimated...|$|R
