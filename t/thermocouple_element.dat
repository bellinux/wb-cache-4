The depth range of the measurement by the surface element in the brain tissue is about 1. 5 mm {{from the surface of}} the cortex. The range of the measurement by the subcortical element is about 3 mm diameter around the joint of copper-constantan. 1. Spontaneous undulation of the blood flow was seen in the cortex and hippocampus; the undulation was synchronized with and dependent on the spontaneous undulation of the systemic blood pressure. 2. Innervation of cerebral blood vessels is likely more sympathetic but weaker than that of blood vessels in other body tissues. 3. Applying CO_ 2 in concentration of 3 - 7 % in air increased consistently the cerebral blood flow among all three tissues used in this experiment. The influence of asphyxia on the blood flow was quite variable in these tissues; sometimes no effect or dependent only on the systemic blood pressure change. 4. Norepinephrine (i. v.) decreased the cerebral blood flow, but the response was inconstant. In contrast, DOPA increased the cerebral blood flow and it was independent of the systemic blood pressure change. Acetylcholine also increased the cerebral blood flow. 5. The regional blood flow in the cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus were different in dependency on the systemic blood pressure and respiration, and in the responses to some drugs...|$|E
40|$|The task of {{the work}} {{presented}} here was to develop an inner diameter laser cladding head for internal cladding of barrels with a length up to 1800 mm and an internal diameter of 58 mm. The small dimensions were a big challenge for the cladding process and especially for the cladding head. So {{it was necessary to}} develop a new slim process head to reach the small and long internal depth of immersions. The new optic design of the MINIID includes many advantages of the former established IWS ID cladding head COAXID and further special features. The big challenge was to integrate all media supply like powder, water cooling, and inert gas as well as to include all optic components like optical fiber cable, lenses, mirror and finally a process control camera plus a <b>thermocouple</b> <b>element.</b> On the basis of the high immersion depth and the small diameter it was really necessary to integrate a process and temperature monitoring system. The new design of the head has enabled us to clad barrels with a minimum diameter of 50 mm. Depending on the length of the barrels even a minimum diameter of 43 mm with an immersion depth of 280 mm is possible. The head is modularly designed and can be extended in steps of 500 mm to a total immersion depth of 3000 mm. In summary the newly developed MINIID head is capable to deliver our requirements for inner cladding barrels with small dimensions...|$|E

Spectral deconvolution methods are used to infer a mean square optimal estimate of the surface heat flux from time resolved surface temperature measurements. This improved signal processing method is applicable to transient heat flux gauges of all types. Potential reducible error sources and other systematic errors are described.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{for heat}} transfer prediction of in-service welding operations in a forced flow of fluid is presented. The algorithm presented {{is derived from}} Rosenthal's 3 D heat flow equation and boundary layer approximations. This was possible {{by the introduction of}} an apparent thermal conductivity k(PL), which {{is a function of the}} boundary layer's heat transfer coefficient alpha(f) and the base material's thickness delta. This implies that a weld cooling time Delta tT(1) /T- 2 in a forced flow of fluid can now be calculated by an ordinary engineering calculator and thus enabling suitable welding parameters to be determined. The magnitude of k(PL) (alpha(f),delta) was established by regression analysis of results from a parametric finite element analysis series of a total number of 112 numerical simulations. Furthermore, the result of the regression analysis was validated and verified by a welding experiment series accomplished on an in-house designed and constructed in-service welding rig. The principle design of the welding rig as well as its instrumentation, a PC based Data Acquisition system, is described. In addition, a method to measure the weld metals cooling time Delta tT(1) /T- 2 by means of <b>thermocouple</b> <b>elements</b> is described.

Absolute cavity radiometers easily meet the spectral response and accuracy requirements for Earth albedo measurements, but the radiometers available today lack the necessary sensitivity and response time.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fabrication {{of a complete}} <b>thermocouple</b> assembly. <b>Elements</b> of construction and installation are discussed under the headings thermocouple current, fabrication, switch box fabrication, field installation of the cable and temperature readings. The principle of measurement is that the emf generated between a reference junction of known temperature and one of unknown temperature can give the unknown temperature. The two metals used are copper and constantan, and the wires must be protected electrically from short circuits. Twenty gauge duplex wire individually encased in polyvinyl chloride is satisfactory. The wires from the installation are usually terminated in a weatherproof switch box. Leeds and Northrup rotary switches, type 31 - 3 are used. Simple clamp type connectors and terminal blocks ensure positive connection. The copper wires are attached to rotary switches. The constantan wires are attached to a common constantan wire. The thermocouple cable's outer jacket is cut at the depths at which readings are required and the copper and constantan wires are soldered to give a thermocouple junction. The completed multi-wire cable is inserted in a suitable length of polyethylene hose. A lucite or brass plug seals the lower end. Steel switch boxes house the switches and wire connection from the elements and still provide accessibility for readings. The cable and switch box are filled with high quality transformer oil. Installation involves pushing the assembly into a bore hole {{or in the case}} of short cables, a test pit. Longer assemblies are usually lowered into bore holes with a 10 - 20 lb weight tied to the bottom. Finally the bore hole is backfilled so that no air pockets exist.

Nickel seed was used to initiate the reduction process, sodium hypophosphite {{was used as a}} reducing agent, and ammonia solution was used to adjust pH, poly(ethylene-comaleic anhydride) (EMA) was used as the first additive and poly(acrylic acid) (PA) as the second additive. Reduction experiments were conducted at a temperature between 60 oC to 70 oC, pH around 8 and a reaction time of 3 min. Synthetic nickel sulfate solution and sodium hypophosphite solutions at concentration of 0. 5 g/L were used as nickel feed solution and reducing agent, respectively. Additives were investigated at high and low concentrations of 5 mg/L and 10 mg/L. The effect of additives on reduction behavior of nickel was investigated by studying the evolution of the volume distribution, moments, specific surface area, and rate of reduction and purity of the powder product. EMA was found to be a growth promoter and PA was found to be a growth inhibitor. The highest reduction rate was observed in the presence of EMA and the lowest in the presence of PA. The SEM micrographs of the powder obtained in the presence of EMA and PA showed that the powder was spherical shaped, open, dentritic and more porous compared with that of the seed particles. Both additives were found to increase the pore size of the powder particles. The presence of particle fragments observed in the scanning electron micrographs confirmed breakage as one of the major particulate process.

40|$|The German {{automotive}} industry {{is trying to}} achieve full electric mobility in Germany. Therefore the research {{focus is on the}} battery as the new primary energy storage. Not only the shorter range and higher costs of this technology are a problem. In addition to that, the battery is a highly dynamic and demanding consumer from a thermodynamic point of view. The working temperature is limited to the range between 20 and 40 °C. Below 0 °C and over 60 °C the life expectancy and the capacity would take damage. Thus the air conditioning cycle of the automobile needs to be adapted to the new challenge. Since the industry wants to simulate every state of the dynamic air conditioning system in the car, numerically robust models are required. A dynamic system model was created and tested in Modelica. Experience shows that in particular low heat loads and mass flows close to zero are causing problems to the solvability of such dynamic cooling cycles. One aspect of these numerical problems is the dynamic heat transfer coefficient at these marginal loads. Hence the aim of the study at the Institute of Thermo-Fluid Dynamics is to investigate the dynamic behavior of the heat transfer coefficient under these conditions for the refrigerant R- 134 a. This paper presents a test rig to measure the heat transfer coefficient of the refrigerant R- 134 a in a small diameter horizontal pipe. The experiment layout is basically a cooling cycle. The basic components are a receiver tank filled with R- 134 a, a pump, an evaporator pipe and a condenser. The evaporator pipe made out of copper is the main <b>element.</b> <b>Thermocouples,</b> pressure sensors and a mass flow sensor provide the information necessary to determine the heat transfer coefficient of the horizontal pipe.
