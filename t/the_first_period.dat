5|$|The scoring started {{early in}} the game as Team Staal's Alexander Ovechkin scored the game's first goal in just 50 seconds into <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period.</b> When he took his first shift Jeff Skinner officially became the {{youngest}} player to play in an All-Star game (18 years, 259 days) surpassing the mark set in 1984 by Steve Yzerman by eight days. By the time Claude Giroux scored, less than five minutes later, Team Staal had opened up a 4–0 lead. Team Lidstrom's Marc-Andre Fleury allowed the four goals on only nine shots while his counterpart Cam Ward stopped the first four shots he faced. The tide turned a little over halfway through <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period</b> when Anze Kopitar scored on a backhand shot. Team Lidstrom completed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period</b> comeback with under four minutes left in the period when Eriksson and Matt Duchene scored 23 seconds apart to tie the game at four. Team Lidstrom finished the period scoring on four of their final ten shots.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} season, the Penguins played the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals, marking {{the first time in}} 25years that two teams played each other in consecutive Finals. Tickets for Games 3 and 4, which were hosted at Mellon Arena, sold out in 10minutes. In {{the first game of the}} series, the Red Wings scored the first goal when a puck shot by Brad Stuart ricocheted off the boards behind the goal, then bounced off Marc-Andre Fleury and into the net. Ruslan Fedotenko, with an assist from Evgeni Malkin, tied the game before the conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period.</b> Detroit went on to score a goal in each of the final two periods to win Game 1, 3–1. Evgeni Malkin scored a powerplay goal in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period</b> of game two, but the Penguins were held scoreless for the remainder of the contest; falling 3–1 for a second consecutive game.|$|E
5|$|In Game 2, the Penguins were shut-out for {{a second}} time. Detroit's Brad Stuart and Tomas Holmstrom scored in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period</b> and Valtteri Filppula added a third goal in the third period. Pittsburgh struggled, failing to direct a shot on goal for the first 12 minutes of the game.

5|$|Liverpool {{kicked off}} {{the first half of}} extra time. Pirlo had a chance in the early stages, but he put his shot over the crossbar. Tomasson came close in the later stages of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period</b> of extra time, but he could not make contact with the ball. Vladimír Šmicer {{required}} treatment for cramp towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period,</b> as a number of Liverpool players felt fatigued. Liverpool had the most of the early exchanges after winning two corners, but could not score. Shortly afterwards, Milan make their final substitution replacing Gennaro Gattuso with Rui Costa. The best chance of the second half came near the end when Shevchenko shot at goal. Dudek saved only for it to rebound back out to Shevchenko, who again shot from under , which Dudek again saved by pushing the shot over the bar. Liverpool had one last chance at the end of extra time, but John Arne Riise's free kick shot was blocked and following this the referee signalled the end of extra time, which meant a penalty shoot-out would decide the championship.|$|E

5|$|The {{salary for}} Soviet {{citizens}} increased abruptly by almost 2.5 {{times during the}} plan. Real wages in 1980 amounted to 232.7 rubles, compared to 166.3 rubles before the 1965 Soviet economic reform and the Eight-Five Year Plan. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>period,</b> 1960–1964, was characterised by low growth, while the second period, 1965–1981, had a stronger growth rate. The second period vividly demonstrated {{the success of the}} Kosygin reform, with the average annual growth in retail turnover being 11.2 billion rubles, 1.8 times higher than in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period</b> and 1.2 times higher than the third period (1981–1985). Consumption of goods and daily demand also increased. The consumption of home appliances greatly increased. Refrigerators increased from a low of 109,000 in 1964 to 440,000 units by 1973; consumption declined during the reversal of the reform. Car production increased, and would continue to do so until the late 1980s. The Soviet leadership, under pressure, sought to provide more attractive goods for Soviet consumers.|$|E

After fighting Richards in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period</b> (one of four fights in the game and Booth's first in the NHL), Booth scored a goal and three assists (completing a Gordie Howe hat trick) to help the Panthers to a 7–4 win.|$|E
