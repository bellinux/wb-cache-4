40|$|Radiometric dating of melt {{rocks at}} impact craters has {{revealed}} that some giant impacts appear to overlap in time with major boundaries in Earth history [e. g., the Cretaceous–Tertiary (K/T) and Jurassic–Cretaceous (J/K) boundaries]. The Morokweng impact crater in South Africa is coincident in age with the J/K boundary. However, the types of objects that generate large craters are poorly known because {{it is difficult to}} unambiguously identify the projectile from the signature it imparts into the impact rocks. Meteorites are highly enriched in the platinum-group elements (PGE), which have been widely used as a tool for identifying the presence of a meteorite signature. Here we present new PGE analyses from the Morokweng impact melt sheet. Our data reveal high PGE concentrations and high degree of PGE correlation through the melt sheet. Regression analysis was used to determine the projectile PGE signature and constrain input from the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>target</b> rocks. The closest match to Morokweng is the PGE signature of ordinary (L or LL) chondrite meteorites, which is broadly in agreement with the results of an earlier Cr isotope study.

The attitude determination and control system onboard the Space Flight Laboratory’s NEMO-class satellite platforms uses an extended Kalman filter and low-cadence (1 Hz) star-tracker measurements to constrain the attitude and rate estimation errors to within 0. 05 ° and 0. 04 °/s (2 -σ), respectively. In addition, the pointing error of this satellite platform is constrained to below 0. 3 ° (2 -σ) for ground target tracking applications. However, {{in order to meet}} the stability requirements of future missions that require precise target-tracking capabilities, a combination of star tracker and high frequency gyro-measurements is preferred. Leveraging high-grade miniaturized and commercially-accessible fiber optic gyroscopes (FOGs) with sampling frequencies of ≥ 2 Hz, a high-performance attitude determination and control system suitable for target tracking micro- and nano-satellites is under development at the Space Flight Laboratory of Toronto, Canada. This paper discusses the design of an attitude estimation filter tailored to constrain the ground target pointing error of NEMO-class satellites to well below 0. 3 ° (3 -σ). To evaluate the performance of this filter, precision target tracking simulations were conducted, and the results demonstrated significant improvement in some state estimates when a combination of three-orthogonally mounted FOGs operating at high cadence (5 Hz) and a single star tracker operating at 1 Hz were implemented...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical solution for a low-thrust maneuver {{to reduce the}} flyover time of a given <b>terrestrial</b> <b>target.</b> The work extends the general solution previously developed by the authors for a 3 -phase spiral transfer that results in {{a change in the}} relative right ascension of the ascending node and argument of latitude of satellites in a constellation, by varying the orbital period and the J 2 effect experienced by each satellite. This work improves the accuracy of the existing method by including the periodic effects of J 2 in the analytical solution. Using these improved equations, a calculation of the flyover time of a given latitude can be determined, and the passes for which the target longitude is in view identified. Validation against a numerical orbit propagator shows the analytical method to accurately predict the sub-satellite point of the satellite to within ± 1 ° of longitude after 15 days. A case study is performed showing that the method can successfully be used to reduce the time of flyover of Los Angeles from 14 days to just 1. 97 days, with a change of velocity (ΔV) of 63 m/s. The full exploration of the solution space shows the problem to be highly complex, such that an increase in the ΔV used for a maneuver will not necessarily reduce the time of flyover, potentially making optimization using a numerical solution challenging. It also shows that very similar flyover times can be achieved with very different ΔV usage. As such, an overview of the solution space is extremely valuable in allowing an informed trade-off between the time of flyover and maneuver ΔV...|$|E

AUGEO system intends to assess and decrease co-registration errors in remote imagery through geo-referenced terrestrial targets (TT), captured in the imagery and semi-automatically recognized by AUGEO 2. 0 ® software. This works as an add-on of ENVI® for image co-registration. A higher number of TT used in the geo-referencing process leads to a lower obtained error (RMSE). Pair/ couple TT considerably increased accuracy. Furthermore, results from coupled analysis show that TT detection increased as {{the distance between the}} TTs decreased. AUGEO system requires considerably less time than conventional georeferencing field work and subsequent computer work, and allows the georeferencing of images of areas that do not contain recognizable ground control points for verification and validation.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that a large meteorite approximately 10 km in diameter impacted Earth at the termination of the Cretaceous Period with cosmic velocity, vaporising itself, along with a greater mass of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>target</b> rocks into a cloud of hot rock vapour. The vapour cloud condensed into particles of sand to clay size at high altitude before returning to Earth to form a worldwide layer marking the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. Chemical evidence from this boundary layer suggests that the impactor was a chondritic meteorite, enriched in the platinum group elements compared to the Earth's crust. An enrichment of these elements above their background crustal abundances to approximately 0. 1 of the chondritic abundance has been observed {{in a number of}} Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary layers worldwide. Iridium is the platinum group element traditionally used as an indicator of the extraterrestrial component (ETC) in likely impact layers due to its rarity in the Earth's crust and low detection limits possible using neutron activation analysis methods. Neutron activation analysis is however expensive and requires specialist facilities, this thesis proposes that the elements gold and palladium {{can also be used to}} indicate the ETC in the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary layer. Samples from two Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary sites, Woodside Creek and Chancet Quarry, were analysed for gold and palladium using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. A strong correlation was found between iridium, gold, and palladium abundances at these sites, with all showing enrichment at precisely the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary in proportion to iridium, indicating a common origin for all three elements. Gold showed almost precisely the expected 0. 1 of its chondritic abundance in the clay size fraction at both Woodside Creek and Chancet Quarry (15 ng/g). Palladium showed exactly 0. 1 of its chondritic abundance at the Chancet Quarry boundary with 53 ng/g. Gold abundances on the boundary at Woodside Creek (55 ng/g) and Chancet Quarry (44 ng/g) showed excellent agreement with published values as did the palladium result for Woodside Creek (22 ng/g) ...|$|E

40|$|BioProtein® (BP) is a {{trademark}} for single cell (bacteria) protein, based on conversion of methane, {{with the addition}} of ammonia and oxygen, to a protein source. BP is produced by Norferm AS in Norway, and has been authorized by the EU as a protein source in animal feeds since 1995, for fattening pigs (8 %), calves (8 %) and salmon (19 - 33 %). Significant immune effects were revealed in a toxicity study performed in rats fed a nucleic acid reduced BP product (NABP) and thereafter, similar, but less severe effects were also found after feeding with untreated BP. Additional studies confirmed increased mesenteric lymph node weights in cats and foxes. Due to the undesirable effects and also due to applications for extended use, BP has been assessed by the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition (SCAN) and EU’s Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1995, by SCAN in 2001 and 2003 and by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2005. The EU memberstates United Kingdom, France and Finland have also conducted assessments. The EU approval from 1995 remains unchanged. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority requested the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM) to assess the risk of using BP as a protein source in feedingstuffs, both for the animal categories already authorized and for extended use to pet animals, chickens and pigs from weaning to slaughter. The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety was asked to consider all existing documentation. Based on all documentation enclosed with the request from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and published scientific articels, an opinion on the safety of BP assessed by the VKM panel on Animal Feed was published on 20 March 2006 (05 / 608 -final-rev 1). The Producer made a complaint regarding this opinion and claimed that not all documents on BP had been evaluated. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority then requested VKM to revise its opinion on the risk of using BP as a protein source in feedingstuffs, based on 17 documents previously not available to VKM, in addition to the 20 documents included in the opinion published on 20 March 2006. BP is composed of a protein with a somewhat different amino acid compostion compared with fish meal, but BP and fish meal have more similarities in amino acid content than soybean meal. BP has relatively high level of nucleic acids, phospholipids, lipopolysaccarides and minerals. Effect studies with BP have been conducted in rats/mice, pigs, chicken, cats, foxes, and salmon. Most of the concern regarding the side effects of BP in feed is related to the immune response. The main findings include changes in weight and morphology of mesenteric lymph nodes, followed by induction of specific antibodies. Histopathological examination after feeding with NABP also revealed changes in the intestines and several internal organs indicating systemic effects. The Producer claims that the immune response seen in BP-fed mice/rats is most likely a normal response to ingestion of large doses of a foreign antigen, and further, that oral tolerance towards this protein is induced over time. However, these interpretations are not adequately supported by the supplied documentation. A tendency towards adaption might be indicated in some of the studies, other results argue against tolerance induction. It is unclear whether the content of phospholipids, lipopolysaccarides, nucleic acids or the protein structure, or the combination of these compounds is responsible for the immunological changes observed. However, the particulate structure of BP has been shown to influence the observed immune response as the systemic immune response was avoided by ingestion of BP free of whole cells. The studies conducted in target species have not included adequate examinations of the immune effects from ingestion of BP. Concerning terrestrial species, no histopathological effects were revealed in the pig, chicken, cat or fox studies. However, increased mesenteric lymph nodes were reported in cats and foxes fed BP. In the remaining studies the main focus has been on production parameters; weight gain, feed intake, feed efficiency, metabolism of nutrients, observation of clinical health, and product quality. When the contents of amino acids were balanced, the inclusion of low levels of BP (9 %) tended to stimulate growth in pigs and the same tendency was found in chicken with 6 % BP. Higher feed levels of BP tended to cause a reduction in growth. In salmon, a dose dependent improvement of growth was reported in a short term experiment (8 weeks). However, in longer term experiments with salmon, depressed growth and increased liver weight were observed in freshwater at 19 % BP with no-effect-level at 10 %. In seawater studies, a tendency of reduced growth was found in salmon fed with 20 % BP in the diet, and BP levels of 27 % and higher levels resulted in significantly reduced body weight. Furthermore, levels of 27 % BP and above in fish feed reduced specific immune responses, but increased lymphocyte response, and also tended to improve the survival after bacterial and viral infections. At 37 % BP in the diet histopathological changes in the distal intestine, and reduced storage of glycogen and increased lipid deposition and liver weight were observed. No negative effects were seen in salmon in seawater at a feed level of 13. 5 % BP. The results indicate negative effects in salmon at BP levels in fish feed considerably lower than those currently approved (19 and 33 %, in feed for salmon in fresh and sea water, respectively). To conclude, in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>target</b> species documented effects of BP include reduced weight gain and increased weight of mesenteric lymph nodes. In the more thoroughly studied species the rat, findings incluse histopathologic effects in mesenteric lymph nodes, changed humoral immune responses, increased weight of other lymphoid tissue (spleen), increased level of neutrophile granulocytes, and slight leakage of hepatic and renal tubuli enzymes. In <b>terrestrial</b> <b>target</b> species, 6 % BP in the feed is considered to be the highest inclusion level not to cause such effects. The results from the rat studies show a similar no-effect-level. In salmon, reduced weight gain, liver storage effects, changed humoral and celluar immune responses and histopathological effects in the intestine are documented. A 10 % level of BP in fish feed is the highest level tested without causing such effects. There are relatively few valid studies for the risk assessment of BP in target species, and the designs of the assessed studies are very variable. Thus, there are qualitative and quantitative uncertainties concerning the effects of BP in target species. The Panel on Animal Feed is of the opinion that an inclusion level of BP of 6 % in the diets to <b>terrestrial</b> <b>target</b> animals and a 10 % maximum inclusion level in salmon feed (both for fresh- and seawater stages) would reduce the risk of potentially adverse effects in the animals. The risk associated with the human consumption of products from animals fed on BP is considered negligible. However, the production of single cell protein for feed production represents a relatively new scientific approach which implies precautionary handling...|$|E

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the satellite laser ranging is the millimeter precision and accuracy.

Cloud and aerosol lidar measurements were made to thin cirrus clouds at 13 km altitude with Rayleigh (molecular) backscatter evident up to 9 km. Average transmitter power was 35 mW and measurement integration time was 20 minutes. An AlGaAs laser was used to characterize spectral properties of water vapor absorption lines at 811. 617, 816. 024, and 815. 769 nm in a multipass absorption cell using derivative spectroscopy techniques. Frequency locking of an AlGaAs laser to a water vapor absorption line was achieved with a laser center frequency stability measured to better than one-fifth of the water vapor Doppler linewidth over several minutes. Differential absorption lidar measurements of atmospheric water vapor were made in both integrated path and range-resolved modes using an externally modulated AlGaAs laser. Mean water vapor number density was estimated from both integrated path and range-resolved DIAL measurements and agreed with measured humidity values to within 6. 5 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Error sources were identified and their effects on estimates of water vapor number density calculated...|$|R
50|$|The MiG-31 was {{equipped}} with RK-RLDN and APD-518 digital secure datalinks. The RK-RLDN datalink is for communication with ground control centers. The APD-518 datalink enables a flight of four MiG-31 to automatically exchange radar-generated data within 200 km (124 mi) from each other. It also enables other aircraft with less sophisticated avionics, such as MiG-23,25,29/Su-15,27 to be directed to targets spotted by MiG-31 (a maximum of 4 (long-range) for each MiG-31 aircraft). The A-50 AEW aircraft and MiG-31 can automatically exchange aerial and <b>terrestrial</b> radar <b>target</b> designation, as well as air defense.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{application}} of the radar backscatter frequency correlation for classification and inversion of physical parameters of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>targets</b> is investigated. Traditionally, in radar remote sensing, the backscattering coefficients and the backscatter phase difference statistics of a distributed target are considered for estimating the biophysical parameters of interest. Because of the complex nature of random media scattering problems, however, target classification and parameter inversion algorithms are very convoluted. One obvious way of enhancing the success and accuracy of an inversion algorithm is to expand the dimension of the input vector space. Depending on the radar parameters, such as footprint (pixel) size, incidence angle, and the target attributes (physical parameters), the backscatter signal decorrelates as function of frequency. In this paper, analytical and experimental procedures are developed to establish a relationship between the complex frequency correlation function (FCF) of the backscatter and the radar and target attributes. Specifically, two classes of distributed targets are considered: 1) rough surfaces and 2) random media. Analytical expressions for the frequency correlation function are derived and it is shown that the effect of radar parameters can be expressed explicitly and thus removed from the measured correlation functions. The University of Michigan wideband polarimetric scatterometer systems are used to verify the theoretical models and inversion algorithms developed in this study.

40|$|Future space-based experiments, such as (Orbiting Wide-angle Light Collectors (OWL) and JEM-EUSO, view large {{atmospheric}} and <b>terrestrial</b> neutrino <b>targets.</b> With energy thresholds {{slightly above}} 10 (exp 19) eV for observing airshowers via air fluorescence, {{the potential for}} observing the cosmogenic neutrino flux associated with the GZK effect is limited. However, the forward Cherenkov signal associated with the airshower can be observed at much lower energies. A simulation was developed to determine the Cherenkov signal strength and spatial extent at low-Earth orbit for upward-moving airshowers. A model of tau neutrino interactions in the Earth was employed to determine the event rate of interactions that yielded a tau lepton which would induce an upward-moving airshower observable by a space-based instrument. The effect of neutrino attenuation by the Earth forces the viewing of the Earth's limb to observe the vT-induced Cherenkov airshower signal at above the OWL Cherenkov energy threshold of approximately 10 (exp 16. 5) eV for limb-viewed events. Furthermore, the neutrino attenuation limits the effective <b>terrestrial</b> neutrino <b>target</b> area to approximately 3 x 10 (exp 5) square km at 10 (exp 17) eV, for an orbit of 1000 km and an instrumental full Field-of-View of 45 deg. This translates into an observable cosmogenic neutrino event rate of approx. l/year based upon two different models of the cosmogenic neutrino flux, assuming neutrino oscillations and a 10 % duty cycle for observation...|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} surface object temperature from airborne imagery {{is complicated by}} several factors including {{the effects of the}} atmosphere, surface emissivity variations, and BRDF effects. Several methods have been proposed to handle specific cases where some of the unknowns can be eliminated. Typically, these methods use one or two spectral bands or viewing geometries and are applied to large, homogeneous surfaces where the surface emissivity can be approximated as a black body. In particular, a method using two spectral bands for sea-surface temperature estimation with the AVHRR sensor has shown success while removing the need for an estimate of the atmospheric upwelling radiance. Here, this method is extended to include a third band measurement and is applied to <b>terrestrial</b> <b>targets.</b> The algorithm has been tested against a synthetic scene containing a wide variety of targets. Temperature prediction capabilities are modestly improved by inclusion of the third radiance band measurement. Sensitivity studies demonstrate that the inclusion of the third band slightly decreases the sensitivity of the algorithm to knowledge of the atmospheric transmission and downwelling radiance. This is true even for stressing cases such as hot targets and targets with very low emissivity. It is also shown that for both methods precise knowledge of the downwelling radiance is the least significant input parameter for accurate surface temperature estimation...|$|R
