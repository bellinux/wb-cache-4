5|$|Wanting {{to reunite}} with Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into taking {{him back to}} the Land of the Living by pretending he wants her to meet his parents. She agrees to this and takes him to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, to return Victor and Emily {{temporarily}} to the Land of the Living. Once back home, Victor asks Emily to wait in the forest while he rushes off to see Victoria and confess his wish to marry her as soon as possible, to which she gladly returns his feelings. Just as they are about to share a kiss, Emily arrives and sees <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together.</b> Feeling betrayed and hurt, she angrily drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead. Victoria tells her parents that Victor has been forcibly wed to a dead woman, but no one believes her. With Victor gone, Victoria's parents decide to marry her off against her will to a presumed-wealthy newcomer in town named Lord Barkis Bittern, who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.|$|E
25|$|It {{was at this}} {{juncture}} that Kember and Pierce chose {{to enter into a}} contractual relationship with Gerald Palmer, a Northamptonshire businessman and concert promoter who had already been functioning recently as Spacemen 3's de facto manager. This tripartite business partnership had the following terms: Palmer would own the master tapes of all future recordings, the rights of which would be licensed to record labels for release; touring and recording costs etc. would be financed by Palmer, who would give Kember and Pierce an advance of £1,000 each; and, in return, all profits would be split 50:50: 50% for Palmer, and 50% for Kember and Pierce and other band members. Significantly, this contract was only with Kember and Pierce, meaning Spacemen 3 as a legal and financial entity would, in essence, constitute only <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> with Palmer. In addition, Palmer became Spacemen 3's manager.|$|E

500|$|Brett Berk, {{writing for}} Vanity Fair, was {{positive}} about the scripting of the Quinn character in the second season premiere, now that the pregnancy storyline was over, and {{was happy to see}} the return of [...] "evil Quinn". Joel Kelly of TV Squad criticized the decision to pair Quinn with Finn again in the Valentine's Day oriented episode. He saw it as a regression of the characters, and commented: [...] "Yes, it feels like Glee Classic, because the series started with <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together.</b> But both of them have changed—Quinn more so than Finn—and having them dating again seems like they're going back to the days when Quinn was the icy lead Cheerio and Finn was the nice but dumb star quarterback." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Here We Go Again" [...] was {{directed}} by Brendan Malloy and Tim Wheeler, both who directed Lovato's previous video [...] "La La Land". The music video was filmed on June 8, 2009 in Los Angeles, California. The video premiered on June 26, 2009 on Disney Channel, following the premiere of Princess Protection Program (which stars Lovato). The video begins with Lovato in her dressing room to prepare for her concert. Lovato is talking to her boyfriend (portrayed by Christopher Mason) over the phone. After hanging up, she rips up a photograph of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together,</b> implying he ended their relationship. He tries to call her back, but she ignores the call and heads to the stage. The boyfriend is shown visiting the concert and after Lovato is finished the performance, she returns to her dressing room. He meets her with a rose and they begin their relationship again.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Cruz and his girlfriend, played by Uzbekistan-born supermodel Nadya Nepomnyashaya, sitting {{together}} in a sports car near a pier. She tells him [...] "You know I'm just gonna hurt you." [...] Cruz responds by saying [...] "You know I'm only gonna break your heart, right?" [...] She says [...] "You want a bet?" [...] and he says [...] "Bring It On." [...] They then exit the car, walk down the pier and enter a nearby speedboat. Scenes are then shown in several different venues, including a club, a boat, a beachfront party, the speedboat and a hotel room. Throughout the video, Cruz is on escapades with different women. The video ends with Cruz's girlfriend laughing at his attempts to break her heart and then the two get off the boat they are on and go back onto the speedboat.

He also said he felt [...] "kind of trapped in that material" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no way out". He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch. When Vilanch intimated that the busy actor appeared less than fully committed to the job, Franco posted a photo of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> graffiti-ed saying [...] "James Fucked up the oscars. Trust me, I KNOW comedy. I mean, come on, I write for Bette Midler". Franco explained to Playboy that [...] "I personally do not do my best thinking when I'm angry.

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons {{reported}} that [...] "Winter Madness" [...] was [...] "something of a letdown." [...] She commented that Julianne Moore's Nancy was not [...] "funny enough" [...] as a [...] "romantic foil for Jack", and that taking {{the show to}} Boston seemed off the mark. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{reported that}} [...] "Winter Madness" [...] fell {{into the category of}} an episode that featured [...] "a lot of funny gags but aren't wholly satisfying" [...] and added that it [...] "just stopped, rather than building to a real conclusion". Sean Gandert of Paste rated unfavorably the pairing of Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore's characters, citing {{that they do not have}} [...] "much rapport, so the scenes with <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> are a bit dead, as much as I usually enjoy seeing Julianne Moore in pretty much anything." [...] Amos Barshad for New York magazine criticized Moore's Boston accent, citing that it was [...] "atrocious", while TV Guide Magazines Bruce Fretts opined that the accent was [...] "wicked bad". Regarding the episode itself, Fretts said that it was [...] "weak".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of Glee second season, Lauren forms a {{relationship}} with local bad boy and football star Noah Puckerman. As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled [...] "Special Education". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride. I know what you mean, but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's going somewhere. Ultimately, {{it comes down to}} whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility." ...|$|E

Glee co-creator Ian Brennan appeared in the episode as a Regionals competition judge named Svengoobles, a parody of the character Svengoolie. NeNe Leakes, who plays coach Roz Washington, was announced by a Fox press release as guest starring in the episode, and Leakes and Chris Colfer both tweeted a picture of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> from the set during the filming of the Regionals competition, but the scenes shot with Leakes did {{not appear in the}} episode as broadcast, nor was she credited.

500|$|Nominal {{impedance}} {{first started}} to be specified {{in the early days}} of telecommunications. [...] At first amplifiers were not available and when they did become available they were expensive. [...] It was consequently necessary to achieve maximum power transfer from the cable at the receiving end in order to maximise the lengths of cables that could be installed. [...] It also became apparent that reflections on the transmission line would severely limit the bandwidth that could be used or the distance that it was practicable to transmit. [...] Matching equipment impedance to the characteristic impedance of the cable reduces reflections (and they are eliminated altogether if the match is perfect) and power transfer is maximised. [...] To this end, all cables and equipment {{started to be}} specified to a standard nominal impedance. [...] The earliest, and still the most widespread, standard is 600 Ω, originally used for telephony. [...] It has to be said that the choice of this figure had more to do with the way telephones were interfaced into the local exchange than any characteristic of the local telephone cable. [...] Telephones (old style analogue telephones) connect to the exchange through twisted pair cabling. [...] Each leg of the pair is connected to a relay coil which detect the signalling on the line (dialling, handset off-hook etc.). [...] The other end of one coil is connected to a supply voltage and the second coil is connected to ground. [...] A telephone exchange relay coil is around 300 Ω so <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> are terminating the line in 600 Ω.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on June 28, 2008 on ABC. It was {{the most}} watched music-related video on YouTube until it was surpassed by Lady Gaga's [...] "Bad Romance" [...] music video in Spring 2010. Todd Martens of The Los Angeles Times was {{disappointed}} with the video's special effects and production values, adding that it looked [...] "as if it were filmed with one camera on a tripod in a single-bulb basement". However, he complimented how they [...] "show off Miley's universal appeal". Henry Freeland of Paste magazine said, [...] "Cyrus wiggles to and fro, mugging for the camera like her face is fighting gravity and barely winning." [...] A Pop Cultured review from MTV described the video as PG and [...] "Disney approved". The review continued that it was mildly angry, comparing Cyrus to [...] "a watered-down version of Avril Lavigne's kid sister, and Lindsay Lohan's pseudo-rebellious character in Freaky Friday [...] minus the eyeliner". Leigh Holmwood of The Guardian commented, [...] "Miley's new music vid, reminds me, creepily enough, of early Britney." [...] Molly Lambert of the New York Times described Cyrus as the video's [...] "charismatic center" [...] and writes, [...] "When she flashes Nick’s dog tags {{and a picture of}} <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>together,</b> she seems so vindictive and so embarrassingly vulnerable, just like [...] [...] [...] a 15-year-old suffering her first serious heartbreak, basically." [...] The video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Tokio Hotel's music video for [...] "Ready, Set, Go!". At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best Editing, but lost to Beyoncé Knowles' music video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)".|$|E
