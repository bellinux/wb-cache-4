Free delivery SCs were associated with a more systematic application of SCs in case of exposure, and a decreased sunburn occurrence, without increase of exposure.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of ageing on the {{mobility}} and sequestration of 14 C-phenanthrene in an agricultural soil. We used autovial microcolumns incubated for a period ranging between 0 and 156 days. Our results showed that {{a large proportion of}} radioactivity remained extractable by methanol up to 64 days of incubation, amounting from 44. 5 to 80. 2 % of initial radioactivity. Mineralisation of 14 C-phenanthrene began tardily, after the decrease of mineralisation of the soil organic matter. Throughout incubation, mineralisation remained slow and weak, of co-metabolic type, and only 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>applied</b> was mineralised over a period of 156 days. The amount of radioactivity leached varied considerably during incubation. Under {{the effect of}} water percolation of 64 mm, <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> exported in equivalent 14 C-phenanthrene went from 0. 90 to 0. 48 ng/g of soil between 0 and 35 days, then increased up to 1. 5 ng/g at 100 days. The radioactivity present in pore water displayed the same dynamic and the same variations. For pore water, this radioactivity represented, in equivalent phenanthrene, 0. 09 ng/g of soil up to 46 days, then increased rapidly to reach 0. 5 ng/g at 65 days. In both cases (leachates and pore water), enrichment in radioactivity due to the presence of a high proportion of polar compounds reached 89 %. Lastly, the formation of non-extractable residues progressed very slowly up to 45 days (5. 9 to 13 % of the amount applied), after which there was a marked increase, i. e. to 20. 7, 32. 2 and 35. 8 % at 52, 64 and 156 days, respectively. These increases in radioactivity in different compartments of soil are correlated with mineralisation of phenanthrene due to preliminary production of degradation products. Thus, the capacity of a soil to degrade and mineralise phenanthrene plays a determining role in the distribution of its residues between the soil solution and the solid matrix. Overall, our results suggest that in agricultural soils contaminated by strongly adsorbed organic compounds, water pollution and sequestration are primarily controlled by degradation...|$|R

Prevalence of infection was positively correlated with <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> of inoculum <b>applied</b> but negatively correlated with the interval between application and sampling of larvae for both granular and spray formulations.

On the contrary, the sample size in the range investigated (0. 2 - 1. 0 g) showed a negligible effect on the ignition properties. The influence of fire chemical retardants (NH 4) 2 HPO 4 (DAP) and (NH 4) 2 SO 4 (AS) on the ignitability characteristics was studied under various concentration levels. The data in {{this study showed that}} the presence of DAP and AS increases the fire point, as well as the time required for ignition, and this effect is pronounced at high concentration levels. However, at lower temperatures, i. e. below 500 °C, flaming combustion appears sensitive to <b>the</b> AS <b>quantity</b> <b>applied,</b> whereas at high temperatures (i. e. above 600 °C) the DAP concentration had a major influence on its flammability behavior. In addition the time of combustion was slightly extended, therefore, the energy release rate was reduced in the presence of fire retardants, particularly of AS. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the fire extinguishing capabilities of (NH 4) 2 HPO 4 and (NH 4) 2 SO 4, commonly used chemicals in forest fires, by comparing the ignition properties of samples, prior and after retardant loading. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} effect of {{different}} doses of lime in acid sulphate soils and physiological responses of two species of grasses, Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst and Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. Materials and methods. The work was carried out during 2006 in acid sulfate soils at El Deseo farm (Ciénaga de Oro - Córdoba, Colombia), where 3, 6 and 9 tons/ha of agricultural lime was applied and two grass species, Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst (pasto estrella) and Brachiaria decumbens Stapf (pasto brachiaria) were planted. The responses considered during 5 mowings were the chemical features of the soil, fresh and dry weight of each genotype and the leaf/stem ratio. An experiment of complete random blocks was designed using a structure of divided plots, where the main plots corresponded to the grasses and the subplots to the lime doses. Results. The most outstanding results suggested that the pH values and aluminum in the soil concentrations fall significantly with <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> of <b>applied</b> lime, decreasing up to 80 %. In general, the interchangeable bases increased with the lime dosage and {{the contents of the}} microelements decreased considerably over time, although this was not evident for the lime. Independently of genotype, the production of fresh biomass showed a linear relationship within lime dosage (y= 0, 656 x + 11, 99; R 2 = 0. 92); the dry mass and the leaf/stem ratio were always greater for B. decumbens compared to C. nlemfuensis, independent of lime dosage...|$|R
