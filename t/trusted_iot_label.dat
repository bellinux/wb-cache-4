40|$|Prior {{research}} on interorganizational <b>trust</b> (<b>IOT)</b> has drawn on multiple theories across disci-plines, resulting in mixed findings. This meta-analysis combines {{the three major}} theories of IOT, namely, transaction cost economics, social embeddedness theory, and resource dependence theory, to retheorize about these IOT relationships. Specifically, we consolidate 168 tests of IOT across theories and corroborate the additive predictive validity {{of each of the}} three theories and their combined explanations on IOT development. In particular, by combining IOT theories, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between relationship duration and IOT; we also find an intertemporal link among the three IOT theories, and relationship duration as the spanning fac-tor functions to moderate the IOT relationships across theories. These findings serve to recon-cile prior conflicting findings and shed new light on IOT development. We conclude our meta-analysis by providing directions for future research...|$|R

40|$|Application {{of trust}} {{principals}} in {{internet of things}} (IoT) has allowed to provide more trustworthy services among the corresponding stakeholders. The most common method of assessing <b>trust</b> in <b>IoT</b> applications is to estimate trust level of the end entities (entity-centric) relative to the trustor. In these systems, trust level of the data {{is assumed to be}} the same as the trust level of the data source. However, most of the IoT based systems are data centric and operate in dynamic environments, which need immediate actions without waiting for a trust report from end entities. We address this challenge by extending our previous proposals on trust establishment for entities based on their reputation, experience and knowledge, to trust estimation of data items [1 - 3]. First, we present a hybrid trust framework for evaluating both data trust and entity trust, which will be enhanced as a standardization for future data driven society. The modules including data trust metric extraction, data trust aggregation, evaluation and prediction are elaborated inside the proposed framework. Finally, a possible design model is described to implement the proposed ideas...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWith the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, {{potentially}} private {{data could}} be made available on the Internet. Such data could then, be consumed by {{a growing number of}} applications. The acceptance and success of new pervasive applications depend on both the protection of privacy and the guarantee of quality of context (QoC). As in the IoT producers and consumers of context are decoupled, they are not aware of each other. Therefore, it is essential to provide them with means to express their guarantees and requirements concerning QoC and privacy. For this purpose, we propose meta-models to design context contracts defining privacy and QoC agreements, independently of the consumer and the producer sides. The contracts are key to an autonomous management of QoC and privacy in the IoT. Firstly, contracts may be modified at runtime to add, edit or remove clauses. Secondly, the middleware in charge of transmitting data from context producers to context consumers (e. g., context managers) will be able to match QoC/privacy requirements and guarantees. Finally, the matching process can adapt dynamically, for instance, to the current trust level between the two parties. These contracts will participate to build <b>trust</b> among <b>IoT</b> participant...|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{evolution}} of the Internet towards the Internet of Things (IoT) is creating new exciting markets and applications, but also poses new questions {{on the relationship between}} the human subjects and the IoT devices and services. Connected medical devices, wearable sensors, smart cars and smart appliances will become more and more extensions of the human body and mind, enhancing the synergies between humans, the physical, and the digital world. In this context, there is the risk that humans increasingly shift or delegate their freedom and capability to act (agency) to IoT “things”, which have unclear or undefined levels of trust. There is the need to create “more robustly” trusted and effective digital relationships, where the users can maintain their control on the IoT services and the generated flows of data. In addition, they should have reliable knowledge of the levels of trust provided by the IoT technologies. In this paper, we discuss how these new relationships should be formed, we identify the main challenges for building <b>trust</b> in <b>IoT</b> and we propose a model-based approach for risk, trust, and usage control policies. In our vision, the integration of specific technological tools, coupled {{with a high level of}} choice for the citizen/user can be used to mitigate these challenges. JRC.

40|$|Internet of Things (IoT) {{is a broad}} term which {{indicates}} the concept of increasingly pervasive connected devices (embedded within, attached to or related to “Things”) supporting various applications to enhance the awareness and the capabilities of users. The adoption of IoT essentially depends upon trust. Moreover this trust must be established and maintained {{with respect to a}} broad group of stakeholders otherwise IoT will face, to some degree or other, challenges which may restrict adoption scope or delay its timing. Without sufficient IoT security it is highly likely that some applications will more resemble the Intranet of Things rather than the Internet of Things as users seek to place their own proprietary protection barriers and thus frustrating broad interoperability. Many of the device connections to the Internet today more closely resemble the Intranet of Things which differs dramatically from the vision for the Internet of Things, the latter being a much more open and interoperable environment allowing in theory the connection with many more objects and, with their multiple IoT compatible devices. One specific challenge within IoT is the control exercised over information collected by increasingly small and pervasive mobile devices, like RFID or future micro-nano sensors which can be ingested, implanted, worn or distributed elsewhere within the environment. In most cases, such devices have the capability of being wireless connected and accessible at all times and by anyone. In this context, the challenge is to ensure that the information collected and stored by the devices should be visible and distributed only by those legally permitted and authorized, acknowledging that permissions and authorizations may change throughout a devices or objects life or lives. This element of IoT represents {{one of a number of}} perceived and real concerns which are grouped under the title of IoT privacy. One aspect which often gets overlooked particularly frequently by those of us who entered adulthood before the year 1990 is the importance of the virtual-world. The Internet is a virtual environment. IoT is capable of establishing an important new bridge between the real and virtual-worlds. This bridge is likely to grow and become more relevant to the lives of citizens in the future allowing real-world augmentation of virtual-worlds and conversely allow the virtual-world to be enhanced by real-world information. Noteworthy is that IoT devices may be real or, virtual or, include aspects of both, either instantaneously or one or the other over a device’s or thing’s lifetime. IoT not only supports the exchange of information it nourishes the creation of greater automation. When IoT delivers this automation often reference is made to “smart” e. g. smart-city, smart-healthcare, etc. <b>Trusted</b> <b>IoT</b> therefore extends to confident and appropriate outcomes and not only the aggregation of clear dependable and timely information. Similar such “smart” automation has been widely used for investment banking transactions which has shown how a small change can cause an almost instantaneous and unstoppable global avalanche of stock values which was neither intended nor justified and resulting in severe penalties for a large number of stakeholders. IoT and “smart” applications effects need careful consideration and possibly some form of permanent monitoring to identity potential risks and oversee the development and introduction of suitably appropriate measures. A future IoT governance model has a role in overseeing such measures are put in place to protect IoT users and reinforce trust and confidence in “smart” applications.

40|$|In the {{blooming}} {{era of the}} Internet of Things (<b>IoT),</b> <b>trust</b> {{has been}} accepted as a vital factor for provisioning secure, reliable, seamless communications and services. However, {{a large number of}} challenges have been unsolved yet due to the ambiguity of the concept of trust as well as the variety of divergent trust models in different contexts. In this research, we augment the trust concept, the trust definition and provide a general conceptual model {{in the context of the}} Social IoT (SIoT) environment by breaking down all attributes influencing trust. Then, we propose a trust evaluation model called REK comprised of the triad Reputation, Experience and Knowledge trust indicators (TIs). The REK model covers multi-dimensional aspects of trust by incorporating heterogeneous information from direct observation (as Knowledge TI), personal experiences (as Experience TI) to global opinions (as Reputation TI). The associated evaluation models for the three TIs are also proposed and provisioned. We then come up with an aggregation mechanism for deriving trust values as the final outcome of the REK evaluation model. We believe this article offers better understandings on trust as well as provides several prospective approaches for the trust evaluation in the SIoT environment...|$|R

The characteristics of the Internet of Things (IoT) are such that traditional models of trust developed within interpersonal, organisational, virtual and Information Systems (IS) contexts may be inappropriate for use within an IoT context. The {{purpose of this study}} is to offer empirically generated understandings of <b>trust</b> within potential <b>IoT</b> applications. In an attempt to capture and communicate the complex and all-pervading but frequently inconspicuous nature of ubiquitous technologies within potential IoT techno-systems, propositions developed are investigated using a novel mixed methods research design combining a videographic projective technique with a quantitative survey, sampling 1200 respondents. Research findings suggest the dimensionality of trust may vary according to the IoT techno-service context being assessed. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, and from a theoretical perspective, it offers a conceptual foundation for trust dimensions within potential IoT applications based upon empirical evaluation. Second, and from a pragmatic perspective, the paper offers insights into how findings may guide practitioners in developing appropriate trust management systems dependent upon the characteristics of particular techno-service contexts...|$|R
30|$|Five inhibitors (i 1 –i 5) {{belonging}} to the industrial domain were identified in literature (Table  3). These inhibitors affect the industry overall and are largely external to the enterprise. The lack of clear regulations on the collection, sharing and use of data can pose significant legal challenges for enterprises developing IoT applications. Issues pertaining to data access and collection {{are tied to the}} basic right to privacy, which includes concealing personal information and the ability to control what happens with this information (Weber 2010). IoT applications will remain limited to a few niche markets if there is continued public concern about privacy (Sundmaeker et al. 2010). The lack of comprehensive, trustworthy and widely accepted service intermediaries prevents the deployment of IoT applications (Haller et al. 2009). The lack of a method for certification of IoT applications can pose a challenge to enterprises trying to establish credibility and improve customer <b>trust</b> in their <b>IoT</b> applications. A few emerging certification programs for IoT-specific applications are available (Underwriters Laboratories 2016; ICSA Labs 2017; IoT Security Foundation 2017).

IoT is now part of our life and {{we have to deal with}} it. More than 10 billion devices are already connected and five times more are expected to be deployed in the next five years. While deployment and integration of IoT is expanding, one of the main challenge is to provide practical solutions to security, privacy and <b>trust</b> issues in <b>IoT.</b> Protection and security mechanisms need to include features such as interoperability and scalability but also traceability, authentication and access control while remaining lightweight. Among the most promising approaches to such security mechanisms, physical unclonable functions (PUF) provide a unique identifier for similar but different integrated circuits using some of their physical characteristics. These types of functions can thus be used to authenticate integrated circuits, provide traceability and access control. This paper presents a comprehensive case study of the transient effect ring oscillator (TERO) PUF from its implementation on FPGAs to its complete characterization. The implementation of the PUF is detailed for two different families of FPGAs: Xilinx Spartan 6 and Altera Cyclone V. All the metrics used for the characterization are explained in detail and the results of the characterization include robustness to environmental parameters including variations in temperature and voltage. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained for another PUF: the ring oscillator (RO) PUF.
