40|$|We {{have tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>proliferation</b> of synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) observed during in vitro culture {{is due to a}} mechanism analogous to the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR). Thus by observing the effect of addition of cyclosporin A, monoclonal anti-HLA-DR antibody, and recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL- 2) on <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>proliferation</b> of SFMC from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a wide range of seronegative spondyloarthritides (SN), we have demonstrated that this phenomenon is: (i) a T cell response, (ii) inhibited by the addition of cyclosporin A or monoclonal anti-HLA-DR antibody, (iii) enhanced by the addition of rIL- 2 and (iv) the rIL- 2 enhancement of <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>proliferation</b> is inhibited by a monoclonal anti-HLA-DR antibody. These observations suggest that <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>proliferation</b> of SFMC is at least in part an HLA-DR driven, IL- 2 dependent event analogous to the AMLR, and support the concept derived from immunohistological studies of an important role for an antigen-presenting cell/T cell interaction occurring in the synovial membrane in inflammatory joint diseases such as RA...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Previous clinical trials {{showed that there}} was no clinical benefit in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer when chemotherapy combined with gefitinib. The present study aims to assess the sequential administration of paclitaxel and gefitinib on <b>the</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> of lung adenocarcinoma cell SPC-A 1 and to explore its mechanism by observing their effects on the cell cycle. Methods The expression of EGFR mRNA and EGFR protein were examined by RT-PCR and western blotting respectively. MTT was used to measure <b>the</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> of SPC-A 1 cells. Cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry. Results Both EGFR mRNA and EGFR protein were overexpressed in SPC-A 1 cells. From 1 × 10 - 14 M to 1 × 10 - 6 M, both paclitaxel and gefitinib inhibited <b>the</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> of SPC-A 1 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner in vitro. The effects of paclitaxel in combination with gefitinib on cell <b>proliferation</b> depended on <b>the</b> sequence. No significant additive effects on cell proliferation was found when they were used simultaneously or gefitinib was added before paclitaxel. However, sequential administration of gefitinib following paclitaxel can remarkably enhanced the effect of paclitaxel on <b>the</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> of SPC-A 1 cells. Cell cycle studies showed that paclitaxel and gefitinib induced G 2 /M and G 0 /G 1 arrest respectively. The G 0 /G 1 arrest was observed when paclitaxel and gefitinib was used simultaneously or gefitinib was added before paclitaxel. In contrast, sequential administration of gefitinib following paclitaxel induced G 2 /M arrest. Conclusion Both paclitaxel and gefitinib inhibits <b>the</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> of SPC-A 1 cells. The additive effects on cell <b>proliferation</b> are sequential-dependent. <b>The</b> concomitant and the sequential treatment of gefitinib followed by paclitaxel exert no significant additive effects on <b>the</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> and resulted in the accumulation of cells in G 0 /G 1 phase, which may decrease the effectiveness of paclitaxel in subsequent cycles. The additive effected on <b>the</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> are observed only when gefitinib is sequentially administrated following paclitaxel, which results in the G 2 /M arrest. The increase in G 2 /M phase suggests that cell cycle effects might not explain the observed additive effects...|$|R
5|$|Burghs had unique layouts and {{economic}} functions.

The foundations of around 15 burghs {{can be traced to}} the reign of David I and there is evidence of 55 burghs by 1296. In addition to the major royal burghs, the late Middle Ages saw <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts. Excluded from international trade they mainly acted as local markets and centres of craftsmanship. In general, burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands than nationally or internationally, relying on them for food and raw materials.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} {{innate immune system}} and {{adaptive}} immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E
