Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters <b>to</b> <b>verify</b> <b>the</b> presence of plutonium.

5|$|Using {{a program}} called Blendanal, similar to the Blender {{technique}} used <b>to</b> <b>verify</b> <b>the</b> planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light curve and radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a bright star and a binary star in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star whose secondary companion is too dim to be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated that the planet HAT-P-33b did indeed exist.|$|E
