5|$|Many {{stations}} in the subway system have mezzanines. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> before entering. Inside mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In many older stations, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E

40|$|Enhancing bus {{transit system}} {{performance}} and increasing its market potential has {{significant impact on}} congestion and air quality in urban areas. Such derived benefits can be maximized by providing safe and improved access to buses at bus-stops. However, buses typically stop at locations farther away from an intersection. These locations do not have adequate facilities such as crosswalks <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Riders or users, thus, tend <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> midblock from either behind or {{in front of the}} buses. These unsafe maneuvers result in pedestrian crashes and pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. The focus {{of this paper is to}} develop a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based methodology to identify and rank bus-stops in pedestrian high crash concentration areas. The GIS based methodology involves (1) geocoding pedestrian crash data, (2) identifying pedestrian crash concentrations by generating a crash concentration map, (3) overlaying this on a bus-stop coverage to identify pedestrian high crash locations in the vicinity of bus-stops, (4) extracting the number of crashes for each bus-stop location in pedestrian high crash concentration areas, and (5) ranking the high crash bus-stop locations. The causes of pedestrian crashes at these bus-stop locations then need to be studied to identify strategies to enhance safety at such locations. The working of the GIS based methodology is illustrated using 2002 pedestrian crash data, bus-stop coverage, and street centerline coverage for the Las Vegas metropolitan area...|$|R

Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins shouted, as Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E
25|$|The {{station is}} part of the {{original}} set of stations which made up the first phase of Line 2. It was built on October 31, 1980 at Konkuk University intersection and originally called Hwayang Station. The initial section of Line 2 ran from Sinseoul-Dong to the Sports Complex Station in Jamsil-dong. On March 7, 1985 the station's name was changed from Hwayang to Konkuk University station. Line 7 was joined with Line 2 at this station on October 11, 1996. Star City, a residential and shopping complex, was finished in October 2008 {{with the opening of the}} Lotte Department Store. As part of the development an underground exit was built between the Line 7 platform and complex. It was opened on July 25, 2009. It links the areas without requiring passengers <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and will house several shops.|$|E
25|$|During construction, {{there was}} also {{controversy}} about the unused land between the new roadway and the old one, since Geneva didn't own all of the property. Geneva wanted the state to give the land the college didn't own for free. However, the state refused, but later sold the land (as well as the former Route 18 alignment, which became a private access road for the university) to Geneva. After construction of the new right-of-way was complete and opened, Geneva shrunk part of the southern end to a one-lane road (in order {{to make room for}} the expansion of Reeves Field) and put a sidewalk in where the northern end used to make the first bend in the s-turn, permanently blocking access to the s-bend. A traffic light was installed at the intersection along the new alignment with Geneva R.P. Church, requiring students <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> at the light.|$|E

25|$|Many {{stations}} in the subway system have mezzanines. In underground stations, this typically consists of the first level below the street or the areas between the street and platform level. For open-cut, grade-level and elevated stations, prevalent in uptown Manhattan and the outer boroughs, the mezzanine area often consists of a station house at street level or above the street. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> before entering. At busy intersections, they also act as a pedestrian underpass or overpass. They also allow for crossover between uptown and downtown trains on side platforms or a pair of island platforms, which is very useful when local tracks are closed for construction. Within the mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In underground subway stations built close to ground level or under narrow streets, a characteristic of early IRT and BMT construction, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E

2500|$|Turns on red are {{especially}} problematic for pedestrians due to drivers looking left for traffic on red light and not noticing a pedestrian waiting <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to the driver's right.

40|$|Safety and {{accessibility}} to bus transit systems {{play a vital}} role in increasing transit market potential. Bus passengers often tend <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> from either behind or in front of the bus as crosswalks do not exist near most bus stops, which are typically away from intersections. These unsafe maneuvers frequently result in either autopedestrian collisions or conflicts. Identifying hazardous bus stops would serve as a building block to study the causal factors, select mitigation strategies, and allocate safety funds to improve bus passenger safety. The focus of this article is to develop a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based methodology to assist decision-makers in identifying and ranking bus stops in high auto-pedestrian collision concentration areas. The working of the GISbased methodology is illustrated using 2000 – 2002 auto-pedestrian collision data, traffic volumes, bus stop coverage, transit ridership data, and street centerline coverage for the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Results obtained are sensitive to buffer radius and ranking methods used to rank hazardous bus stops. Potential strategies and countermeasures to enhance safety at hazardous bus stops are also discussed...|$|R
