5|$|The Provisional Legislature of Oregon was the single-chamber {{legislative}} {{body of the}} Provisional Government of Oregon. It served the Oregon Country of the Pacific Northwest of North America from 1843 until early 1849 {{at a time when}} no country had sovereignty over the region. This democratically elected legislature became the Oregon Territorial Legislature when the <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> arrived after the creation of the Oregon Territory by the United States in 1848. The body was first termed the Legislative Committee and later renamed the House of Representatives. Over the course of its six-year history the legislature passed laws, including taxation and liquor regulation, and created an army to deal with conflicts with Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a {{developed}} country and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom {{and quality of}} life. Since the 1980s, New Zealand has transformed from an agrarian, regulated economy to a market economy. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently Jacinda Ardern. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a governor-general, currently Dame Patsy Reddy. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand {{is a member of}} the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> are {{the second}} tier of local {{government}} in New Zealand, below regional councils. There are 67 territorial authorities: 13 city councils (including Auckland Council), 53 district councils and the Chatham Islands Council. District councils serve a combination of rural and urban communities, while city councils administer the larger urban areas. Five <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> (Auckland, Nelson, Gisborne, Tasman and Marlborough) also perform the functions of a regional council and thus are unitary authorities. The Chatham Islands Council is a sui generis territorial authority {{that is similar to}} a unitary authority.|$|E
25|$|Territorial {{authority}} {{districts are}} not subdivisions of regions, {{and some of}} them fall within more than one region. Taupo District has the distinction of straddling the boundaries of four different regions. Regional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> are based on community of interest and road access. Regional councils are responsible for the administration of many environmental and public transport matters, while the <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> administer local roading and reserves, sewerage, building consents, the land use and subdivision aspects of resource management, and other local matters. Some activities are delegated to council-controlled organisations.|$|E
25|$|Six of the <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> are unitary authorities, {{which also}} have the powers of a {{regional}} council. They are Auckland Council, Nelson City Council, the Gisborne, Marlborough and Tasman district councils, and Chatham Islands Council.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance {{received}} 3,080 submissions (from {{a population}} of 1.2 million), 737 of which were made by Waihekeans (population 8,500), almost 1/4 of all submissions. This exemplifies the level of citizen involvement found on Waiheke. A public meeting of 150 residents on 29 March 2008 found a majority in favour of breaking away from Auckland City. The Royal Commission recommended that Waiheke Island retain its community board with enhanced powers. When the new Auckland Council made up of seven councils and <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities,</b> plus the Auckland Regional Council, Waiheke was given its own local board.|$|E
25|$|New Zealandâ€™s local {{government}} structural arrangements were significantly reformed by the Local Government Commission in 1989 when approximately 700 councils and special purpose bodies were amalgamated to create 87 new local authorities. Regional councils were reduced in number from 20 to 13, <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> (city/district councils) from 200 to 75, and special purpose bodies from over 400 to 7. The new district and city councils were generally much larger and most covered substantial areas of both {{urban and rural}} land.

25|$|Louisa, {{along with}} the wives and {{families}} of other Union officers chose to remain behind. They soon had misgivings, not for fear of the approaching rebel army so much as because the evacuation of <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> had encouraged looters and other criminal elements. The Confederates who entered Santa Fe on March 10, 1862 were thus surprised to find a welcoming committee consisting of the wives of Union officers led by the wife of Colonel Canby. As expected, the Confederates established martial law and then conducted a mostly fruitlessly search for hidden supplies. On March 29, 1862 Confederate forces returned to Santa Fe from a Pyrrhic victory at Glorieta Pass. On their way to attack Fort Union, the Confederates had met a force made up predominantly of inexperienced Colorado volunteers. While the Confederates had won a technical victory, a unit of about 500 Coloradans had gone behind Confederate lines and destroyed more than 70 wagons loaded with Confederate food and gear. Without sufficient provisions to lay siege to Fort Union, the rebels had {{no alternative but to}} retreat.|$|E
500|$|Since 1876, various councils have {{administered}} local areas under legislation {{determined by}} the central government. In 1989, the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of regional councils and <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities.</b> The 249 municipalities that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> and 11 regional councils. The regional councils' role is to regulate [...] "the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management", while <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> are responsible for sewage, water, local roads, building consents and other local matters. Five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils. The <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> consist of 13 city councils, 53 district councils, and the Chatham Islands Council. While officially the Chatham Islands Council is not a unitary authority, it undertakes many functions of a regional council.|$|E
500|$|Before local {{government}} {{reforms in the}} late 1980s, a borough council with more than 20,000 people could be proclaimed a city. The boundaries of councils tended to follow {{the edge of the}} built-up area, so there was little difference between the urban area and the {{local government}} area. In 1989, all councils were consolidated into regional councils (top tier) and <b>territorial</b> <b>authorities</b> (second tier) which cover a much wider area and population than the old city councils. Today a territorial authority must have a predominantly urban population of at least 50,000 before it can be officially recognised as a city. The 20 largest urban areas are listed below: ...|$|E
