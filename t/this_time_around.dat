After this failure, he went back to traveling, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> Shandong and Hebei.|$|E

Ornais incurred a cervical fracture at the fourth fence (a plain 4ft 10-inch obstacle) and Dooneys Gate fractured his thoracolumbar at fence six (the 5ft Becher's Brook). Aintree had made significant modifications to its National Course in recent years, including improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of some fences, but another notable change was highlighted in this race – that the course has been widened to allow more fences to be bypassed if necessary. As the remaining contenders on the second circuit approached the 20th fence, arrowed signposts and marshals waving chequered flags signalled them to bypass on the outside as Ornais' body was covered by a tarpaulin on the landing side. Two jumps later and they were again diverted, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> the famous Becher's Brook, where veterinary staff attended to Dooneys Gate.
