2500|$|Although Soviet law, from 1925 {{on until}} {{the demise of the}} Soviet Union (and also beyond in the {{successor}} states of the USSR), has always maintained that copyrights existed on a work regardless of its purpose or its value, the exercise of copyright in the Soviet Union was subject to the rules of censorship and the literary controls, the press legislation, the laws on printing, publishing, and selling, and Party directives. In general, only authors of [...] "socially useful" [...] works could exploit their copyrights; on [...] "useless works" [...] such as Church hymns no economic rights could be enforced; and authors of undesirable works faced administrative, or social, or even penal sanctions. What was [...] "socially useful" [...] was defined in a number of Party decrees (from 1925 to 1963, there were thirty-three such decrees). Publishers, film studios, and so on, were expected to refuse to publish works that were considered non-compliant to the currently valid definitions of the goals of artistic activity as defined by these decrees. In this way, the nominally exclusive rights of authors to publication were restricted by the need to go <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>channels</b> and state-controlled publishing houses. As a way to bypass this governmental control for literary works samizdat developed: the non-commercial dissemination of a work in chain-letter fashion through carbon-copies produced by readers on their typewriters. Many samizdat works were considered to be [...] "anti-Soviet agitation" [...] by the authorities and the authors were prosecuted under article 58(10) (later articles 70 and 190(1)) of the RSFSR Criminal Code or corresponding provisions of the other republics' penal laws.|$|E
2500|$|Bekele's eight year [...]africa {{journey was}} not without a trial. She has fought many {{challenges}} by her opponents over the issues of accountability and transparency on the bid for [...]africa, including the African Union Commission(AUC). For instance, on April 24, 2014, during the International ICT Girls day, the AUC blocked Bekele from speaking at an ITU event that was held on the AUC premises in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, due to a dispute over the [...]africa. Bekele has been challenging the AUC, who allegedly disavowed the first endorsement they gave her organization DotConnectAfrica in 2009 to apply at ICANN for the [...]africa gTLD, to subsequently request for the same directly from ICANN, at the ICANN 42 International meeting held in Dakar Senegal from 23–28 October 2011. AUC requested from ICANN to include all similar name strings [...] ".africa", [...] ".afrique" [...] and [...] ".afriqia", {{in the list of}} [...] "reserved names", to afford special legislative protection to the AUC to own these strings so as to make it unavailable to anyone, through a method of bypassing the formal application process of the ICANN's new generic top level domains (gTLDs). [...] Bekele strongly opposed to the AUC's request to reserve the names saying the request was against the ICANN gTLD rule book, thus reserving the name will disqualify all competition to enable the AUC to separately negotiate the delegation of these name strings under a separate process outside the aegis of the official ICANN new gTLD programme. Bekele came victorious on this battle at ICANN Dakar, as it became known later that ICANN could not reserve the names for the AU, however ICANN did recommend to the AUC to use Government Advisory Committee to raise concerns that an applicant is seen as potentially sensitive or problematic, or to provide direct advice to the Board, so as to change the outcome of the gTLD. which AUC implemented the advice during the GAC objection period, to the detriment of DCA's application. [...] In addition, failing to secure the reserve names, the AUC then directly endorsed another firm from SouthAfrica to apply to ICANN, who was also supported by its own AU Dotafrica Task Force. [...] According to the public part of their application, the South African company submitted a [...] "non-community" [...] application to ICANN naming AUC as a “co-applicant” and giving the [...]africa registry and intellectual property rights to the AUC in a separate contract Bekele's organization then challenged the ICANN application process for the competition, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>channels</b> of ICANN, as well as challenged the AUC's RFP process that gave a direct endorsement for the SouthAfrican company by requesting full disclosure of the process with the AU leadership and ICANN Governmental Committee, in the interest of accountability and transparency to the global public at large ...|$|E

He did not introduce himself as such and indeed, you would never hear the kind of straight-talking that followed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>channels</b> of that organisation. What held the mostly respectful attention of Lindsay Bookie’s audience was that here was a black man, a man with strong traditional culture and standing, taking to his feet in a mostly white and potentially hostile forum, identifying himself with the town (“we”), recognising the gathering’s grievances and proposing some practical solutions… Read the full article Photo: Alice Springs News  ...|$|E
40|$|Kakšni so demokratični potenciali {{internet}}a? V teoretskem okviru "podrejenih javnih sfer" velja, da lahko internet opolnomoči podrejene družbene skupine in poveča inkluzivnost demokracije. "Rear Window to Movies" je spletna razpravljalska skupina na Kitajskem, ki zagotavlja varen diskurzivni prostor za podrejeno javnost, ki jo sestavljajo filmski navdušenci iz kitajskega nerazvitega srednjega sloja. Podrejena javnost uporablja internet za izmenjavo mnenj in kritično razpravlja o stvareh, ki jo zanimajo. Uspešno oblikuje svoj lastni diskurz, ki se razlikuje od tržnega in nevtralizira državnega. Poleg tega se vpliv te diskurzivne prakse na različne načine širi na "zunanji" svet, kar pa s seboj prinaša omejitve, ki bi lahko bile za podrejeno javno sfero tudi nevarne. What is {{the democratic}} potential of the Internet? Using subaltern public spheres as the theoretical framework, the Internet is expected to empower the subordinated social groups and extend the inclusiveness of democracy. RearWindow to Movies is a Chinese online discussion group, which focuses {{on the topic of}} movies. I used this case to answer my research question: How does the online discussion group function as a subaltern public sphere? My research found that the online discussion group supported the concept of subaltern public spheres instead of a unitary public sphere. The online subaltern public sphere provided a safe discursive space for the subaltern public, who was movie fans from the underdeveloped middle class in China. The subaltern public used online spheres to exchange their opinions and critically debated on issues that they were interested in. They successfully constructed their own discourse, which is different from the market discourse and counteracts the domination of the state discourse. In addition, the impactof these discursive practices was disseminated into the offline world by various methods. On the one hand, RearWindow users took use of social resources including those from the commercial forces to show movies that couldnot be reached <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>channels.</b> On the other hand, the interaction with mass media also helped making the subaltern discourses more and more audible. However, both methods have their own limitations, which might harm the subaltern public sphere as well...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} the European Union`s 2012 theme year: Active aging and {{solidarity}} between generations I wished to {{gain an understanding of}} weather elderly immigrant are provided with equal possibilities and access to local community information as the majority population and their participation in activities arranged for senior citizens in the municipality where they live. I have done this by meeting with those who work in this capacity. I also chose to meet with representatives for immigrant organizations in the local community to enquire of their work with senior citizens within their own ethnic group. This is a qualitative study on a phenomenological ground based on nine interviews and four observations. I have had two theories to help me analyze my empirical material. Globalization theory is a good groundwork to understanding the changes in modern multicultural societies where I have looked at the work of Anthony Giddens first at hand. The theory of KASAM by Aaron Antonowsky explains how the sense of coherence helps people to remain positive and satisfied in old age despite their failing health and unfavorable circumstances at times. I have found that the municipality where this study is preformed has a multicultural focus in their manor of spreading information. Yet many ethnic groups seek information verbally from friends and family rather than seek it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> <b>channels</b> which may be more common among the majority population and immigrants that have established themselves in the society. Still all those whom I interviewed agreed that spreading information through direct contact always is {{the most effective way to}} get information across to people. I found that the local community meeting places for senior citizens have no immigrants attending on a regular basis. I did meet a group of senior migrant citizens with their origin in various nationalities that gather under the supervision of a cooperation project that has integration and public health as its main goal. All the participants in their activities for senior citizens started coming through personal invitation from the project leader or other group participants. With regards to the theme year those working with senior citizens were aware of it but haven’t had any specific focus on it in their work except for a few that participate in a regional public health project. They all agree that a theme year for active ageing and solidarity is an important milestone to recognizing the needs for recreation and showing respect to those who are beyond the age for retirement...|$|E
