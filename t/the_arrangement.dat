40|$|In {{this article}} we give a {{computational}} study of combinatorics of <b>the</b> discriminantal <b>arrangements.</b> <b>The</b> discriminantal <b>arrangements</b> are parametrized by two positive integers n and k such that n>k. The intersection lattice of <b>the</b> discriminantal <b>arrangement</b> with <b>the</b> parameter (n,k) is isomorphic to the intersection lattice of <b>the</b> hyperplane <b>arrangement</b> generated by n generic points in the d-dimensional vector space where d=n-k- 1. The combinatorics of <b>the</b> discriminantal <b>arrangements</b> is very hard, except for the special cases of <b>the</b> Boolean <b>arrangements</b> (k= 0) and <b>the</b> braid <b>arrangements</b> (k= 1). We review some results on the intersection lattices of <b>the</b> <b>arrangements</b> generated by generic points {{and use them to}} obtain some computational results on the characteristic polynomials of <b>the</b> discriminantal <b>arrangements...</b>|$|R
500|$|Mike Salbato of RPGFan {{reviewed}} the album and described it in similar terms to From Astral, <b>the</b> first <b>arrangement</b> album for <b>the</b> game. He praised {{the high quality}} of <b>the</b> <b>arrangements</b> and performances, but found <b>the</b> piano <b>arrangements</b> more interesting for their originality than the rock arrangements; unlike for the From Astral rock <b>arrangements,</b> many of <b>the</b> Duality <b>arrangements</b> were of rock or rock-inspired tracks, which he felt left <b>the</b> <b>arrangements</b> feeling superfluous. He concluded, however, that <b>the</b> piano <b>arrangements</b> and Oblivion cover made the album an [...] "easy recommendation".|$|R

5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E
