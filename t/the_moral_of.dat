25|$|The {{struggle}} with the world is framed {{by the idea that}} series of personal and social transformations can increase our share of attributes associated with the divine and give us a larger life. It emphasizes love over altruism, rejecting <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> the mastery of self-interest to enhance solidarity, and emphasizing the humility of individual love. This orientation has been articulated in two different voices: the sacred voice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the profane voice of the secular projects of liberation.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle of}} Hatvan {{was not a}} very {{important}} victory, but its influence on <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> the Hungarian troops was remarkable. The most important result of the battle was that Gáspár succeeded to make Schlik to think that he faced the whole Hungarian army, and not just its VIIth corps. Windisch-Grätz continued to be unsure about the plans and displacement of the Hungarian main army, and because of this he remained mostly incapable of stopping them to advance from two sides, towards his headquarters at Gödöllő. After the victory of Hatvan, the other, more numerous Hungarian army, consisting of three corps, won at Tápióbicske another victory, than neared to Isaszeg, where, on 6 April, the decisive battle of {{the first phase of the}} Spring Campaign took place.|$|E

Operatives of the INA were also landed in the Indian coast by submarine for planned espionage operations within India. Coming {{at the time that the}} Quit India Movement had raised turmoil within British India, the threat of the INA affecting British Indian troops and INA operatives mounting espionage within India saw the start of a propaganda campaign in the British Indian Army and a news ban on the unit that was not to be lifted till after the war ended.|$|E

25|$|The {{parable of}} the blind men and an {{elephant}} originated in ancient Indian subcontinent, from where it has widely diffused. It {{is a story of}} a group of blind men, who have never come across an elephant before, learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels {{a different part of the}} elephant body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their partial experience and their descriptions are in complete disagreement on what an elephant is. In some versions they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. <b>The</b> <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> the parable is that humans have a tendency to project their partial experiences as the whole truth, ignore other people's partial experiences, and one should consider that one may be partially right and may have partial information.|$|E
25|$|During {{her first}} term, Benazir Bhutto had {{strained}} {{relationship with the}} Pakistan Armed Forces, especially with Pakistan Army. Army chief Mirza Aslam Beg had cold relations with the elected prime minister, and continued to undermine her authority. As for the military appointments, Benazir Bhutto refused to appoint General Beg as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, instead invited Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey to take {{the chairmanship of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff. In 1988, Benazir Bhutto appointed Air Chief Marshal Hakimullah as the Chief of Air Staff and Admiral Jastural Haq as the Chief of Naval Staff. In 1988, shortly after assuming the office, Benazir Bhutto paid a visit to Siachen region, to boost <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> the soldiers who fought the Siachen war with India. This was the first visit of any civilian leader to any military war-zone area since the country's independence in 1947. In 1988, Benazir appointed Major-General Pervez Musharraf as Director-General of the Army Directorate General for Military Operations (DGMO); and then-Brigadier-General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani as her Military-Secretary. In 1989, the Pakistan Army exposed the alleged Operation Midnight Jackal against the government of Benazir Bhutto. When she learned the news, Benazir Bhutto ordered the arrest and trial of former ISI officer Brigadier Imtiaz Ahmad and Major Amir Khan, it was later revealed that it was General Beg who was behind this plot. General Beg soon paid the price in 1993 elections, when Benazir Bhutto politically destroyed the former general and his career was over before taking any shifts in politics. During her first term, Benazir Bhutto had successfully removed senior military officers including Lieutenant-Generals Hamid Gul, Zahid Ali Akbar Khan, General Jamal A. Khan, and Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan, all of whom had anti-democratic views and were closely aligned to General Zia, replacing them with officers who were educated in Western military institutes and academies, generally the ones with more westernised democratic views.|$|E

500|$|The {{adaptation}} of the setting for Richard III to a 1930s fascist England in Ian McKellen's 1995 film, however, did {{not sit well with}} historians. Adams posits that the original Shakespearian setting for Richard's fate at Bosworth teaches <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> facing one's fate, no matter how unjust it is, [...] "nobly and with dignity". [...] By overshadowing the dramatic teaching with special effects, McKellen's film reduces its version of the battle to a pyrotechnic spectacle about the death of a one-dimensional villain. [...] Coursen agrees that, in this version, the battle and Richard's end are trite and underwhelming.|$|E

500|$|A {{probable}} {{source of}} the tale is Petrus Alfonsi's Disciplina clericalis, which has the same three motifs: the rash promise of the husbandman; the wolf mistaking the moon for cheese; and the wolf that descends into the well via a bucket, thereby trapping himself and freeing the fox. However, the discussion of legality and the questioning of language that take place alongside these motifs are entirely Henryson's invention. Whereas <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> Alfonsi's tale explains that the wolf lost both the oxen and the cheese because he [...] "relinquished what was present for what was to come" [...] (Latin: pro futuro quod presens erat dimisit), Henryson's moralitas more fully involves the husbandman.|$|E
500|$|Food critic Katharine Shilcutt of the Houston Press {{criticized the}} episode for giving {{what she thought}} was an {{inaccurate}} depiction of foodies, as people that are [...] "tacky, snotty, slightly racist, hoarders of food experiences that you gather like rare gems and patronizingly hold over other people's heads." [...] Shilcutt added that she found it upsetting that what she believes to be <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> the episode is that [...] "Educated, passionate people are elitists. It reduces all the hard work that people put into creating good, honest food into a joke, and not a terribly funny one.

500|$|Andrew Tran of {{the website}} Overmental, {{on the other}} hand, reacted more {{positively}} to the episode. He felt that both King Huge and Seven were representative of a stagnation in mindset; according to him, they are both stuck in their ways and unwilling to change. However, {{he notes that the}} two also differ substantially. Tran argues that King Huge has legions of slaves feeding him the richest of foods. He is comfortable, but unaccustomed to dealing with outsiders, which expresses itself as xenophobia. Seven, on the other hand, lives in abject poverty, and is much more welcoming of strangers. In the end, Seven escapes the episode unscathed, and according to Tran, <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> the episode is that [...] "the bright side of a crap situation is that [...] pushes rather than restricts, enriches rather than fattens." ...|$|E
