2500|$|... the octave B flat to B flat in Bing's {{voice at}} that time [...] is, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears,</b> one of the loveliest I have heard in forty-five years of {{listening}} to baritones, both classical and popular, it dropped conspicuously in later years. From the mid-1950s, Bing was more comfortable in a bass range while maintaining a baritone quality, with the best octave being G to G, or even F to F. In a recording he made of 'Dardanella' with Louis Armstrong in 1960, he attacks lightly and easily on a low E flat. This is lower than most opera basses care to venture, {{and they tend to}} sound as if they were in the cellar when they get there.|$|E
2500|$|In 1846 Konstantin's sister, Grand Duchess Olga, married Crown Prince Charles of Württemberg. He {{went with}} her to Stuttgart then he {{continued}} to Altenburg to be introduced to Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg. His parents had arranged the meeting thinking that Alexandra might make a good match for Konstantin. Alexandra was strikingly beautiful, tall and slim and Konstantin was immediately eager to marry her. [...] "I don't know {{what is happening to}} me. It is as if I am a completely new person. Just one thought moves me, just one image fills my eyes: forever and only she, my angel, my universe. I really do think I’m in love. However, what can it mean? I've only known her a few hours and I'm already up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> in Passion".|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, guest star Dylan McDermott spoke {{about being in}} the second season of American Horror Story, [...] "I loved doing the show. It's like being home for me. We talked about it I think early in the season. He [...] called me over the summer and {{we were trying to}} figure out what was the best plan and in what capacity. I wasn't sure myself and obviously he's the master and the genius that figures this shit out. So the day the show premiered he called me and he explained it to me because I hadn't read any of the scripts. He explained to me what my character was going to be and I was like, 'Are you fucking kidding me? I love this! I love this! It's beyond!' To play the modern day Bloody Face and to have this whole back story of a guy who's thrown away and aborted and still lived! It was just like, are you kidding me? It was music <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears,</b> maybe nobody else's. But to me? I couldn't believe it. It's so twisted and dark and fucked up. That's why I'm on the show because I love stuff like that." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the sound}} of a whisper on <b>my</b> pillow, close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b> <b>My</b> strange {{insensibility}} <b>to</b> fear remained undisturbed. The whisper was welcome, it kept me company in the dark room.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are in luck.--Your only blunder was {{confined}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> when you imagined a certain {{friend of ours}} {{in love with the}} lady." ...|$|R
60|$|God said, I {{am tired}} of kings, I suffer them no more; Up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> the morning brings The outrage of the poor.|$|R
60|$|SIR,--It {{has come}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> {{that you have}} lent the {{authority}} of your columns to an error.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen of Rock River, when, in {{the course}} of human events, rumor had blow'd <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> the history of the checker-playing of Rock River, and when I had waxed Cerro Gordo, and Claiborne, and Mower, then, when I say <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> was borne the clash of resounding arms in Rock River, the emporium of Rock County, then did I yearn for more worlds to conquer, and behold, I buckled on my armor and I am here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, {{there have}} come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> several {{incidents}} which {{are hard to}} reconcile with the settled order of Nature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you've {{done this}} sort of thing before," [...] she reproached, calling loudly, so that I might hear, her lips close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} there came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> the loud sound of voices, human voices, strident and eager, with {{nothing of the}} animal growl in them.|$|R
60|$|There was one dreadful {{moment of}} silence. He still held his arms round my neck, {{and on a}} sudden he put his lips close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not yourself! Really, I am {{a simple}} personage. I believe {{in my eyes}} and trust <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears.</b> I am {{at a loss for}} your meaning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Etienne!" [...] It was a woman's voice which spoke--a voice {{which was}} always music <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears.</b> I sprang {{through the gap}} and I flung my arms round her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can believe}} {{anything}} {{in favor of}} Ursula Malbone, my dear Chainbearer; and no music could be sweeter, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears,</b> than thus to hear you pronouncing her praise." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mary put her {{trembling}} lips <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> and whispered: [...] "Let me go, George! I can't bear to see it. Oh, {{look how}} he frowns! I know he'll hurt you." ...|$|R
6000|$|That is cool. A highwayman holds {{a pistol}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> and mutters through his teeth, [...] "Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, {{and then you}} will be a murderer!" ...|$|R
60|$|Holmes was for {{the moment}} as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Mistaken the words!" [...] {{cried the}} boy; [...] "why, I tell thee {{they were as}} plain <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> and my senses as what thou hast said this moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{repeat the}} question," [...] said the distant voice again, a cold deep voice {{with a note}} in it that <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> sounded like the knell of {{approaching}} doom.|$|E
60|$|The nasty {{laugh that}} came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> through the heavy {{planking}} {{of the door}} after the lock clicked was my first intimation that all was not as it should be.|$|E
60|$|Either, methinks, 'plays' {{should be}} 'play'd,' or 'and' {{should be changed}} to 'while.' I can {{certainly}} understand it as a parenthesis, an interadditive of scorn; {{but it does not}} sound <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> as in Shakspeare's manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "`Och! now or niver! Off wid ye!' yelled a {{splitting}} voice close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear!</b> I {{need not}} tell you whose voice that was, or that its owner was skipping about like a gorilla, almost as mad as the elephant!" ...|$|R
6000|$|It seems, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> {{that there}} is a sad want of harmony in Lord Byron's verses. Is it not unnatural to be always {{connecting}} very great intellectual power with utter depravity? Does such a combination often really exist in rerum naturae? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Armstrong," [...] said Frank, [...] "I {{have just}} heard the most horrid story that ever came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears.</b> That wretch, Barry Lynch, has tried to induce Doctor Colligan to poison his sister!" ...|$|E
60|$|Farnese {{dismissed}} {{the matter with}} a casual laugh. And then a lazy, drawling voice--a voice that once had been sweetest music <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears,</b> but now was loathsome as the croaking of Stygian frogs--addressed me.|$|E
60|$|He {{moved to}} {{a corner of the}} room behind him, and touched a knob in the wall which I had never before observed. A bell rang directly, which had a new tone in it <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
60|$|Spenser's Epithalamion {{is truly}} sublime; and pray mark the swan-like {{movement}} of his exquisite Prothalamion. [1] His attention to metre and rhythm is sometimes so extremely minute as to be painful even <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> {{and you know how}} highly I prize good versification.|$|R
6000|$|... "In short, my valued friend," [...] pursued Miss Flite, {{advancing}} {{her lips}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> {{with an air}} of equal patronage and mystery, [...] "I must tell you a secret. I have made him my executor. Nominated, constituted, and appointed him. In my will. Ye-es." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Persuade {{the little}} ones not to be afraid, not to cry, to be as still and silent as may be," [...] {{continued}} the voice, which I felt must be that of one of God's own angels, so exquisitely kind did it sound <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
60|$|A time {{of silence}} followed, though {{how long it}} might be I could not exactly tell. Then I heard Captain England speak, the words coming <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> as though from a great distance, because of my condition.|$|E
60|$|In {{my dreams}} that night I fancied that a strange cry came ringing <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> from the marshes--a long-drawn-out cry of terror, {{ending in a}} sob. I was weary, and I turned on my side again and slept.|$|E
60|$|The back {{windows of}} the houses {{commanding}} the scene are lined with enthusiastic spectators, {{and the sound of}} blows, and of oaths that make one's blood run cold, are borne <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears.</b> Happily, I cannot see the combatants.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He is a {{very useful}} servant of the Emperor, but--but--' he {{inclined}} his head downward <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> 'some more congenial service will be found for you, Monsieur de Laval,' and so, with a bow, he whisked round, and tapped {{his way across the}} tent again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Abel, can you understand--now--at last!" [...] And {{putting her}} lips close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> she began <b>to</b> murmur soft, melodious sounds {{that told me}} nothing. Then drawing back her head, she looked again at me, her eyes glistening with tears, her lips half parted with a smile, tender and wistful.|$|R
6000|$|I {{pretended to}} {{consider}} the matter deeply, she watching my anxious and labouring countenance with a devouring and delighted interest; and when, at last, I gave it up and begged her <b>to</b> appease <b>my</b> longing by telling me herself how much this polar Vanderbilt was worth, she put her mouth close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> and whispered, impressively: ...|$|R
