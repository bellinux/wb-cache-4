40|$|Historically, {{the study}} of tight immersions of {{manifolds}} had its origins in {{the study of}} <b>immersions</b> with minimal <b>total</b> absolute curvature. The most significant result {{in the study of}} minimal <b>total</b> absolute curvature <b>immersions</b> is the theorem of Chern and Lashof, which completely characterizes minimal <b>total</b> absolute curvature <b>immersions</b> (and tight immersions) of spheres into a Euclidean space.

In this sense, the theorem of Chern and Lashof characterizes tight immersions of the topologically simplest compact manifold. It is very natural to try and characterize tight immersions of other manifolds with topological restrictions. The most natural candidates are highly connected manifolds; i. e., 2 k-dimensional manifolds that are (k − 1) -connected, but not k-connected. In the years since the theorem of Chern and Lashof was proved, tight immersions of these manifolds have been studied extensively by Kuiper and others.

In individual interviews, the informants were encouraged to explore whether {{and to what extent}} they had perceived changes in themselves {{as a result of their}} participation in the immersion program.

Elements of such personal growth include perceived increases in participants' senses of resourcefulness, self-confidence, wanderlust, autonomy, open-mindedness, and sociability. Informants also enumerate the SLBP's unique factors which promote changes in self-perception. Changes in participants' perspectives on identity are not viewed simply as incidental immersion outcomes.
