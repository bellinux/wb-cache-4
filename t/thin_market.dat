The dominance in <b>thin</b> <b>markets</b> by some (short-memory) traders produces a better environment for learning profitable strategies with computational intelligence tools.

To model the turmoil in an economic system with recurrent shocks, short-memory horizons are optimal, as older data is not informative about current or future states.

30|$|The world rice {{market is}} seen as a <b>thin</b> <b>market</b> which is used to explain its {{volatile}} nature (Siamwalla and Haykin, 1983; Gibson, 1994; Wailes, 2002; Nielsen, 2003; Wailes, 2005; Headey, 2011; and Rapsomanikis, 2011). Two explanations are usually given for why it is a <b>thin</b> <b>market.</b> Firstly, it has been pointed out that the proportion of world rice production traded internationally represents just seven percent of the market (Wailes, 2005; Headey, 2011). In such an event, prices do not reflect the supply and demand conditions of the market (Tomek and Robinson, 1990), it increases search costs and can lead to excessive price volatility (Anderson et al. 2007). The second argument given is that international rice markets have a low level of substitution (Petzel and Monke, 1980; Siamwalla and Haykin, 1983, 1985; Cramer et al. 1993; Jayne, 1993; Chan, 1997, Wailes, 2005; Dawe, 2008) which fragments the world market into even smaller unrelated markets and makes it harder to discover price information (Jayne, 1993).|$|E

In the early 1990 s, nearly 90 % of hogs were purchased in the spot market through auctions, dealers or directly by packers. By early 2010, the percent of spot market hogs had fallen to 5 - 7 %. Approximately 25 % of hogs are owned and processed by packers in their own plants and 70 % of hogs are traded between seller and buyer through marketing contracts. The contracts vary in duration and specification but are similar in that the transaction price is derived by a formula based on another market, often the now very <b>thin</b> spot <b>market.</b> The motivations of sellers and buyers to abandon the spot market may still exist, but the <b>thin</b> spot <b>market</b> raises concerns. Prices in these <b>thin</b> <b>markets</b> potentially may become highly volatile, subject to manipulation, and less representative of competitive market equilibrium (Martinez, 1999).

30|$|The world rice {{market may}} be a <b>thin</b> <b>market</b> but the study’s results would {{suggest that it is}} not as {{fragmented}} as some of the literature proposes, at least when one considers indica rice markets which make up the bulk of world rice production and trade. This is especially the case for Asian rice export markets. An implication of this is that large Asian rice exporting nations have the ability to destabilize the international rice market. In one sense, the study’s results demonstrate that governments of major rice export markets do not generally distort their export prices to the extent that these prices remain isolated from other export rice prices. On the other hand, {{due to the fact that}} it is such as <b>thin</b> <b>market,</b> the price distortions of one major rice exporting country has the ability to destabilize the international rice market as a whole due to the existence of price transmission between these markets. The unprecedented rise in international rice prices across the world which peaked in 2008 is a striking example which has been argued that the actions of India banning non-basmati rice exports was one of the main causes which initiated the pricing frenzy (Headey, 2011).|$|E

The number of head of stocker weight cattle sold on the spot market has increased in recent years while the practice of cross-hedging stocker weight cattle against the feeder cattle contract remains risky. A model explains the spread between feeder cattle and stocker cattle futures prices as a function of feed prices, live cattle prices, and seasonal factors. The volatility of spot stocker cattle prices is comparable to spot feeder cattle prices, supporting the idea of using feeder cattle implied volatility measures as estimates of stocker cattle futures implied volatility in option pricing models.
