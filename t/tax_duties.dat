5000|$|...The {{first series}} of revenue stamps have two {{distinctive}} design types with each stamp designating the tax 'duty'. Designs for denominations 1-cent through 20-cents were simple, bearing {{a portrait of}} George Washington, while stamps with denominations 25-cents through 1-dollar are larger and have a more elaborate design and also designate the tax duty in a lower banner. Stamps with denominations of $1.30 were used to pay the tax duty for foreign exchange only, $1.50 for Inland exchange only while the stamps with denominations of $1.60 and $1.90 were for Foreign exchange only and oddly bear no duty designations in the stamp design. Denominations of 2-dollars through 10-dollars have <b>tax</b> <b>duties</b> designated in the lower circular banner surrounding Washington's portrait. Denominations of 15-dollars through 50-dollars have <b>tax</b> <b>duties</b> designated in {{the right side of}} the circular banner surrounding the portrait. The design used for the [...] denomination is unique and is not used for any other denomination. Various <b>tax</b> <b>duties</b> were only served by certain revenue stamps as some duties were only found on lower or higher denomination revenue stamps as the case may be. For example, revenue stamps with a designation for Playing cards occur only on denominations of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cents, while the 25-cent denomination revenue stamp is the only one whose designation specifies [...] A specialized stamp catalog is needed to see the different occurrences of tax-designation to denomination combinations.|$|E

50|$|The first revenue stamps in the United States {{were used}} briefly during colonial times, {{among the most}} notable usage {{involved}} the Stamp Act. Long after independence, the first revenue stamps printed by the United States government were issued {{in the midst of}} the American Civil War, prompted by the urgent need to raise revenue to pay for the great costs it incurred. After the war ended however, revenue stamps and the taxes they represented still continued. Revenue stamps served to pay <b>tax</b> <b>duties</b> on items that came under two main categories, Proprietary and Documentary. Proprietary stamps paid <b>tax</b> <b>duties</b> on goods like alcohol and tobacco, and were also used for various services, while Documentary stamps paid duties on legal documents, mortgage deeds, stocks and a fair number of other legal dealings. Proprietary and Documentary stamps often bore these respective designations, while in several of the issues they shared the same designs, sometimes with minor variations. Beginning in 1862 the first revenue stamps were issued, and would continue to be used for another hundred years and more. For the first twelve years George Washington was the only subject featured on U.S. revenue stamps, when in 1875 an allegorical figure of Liberty finally appeared. Revenue stamps were printed in many varieties and denominations and are widely sought after by collectors and historians. Revenue stamps were finally discontinued on December 31, 1967.|$|E

The CJEU has substantially mitigated the scope of this rule.

50|$|The Protestant Reformation was {{introduced}} in Lauenburg soon after 1519. The territory passed to King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland after the 1637 death of Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania. The Counter-Reformation was largely ineffective in the Lutheran town. Lauenburg was occupied by Swedes in the Northern Wars. To gain an ally against Sweden during The Deluge, King John II Casimir of Poland gave the Lauenburg and Bütow Land to Margrave Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia as a hereditary fiefdom in the 1657 Treaty of Bromberg. The Swedish troops burnt Lauenburg before their retreat in 1658, destroying seventy houses and the town hall. Frederick William released the town from <b>tax</b> <b>duties</b> for five years to aid in its rebuilding. Lauenburg suffered a second fire in 1682.|$|E

Eight times a year grain markets were organized, and the grain purchased in Nowy Korczyn was transported along the Vistula to Gdańsk. Korczyn {{had a number of}} granaries, in 1566 a new town hall was built, and in 1568 a canal was completed, which connected the man-made lake Czartoria with the Nida river.

50|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Abbasid Caliphate, Caliph al-Mansur (reigned 754-775) abolished the subsidies paid to the various Armenian princes (nakharar) and in addition imposed heavy <b>tax</b> <b>duties</b> on them. Coupled with instances of religious persecution against the majority Christian Armenian population, these measures prompted the outbreak of a major anti-Abbasid revolt in 774. The revolt was led by Artavazd Mamikonian, but gathered the direct or tacit support of most nakharar families, most notably the hitherto pro-Arab Bagratuni, while the Artsruni and Siwni families remained neutral. The rebellion spread through Armenia, including attacks against Arab tax-collectors, and the local Arab governor, al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba, was unable to contain it. The Caliph sent 30,000 Khurasanis under Amir ibn Isma'il into the province, and at the Battle of Bagrevand on 25 April 775, the nakharar suffered a decisive defeat, losing their leaders, Smbat VII Bagratuni and Mushegh VI Mamikonian. After the battle, the revolt was brutally suppressed by the Abbasids.|$|E

The main goal of this work is to define independent variables of revenues and to create models for prediction revenues. For achieving this goal, it is used theory of tax revenues and mathematical - statistical methods of regression analysis and method of comparison. At first set the variables that affect the amount of revenues, then create equation for estimating revenues and eventually these predictions are verified on real data. Independent variable affecting revenues are GDP, GDP growth and tax rate. The best model for prediction is model based on GDP growth and difference in tax rate. We use method of comparison for searching conclusions in differences between <b>tax</b> <b>duty</b> and <b>tax</b> revenues. <b>Tax</b> <b>duty</b> is always higher than tax revenues.

5000|$|Shurṭa (شرطة) is {{the common}} Arabic term for police, {{although}} its precise meaning {{is that of a}} [...] "picked" [...] or elite force. Bodies termed shurṭa were established {{in the early days of}} the Caliphate, perhaps as early as the caliphate of Uthman (644-656). In the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, the shurṭa had considerable power, and its head, the ṣāḥib al-shurṭa (صاحب الشرطة), was an important official, whether at the provincial level or in the central government. The duties of the shurṭa varied with time and place: it was primarily a police and internal security force and also had judicial functions, but it could also be entrusted with suppressing brigandage, enforcing the ḥisbah, customs and <b>tax</b> <b>duties,</b> rubbish collection, acting as a bodyguard for governors, etc. From the 10th century, the importance of the shurṭa declined, along with the power of the central government: the army—now dominated by foreign military castes (ghilmān or mamālīk)—assumed the internal security role, while the cities regained a measure of self-government and appropriated the more local tasks of the shurṭa such as that of the night watch.|$|E

In the same year Jews were granted the right to become permanent residents, and who could work, conduct commerce, and come and go from the city as they pleased. In 1666 the city's first town hall (or ‘ratusha’) was erected and built out of wood. Soon after the Turks conquered {{the fortress}} of Kamianets-Podilskyi in 1672, Stanisławow, together with Halych, became the strongholds against Turkish forces. It was attacked and besieged in early September 1676, but the Turks did not manage to capture and pillage the city. However, some of Stanisławow fortifications were so badly damaged that in 1677 the Sejm in Warsaw relieved the city of its <b>tax</b> <b>duties.</b> On September 12, 1683 the oldest son of the city founder - Stanisław perished in battle against the Turks near Vienna.
