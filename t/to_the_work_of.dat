5|$|Sicilian Baroque {{is today}} {{recognised}} as an architectural style, largely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Sacheverall Sitwell, whose Southern Baroque Art of 1924 {{was the first}} book to appreciate the style, followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt.|$|E
5|$|According to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an {{important}} influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> David Hilbert. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. This phase {{marks the beginning of}} her engagement with abstract algebra, the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{microscopy}} {{also had}} a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838 and 1839, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theory.|$|E

50|$|During the 19th century, {{the term}} 'rigorous' {{began to be}} used to {{describe}} decreasing levels of abstraction when dealing with calculus which eventually became known as analysis. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Cauchy added rigour <b>to</b> <b>the</b> older <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Euler and Gauss. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Riemann added rigour <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Cauchy. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Weierstrass added rigour <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Riemann, eventually culminating in the arithmetization of analysis. Starting in the 1870s, the term gradually came to be associated with Cantorian set theory.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with other}} {{mainline}} Protestant churches, the Presbyterian Church in the USA was {{a founding member}} of the Federal Council of Churches (a predecessor to the National Council of Churches) in 1908. During World War I, the PCUSA was a leading contributor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the Federal Council's General War–Time Commission, which coordinated chaplaincy and supported the war effort. From 1918 to 1920, the church participated in a short-lived international ecumenical organization called the Interchurch World Movement.|$|E
5|$|Art has {{sometimes}} stimulated {{the development of}} mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing, and ultimately to the mathematics of projective geometry of Girard Desargues and Jean-Victor Poncelet.|$|E
5|$|Born in New York City, {{he spent}} much of his early {{childhood}} in Bogotá, Colombia before moving back to the United States at the age of 12. In his youth, Williamson developed an interest in comic strips, particularly Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon. He took art classes at Burne Hogarth's Cartoonists and Illustrators School, there befriending future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel, who introduced him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> illustrators who had influenced adventure strips. Before long, he was working professionally in the comics industry. His most notable works include his science-fiction/heroic fantasy art for EC Comics in the 1950s, on titles including Weird Science and Weird Fantasy.|$|E

5|$|Building on {{his late}} 1950s {{drawings}} of comic strips characters, Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations {{of pop culture}} and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself.|$|E
5|$|Day was {{introduced}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Jean-Jacques Rousseau {{by his friend}} Richard Lovell Edgeworth; the pair shared a particular affinity for Rousseau's work on education in the book Emile, or On Education. On leaving Oxford, Edgeworth and Day attempted to teach Edgeworth's first son, Dick, {{in the style of}} Emile, a learning-by-doing approach. Accompanying Edgeworth to Ireland as Dick's tutor, Day fell in love and was spurned first by Edgeworth's sister, and then by at least three other women in quick succession.|$|E

5|$|It {{consists}} of {{the second and third}} parts to Monáe's Metropolis concept series. Incorporating conceptual elements of Afrofuturism and science fiction, The ArchAndroid continues the series' fictional tale of a messianic android and features lyrical themes of love, identity, and self-realization. The album has been compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> artists such as David Bowie, Outkast, Prince and Michael Jackson. The album features multiple collaborations with artists; Saul Williams, Big Boi, Of Montreal and Deep Cotton.|$|E
5|$|Like Bülow, Bache {{performed}} {{works from}} memory instead of from the printed page, {{at a time}} when doing so was a matter of open debate. Also like Bülow, he began giving recitals devoted entirely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> one composer. In 1879, he began giving all-Liszt recitals, and in 1883 he experimented with an all-Beethoven recital.|$|E
5|$|MercyMe {{wanted to}} get out of their comfort zone with the overall sound of the album, and brought in {{producer}} Dan Muckala. Millard has said that he initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music, meaning the band didn't think much about the overall length of the songs. MercyMe further developed the sound of the album by looking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> The Beatles for inspiration.|$|E

She performed a similar concert in London, which was taped and released on video, and also aired on U.S. Public Television stations in 1999.

Hate crimes continued in the city; in November 2010, a man perceived to be gay was severely beaten and left unconscious while walking home in southeast Portland. According to Portland Police, eight bias crimes were reported between January 1 and April 30, 2011, half the number reported during the same period in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Self-referencing is {{a feature}} {{specific}} to Kiarostami's cinema. Stephen Bransford contends that Kiarostami's films {{do not contain}} references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> other directors, but do include a myriad of references to his own work. Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic: one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 EP Instant 0 in the Universe was {{recorded}} in France, and was Stereolab's first release following Hansen's death. According to music journalist Jim DeRogatis, the EP marked a return to their earlier, harder sound—"free from the pseudo-funk moves and avant-garde tinkering that had been inspired by Chicago producer Jim O'Rourke". That year, Sadier's side-project, Monade, released its debut album Socialisme Ou Barbarie: The Bedroom Recordings.
