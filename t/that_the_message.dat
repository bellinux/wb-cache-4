5|$|Following this {{successful}} demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially {{as a spy}} of the Army of the Rhine. Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, {{he was concerned about}} his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.|$|E
5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} {{the analogy of}} a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children {{at the top of}} a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E
5|$|Yvonne Navarro co-wrote a novelization {{based on}} the {{original}} screenplay with Dennis Feldman. The book gives several in-depth details about the characters not seen in the film, such as Sil's ability to visualize odors and determine harmful substances from edible items by the color. Gas appears black, food appears pink, and an unhealthy potential mate appears to give off green fumes. Other character details include Preston's background in tracking down AWOL soldiers {{as well as the}} process of decoding the alien signal. Although no clues are given as to its origin, it is mentioned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> was somehow routed through several black holes to mask its point of origin.|$|E

5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{continues}} to struggle in deciphering an encrypted Starfleet {{message that they}} previously obtained through the Hirogen relay system (""). Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), who helped him obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help decrypt it. He is successful, and finds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> is from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though {{the rest of the}} crew is elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that the Borg have never been able to assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which will allow them to arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E
5|$|At 00:30 on 11 February the {{explosives}} were detonated {{and the western}} pier destroyed, causing the aqueduct to crumble and effectively break in half, and the Ginestra bridge was also successfully destroyed. Leaving one man who had broken his ankle when he had landed with a nearby farmer, {{the remainder of the}} Troop withdrew from the area at 01:00, splitting into three groups and heading towards the coast. The three groups moved as fast as possible towards the coast, but were all captured within a few hours of the aqueduct being demolished. The group commanded by Major Pritchard was spotted by a farmer who raised the alarm at a nearby village, leading to a local carabinieri unit surrounding the group; with little ammunition and heavily outnumbered, Pritchard decided to surrender. The other three groups, including the six sappers who had landed two miles from the objective, fared little better. The two groups from the aqueduct were soon located by Italian soldiers and ambushed, forcing them to surrender after brief firefights. The third group were found by a group of civilians as they moved towards the coast; after attempting to bluff their way past by claiming to be German soldiers on a special field exercise, which failed when the local Mayor demanded identity papers, they were captured by carabinieri. All were stripped of their weapons and equipment and transported to Naples, {{with the exception of the}} Italian translator, Picchi; he was handed over to the Blackshirts, a Fascist paramilitary group, who tortured and then executed him. Even if any of the groups had managed to make their way to the coast and the rendezvous point, they would not have been picked up by HMS Triumph. One of the two Whitleys conducting the diversionary raid at Foggia suffered engine trouble after bombing the railway yards. The pilot radioed Malta, informing his airfield that he was ditching in the mouth of the River Sele, coincidentally the area where the rendezvous was to occur. Fearing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> had been monitored by the Italians and that the submarine might sail into a trap, the decision was made by senior officers not to send it to the rendezvous point.|$|E

25|$|Underwater voice {{communication}} protocol is like radio communication protocol. The parties take turns to speak, use clear, short sentences, and indicate {{when they have}} finished, and whether a response is expected. Like radio, this is done to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> has a fair chance of being understood, and the speaker is not interrupted. When more than one recipient is possible, the caller will also identify the desired recipient by a call up message, and will also usually identify him/herself.|$|E
25|$|Debriefing {{is another}} useful strategy. Healthcare {{providers}} meet {{to discuss a}} situation, record what they learned and discuss {{how it might be}} better handled. Closed loop communication is another important technique used to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> that was sent is received and interpreted by the receiver. SBAR is a structured system designed to help team members communicate about the patient in the most convenient form possible. Communication between healthcare professionals not only helps achieve the best results for the patient but also prevents any unseen incidents.|$|E
25|$|Echomail did not {{necessarily}} use the same distribution pathways as normal netmail, and the distribution routing was stored in a separate setup file not unlike the original ROUTES.BBS. At the originating site a header line {{was added to the}} message indicating the origin system's name and address. After that, each system <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> traveled through added itself to a growing PATH header, as well as a SEENBY header. SEENBY prevented the message from looping around the network in the case of mis-configured routing information.|$|E
50|$|Mother Eugenia Ravasio's {{messages}} {{were approved by}} Bishop Alexander Caillot of Grenoble, who was mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>messages.</b> Bishop Caillot ordered an investigation, and after ten years issued a letter stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> had a divine nature. In 1988 <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> received <b>the</b> imprimatur of Cardinal Petrus Canisius Van Lierde, Vicar General for the Vatican City State, whose general duties were the administration of daily functions of Vatican City. <b>The</b> imprimatur signified <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> Cardinal's opinion <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> contain nothing against faith and morals, but not certifying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> were received from God the Father. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith at the Holy See, which is the official authority for approving private revelations {{on behalf of the}} Catholic Church has not approved Mother Ravasio's messages as authentic, nor issued an opinion on them.|$|R

The Challengers are then met by Nix Uotan, who explains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> came from The Source and sends them to Apokolips.|$|E
25|$|Tales of miraculous icons are not uncommon, {{though it}} has always been {{considered}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> of such an event was for the immediate faithful involved and therefore does not usually attract crowds. Some miraculous icons whose reputations span long periods of time nevertheless become objects of pilgrimage along with the places where they are kept. As several Orthodox theologians and saints have explored in the past, the icon's miraculous nature is found not in the material, but in the glory of the saint who is depicted. The icon is a window, in the words of Paul Florensky, that actually participates in the glory of what it represents.|$|E
25|$|Fleming is {{permitted}} to use the computer facilities at the London Institute of Electronics, where he is aided by Christine (Julie Christie). Using the computer to decode the message, Fleming realises <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> contains a set of instructions {{for the construction of}} another more advanced computer. The message also contains another programme for the computer to run, and data to process. Bridger meanwhile, has sold out to an international conglomerate called Intel, represented by the sinister Kaufmann (John Hollis). The British government decides to build the computer at a military establishment at Thorness in Scotland. The computer is switched on and begins to output its first set of instructions.|$|E
50|$|Some skeptics {{have noted}} how the revelations have changed {{with time and}} have alleged that this was in order to conform more with church doctrine.

25|$|According to Malhotra, Dharmic traditions rely on adhyatma-vidya, {{while the}} Abrahamic {{religions}} rely on God's interventions in human history. For followers of history-centric (Abrahamic) religions, truth-claims based on history are {{more significant than}} the scriptural message itself. History-centric dogma such as original sin and resurrection become critical beliefs and no compromise can be made on their acceptance. This explains the centrality of Nicene creed to all major Christian denominations. Followers of history-centric religions believe that the God revealed His message through a special prophet and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> is secured in scriptures. This special access to God is available only to these intermediaries or prophets and not to any other human beings.|$|E
25|$|The {{message is}} taken to the Samaritans, a people {{rejected}} by Jews, and to the Gentiles. Saul of Tarsus, one of the Jews who persecuted the Christians, is converted by a vision to become a follower of Christ (an event which Luke regards as so important that he relates it three times). Peter, directed {{by a series of}} visions, preaches to Cornelius the Centurion, a Gentile God-fearer, who becomes a follower of Christ. The Holy Spirit descends on Peter and Cornelius, thus confirming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> of eternal life in Christ is for all mankind. The Gentile church is established in Antioch (north-western Syria, the third-largest city of the empire), and here Christ's followers are first called Christians.|$|E
25|$|A codon {{is a set}} {{of three}} nucleotides, a triplet that code for a certain amino acid. The first codon {{establishes}} the reading frame, whereby a new codon begins. A protein′s amino acid backbone sequence is defined by contiguous triplets. Codons are key to translation of genetic information for the synthesis of proteins. The reading frame is set when translating the mRNA begins and is maintained as it reads one triplet to the next. The reading of the genetic code is subject to three rules the monitor codons in mRNA. First, codons are read in a 5' to 3' direction. Second, codons are nonoverlapping and the message has no gaps. The last rule, as stated above, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> is translated in a fixed reading frame.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{messenger}} {{could be seen}} and touched, some in Draves' church have expressed a belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> in <b>the</b> Word of the Lord are not revelations, since for a revelation (according to them), the author is unseen.|$|R
50|$|The term telegraphy, {{although}} {{best known}} {{in relation to}} the electric telegraph, relates to <b>the</b> sending of <b>messages</b> over long-distances.
