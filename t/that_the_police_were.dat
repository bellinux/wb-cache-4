Meanwhile, the Minister of Interior commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> already in the process of hiring 4,000 new officers (about 10% of its total manpower), thus reversing cuts enacted by previous governments. Experts further pointed out the necessity to provide more CQB training to policemen in small municipalities and at rural areas. This type of training had until that point been largely aimed and directed at police officers in large towns.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 2013, Wizkid and his {{management}} were questioned by {{men from the}} Nigeria Police Force. Duping charges were leveled against them {{by a group of}} UNILAG students. The students claimed that Wizkid agreed to perform at the UNILAG Sports Centre on 21 May 2013 for a total sum of ₦500,000. They also claimed that he didn't show up for the show and didn't return their money. After conducting a thorough investigation, Police determined that Unilag students were bamboozled by con artists pretending to be affiliates of E.M.E. In the aforementioned interview with Showtime Celebrity, Wizkid commented on the events that transpired after the accusations. He told the media <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> investigating the case. The masterminds behind the impersonation were later detained by law enforcement agents in Lagos. In addition to duping Unilag students, the culprits set up fake email and social media accounts. Wizkid also elaborated on how one can go about booking him.|$|E
5|$|The September 2008 attacks had {{political}} significance, {{given that}} the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Karnataka state government, led by B. S. Yeddyurappa, were also accused of involvement and backing the anti-Christian campaigns and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> reported to have had knowledge of the imminent attacks but failed to prevent them. The police were criticised for their reaction to the protests and a report by a committee of human rights activists {{set up in the}} aftermath to examine the causes of the attacks claimed that they had used the event as a pretext to assault the community, rather than defend it. Justice B. K. Somasekhara of Karnataka, however, concluded that the police and government helped maintain order and were not responsible for the attacks. In response to the alleged forcible conversions of involvement, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) gave a three-month deadline for New Life Fellowship Trust (NLFT) to stop all conversion activities in Mangalore. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Mangalore declared that it would distance itself from the New Life Fellowship Trust.|$|E

25|$|Following the riots, a {{high degree}} of tension between Jewish and Arab {{citizens}} and distrust between the Arab citizens and police were widespread. An investigation committee, headed by Supreme Court Justice Theodor Or, reviewed the violent riots and found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> poorly prepared to handle such riots and charged major officers with bad conduct. The Or Commission reprimanded Prime Minister Ehud Barak and recommended Shlomo Ben-Ami, then the Internal Security Minister, not serve again as Minister of Public Security. The committee also blamed Arab leaders and Knesset members for contributing to inflaming the atmosphere and making the violence more severe.|$|E
25|$|Upon his arrest, Chikatilo gave a {{statement}} claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> mistaken, and {{complained that he}} had also been arrested in 1984 for the same series of murders. A strip-search of the suspect revealed a further piece of evidence: one of Chikatilo's fingers had a flesh wound. Medical examiners concluded the wound was from a human bite. Chikatilo's penultimate victim, Viktor Tishchenko, was a physically strong youth. At the crime scene, the police had found numerous signs of a ferocious physical struggle between the victim and his murderer. Although a finger bone was later found to be broken, and his fingernail had been bitten off, Chikatilo had never sought medical treatment for his injuries.|$|E

25|$|State media {{reported}} on 31 May that two ZANU-PF supporters {{had been killed}} by assailants believed to be MDC supporters.

He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> obstructing the MDC on instructions from ZANU-PF. Eric Matinenga, the newly elected MDC MP for Buhera West, was arrested on 31 May for allegedly paying MDC supporters to attack war veterans; the MDC said that his arrest occurred when he went to visit MDC supporters who had already been arrested.|$|E

The union did not make any overt efforts to stop those few trucks accompanied by convoys of forty police cars apiece that tried to deliver goods, but sent so many cars with pickets to accompany those convoys <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> never able to shepherd more than a few delivery trucks on any given day.|$|E
25|$|People {{started to}} feel <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> taking sides with the city council and Faderhuset. Tensions boiled over when a {{demonstration}} on 24 September was attacked by the police. The reason for the police attack apparently was a bottle being thrown at a police van. The police responded with a full frontal baton-charge on the demonstration. This led to several hours of street fighting between police and demonstrators. During the street fighting, three hundred people were arrested, many of which had not {{been involved with the}} fighting. A lot of these later claimed to have been brutally treated while in police custody. This sparked anger amongst the supporters of Ungdomshuset and many stated that violent resistance was now not only necessary and justified but the only right course of action that they could choose.|$|E

They had brought the man to Black Self-Help Moving's warehouse, gagged and tied him up, and while he was still conscious, took turns hacking away his limbs. Harris told the detectives that they had dumped the body into the bay. He told his story in such detail <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> convinced of its veracity, especially since the police had, on the previous December 24, recovered the bound and badly butchered torso of a male, missing its hands, feet and head, that had washed up in the city's Ocean Beach district at the foot of Pacheco Street. Harris provided the police with names, dates, addresses and details — enough information to issue arrest warrants against the suspects. Harris subsequently sought, and received, immunity for his help in breaking the Zebra case, as well as new identities for himself, his girlfriend, and her child.|$|E
25|$|When Gandhi was in prison, Patel {{was asked}} by Members of Congress to lead the satyagraha in Nagpur in 1923 against a law banning the raising of the Indian flag. He {{organised}} thousands of volunteers {{from all over the}} country to take part in processions of people hoisting the flag. Patel negotiated a settlement obtaining the release of all prisoners and allowing nationalists to hoist the flag in public. Later that year, Patel and his allies uncovered evidence suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> in league with local dacoits in the Borsad taluka even as the government prepared to levy a major tax for fighting dacoits in the area. More than 6,000 villagers assembled to hear Patel speak in support of proposed agitation against the tax, which was deemed immoral and unnecessary. He organised hundreds of Congressmen, sent instructions, and received information from across the district. Every village in the taluka resisted payment of the tax, and through cohesion, also prevented the seizure of property and land. After a protracted struggle, the government withdrew the tax. Historians believe that one of Patel's key achievements was the building of cohesion and trust amongst the different castes and communities, which had been divided along socio-economic lines.|$|E
