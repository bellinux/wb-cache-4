The Documentaly sessions led Yamaguchi to decide to live as a musician for a full-time career.|$|E

40|$|I {{tested the}} effects of <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> {{emersion}} protocol on rate of learning across academic instruction {{and the emergence of}} Naming. In two experiments, using a delayed multiple probe design, I first tested {{the effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> protocol and then tested for the emergence of <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> and speaker components for Naming. In Experiment I, the participants were three preschoolers with developmental delays who had a limited repertoire of listener skills and had difficulty meeting their instructional objectives. None of them emitted a selection or listener response following mastery of match-to-sample responses for visual stimuli while hearing the word for the stimuli they matched during <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> half of Naming probes. Prior to the onset of <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> emersion training, participants' academic curricula were suspended and they were immersed in learning instructional sets of <b>listener</b> responses. <b>The</b> instructional procedure required the participants to respond only to the auditory properties (speech sound combination) of speech presented to them face-to-face, as well as to voices recorded on tape. This was done until the participants acquired both accuracy and rate of responding criteria for all the sets of <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> emersion protocol. Results from this experiment showed that mastery of <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> emersion protocol accelerated participants' rate of learning (decreased their learn units-to-criteria) to meet instructional objectives. <b>The</b> <b>listener</b> half of Naming emerged for two out of the three participants. In Experiment II, <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> emersion protocol was used to test for the emergence of the speaker and <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> component of Naming for four preschoolers who had more vocal verbal behavior and faster rates of learning than the first group of participants.

40|$|Stereo {{reproduction}} of spatial audio allows {{the creation of}} stable acoustic images when <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> {{is placed in the}} sweet spot, a small region {{in the vicinity of the}} axis of symmetry between both loudspeakers.

In order to overcome such limitation, a stereo reproduction technique that adapts the sweet spot to <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> position is presented here. This strategy introduces a new approach that maximizes listener immersion by rendering object-based audio, in which several audio objects or sources are placed at virtual locations between the stereo span. By using a video tracking device, <b>the</b> <b>listener</b> is allowed to move freely between the loudspeaker span, while loudspeaker outputs are compensated using conventional panning algorithms so that the position of the different audio objects is kept independent from that of <b>the</b> <b>listener...</b>|$|R
