5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (about {{the size of}} a half dollar) being issued by <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> was {{becoming}} both unpopular in commerce and expensive to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new piece in February 1857.|$|E
5|$|Mary Margaret O'Reilly (October 14, 1865– December 6, 1949) was an American {{civil servant}} {{who worked as}} the Assistant Director of the United States Bureau of <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> from 1924 until 1938. One of the United States' highest-ranking female civil {{servants}} of her time, she worked at <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> for 34 years, during which she often served as acting director during <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> Director's absence.|$|E
5|$|Knox, in his 1866 report, had {{recommended}} a thorough {{revision of the}} laws pertaining to <b>the</b> <b>Mint,</b> and in January 1870, Secretary Boutwell instructed him to prepare a draft. In this, Knox had the assistance of former Mint Director Henry Linderman, who then held a roving commission for the Treasury Department; Linderman would in 1873 become the first director of the Bureau of <b>the</b> <b>Mint.</b>|$|E

5|$|Once Beach {{accepted}} the commission on March 12, 1928, Juliette Fraser's sketches were forwarded to him. On April 7, he sent completed models to <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> and photographs to the Fine Arts Commission. Both <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> and Houston responded with criticism, the former that {{the relief of}} the coin was high and difficult to reduce to coin-sized hubs. On April 19, Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock wrote in a memorandum that the coin {{would be very hard}} to produce because the area of greatest relief on each side was in the same part of the design. Beach agreed to lower any high points that might cause <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Silver half dimes {{had been}} struck {{from the early days}} of the United States Mint in the late 18th century. Those {{disappeared}} from circulation, along with most other coins, in the economic turmoil of the Civil War. In 1864, <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> successfully introduced low-denomination coins, whose intrinsic worth did not approach their face value. Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel—a metal in which he had significant financial interests. When <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> proposed a copper-nickel five-cent piece, Congress required that the coin be heavier than <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> had suggested, allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government.|$|E

50|$|Collectors and {{organizations}} dedicated to collecting coins regard mint striking errors {{as those that}} have been created by <b>the</b> <b>minting</b> process. Mint striking errors are caused by the collar moving, cracking, or not being present in <b>the</b> <b>minting</b> process. <b>The</b> collar is a third die that actually holds the coin in place in <b>the</b> <b>minting</b> process. It is the collar that imprints the lettering on a coin, such as the lettering on the Presidential dollars.|$|R
50|$|The {{letters were}} {{assigned}} to <b>the</b> <b>mints</b> as they opened. <b>The</b> <b>mints</b> in Hannover/Vienna (B), Frankfurt am Main (C), Dresden/Muldenhütte (E), and Darmstadt (H) have since been closed; the last, Muldenhütte, in 1953.|$|R
5000|$|Today four <b>mints</b> {{operate in}} <b>the</b> United States {{producing}} billions of coins each year. <b>The</b> main <b>mint</b> is <b>the</b> Philadelphia <b>Mint,</b> which produces circulating coinage, mint sets and some commemorative coins. <b>The</b> Denver <b>Mint</b> also produces circulating coinage, mint sets and commemoratives. <b>The</b> San Francisco <b>Mint</b> produces regular and silver proof coinage, and produced circulating coinage until the 1970s. <b>The</b> West Point <b>Mint</b> produces bullion coinage (including proofs). Philadelphia and Denver produce the dies used {{at all of}} <b>the</b> <b>mints.</b> <b>The</b> proof and <b>mint</b> sets are manufactured each year and contain examples {{of all of the}} year's circulating coins.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mint</b> {{released}} a centennial version, in gold, of the Mercury dime on April 21, 2016, sold through the Mint's official website. Demand was so high, that orders {{were no longer}} able to be placed within 45 minutes of the coin becoming available. On April 26, <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> reported that it had sold 122,510 units, just 2,490 pieces away from the item's maximum allowable mintage. The remainder, which included about as many as 8,000 to 9,000 coins that were unsold or returned to <b>the</b> <b>mint</b> from prior sales, were offered for sale on December 15, 2016, with a limit of one per customer, and sold out within 90 minutes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mint</b> struck pattern {{pieces of}} the smaller size, with various shapes and compositions. An 11-sided coin was considered, which would have {{differentiated}} it from the quarter, but the patterns would not work in vending machines. Such exotic metals as titanium were considered before <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> decided on the standard clad composition. Gasparro prepared, for the circulating pieces, a design showing Liberty with flowing hair, similar to early American coins.|$|E
5|$|The eagle was {{the largest}} {{denomination}} authorized by <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> Act of 1792, which established the Bureau of <b>the</b> <b>Mint.</b> It was not struck until 1795, as <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> at first struck copper and silver coins. The number of stars on the obverse was initially intended to be equal {{to the number of}} states in the Union, but with the number at 16, that idea was abandoned in favor of using 13 stars in honor of the original states. The initial reverse, featuring an eagle with a wreath in its mouth, proved unpopular and was replaced by a heraldic eagle.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> new <b>mint</b> and <b>the</b> Melbourne <b>Mint</b> {{operated}} concurrently while sufficient {{stockpiles of}} new coinage were prepared and {{until it was}} felt that production in Canberra was proceeding smoothly, after which in 1967 <b>the</b> Melbourne <b>mint</b> was closed. Some staff from <b>the</b> Melbourne <b>mint</b> relocated to Canberra to operate <b>the</b> new <b>mint.</b> However {{it was not until the}} early 1980s that the RAM was able to sustain solitary production of the full set of circulating Australian coins, and so on several occasions in the 1960s and 1970s the RAM contracted production runs to <b>the</b> Perth <b>Mint,</b> <b>the</b> Royal <b>Mint</b> in both London and Llantrisant, and even on one occasion <b>the</b> Royal Canadian <b>Mint.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>mints</b> {{were under}} <b>the</b> {{authority}} of the Chambre des Comptes of Navarre, <b>the</b> most senior <b>mint</b> official, <b>the</b> Général des Monnaies, was {{an officer of the}} Chambre des Comptes of Navarre. Each of <b>the</b> three <b>mints</b> had their own separate and distinct personnel. <b>The</b> <b>mints</b> officers included a Garde de la Monnaie, a Contre-Garde de la Monnaie, a Prosecutor (French: procureur), a Registrar (French: greffier), and later a Huissier.|$|R

5|$|Both {{varieties}} {{were sold}} by the centennial commission for $1, and primarily went to citizens of Alabama; banks throughout the state vended them. When {{they could not be}} sold, 5,000 of the plain variety were returned to <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> and melted.|$|E
5|$|Details of the {{preparation}} of the commemorative dollar are lost; <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> destroyed many records in the 1960s. Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber was responsible for the designs.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> {{tried to}} {{alleviate}} the breakage problem using {{a new version of}} the cent with a shallower relief. This attempt led to the major variety of the series, as coins of the revised version have smaller letters in the inscriptions than those struck earlier. The two varieties are about equally common, and were probably struck side by side for some period as <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> used up older dies. Efforts to conserve dies were the probable cause of another variety, the 1858/7, as 1857-dated dies were overstruck to allow them to be used in the new year.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Dahlonega <b>Mint</b> was {{a former}} branch of <b>the</b> United States <b>Mint</b> built during <b>the</b> Georgia Gold Rush to help the miners get their gold assayed and minted, without having to travel to <b>the</b> Philadelphia <b>Mint.</b> It was located at (34°31.8′N 83°59.2′W [...] ) in Dahlonega, Lumpkin County, Georgia. Coins {{produced}} at <b>the</b> Dahlonega <b>Mint</b> bear <b>the</b> [...] "D" [...] mint mark. That mint mark is used today by <b>the</b> Denver <b>Mint,</b> which opened many years after <b>the</b> Dahlonega <b>Mint</b> closed. All coins from <b>the</b> Dahlonega <b>Mint</b> are gold, in the $1, $2.50, $3, and $5 denominations, and bear dates in the range 1838-1861.|$|R

5|$|On January 29, 1971, <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> {{announced}} the {{prices for the}} 40% silver pieces which would be struck at San Francisco: $3 for uncirculated specimens and $10 for mirror-surfaced proof pieces, with orders to be taken by mail beginning on July 1, with a limit of five of each per customer. Order forms for the public were shipped to 44,000 post offices and 33,000 banks, with instructions not to hand them out until June 18. <b>The</b> <b>Mint</b> returned some orders for being sent in too early. Mint sets of the circulating coinage for 1971 {{did not include the}} Eisenhower dollar.|$|E
5|$|Talented but temperamental, Pistrucci {{refused to}} copy the work of other artists. When in 1823 George IV demanded that an unflattering {{portrait}} of him on the coinage be changed with a new likeness {{to be based on}} the work of Francis Chantrey, Pistrucci refused and was nearly sacked. <b>The</b> <b>Mint</b> did not dismiss him, lest the money already spent on the Waterloo Medal be wasted. Pistrucci kept his place with <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> for the rest of his life, eventually completing the Waterloo Medal in 1849, though because of its great size it could not be struck. After Pistrucci's death, the George and Dragon design was restored to the sovereign coin, and is still used today.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Head cent, {{also known}} as an Indian Head penny, was a one-cent coin ($0.01) {{produced}} by the United States Bureau of <b>the</b> <b>Mint</b> from 1859 to 1909. It was designed by James Barton Longacre, the Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint.|$|E
