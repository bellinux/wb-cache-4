5|$|The cavalry charge gave Ney {{enough time}} to place Desperrières' brigade in line of battle to meet the first shock. Ney's {{division}} included 8,200 infantry, 1,100 cavalry, and 14 cannons, {{but one of his}} three brigades was detached to the south at Wasserburg am Inn. Desperrières conducted an able defense, counterattacking when the 13th Dragoons rode to his support. Meanwhile, Ney directed the fighting on a second brigade front. At noon, a horse artillery battery led by Jean Baptiste Eblé arrived and its accurate fire quickly dismounted four Austrian guns and destroyed three caissons. Later, two pieces were overrun by Austrian hussars, but the French gunners rallied and recaptured <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> a horseback charge.|$|E
5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> <b>In</b> bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E

5|$|With {{the fair}} closed, the {{question}} remained {{what to do}} with the some 4,600,000 half dollars which had not been sold. Organizers did not wish them to be issued, to preserve the premium price paid by purchasers. Those remaining in the Company's hands were redeemed by the Mint, which melted them; the fee for this service was forgiven by act of Congress. The coins which had been impounded by the Treasury were offered for sale at face value beginning in October 1894; when there were few takers, they were released into circulation. A million coins held by the Chicago banks were also placed in circulation. Although 2,501,700 half dollars were melted (all dated 1893), this still left a like number of Columbians in public hands. Coin dealer and numismatic historian Q. David Bowers recalls that when he began collecting coins as a boy in the 1950s, the Columbians were among the most common 19th-century pieces remaining in circulation. It was not until the 1930s that <b>the</b> <b>pieces,</b> <b>in</b> uncirculated condition, commanded the original price of $1. Prices began to rise as silver coins were replaced by base metal ones in the 1960s. In the 2012 version of Yeoman's catalog, both pieces are listed at under $20 in almost uncirculated (AU-50) condition, with specimens in near-pristine MS-66 selling for over a thousand dollars.|$|E

25|$|It is {{customary}} {{to eat the}} challah or {{bread with}} salt, although the specific practice varies. Some dip the bread into salt before the blessing on bread.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> a geomagic square {{may also}} be disjoint, or {{composed}} of separated islands, as seen in Figure 3.

25|$|Priuli's {{instrumental}} music, such as <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the two collections entitled Sacrorum concentuum, 1618 and 1619, {{is akin to}} {{the music}} of Gabrieli. The number of parts ranges from five to twelve; some of the pieces use echo effects reminiscent of the repertory of the composers working in St. Mark's, where that style first developed. All of these works were intended for use in church.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects that may seem counterintuitive. One example is the Banach–Tarski paradox which {{says that it is}} possible to decompose the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are non-measurable sets.|$|E

50|$|Stripping: Avoid {{stripping}} antiques {{at almost}} any cost, stripping in its true sense involves dipping <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> a chemical bath that will remove finish, patina, {{and in some cases}} the glue holding <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> together. A stripped antique is truly stripped, mainly of its value. Veneering may peel, joints will swell or break apart, and <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> usually has to be completely rebuilt. This applies in cases where someone has foolishly stripped <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past and applied inappropriate finishes that must be removed.|$|R

25|$|The {{most notorious}} {{criminal}} {{of the period}} (aside from the Nazis and their collaborators) was Doctor Marcel Petiot. Petiot purchased a house at 21 rue Le Sueur in the 16th arrondissement, and {{under the name of}} Docteur Eugène, pretended to be the head of a Resistance network that smuggled Jews from France to Argentina. He collected a large advance from his clients and then instructed them to come to his house, bringing their gold, silver and other valuables with them. After they arrived, he brought them to his consulting room, and, convincing them vaccination was required in order to enter Argentina, gave them a lethal intravenous injection, then watched their slow death in an adjacent room through a spyhole in the door. Afterwards, he cut up their bodies, put <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the well, and dissolved them with quicklime. His activities attracted the attention of the Gestapo, which arrested him in 1943, thus allowing him to claim later that he had been a real member of the Resistance. His crimes were discovered after the Liberation in 1944, and he was charged with the murders of twenty-seven persons, tried in 1946, and sentenced to death. He went to the guillotine on May 25, 1946. The gold, silver and other valuables were not found when he was arrested. In search of the treasure, the house was carefully demolished in 1966, but no trace of it was ever found.|$|E
