5|$|The Interstate Highways and U.S. Routes in Delaware are {{numbered}} {{according to a}} national numbering pattern. Interstate Highways <b>that</b> <b>run</b> north–south have odd numbers, increasing from west to east, while those <b>that</b> <b>run</b> east–west have even numbers, increasing from south to north. Major north–south Interstates have numbers ending in 5 while major east–west Interstates have numbers ending in 0. Three-digit Interstates begin with odd numbers if they are a spur and an even number if they are a bypass or beltway and repeat numbers in different states. As such, the major north–south Interstate along the East Coast, Interstate 95 (I-95), passes through northern New Castle County. I-495 bypasses the section of I-95 {{that runs through the}} city of Wilmington.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} buses ran on diesel fuel, but {{the system}} allows for buses <b>that</b> <b>run</b> on alternative energy sources. Biodiesel fuel and natural gas have been trialled, and 20% of the Adelaide bus fleet uses compressed natural gas, 48% B20 and 32% B5 biodiesel blends. The design of the O-Bahn allows for the installation of overhead wires for trolleybuses.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Routes <b>that</b> <b>run</b> north–south have odd numbers, {{increasing}} {{from east}} to west, while those <b>that</b> <b>run</b> east–west have even numbers, increasing from north to south. Major north–south U.S. Routes have numbers ending in 1 while major east–west U.S. Routes have numbers ending in 0. Three-digit U.S. Routes serve as branches of their parent route. As such, U.S. Route 13 (US 13) runs north–south through {{the entire length of}} Delaware while US 40, a major U.S. Route running from Utah to New Jersey, passes east–west through northern New Castle County. US 113 serves as a branch of US 13 {{in the southern part of}} the state. US 9 is an exception to the numbering pattern as it runs east–west across Sussex County, though the route runs north–south in New Jersey and New York.|$|E

5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with {{a wider range of}} themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads <b>that</b> <b>run</b> through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|As the Britannia Restaurant {{takes up}} the full width of the ship on two decks, a 'tween deck, called Deck 3L, was devised to allow {{passengers}} to walk from the Grand Lobby to the Queen's Room without traversing the dining room mid-meal. The deck consists of two corridors <b>that</b> <b>run</b> beneath the upper balcony of the restaurant on Deck 3, and above the main dining area on Deck 2. This is why the balcony of the Britannia has tiers that step up towards the hull. This arrangement is illustrated on the hull {{where there is a}} stack of three rows of windows in the area where the main restaurant sits, the two upper and lower most rows illuminate the dining room, while the centre row serves Deck 3L. There is a similar arrangement through the Royal Court Theatre. As well, the passages <b>that</b> <b>run</b> on either side of Illuminations on Deck 3 ramp upwards to compensate for the change in deck elevation between the entrance to Illuminations and an elevator bank forward of the room.|$|E
5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago and the region is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults <b>that</b> <b>run</b> parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along the San Andreas Fault (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the portion}} <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> through Caribou has been re-routed, {{due to a}} new bypass that was {{completed}} in 2012. The two-lane bypass now carries SR 161, and the old portion <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> through downtown Caribou has been re-signed as SR 161B.|$|R

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating. It is produced during incomplete burning of organic matter. This can occur from motor vehicles, heaters, or cooking equipment <b>that</b> <b>run</b> on carbon-based fuels. It can also occur from exposure to methylene chloride. Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) preventing the blood from carrying oxygen. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are affected. Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.|$|E

The current {{home and away}} kit features the traditional colours {{with the exception of}} bold curved trims <b>that</b> <b>run</b> {{from the center of the}} neck and open to the sides, forming two panels on the chest that contain the Umbro logo and emblem of the Salvadoran Football Federation. At the center of the kit the Salvadoran national emblem, once again, is shown. The right sleeve shows the national flag.|$|E
5|$|Food waste puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax. For councils, the cost of food waste comes from its collection and disposal {{as a part of the}} waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils <b>that</b> <b>run</b> separate food waste collections.|$|E

The plan also includes the purchase of 20,000 flex cars in 2009 for the government fleet.|$|E

To increase the vocabulary available, some static devices have multiple levels, with different words appearing on different levels. On dynamic AAC devices, the user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages.|$|E
