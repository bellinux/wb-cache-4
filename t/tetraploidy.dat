The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] to this item has been restricted by repository administrators {{at the request of the}} publisher, Elsevier, until December 2016. A gene's duplication relaxes selection. Loss of duplicate, low-function DNA (fractionation) sometimes follows, mostly by deletion in plants, but mostly via the pseudogene pathway in fish and other clades with smaller population sizes. Subfunctionalization — the founding term of the Xfunctionalization lexicon — while not the general cause of differences in duplicate gene retention, becomes primary as the number of a gene's cis — regulatory sites increases. Balanced gene drive explains retention for the average gene. Both maintenance-of-balance and subfunctionalization drive gene content nonrandomly, and currently fall outside of our accepted Theory of Evolution. The ‘typical’ mutation encountered by a gene duplicate is not a neutral loss-of-function; dominant mutations (Muller's lexicon; these are not neutral) abound, and confound X functionalization terms like ‘neofunctionalization’. Confusion of words may cause confusion of thought. As with many plants, fish <b>tetraploidies</b> provide a higher throughput surrogate-genetic method to infer function from human and other vertebrate ENCODE-like regulatory sites. ‘Not only have studies on polyploid fractionation led to reconsiderations of fundamental evolutionary theory, but fractionation in polyploids permits higher-throughput comparative genomic experiments using ENCODE-like data yielding the logical precision expected of genetic analyses. ...|$|R

Autologous cancellous bone remains the gold standard in this context of long bone nonunion reconstruction, but with several clinical limitations. We then assessed the feasibility and safety of human autologous scaffold-free osteogenic 3 -dimensional (3 D) graft (derived from autologous adipose-derived stem cells [ASCs]) to cure a bone nonunion in extreme clinical and pathophysiological conditions. Human ASCs (obtained from subcutaneous adipose tissue of 6 patients and expanded up to passage 4) were incubated in osteogenic media and supplemented with demineralized bone matrix to obtain the scaffold-free 3 D osteogenic structure as confirmed in vitro by histomorphometry for osteogenesis and mineralization. The 3 D "bone-like" structure was finally transplanted for 3 patients with bone tumor and 3 patients with bone pseudarthrosis (2 congenital, 1 acquired) to assess the clinical feasibility, safety, and efficacy. Although minor clones with structural aberrations (aneuploidies, such as tri or <b>tetraploidies</b> or clonal trisomy 7 in 6 %- 20 % of cells) were detected in the undifferentiated ASCs at passage 4, the osteogenic differentiation significantly reduced these clonal anomalies. The final osteogenic product was stable, did not rupture with forceps manipulation, did not induce donor site morbidity, and was easily implanted directly into the bone defect. No acute (< 3 mo) side effects, such as impaired wound healing, pain, inflammatory reaction, and infection, or long-term side effects, such as tumor development, were associated with the graft up to 4 years after transplantation.

50|$|Unlike karyotypes {{obtained}} from conventional cytogenetics, virtual karyotypes are reconstructed by computer programs using signals {{obtained from}} disrupted DNA. In essence, {{the computer program}} will correct translocations when it lines up the signals in chromosomal order. Therefore, virtual karyotypes cannot detect balanced translocations and inversions. They also can only detect genetic aberrations in regions of the genome that are represented by probes on the array. In addition, virtual karyotypes generate a relative copy number normalized against a diploid genome, so tetraploid genomes will be condensed into a diploid space unless renormalization is performed. Renormalization requires an ancillary cell-based assay, such as FISH, if one is using arrayCGH. For karyotypes obtained from SNP-based arrays, <b>tetraploidy</b> can often be inferred from the maintenance of heterozygosity within a region of apparent copy number loss. Low-level mosaicism or small subclones may not be detected by virtual karyotypes because the presence of normal cells in the sample will dampen the signal from the abnormal clone. The exact point of failure, {{in terms of the}} minimal percentage of neoplastic cells, will depend on the particular platform and algorithms used. Many copy number analysis software programs used to generate array-based karyotypes will falter with less than 25-30% tumor/abnormal cells in the sample.

50|$|Though Psathyrostachys juncea {{can survive}} in harsh conditions, it {{is a hard}} species to {{initially}} plant, because the seeds {{must be in the}} correct conditions in order to begin germination. Psathyrostachys juncea has low seedling vigor, which affects the success of germination. But once P. juncea has begun germination, it can tolerate most harsh weather conditions. In recent years, scientists have explored possible solutions to improving seedling vigor. One possible technique to increasing seedling vigor is increasing ploidy. In nature, P. juncea are diploids, however, tetraploid germplasm have been show to increase seed size and seedling vigor in P. juncea. Regeneration of this species has been successful, meaning that scientists can more easily select for specific traits and manipulate P. juncea at the cellular level. Thus, humans can easily induce <b>tetraploidy</b> in P. juncea. As a result, breeding programs have begun to grow tetraploid cultivars so as to increase the success of P. juncea germination. There is a small change in tissue quality and nutrition content with different ploidy levels, but nothing significant. Therefore, increasing tetraploid cultivars is a possible avenue for improving seed quality. Path analysis has been conducted to examine what exactly effects seed yield. Fertile, strong stems (tillers), the number of flowers (florets) per flower cluster (spikelet), and seed weight all showed positive relationships with seed yield. That is, P. juncea with more stems/tillers, more flowers, and/or heavier seeds have improved seed yield. However, the number of flower clusters (spikelet) per stem and number of seeds per flower cluster were negatively correlated with seed yield. Thus, having more flowers on a cluster, not more seeds per cluster, increasing seed yield. This information can be used to improve breeding programs for P. juncea. In addition, water stress also improves leaf and inflorescence tissue quality, while nitrogen rich fertilizer improves leaf, stem, and inflorescence tissue quality. Increased tissue quality is related to improvements in total yield.|$|E

40|$|Genomic {{instability}} (GI) {{is essential}} for the initiation and evolution of many cancers and often precedes frank neoplastic conversion. Although GI can occur at several levels, the most conspicuous examples involve gains or losses of entire chromosomes (aneuploidy), the antecedent of which may be whole genome duplication (<b>tetraploidy).</b> Through largely undefined mechanisms, the c-Myc oncoprotein and its downstream target, MTMC 1, promote <b>tetraploidy</b> and other forms of GI. In myeloid cells, c-Myc and MTMC 1 also regulate a common, small subset of c-Myc target genes including GP 1 Bα, which encodes a subunit of the von Willebrand's factor receptor complex that mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation. Gp 1 bα also participates in megakaryocyte endomitosis, a form of controlled and precise whole-genome amplification. In this article, we show that both c-Myc and MTMC 1 strongly up-regulate Gp 1 bα concurrent with their promotion of <b>tetraploidy.</b> shRNA-mediated inhibition of Gp 1 bα prevents <b>tetraploidy</b> by both c-Myc and MTMC 1, whereas Gp 1 bα overexpression alone is sufficient to induce <b>tetraploidy</b> in established and primary cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Mammalian {{cells have}} been {{reported}} to have a p 53 -dependent <b>tetraploidy</b> checkpoint that blocks cell cycle progression in G 1 in response to failure of cell division. In most cases where the <b>tetraploidy</b> checkpoint has been observed cell division was perturbed by anti-cytoskeleton drug treatments. However, other evidence argues against the existence of a <b>tetraploidy</b> checkpoint. Cells that have failed to divide differ from normal cells in having two nuclei, two centrosomes, a decreased surface to volume ratio, and having undergone an abortive cytokinesis. We tested each of these to determine which, if any, cause a G 1 cell cycle arrest. Results Primary human diploid fibroblasts with intact cell cycle checkpoints were used in all experiments. Synchronized cells exhibited G 1 arrest in response to division failure caused by treatment with either cytochalasin or the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin. The role of <b>tetraploidy,</b> aberrant centrosome number, and increased cell size were tested by cell/cell and cell/cytoplast fusion experiments; none of these conditions resulted in G 1 arrest. Instead we found that various drug treatments of the cells resulted in cellular damage, which was the likely cause of the arrest. When cytokinesis was blocked in the absence of damage-inducing drug treatments no G 1 arrest was observed. Conclusions We show that neither <b>tetraploidy,</b> aberrant centrosome number, cell size, nor failure of cytokinesis lead to G 1 arrest, suggesting that there is no <b>tetraploidy</b> checkpoint. Rather, certain standard synchronization treatments cause damage that is the likely cause of G 1 arrest. Since tetraploid cells can cycle when created with minimal manipulation, previous reports of a <b>tetraploidy</b> checkpoint can probably be explained by side effects of the drug treatments used to observe them. </p...|$|E

The ploidy between BRCA 2 -mutated (n= 71) and matched sporadic (n= 165) cancers was compared. Differences in ploidy distribution were examined with respect to molecular tumour subtypes, previously defined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray sections. <b>Tetraploidy</b> was significantly 3 times more common in BRCA 2 breast cancers than sporadic. However, no differences were found in the overall ploidy distribution between BRCA 2 -mutation carriers and non-carriers. In BRCA 2 cancers, <b>tetraploidy</b> was associated with luminal characteristics. The increased frequency of <b>tetraploidy</b> in BRCA 2 associated cancers may be linked to cell division errors, particularly cytokinesis. Additionally, <b>tetraploidy</b> emerges predominantly in BRCA 2 breast cancers displaying luminal rather than triple-negative phenotypes...|$|E
30|$|We next {{examined}} the induction of <b>tetraploidy</b> in Korean rose bitterling with hydrostatic pressure treatments for various times. The longer the shock duration, {{the higher the}} induction rate {{in each of the}} experimental groups. However, a significant difference was not observed (P >  0.05). The experimental group treated for 100  min showed the highest rate. Furthermore, an increased induction rate was not observed in the control group. <b>Tetraploidy</b> was not induced in any of the experimental groups treated at 4500 psi hydrostatic pressure. The induction rate of <b>tetraploidy</b> was highest at 7500 psi hydrostatic pressure. Under the same treatment time and longer shock duration, the induction rate increased in each experimental group, but {{there was no significant difference}} (P >  0.05).|$|E
