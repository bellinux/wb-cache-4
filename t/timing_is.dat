5|$|Tubman {{changed her}} name from Araminta to Harriet soon after her marriage, though the exact <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> unclear. Larson {{suggests}} this happened {{right after the}} wedding, and Clinton suggests that it coincided with Tubman's plans to escape from slavery. She adopted her mother's name, possibly {{as part of a}} religious conversion, or to honor another relative.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{appear to}} moult {{once a year}} in spring or summer, {{although}} observations have been limited. Young birds spend about a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and eyes are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their eyes are brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> unknown but likely to be around four months of age.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps have a {{complete}} moult in their breeding areas in August and September prior to migration. Some birds, typically those migrating the greatest distances, have a further partial moult between December and March. Juveniles replace their loosely structured body feathers with adult plumage, starting earlier, but taking longer to complete, than the adults. Blackcaps breeding {{in the north of}} the range have an earlier and shorter post-juvenile moult than those further south, and cross-breeding of captive birds shows that the <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> genetically controlled.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a list}} of the NCAA outdoor champions in the 3000 meters steeplechase. Hand <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> used until 1973, {{starting}} in 1974 fully automatic <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> used.|$|R
50|$|Descriptions {{are taken}} from the track list on the album cover. <b>Timings</b> <b>are</b> taken from the first edition's label, which uses take four of each side. Later editions have {{alternate}} takes of side two, and <b>timings</b> <b>are</b> not shown on the labels.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a list}} of the NCAA outdoor champions in the 4x110 yard relay until 1975, and {{the metric}} 4x100 meters relay being contested after {{metrication}} occurred in 1976. Hand <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> used until 1973, starting in 1974 fully automatic <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> used.|$|R
5|$|Pesticides {{are applied}} to crops by {{agricultural}} aircraft, tractor-mounted crop sprayers or as seed dressings to control pests. However, successful control by pesticides is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> often critical, the method of application is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimised. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed. Where progressive farmers are using fertilisers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate application of pesticides may be detrimental in the longer term.|$|E
25|$|Sleep <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> {{controlled}} by the circadian clock (Process C), sleep-wake homeostasis (Process S), {{and to some extent}} by individual will.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing diagram}} {{is shown to}} the right. The <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> further {{described}} below and applies to both the master and the slave device.|$|E
5000|$|The track <b>timings</b> <b>are</b> {{taken from}} the 1990 British release (RCA PL 74828). When {{released}} in the United States and Canada, the track <b>timings</b> <b>were</b> slightly different. These latter releases also contained an 18th song, [...] "X Y & Zee (Sensory Amplification)".|$|R
40|$|Accuracy and {{variability}} of motor <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> assessed using a finger-tapping task. Participants were healthy, had generalized cerebellar dysfunction or Parkinson Disease. Inaccuracy of motor timing during the short duration interval differentiated groups. Variability of motor <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> {{increased in the}} cerebellar disorder participants...|$|R

25|$|<b>Timing</b> <b>is</b> sacrosanct on the channel. Running {{over the}} hour except in special {{circumstances}} or the occasional scheduled instance is unheard of, and interrupting the Greenwich Time Signal {{on the hour}} (known as 'crashing the pips') is frowned upon.|$|E
25|$|Melatonin {{is known}} to aid in {{reducing}} the effects of jet lag, especially in eastward travel, by promoting the necessary reset of the body's sleep-wake phase. If the <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> not correct, however, it can instead delay adaption.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{have argued}} that the {{judicial}} branch checks bureaucratic drift most efficiently when controlling delays of implementing law. <b>Timing</b> <b>is</b> important because the process gives less organized groups time to learn about proposed actions and respond to these proposals.|$|E

5000|$|Agnus's <b>timings</b> <b>are</b> {{measured}} in [...] "color clocks" [...] of 280 ns. This {{is equivalent to}} two low resolution (140 ns) pixels or four high resolution (70 ns) pixels. Like Denise, these <b>timings</b> <b>were</b> designed for display on household TVs, and can be synchronized to an external clock source.|$|R

25|$|Various {{studies have}} found direct genetic effects to account for at least 46% of the {{variation}} of timing of puberty in well-nourished populations. The genetic association of <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> strongest between mothers and daughters. The specific genes affecting timing are not yet known. Among the candidates is an androgen receptor gene.|$|E
25|$|Time and <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} {{important}} factor when planning land use. Not only is it crucial to understand how long to use the land for agriculture and how long to rest, it is equally important to understand exactly when and where the land is ready for that use and rest.|$|E
25|$|Tide flow {{information}} is most commonly seen on nautical charts, {{presented as a}} table of flow speeds and bearings at hourly intervals, with separate tables for spring and neap tides. The <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> relative to high water at some harbour where the tidal behaviour is similar in pattern, {{though it may be}} far away.|$|E
50|$|From its {{inception}} until 1980, the World Junior Championships {{were held in}} the spring. In 1981, the <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> changed to the November or December of the previous calendar year. In 2000, the <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> changed back to its previous form and the World Junior Championships were once again held in the spring.|$|R

25|$|<b>Timing</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} to wound healing. Critically, {{the timing of}} wound reepithelialization can decide {{the outcome of the}} healing. If the epithelization of tissue over a denuded area is slow, a scar will form over many weeks, or months; If the epithelization of a wounded area is fast, the healing will result in regeneration.|$|E
25|$|This article {{treats the}} {{reckoning}} of days, {{months and years}} in the calendar used by adherents of the Zoroastrian faith. Zoroastrian religious festivals are discussed elsewhere, but have a fixed relationship to Nawruz, the New Year festival, whose <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> discussed below. Three distinct versions of the calendar are currently in use by different Zoroastrian communities.|$|E
25|$|By July 2011 {{violence}} became at {{a record}} high in the insurgency. In late July 2011, NATO troops also handed control of Mazar-i-Sharif to local forces amid rising security fears just days after it {{was hit by a}} deadly bombing. Mazar-i-Sharif is the sixth of seven areas to transition to Afghan control, but critics say the <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> political and there is skepticism over Afghan abilities to combat the Taliban insurgency.|$|E

50|$|This {{is a list}} of the NCAA outdoor champions in {{the mile}} run until 1975, and the metric 1500 meters being contested in Olympic years {{starting}} in 1932. Metrication occurred in 1976, so all subsequent championships were at the metric distance. Hand <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> used until 1973, starting in 1974 fully automatic <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> used.|$|R

25|$|They {{married in}} 1904, but Peppino Ricciardo {{probably}} did not last long. The <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> vague, but Ward's next love, and her last husband, {{is thought to have}} been a station manager of the little Italian railroad that helped visitors tour Mount Vesuvius, a Signor Cassalota. Ward is believed to have still been married to her fourth husband when she died in Padua, Italy, on 9 December 1916, aged 43.|$|E
25|$|Ranulf's {{accession}} {{may have}} involved him giving up {{many of his}} other lands, including much of his wife's Lincolnshire lands {{as well as his}} lands in Cumbria, though direct evidence for this beyond convenient <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> lacking. That Cumberland was given up at this point is likely, as King Henry visited Carlisle in December 1122, where, according to the Historia Regum, he ordered the strengthening of the castle.|$|E
25|$|In February 2009, Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Prime Minister of Sweden {{stated that}} a new {{referendum}} on the euro issue will not be held until support is gained from the people and all the major parties. Therefore, the <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> now {{at the discretion of}} the Social Democrats. He added, the request of Mona Sahlin, former leader of the Social Democratic Party, for deferral of a new referendum until after the 2010 mandate period should be respected.|$|E
