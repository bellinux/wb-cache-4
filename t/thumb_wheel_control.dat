40|$|A {{microprocessor}} controlled programmable {{pulse generator}} was {{specifically designed to}} interface with the JEOL JNM-FT- 1 A Radio Frequency (RF) section of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The programmable pulse generator was programmed and controlled by an IBM compatible computer. Statis rams were utilized as the programmable pulse generator 2 Ì† 7 s on board memory which were used to store the pulse sequences. Pulse widths can be programmed from 0. 2 microseconds to 14. 3 minutes. The JEOL RF section is unique in that it allows the pulse generator to control the phase of the RF transmitted to the NMR probe and whether the sample will be decoupled. These two items set this programmable pulse generator apart from other pulse generators described in the literature and those systems which are commercially available. This programmable pulse generator was constructed to replace the old JEOL <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>controlled</b> pulse generator. Typical 180 degree pulse lengths for the JEOL NMR are approximately 20 microseconds...|$|R

40|$|An {{operator}} can {{rapidly and}} automatically produce coded electrical signals by manipulating mechanical <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> switches {{so as to}} instruct a service center to connect any number of telephone lines to the console thus enabling the operator to listen and/or talk over several lines simultaneously. The system includes an on-site console having several mechanically operated <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> switches to which the desired lines to be connected can be dialed in. Electrical coded signals are fed {{to a number of}} banks of line AND gates representing units, tens and hundreds, a group of channel gates, and a command gate. These signals are gated out in a controlled manner to an encoder which generates tones that are transmitted over a single line to a communication service center...|$|R

50|$|A {{universal}} steering <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> interface {{can be used}} on {{most any}} vehicle with steering <b>wheel</b> <b>controls,</b> to be used with today's top aftermarket radio manufactures like Pioneer, Sony, Alpine, Kenwood, Eclipse, JVC, Valor, Boyo (Vision Tech), Dual, Visteon, Advent and Blaupunkt. It is used to retain the OEM steering <b>wheel</b> <b>controls.</b> It has the ability to auto-detect many vehicle makes and aftermarket radios and it will preset the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>controls</b> to the aftermarket radio automatically so no programming is required. If desired it can be manually programmed so the user can make the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>controls</b> function the way they want them to, only limited by the functions of the aftermarket radio.|$|R

50|$|The Nikon F70 (or N70 as it {{is known}} in the U.S.) was a SLR camera {{manufactured}} by the Japanese Company Nikon. Introduced in 1994, it is the predecessor to the Nikon F80.

It is quite different compared to other Nikon SLR's of the same era.|$|R
5000|$|Customized App: A step up {{from this}} {{approach}} is to render each (or all) reports and dashboards in device-specific format.

Examples of these include <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> or <b>thumb</b> button for BlackBerry, up/down/left/right arrows for Palm, gestural manipulation for iPhone. This approach requires more effort than the previous but no additional software.|$|R

50|$|On {{a vehicle}} with {{longitudinal}} leaf springs, {{such as a}} Hotchkiss drive suspension, the springs themselves provide some longitudinal <b>wheel</b> <b>control.</b> One or more torque arms may be added to provide supplementary <b>wheel</b> <b>control,</b> particularly for vehicles with strong torque such as drag racers. On some leaf spring-equipped vehicles, such as 1960s Chrysler Corporation cars, the springs are mounted so that a lesser portion of the spring's length is forward of the <b>wheels,</b> improving <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> on acceleration. A side effect of such positioning is that the longer, aft portion of the springs may not be stiff enough to <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> movement under braking forces, {{which can lead to}} pronounced wheel hop in hard stops.|$|R

5000|$|The {{second type}} of {{steering}} used is steered <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> AGV. This type of steering can be similar to a cars steering. But this is not very manoeuvrable. It is more common to use a three-wheeled vehicle similar to a conventional three wheeled forklift. The drive wheel is the turning wheel. It is more precise in following the programmed path than the differential speed controlled method. This type of AGV has smoother turning.

40|$|Abstract. The hydro-mechanical {{differential}} turning {{mechanism is}} the new type of double power flow turning mechanism of tracked vehicle. The hydraulic stepless speed regulation and the high efficiency of mechanical transmission are integrated into the turning mechanism. The stepless turning of tracked vehicle can be achieved. Basing on hydro-mechanical differential turning theory, the scheme design of steering <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> system of tracked vehicle of hydro-mechanical differential turning is finished. By establishing model of steering <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> system, its working stability and following characteristic is simulated and analyzed in this paper. The demand of hydro-mechanical differential turning of tracked vehicle can be realized by the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> system designed through the simulation results...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> on {{the ribbon}} {{cartridge}} and the correction tape spools were color-coded {{so they could}} be easily identified and matched with the appropriate correction tapes: Yellow for the correctable film ribbon and Lift-Off tape; gray, pink, and blue for cloth, carbon film, and Tech-3, respectively. Later another type of correctable film ribbon and lift-off tape appeared, both color-coded orange. The yellow meant the ribbon was a higher quality and would produce a better quality type image. [...] Orange was a lower cost ribbon for everyday typing. The yellow and orange coded lift-off tapes would work with either ribbon type.|$|R
