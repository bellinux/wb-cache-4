5|$|News {{then reached}} Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander {{defeated}} each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with <b>their</b> <b>troops.</b> With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.|$|E
5|$|The Fatimids were {{estimated}} {{to have as many}} as 50,000 troops (other sources estimate about 20,000–30,000) entering the battle. <b>Their</b> <b>troops</b> consisted of Seljuq Turks, Arabs, Persians, Kurds, and Ethiopians, led by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah. Opposing them were the crusaders, whose numbers, estimated by Raymond of Aguilers, were around 1,200 knights and 9,000 infantry.|$|E

5|$|After a {{month of}} preparation, just before he was to assault the Confederate works at Yorktown, McClellan learned that Johnston had {{withdrawn}} up the Peninsula towards Williamsburg. McClellan was thus required to give chase without any benefit of the heavy artillery so carefully amassed in front of Yorktown. The Battle of Williamsburg on May 5 is considered a Union victory—McClellan's first—but the Confederate army was not destroyed and a bulk of <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> were successfully moved past Williamsburg to Richmond's outer defenses while the battle was waged and for several days thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Another push against Bosanski Brod was {{launched}} on 27 September. The advance initially had moderate success, until 4 October when the VRS rebalanced its forces, changing the {{sector of the}} bridgehead against which the 1st Krajina Corps was concentrated. The move managed to disrupt the HVO and HV defences and the VRS achieved a breakthrough, capturing Bosanski Brod on 6 October. In response, the HV and the HVO withdrew <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> and equipment in an orderly fashion, and the bridge spanning the Sava between the town and Slavonski Brod was demolished on 7 October.|$|E
5|$|As before, {{the uniform}} buttons could also {{reflect the state}} loyalties of an individual. All of the Confederate States {{made an effort to}} supply their {{respective}} State buttons to <b>their</b> <b>troops.</b> The states that did not join the Confederacy, but had men within its ranks, such as Maryland and Missouri, also made buttons, that have turned up on surviving uniforms.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found {{it very difficult to}} rein back <b>their</b> <b>troops,</b> who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Lépes and his brother, the vice-voivode, {{started to}} {{assemble}} <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> near the peasants' camp. The absent voivode, Ladislaus Csáki, hurried to Transylvania. The counts of the Székelys, Michael Jakcs and Henry Tamási, also joined the united armies of the voivode and the bishop. The young noblemen {{who joined the}} campaign {{wanted to make a}} sudden assault on the peasants, but the bishop suggested that the peasants should be pacified through negotiations. The delay enabled the rioters to complete the fortification of their camp.|$|E
5|$|Charles of Bavaria needed {{military}} assistance {{to take the}} imperial title by force, which he secured the treaty of Nymphenburg (July 1741). During the subsequent War of the Austrian Succession, he successfully captured Prague, where he was crowned King of Bohemia. He invaded Upper Austria, planning to capture Vienna, but diplomatic exigencies complicated his plans. His French allies redirected <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> into Bohemia, where Frederick the Great, himself newly King of Prussia, had {{taken advantage of the}} chaos in Austria and Bavaria to annex Silesia.|$|E
50|$|Typically {{constructed}} from plywood, this shallow-draft, barge-like boat could ferry a platoon-sized complement of 36 men to shore at 9 knots (17 km/h). Men generally entered the boat by climbing down a cargo net {{hung from the}} side of <b>their</b> <b>troop</b> transport; they exited by charging down the boat's bow ramp.|$|R
50|$|The Doyen-class ships, at only 414 feet {{in length}} and with a {{displacement}} of 4,351 tons, were considerably smaller than most other classes of attack transport.

500|$|In the Monterey Bay Area Council, Bánáthy {{implemented}} a unique approach to training both the adults and the boys. During 1967, he recruited {{a select group}} of young men and <b>their</b> leaders from <b>troops</b> in the Monterey Bay Area. The individuals were chosen to pilot-test teaching both adult leaders and their Scouts in sequence. In an application not since reproduced, all Wood Badge attendees were also asked to bring <b>their</b> <b>troop</b> to a single week of White Stag summer camp [...] in August.|$|R
5|$|Compared {{to former}} Russian armies, Shein's army was {{significantly}} modernised. Dissatisfied with their traditional formations of musket-equipped infantry (the streltsy), the Russians looked to foreign officers {{to update the}} equipment and training of <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> based on the Western European model of regulars, dragoons, and reiters. Eight such regiments, totaling 14,000 to 17,000 men, comprised a part of Shein's army.|$|E
5|$|During {{battles in}} Soviet Union in 1941 and 1942, the Waffen-SS {{suffered}} enormous casualties. The LSSAH and Das Reich lost over half <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> to illness and combat casualties. In need of recruits, Himmler began to accept soldiers {{that did not}} fit the original SS racial profile. In early 1942, SS-Leibstandarte, SS-Totenkopf, and SS-Das Reich were withdrawn to the West to refit and were converted to Panzergrenadier divisions. The SS-Panzer Corps returned to the Soviet Union in 1943 and participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov in February and March.|$|E
5|$|Ernuszt soon {{realized}} that most barons and prelates preferred Vladislaus Jagiellon, King of Bohemia. To prevent the coronation of Vladislaus, he and Lawrence Újlaki left Buda taking the Holy Crown of Hungary and the royal treasury with them. Đorđe Branković, Nicholas Hédervári, and other barons (mainly those who held estates along the southern borders) joined them. However, Vladislaus's supporters, Stephen Báthory and Paul Kinizsi, assembled <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> and defeated the united armies of Ernuszt and his allies at Gyönk on 4 July.|$|E
50|$|A {{majority}} of Bismarck's citizens {{turned out to}} welcome the Nez Perce prisoners, providing a lavish buffet for them and <b>their</b> <b>troop</b> escort. On November 23, the Nez Perce prisoners had their lodges and equipment loaded into freight cars and themselves into eleven rail coaches for the trip via train to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the highest}} stage. Every year several hundred Scouts aged 14 or above attain this award (ratio 1:180-190). They can {{participate}} in the Scout Rally regardless of <b>their</b> <b>troop.</b> A unique feature at this level is an overnight hike from dusk to dawn, as well as participation in an international Scout exchange programme.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, in disarray, the Germans {{managed to}} counterattack {{with the rest}} of <b>their</b> <b>troop.</b> Some SAS and civilians were killed, but the {{remaining}} SAS troops forced the Germans to withdraw. This mini battle was referred to as [...] "the last Amherst" [...] where part of the town was destroyed, and a huge conflict ensued.|$|R
5|$|Eusebius of Caesarea, a {{contemporary}} ecclesiastical historian, tells a similar story: commanders {{were told to}} give <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> the choice of sacrifice or loss of rank. These terms were stronga soldier would lose {{his career in the}} military, his state pension and his personal savingsbut not fatal. According to Eusebius, the purge was broadly successful, but Eusebius is confused about the technicalities of the event and his characterization of the overall size of the apostasy is ambiguous. Eusebius also attributes the initiative for the purge to Galerius, rather than Diocletian.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} at Alkozai and Balandi, Bales handed himself over into ISAF custody. Afghan forces spotted him leaving his outpost before the killings and U.S. commanders on base {{assembled}} <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> for a head count {{when it was}} discovered that a soldier was missing. A patrol was dispatched to find the missing soldier, but did not find him before he returned to base after the killings. He was reportedly taken into custody without incident. There were no military operations being conducted in the area {{at the time of the}} shootings.|$|E
5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> on the ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result}} of the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for more than six months. An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E

5|$|General Pickett had {{received}} orders from Robert E. Lee to, with the Cavalry divisions of Major Generals William Henry Fitzhugh Lee and Thomas L. Rosser, hold the vital railroad crossing at Five Forks at all costs. On April 1, at the Battle of Five Forks, <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> {{were attacked by}} a combined force under Major General Philip Henry Sheridan, which consisted of the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General Gouverneur K. Warren, and the Cavalry Corps of the Army, commanded by Brigadier General Wesley Merritt. Pickett, W.H.L. Lee, and Rosser were located behind the lines of <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> {{at the time of}} the attack, enjoying a shad bake while failing to inform their subordinate officers of their location. Meanwhile, Warren's troops overwhelmed their left flank, and the Cavalry troops pinned the Confederates down elsewhere. By the time the Confederate commanders realized the catastrophe, it was too late to prevent the defeat. The result of the battle, as well as that of the Third Battle of Petersburg the following day, forced Lee to abandon his entrenchments at Petersburg, leading to the capture of Richmond and surrender of his army on April 9.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, he was {{commissioned}} by the Ottoman authorities {{to prevent the spread}} of a Druze rebellion from Hauran to northern Palestine. He successfully satisfied this request, aided by his Bedouin allies. Among his assignments during the rebellion was the protection from Bedouin raiders of a supply route which the Ottomans used to send ammunition to <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> in Hauran. Aqil and his men accomplished the task successfully.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{personal}} advertisements section in newspapers would sometimes {{be used to}} exchange messages encrypted using simple cipher schemes. Kahn (1967) describes instances of lovers engaging in secret communications enciphered using the Caesar cipher in The Times. Even as late as 1915, the Caesar cipher was in use: the Russian army employed it {{as a replacement for}} more complicated ciphers which had proved to be too difficult for <b>their</b> <b>troops</b> to master; German and Austrian cryptanalysts had little difficulty in decrypting their messages.|$|E
5000|$|The United States began {{drastically}} reducing <b>their</b> <b>troop</b> {{support in}} South Vietnam {{during the final}} years of Vietnamization.

5|$|Most Scouts {{choose to}} work on the Explorer badge that is related to the section of Scouting <b>their</b> <b>Troop</b> belongs to, but {{there is no reason why}} a Scout can not do an Explorer badge from another section.
