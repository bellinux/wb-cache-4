5|$|The {{design of}} {{implants}} has {{to account for}} a lifetime of real-world use in a person's mouth. Regulators and the dental implant industry have created a series of <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the long-term mechanical reliability of implants in a person's mouth where the implant is struck repeatedly with increasing forces (similar in magnitude to biting) until it fails.|$|E
5|$|Water hemlock {{poisoning}} {{is usually}} diagnosed following {{a history of}} plant ingestion and symptoms of abrupt onset of seizures. Laboratory <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the presence of cicutoxin in the blood such as spectrofluorimetry, high pressure liquid chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and mass spectrometry {{have been used to}} detect cicutoxin but these tests are not performed routinely in hospital laboratories. If a sample of the plant ingested has been retained, diagnosis can be confirmed by having the plant identified by a botanist.|$|E
5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the bark of the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required for a complete recovery.|$|E

5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the cause of his mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{had their}} own {{independent}} atomic-bomb programs and therefore the Japanese understood enough to know how very difficult building it would be. Therefore, many Japanese {{and in particular the}} military members of the government refused to believe the United States had built an atomic bomb, and the Japanese military ordered their own independent <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the cause of Hiroshima's destruction. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, argued that even if the United States had made one, they could not have many more. American strategists, having anticipated a reaction like Toyoda's, planned to drop a second bomb shortly after the first, to convince the Japanese that the U.S. had a large supply.|$|E
5|$|The third project {{topic was}} disk mass potential. This topic was {{designed}} to make measurements of the distances to disk stars {{as well as their}} proper motions. The results of the third topic of study were to be combined with the results of the fundamental galactic parameters portion of the study to determine the Solar System's position and velocity in the galaxy. The final topic dealt with dark matter distribution in the Milky Way. SIM data was to be used to create a three-dimensional model of mass distribution in the Galaxy, out to a radius of 270 kiloparsecs (kps). They were to then use two different <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the galactic potential at large radii.|$|E

5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Brain Age 2 is an {{edutainment}} {{video game}} that offers the player several minigames to play. Before the game begins, the player must create a profile, after which Brain Age Check runs three random <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the player's brain age, which ranges from 20 to 80 and {{depends on the}} player's test performance. The brain age determines approximately the responsiveness of the player's brain; a brain age of 20, the lowest age that the player can achieve, indicates that the player's brain is as responsive as that of an average 20-year-old. Once the player is told their initial brain age, three modes are unlocked: Quick Play, Daily Training, and Sudoku. In Quick Play, the player can practice {{with any of the}} available minigames without receiving a score. In Daily Training, the player can perform Brain Age Check to determine their updated brain age. They can also complete one of the available minigames, after which they are given a rating based on their performance. In Daily Training, the player can also play Virus Buster, a simplified version of Dr. Mario (1990) modified for mobile play. To let the player track their progress, the game saves daily statistics of the player's performance, which are shown in a graph. In the third mode, Sudoku, the player can solve one of a hundred Sudoku puzzles.|$|E

40|$|A CNC {{machine tool}} {{performance}} {{depends on the}} machine accuracy status which is very important <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the end product compliance to the specification. The accuracy of the machine can be measured and analyzed; hence the errors' impact can be predicted on a workpiece. This paper presents three types of accuracy tests performed on a CNC Vertical Machining Centre, how the accuracy status affect the end product quality {{and what are the}} corrective actions to be taken. First, the laser <b>test</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the linear positioning accuracy, second the ball bar <b>test</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the circularity accuracy and third, the static accuracy <b>test</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the machine current static accuracy status and finally the cutting <b>test</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the actual machine accuracy effect on a work piece. Machine tool's errors can be diagnosed and minimize or eliminated by either electronic compensation or mechanical maintenance and sometimes both need to be done. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The amount of screening the embryo has already undergone is largely dependent on the genetic parents' own IVF clinic and process. The embryo recipient may elect to have her own embryologist conduct further testing.|$|E
25|$|Many acupuncturists {{attribute}} {{pain relief}} {{to the release of}} endorphins when needles penetrate, but no longer support the idea that acupuncture can affect a disease. It is a generally held belief within the acupuncture community that acupuncture points and meridians structures are special conduits for electrical signals, but no research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either acupuncture points or meridians. Human <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether electrical continuity was significantly different near meridians than other places in the body have been inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{breakage}} of one {{of three}} flow control valves on the previous flight, STS-126, the flow valves of all orbiters were subjected to <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if Discovery was safe to fly. These valves are used to synchronize the flow of gaseous hydrogen between the external fuel tank and the Space Shuttle Main Engines, creating an even flow. Following the testing of the valves, mission managers decided to postpone the launch, and engineers were asked to replace the suspect flow valves with valves that had less flight time.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{assessment}} includes {{measurement of the}} blood pressure and heart rate, as well as blood <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> hemoglobin concentration. In significant bleeding, fluid replacement is often required, as well as blood transfusion, before the source of bleeding can be determined by endoscopy of the upper digestive tract with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Depending on the source, endoscopic therapy {{can be applied to}} reduce rebleeding risk. Specific medical treatments (such as proton pump inhibitors for peptic ulcer disease) or procedures (such as TIPS for variceal hemorrhage) may be used. Recurrent or refractory bleeding may lead to need for surgery, although this has become uncommon as a result of improved endoscopic and medical treatment.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2007, genetic {{analysis}} has become {{available to the}} public. The companies claim their DNA-based diagnostic test can genetically determine the breed composition of mixed-breed dogs. These tests are still limited in scope because {{only a small number}} of the hundreds of dog breeds have been validated against the tests, and because the same breed in different geographical areas may have different genetic profiles. The tests do not test for breed purity, but for genetic sequences that are common to certain breeds. With a mixed-breed dog, the test is not proof of purebred ancestry, but rather an indication that those dogs share common ancestry with certain purebreds. The American Kennel Club does not recognize the use of DNA <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> breed.|$|E
25|$|Other {{diagnostic}} <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{the level}} of diabetic control are fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb) blood tests which can be useful especially if stress may be a factor. While anxiety or stress may influence the results of blood or urine glucose tests, both of these tests measure glycated proteins, which are not affected by them. Fructosamine testing provides information about blood glucose control for an approximate 2- to 4-week period, while GHb tests measure a 2- to 4-month period. Each of these tests has its own limitations and drawbacks and neither are intended to be replacements for blood glucose testing and curves, but are {{to be used to}} supplement the information gained from them. While HbA1c tests are a common diagnostic for diabetes in humans, there are no standards of measurement for use of the test in animals. This means the information from them may not be reliable.|$|E
