Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e. more than 12 weeks – the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the {{efficacy}} of a 38 -h communication skills training program designed for multidisciplinary radiotherapy teams. Materials and methods Four radiotherapy teams were randomly assigned to a training program or to a waiting list. Assessments were scheduled at baseline (T 1) and then after <b>the</b> <b>training</b> was completed or four months later (T 2), respectively. Communication around radiotherapy delivery was assessed based on audio recordings of the first and last radiotherapy sessions in order to assess team members' communication skills and the expression of concerns by breast cancer patients (analyzed with content analysis software LaComm). Results 198 radiotherapy sessions were recorded. During the first radiotherapy sessions, members of <b>the</b> <b>trained</b> <b>teams</b> exhibited more assessment skills (p = 0. 048), provided more setting information (p < 0. 001), and used more social words (p = 0. 019) compared to the members of the untrained teams. During the last radiotherapy session, members of <b>the</b> <b>trained</b> <b>teams</b> used more assessment skills (p = 0. 004) and patients interacting with members of <b>the</b> <b>trained</b> <b>teams</b> expressed more sadness words (p = 0. 023). Conclusion <b>Training</b> of multidisciplinary <b>teams</b> has the potential to transfer skills that affect the short exchanges that take place around radiotherapy delivery.
