40|$|<b>Sensitivity</b> limits <b>of</b> {{ground-based}} infrared interferometers using aperture synthesis are presented. <b>The</b> motivation <b>of</b> {{this analysis}} is to compare an interferometer composed of multiple large telescopes and a single giant telescope with adaptive optics. In deriving these limits, perfect wavefront correction by adaptive optics and perfect cophasing by fringe tracking are assumed. We consider the case in which n beams are pairwise combined at n(n − 1) / 2 detectors (n C 2 interferometer) and the case {{in which all the}} n beams are combined at a single detector (n Cn interferometer). Our analysis covers broadband observations by considering spectral dispersion of interference fringes. In the read noise limit, the n Cn interferometer with one dimensional baseline configuration is superior to the n C 2 interferometer, while in the background limit, <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one-dimensional n Cn interferometer is small. As a case study, we compare <b>the</b> point-source <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> interferometers composed of nine 10 -m diameter telescopes and a 30 -m diameter single telescope with adaptive optics between 1 and 10 µm for 10 -σ detection in one hour. At J and H, <b>the</b> <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interferometers are limited to 25 to 24 mag by read noise and OH airglow background, while that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single telescope is limited to 28 to 26 mag by OH airglow background.

5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. <b>The</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E
