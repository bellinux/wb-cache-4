In this paper, the touch interaction paradigm is challenged for use on large <b>touch</b> <b>displays</b> of 65  in. in size. We present a gesture elicitation study with 26 participants carried out on twelve actions commonly used on <b>touch</b> <b>displays.</b> The results and analysis of 312 touch gestures revealed agreement rates for each action. We report several findings including {{the results of a}} set of ten unique (and a few secondary) gestures, a taxonomy classifying the defined gestures, a pilot study on the defined gestures, and explicit design implications. We discuss the results and include several important factors for future considerations. We aim at helping future designers and engineers to design interactions for large <b>touch</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R

50|$|Apparently {{similar to}} the {{development}} of traditional mobile phones into smartphones, vending machines have also progressively, though at a much slower pace, evolved into smart vending machines. Newer technologies at a lower cost of adoption, such as the large digital <b>touch</b> <b>display,</b> internet connectivity, cameras and various types of sensors, more cost-effective embedded computing power, digital signage, various advanced payment systems, and a wide range of identification technology (NFC, RFID, etc) have contributed to this development. These smart vending machines enable a more interactive user experience, and reduce operating costs while improving the efficiency of the vending operations through remote manageability and intelligent back-end analytic. Integrated sensors and cameras also represent a source of such data as customer demographics, purchase trends, and other locality-specific information. It also enables better customer-engagement for the brands through interactive multimedia and social media connectivity. Smart vending machines were #79 by JWT Intelligence on its list of 100 Things to Watch in 2014. According to market research by Frost & Sullivan, global shipments of smart vending machines are forecasted to reach around 2 million units by 2018, and further to 3.6 million units by 2020 with penetration rate of 20.3 percent.|$|E

The fact that Lenovo has garnered support from EA Games and Ubisoft, giants of the gaming space, has us hopeful that more apps will be designed for this unique device. Finally, it's not terribly expensive either, at least for the lower end version. i3 configurations start at only $999, so even if you're not running your own graphic design firm, the Horizon Table PC isn't out of your reach." ...|$|E
