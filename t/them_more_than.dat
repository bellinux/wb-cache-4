5|$|By 1761, the Maratha menace had diminished and by 1763, Haider Ali had {{captured}} the Keladi kingdom, defeated {{the rulers of}} Bilgi, Bednur and Gutti, invaded the Malabar {{in the south and}} conquered the Zamorin's capital Calicut with ease in 1766 and extended the Mysore kingdom up to Dharwad and Bellary in the north. Mysore was now a major political power in the subcontinent and Haider's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his defiance formed one of the last remaining challenges to complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinent – a challenge which would take <b>them</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three decades to overcome.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaching}} the final, United won nine and drew {{three of their}} 12 matches, dwarfing their record of four wins and six draws in the 10 games they took to reach the final in 1999 (when there was no first knockout round and teams advanced from the group stage directly into the quarter-finals). United scored 19 goals {{en route to the}} final, Ronaldo scoring seven of <b>them,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any other player.|$|E
5|$|In response, {{steps were}} taken to better protect the tankers from attack, but losses {{continued}} to mount until, in April 1942, they were banned by the Navy from operating the north-east sea routes. The government and industry took steps to maximise {{the use of the}} railroads, increasing the amount of oil carried on <b>them</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> ten-fold, but there were shortages of rail tank cars, and the existing fleet of cars was in poor condition. Instead, the United States government began to examine options for the use of pipelines to fulfil the demand for petroleum in the north-east.|$|E

5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to <b>them</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Jordan mounted two counter-attacks. The {{first was}} over Beit Susin.

The second was at Kibbutz Gezer from where the diversion attacks had been launched. A force {{the strength of a}} battalion, made up of Legionnaires and irregulars and supported by a dozen armoured vehicles, attacked the kibbutz in the morning. It was defended by 68 soldiers of the Haganah (including 13 women).|$|E
5|$|Sales were satisfactory, and the {{development}} of sequels began almost immediately after The Witcher release. The team began the design work for The Witcher 2 , and experimented with consoles to develop a new engine for The Witcher 3. Their development was halted when the team began work on , a console version of The Witcher. Although they collaborated with French studio Widescreen Games for the console port, it entered development limbo. Widescreen demanded more manpower, money and time to develop the title, complaining that they were not being paid; according to Iwiński, CD Projekt paid <b>them</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> their own staff members. The team cancelled the project, suspending its development. Unhappy with the decision, Atari demanded that CD Projekt repay them for funding the console port development and Iwiński agreed that Atari would be the North American publisher of the sequel of The Witcher 2. CD Projekt acquired Metropolis Software in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Nowitzki's career, he {{has responded}} to the {{increased}} pressure of the playoffs by increasing his productivity. As {{of the end of}} the 2013–14 season, he had averaged 22.5 points and 8.1 rebounds in the regular season. In the playoffs, he has averaged 25.6 points and 10.1 rebounds, which only Hakeem Olajuwon, Bob Pettit, and Elgin Baylor have managed to do. In the most pressure packed games, such as playoff elimination games he averages 28.8 points, 11.8 rebounds. He has had 14 elimination games where he scored 30 or more points, which ties him with Jerry West for most all time. Of the top 100 elimination game performances in the last 20 years, Nowitzki has had the best performances in 8 of <b>them,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any other player in the NBA in that same time frame.|$|E

25|$|Atoms {{sticking}} together in molecules or crystals {{are said to}} be bonded with one another.
