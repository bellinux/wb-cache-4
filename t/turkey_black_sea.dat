40|$|An Objective 500 -hPa cyclone {{detection}} and analysis is performed during the warm-dry period (16 April to 15 October) of year for Central and Eastern Mediterranean Region (30 °N- 50 °N, 5 °E- 35 °E). The 40 -year NCEP/NCAR reanalyzes gridded data of geopotential height and temperature {{employed in the}} study, enable a climatic approach with a spatial (2. 5 °X 2. 5 °) and a 6 -hour temporal (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC) resolution. The occurrence frequency of these cyclones (low centres), for the entire region, shows an interannual variability with a variation coefficient of 17 %, without a significant trend. Investigation of the typical dimensions of these systems {{is based on the}} estimation of a typical radius around the centre. The prevailing value of typical radius indicates the domination of sub-synoptic lows. Only 56 % of the detected cyclones are related to temperature minima at the same level. Vertical structure of these systems is usually maintained at 700 and 300 hPa levels. On the other hand only 50 % of the number of 500 -hPa cyclones is related to 1000 hPa geopotential height minima. At the upper levels (200 hPa), the occurrence of temperature maxima instead of minima above low centres, is quite common. Three primary activity centres (<b>Turkey,</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> and Genoa) are objectively determined in the frequency domain as local maxima and their intensity is assessed in terms of average geopotential height at the centre of the lows. The Turkey centre, though the most frequent, consists of shallow lows in contrast to the Black Sea one, which is the second in frequency, but on the average, contains the deepest lows among the three. Genoa centre, which comes third in frequency, shows the highest variability in the geopotential height at the centre of the lows. However, the geopotential height at the centre of the lows depends on both latitude and month of the year. It decreases on the average 10 gpm per degree of latitude and peaks during August. Cyclones at the 500 -hPa level, are usually cut-off south of the main westerlies, during the last stages of their life circle. The situation usually occurs over Tyrrhenian Sea, southeast Aegean, Turkey and the Black Sea. Frequency distributions in the entire area, during the three sub periods (Early, Middle and Late Warm Period) and during the four synoptic hours, provide insight in the origins of these systems and reveals secondary centres, such as the centres in Adriatic (at 18 UTC), Northern Greece (during Middle Warm Period) and South Aegean Sea (during Late Warm Period). The spatial distribution of temperature minima, which are related to 500 hPa cyclones, indicates a different picture between lower and upper levels. At the lower levels, temperature minima are observed over sea surfaces, such as, Tyrrhenian Sea, Gulf of Antalya and the Black Sea. At the upper levels, there is a tendency of unification of these local frequency maxima, over the entire Balkan Peninsula. ...|$|E
