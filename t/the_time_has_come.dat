5|$|Freya {{explains}} how {{she came to}} inhabit Chi's body. She reveals that she and Chi merely switched places inside the body, but Chi has shut herself away and Freya cannot contact her. Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that Chi discovered there were certain things that humans could do that she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love her, it would make her existence unbearable. Hideki protests that it would not, but Freya tells him that Chi thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya. Chi, however, has survived the deactivation and comes {{to the conclusion that}} while life with Hideki may seem painful because of her limitations, it is even more painful without him. She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel {{recalls the}} tales that a fellow slave, Macandal, would regale on the {{plantation}} of their master, Lenormand de Mezy. Macandal would tell tales of magical characters and mythical kingdoms with rivers {{rising in the}} sky. He is said to not only have irresistible qualities that appeal to black women, but also the ability to captivate men. He suffers an accident in which his left hand is caught in machinery, and his arm is dragged in up to the shoulder. Being useless to his owner, he departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi that appear to have magical qualities. Ti Noel joins Macandal and both learn about the magical attributes of these natural elements. Macandal suggests that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come,</b> and no longer goes to the plantation. After the rain season has passed, Ti Noel meets {{with him in a}} cave populated with strange items. Macandal has established contact with surrounding plantations, and gives instructions to ensure the death of cows using secret herbs. The poison spreads, killing livestock by the hundreds as well as Frenchmen, wiping out adults and children. Madame Lenormand de Mezy dies as a result, and the deaths continue with entire families suffering the same fate. At gunpoint, a slave eventually explains that Macandal has superhuman powers and is the Lord of Poison. Death within the plantations returns to normal rates as a result and the Frenchmen return to playing cards and drinking, as months pass with no word of Macandal. Macandal, now with the ability to transform into animal forms, like bird, fish, or insect, visits the plantation to affirm faith in his return. The slaves decide to wait four years for Macandal to complete his metamorphoses and once again become a human. After four years, he returns during a celebration and all present are delighted. The chanting alerts the white men, and preparations are made to capture Macandal. He is captured and tied to a post in order to be lashed and burned in front of massive black crowds, but he escapes, flying overhead, and lands among the crowd. He is again captured and burned, but the slaves are certain that he has been saved by African Gods and return to their plantations, laughing.|$|E

25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships.

25|$|On 22 May 2012, Ryan Richards {{announced}} that he was leaving the band. He cited his family as the reason, saying: “I’ve always put music first in my life – but <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> now for my family to take the top spot”. It was the band's initial intention that Richards would not be replaced instantly and that the band would only look for a touring member to play for the band. However, it was announced on that Pat Lundy would be joining the band as Richards' replacement. Lundy is the former drummer of London-based heavy metal band Rise to Remain, having left the band in January 2012. After being contacted by the band to come to audition in Cardiff for the role, Pat learned their whole setlist in 7 days for the audition. Whilst the line up change occurred the band was recording and mixing their follow up to their fifth studio album. Across the year the band made few live appearances as they were working on the album, performing at Wakestock in North Wales, both the northern and southern dates of Slam Dunk Festival 2012 and the UK Warped Tour festival at the Alexandra Palace in London on 10 November 2012.|$|E

The World called it [...] "one of the greatest creations we have had for many years.

It included a Preface written by Stanton in which she acknowledged that [...] "Both friend and foe object to the title." [...] Nevertheless, she praised the Revising Committee for showing [...] "a more worshipful reverence for the great Spirit of All Good than does the Church."

500|$|On 19 October 1988, the Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, {{issued a}} notice under clause 13(4) of the BBC Licence and Agreement to the BBC and under section 29(3) of the Broadcasting Act 1981 to the Independent Broadcasting Authority prohibiting the {{broadcast}} of direct statements by representatives or supporters of eleven Irish {{political and military}} organisations. The ban prevented the UK news media from broadcasting the voices, though not the words, of ten Irish republican and Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups, as well as Sinn Féin. Among the other groups affected were the Provisional IRA, Irish National Liberation Army, Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force, although the ban was targeted primarily at Sinn Féin. Addressing the House of Commons on the ban, Hurd said, [...] "the terrorists themselves draw support and sustenance from access to radio and television ... <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to deny this easy platform to those who use it to propagate terrorism", while the Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, said it would [...] "deny terrorists the oxygen of publicity".|$|E

The review goes on to state that [...] "for fans of more mainstream romantic productions, it's a neat twist on the traditional love-triangle formula, and a charming alternative to boys meeting girls." [...] In a review at Anime News Network (ANN), Carlo Santos commented that [...] "the fast-moving events of this first volume combine to form a story of many moods: a gender-bending comedy, but with sci-fi touches, and most of all, a romance more touching than one might expect. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to rethink the love triangle." [...] In a review at IGN, A. E. Sparrow stated [...] "there's plenty to enjoy in the first book, however.

500|$|Treasury {{officials}} officially recommended Gasparro's design, {{which they}} {{referred to as a}} [...] "modernized version of the classic Liberty design". On May 3, 1978, Wisconsin's William Proxmire introduced legislation in the Senate which was identical to the Treasury proposal, except for mandating a design which was altered to social reformer Susan B. Anthony in place of the allegorical Liberty. On May 15, Representatives Mary Rose Oakar and Patricia Schroeder introduced similar legislation to the House of Representatives. Anthony was also recommended by members of the National Organization for Women, the Congresswomen's Caucus, the National Women's Political Caucus and the League of Women Voters. In support of the proposed legislation, the League addressed a letter to Walter E. Fauntroy, chairman of the Subcommittee on Historic Preservation and Coinage, reading in part: The League believes that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come,</b> and is indeed long past, for the likeness of a prominent American woman to be placed on a denomination of U.S. currency. We believe strongly that the likeness should be that of an actual woman and not that of an imaginary or symbolic figure. Susan B. Anthony contributed immeasurably to the advancement of human dignity in this nation. It is entirely fitting and appropriate that her memory be honored through this measure. In addition, officials tallied suggestions sent to the Mint by the general public as to the subject of the dollar coin, and Susan B. Anthony had received the most support.|$|E
500|$|After Orik's coronation, Eragon and Saphira {{return to}} the elven capital Ellesméra to train. There, Saphira {{revealed}} from a memory that Eragon's deceased mentor, Brom, is Eragon's father; which Brom asked her to show him when the time was right. Oromis and Glaedr too justify Saphira's revelation. Glaedr also reveals the source of Galbatorix's power: Eldunari, or heart of hearts. An Eldunarí allows the holder to communicate with or draw energy from the dragon it belongs to, even if the dragon is deceased, or a great distance away. Galbatorix spent years collecting Eldunari, and forcing the deceased dragons to channel their energy to him through their Eldunari. Saphira is delighted to learn {{of the existence of}} the dragons, although imprisoned by Galbatorix's dark magics. After training, Eragon visits Rhunön, the elven blacksmith who forges swords for Riders. But Rhunön wouldn't create a weapon for him because long ago she swore an oath never to create a weapon again after the Fall of the Riders. Also her stocks of the metal, required to forge rider's swords was completely exhausted. But by deciphering the werecat Solembum's instructions Eragon is able to acquire the metal he requires, from under the roots of the Menoa Tree. After Eragon's repeated requests, Rhunön creates a weapon by controlling Eragon's body. Eragon gives a name to the sword,"Brisingr." [...] As Eragon's body itself forged the sword, a special bond between the sword and Eragon had been created, thus making the sword burst into flames whenever Eragon utters Brisingr, even when he does not intend to use magic. Oromis suspects that [...] "Brisingr" [...] is part of the sword's true name. Before Eragon and Saphira depart for the Varden, Oromis says that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> for him and Glaedr to openly oppose the Empire in combat alongside the Queen of the Elves, Islanzadí. Thus, Glaedr gives his own Eldunari to Eragon. If anything should happen to Glaedr, Eragon would still be able to get advice from him. Then Glaedr and Oromis fly to Gil'ead, while Eragon and Saphira fly to Feinster, the city that the Varden are laying siege to.|$|E
