500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>away...</b> Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E

2500|$|A {{common use}} of backmasking is hiding a comedic or parodical message {{backwards}} in a song.

[...] "You <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Away</b> (to Another World)", sung by Gary Morris and Crystal Gayle, got as high as Billboard's Top 40. [...] This theme was used on AW from 1987 to 1996, and was also used on return-from-midbreak bumpers in the last 10 episodes of the series.

2500|$|The second {{attempted}} mainstream album, Audio Lessonover? (an anagram of 'Radio One Loves Us') {{was released}} in 2001. The band hired well known music producer Chuck Zwicky (Semisonic, Madonna). Zwicky wanted {{to go with a}} more stripped down sound than the sonically layered Mezzamorphis and Glo. The band noted that there were tense and strained moments during the Audio Lessonover recording sessions, but in the end it stretched them as musicians and as a band. The first single [...] "Waiting For The Summer" [...] reached number twenty-six on the charts, hindered by limited radio airplay. This led to a planned second single, <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Away,</b> being cancelled. Critically, the record itself received less favourable reviews in comparison to their previous three albums, whilst commercial album sales were also lower.|$|E
2500|$|Hirst {{was born}} Damien Steven Brennan in Bristol {{and grew up}} in Leeds. He never met his father, with his mother marrying his {{stepfather}} when he was 2 and divorcing 10 years later. His stepfather was reportedly a motor mechanic. Hirst's mother who was from an Irish Catholic background worked for the Citizens Advice Bureau, and has stated that she lost control of her son when he was young. He was arrested on two occasions for shoplifting. However, Hirst sees her as someone who would not tolerate rebellion: she cut up his bondage trousers and heated one of his Sex Pistols vinyl records on the cooker {{to turn it into a}} fruit bowl (or a plant pot). He says, [...] "If she didn't like how I was dressed, she would quickly <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>away</b> from the bus stop." [...] She did, though, encourage his liking for drawing, which was his only successful educational subject.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Another World was {{the first}} soap opera to talk about {{abortion}} when such subjects were taboo. It {{was the first}} soap opera to do a crossover, with the character of Mike Bauer from Guiding Light, which was also created by Irna Phillips, coming from Springfield to Bay City. It {{was also the first}} to expand to one hour, then to ninety minutes, and then back to an hour. It was the first soap to launch two spin-offs, Somerset and Texas, as well as an indirect one, Lovers and Friends, which would be renamed For Richer, For Poorer. Another World was also the first soap opera with a theme song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, [...] "(You <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Away</b> To) Another World" [...] by Crystal Gayle and Gary Morris, in 1987. On April 12, 1999, NBC announced it was canceling Another World [...] with its final episode on the network airing on June 25, 1999. NBC replaced Another World with another soap opera, Passions, on July 5, 1999.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the closest}} of confidants, Beavis and Butt-Head have a jaded, violent, {{and at times}} {{borderline}} sadistic relationship. Butt-Head often insults and physically abuses Beavis (usually by slapping him, sometimes accompanied by a request to [...] "Settle down, Beavis!" [...] if Butt-Head feels his friend is getting a bit too hyperactive, as he often does). On occasion, Beavis will fight back or stand up for himself (“Madame Blavatsky”, “They're Coming to <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Away,</b> Huh Huh”). His favorite means of retribution is kicking Butt-Head in the testicles. On at least one occasion, Beavis throws the first punch. In [...] "Canoe", he initiates a fight by smacking Butt-Head across {{the head with a}} paddle (although Butt-Head goaded him into doing it). Butt-Head usually knows when Beavis is approaching his breaking point and will back off (as seen when he calls Beavis [...] "Buttknocker" [...] or insults Metallica one too many times). In [...] "Choke", he specifically states that Butt-Head is [...] "not really my friend". Nevertheless, it can be inferred that the duo are still best friends, considering their shared activities, residency, interests, and their lack of any other friends. The two usually complement each other when one makes any sort of endeavor, especially if it involves their lifelong goal to 'score with chicks'.|$|E

Having {{finished}} this piece of autobiography, he relapsed into silence, leaving Gethryn to recollect various tales he had heard of his grandfather's eccentricity.
