However, Pacific Telephone was one of the least profitable Bells due to very tough local <b>telephone</b> <b>regulations</b> in California.|$|E
40|$|First Amendment {{analysis}} has historically depended {{on whether a}} party is a speaker, an editor, or a carrier. With communications technology rapidly evolving, determining which category is appropriate becomes increasingly complex, and ascertaining the First Amendment protections that are applied to various actors {{in the process of}} diffusing ideas becomes difficult. This article looks to the historical treatment of the First Amendment rights of speakers, editors, and distributors. This article traces the Supreme Court’s treatment of speech regulations on new technologies, from telegraph and <b>telephone</b> <b>regulations</b> to the seminal Turner Broadcast System, Inc. v. FCC case that created rules for regulating speech in the cable industry. Using this historical basis, the article creates a framework for analyzing First Amendment issues and the new media technologies. Carriers that have the ability to control access to essential pathways of communications can be subject to content-neutral regulation designed to encourage carriage of a diversity of information sources. Governments, however, are not permitted to turn private carriers into authorized censors of the speakers they carry. Finally, liability rules for distributors must be sensitive to the ease with which distributors can be deterred from carrying the controversial speech of others. Carriers should only be liable if they are active participants in illegal speech or if they have been informed that an independent tribunal has determined the speech to be unprotected...|$|E

40|$|Telephone {{industry}} spokespersons in the USA {{have argued}} that, {{over the past}} 50 years, long distance has subsidized local service [...] a view which has been widely accepted. This article argues {{that the existence of}} the subsidy is a myth, and that policy decisions should not be made based on its acceptance. The author shows the flaws behind the telephone companies' characterization of the local loop as a cost entirely arising from local service, on which they base their subsidy argument. The author argues that the misconceptions about the telephone subsidy need to be rectified, {{in order to be able}} effectively to evaluate proposals for <b>telephone</b> <b>regulation.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{compliance}} audit {{carried out by}} the NCC on MTN network revealed unregistered 5.2 million customers lines were not deactivated as directed. This led to the NCC fining MTN with the sum of $1000 for each unregistered SIM according to the <b>Telephone</b> Subscribers <b>regulation</b> (TSR) law, which amounted to $5.2bn.|$|R

The commission exercised section 20(1) of the <b>Telephone</b> Subscribers <b>regulation</b> (TSR) law on MTN, leading to a calculated fine of $5.2 billion, according to the constitution.|$|R
50|$|Some of Powell's {{initiatives}} have been challenged in federal court. Notably, the FCC's BrandX cable modem service decision, which declared cable modem {{should be free}} from <b>telephone</b> service <b>regulations,</b> was overturned in the Ninth Circuit case but was reinstated by the Supreme Court. The FCC's Broadcast Flag proceeding was overturned by the D.C. Circuit Court as an inappropriate exercise of FCC jurisdiction. The FCC's Media Ownership rules were likewise blocked by federal court and the television ownership cap set directly by the U.S. Congress.|$|R

50|$|On February 1, 1960, {{the network}} was {{purchased}} by the Ivy Broadcasting Company, a corporation headed by Woody Erdman. In April 1966, Ivy sold WJIV and the other four FM stations to Chenango and Unadilla Communications, a small upstate New York telephone company. In 1968, C&U was acquired by Continental <b>Telephone,</b> however FCC <b>regulations</b> prohibited control of broadcast licenses by large phone companies - so Continental was forced to divest WJIV.|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{examine how}} {{political}} environments influence industry structure and entrepreneurial opportunities following deregulation. Though deregulation implies a removal of government control, I propose that deregulation remains {{a political process}} that is shaped by previous regulations and by the state actors responsible for implementing and overseeing deregulation. I test my claims by studying the competitive local telephone service industry, which {{was created by the}} federal Telecommunications Act of 1996. Regulators within state governments had historically played a large role in governing the industry and continued to oversee and implement the federal deregulatory policy. I studied the growth of competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) at two different levels of analysis: the state and the firm. At the state-level, I examined CLEC founding rates between 1997 and 2006. I find that states with more experience with incentive-based regulation had higher founding rates and that this effect attenuated with time. Founding rates were also higher for states with new governors throughout the study and for states with new commissioners early in the study period. At the firm-level, I examined expansion decisions made by CLECs between 1997 and 2005. I find that early in the study period, CLECs were more likely to enter states that were similar to their founding state on dimensions of the political ideology of its electorate and that employed the same type of local <b>telephone</b> <b>regulation</b> in 1996. New governors and a regulatory commission with relatively recent turnover also made certain states more attractive expansion targets. Finally, states exhibited a strong tendency to grow within the boundaries of the dominant incumbent carriers’ territories. In many respects, this effect was as strong as the effect of adjacency. Thus, even after one policy has been preempted by a second policy, effects from the first policy remain. Together, the studies support my argument that a state’s current policy is built upon its previous policies and that changes in political leadership can serve as punctuating moments that stimulate competition and industry development. This dissertation provides a basis upon which future research on the relationship between political environments and entrepreneurship can build...|$|R
50|$|In the {{environment}} of convergent network, specific services with certain network technologies will receive different regulatory treatments. The 1996 Act created distinct regulatory categories for services that are provided by different network technologies. Besides the existing regulation framework for regulating telecommunications services and cable services in another title, the 1996 Act defines a category of services, “information services,” that distinguished from “telecommunications services” and was not subject to either <b>telephone</b> or cable <b>regulation.</b> “Information services” are consisted of the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications. For instance, voice and video services that are provided using Internet protocol technology may be classified as “information services” and therefore not subject to traditional voice or video regulation.|$|R
50|$|The cable {{television}} market {{used to be}} almost monopolized by satellite TV provider SKY Brasil and cable TV provider NET, both of them partially owned by Organizações Globo. However, in 2010, Globo sold 19% of its shares in SKY to the DirecTV Group, making Globo owner of only 7% of SKY shares. In the same year, Embratel made an offer to buy all of Globo's shares in NET for R$4.58 billion, even though Embratel has to wait the approval of Bill N° 119, that will allow companies from countries other than Brazil to own cable operations. Since 2006, large national and international phone operators, such as Embratel, Telefónica, and Oi, began to enter the market. Due to cable <b>regulations,</b> <b>telephone</b> companies are using DTH rather than IPTV to launch their TV operations. In 2010's third trimestrer, the market share of cable companies was: NET with 44,8%, SKY with 25,7%, Via Embratel with 9,8%, Telefónica TV Digital with 5,1%, OiTV with 3,1%, Abril (TVA) with 1,8% and smaller companies with 9,6% of the market.|$|R

For practical and efficiency reasons, it was innovatively decided to integrate non-urgent calls (1733) within the existing medical dispatching protocols of the emergency call center (112). The Working Group developed integrated 112 - 1733 triage protocols in which the General Practitioner becomes a fourth official regulation vector in addition to the Mobile Emergency Team, the Paramedical Intervention Team and the Ambulance. The existing Belgian Manual for Medical Regulation for urgent medical calls and 1733 Protocols for non-urgent medical calls were consulted as well as the Dutch Triage system and the Standing Orders of the Paramedical Intervention Team.

40|$|At the 1995 AAPOR conference Battaglia et al. {{presented}} one of {{the first}} papers on the use of automated procedures to remove business and nonworking telephone numbers from random-digit-dialing samples to increase interviewer productivity {{while at the same time}} improving the resolution rate. Since then, advances have been made in methods for purging out-of-scope numbers from RDD samples. Sample purging results from the National Immunization Survey will be presented for 78 geographic areas covering the entire U. S. These sample-purging techniques set aside residential directory-listed telephone numbers on the assumption that the majority are residential numbers. The latest sample purging methods also process residential directory-listed numbers, resulting in some of these numbers being classified as out-of-scope. Based on a recent experiment, validation (false negative) results are given for this component of the sample. Another aspect of sample purging, which is of growing importance in RDD samples, is cellular <b>telephone</b> numbers. FCC <b>regulations</b> specify that cell numbers not be dialed using automated dialing devices. Cellular telephone numbers fall into three categories: 1) numbers in dedicated cellular telephone exchanges, 2) cell numbers in mixed-use exchanges, and 3) cell numbers in POTS exchanges that have been ported from land-line numbers. Procedures for identifying and removing cellular telephone numbers from RDD samples will be discussed...|$|R
5000|$|A {{monopoly}} {{is defined}} as [...] "a firm {{that is the only}} seller of a product or service having no close substitutes." [...] A natural monopoly is when the entire demand within a relevant market can be satisfied at lowest cost by one firm rather than by two or more, and if such a market contains more than one firm then the firms will [...] "quickly shake down to one through mergers or failures, or production will continue to consume more resources than necessary." [...] In a monopoly competition is said to be short-lived, and in a natural monopoly it is said to produce inefficient results." [...] Public utility companies can be regulated to prevent them from gaining monopolistic control. In November 2011 AT&T's proposal for merging with T-Mobile was rejected because it would have [...] "diminished competition," [...] and have led to the company having monopolistic power within the <b>telephone</b> industry. Such <b>regulation</b> is permitted because the telephone industry is a public utility. Similarly, Microsoft has also been prevented from taking various business actions that could result in the company gaining monopolistic power. [...] If social media were a public utility then regulations of Google and Facebook would similarly dictate what they could and could not do.|$|R
