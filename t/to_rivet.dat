5|$|Learning that James {{seeks to}} revive the project and {{continue}} his work by acquiring a Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), the Lone Wanderer soon tracks him down to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Stanislaus Braun, whom James had sought out for information on a G.E.C.K.. Reunited with their father, the pair soon return <b>to</b> <b>Rivet</b> City and recruit Li and the other project members to resume work at the Jefferson Memorial. Just as they begin testing the project, the Memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from {{the remnants of the}} pre-War United States government, which continues to remain active despite the demise of their brethren on the West Coast thirty years previously (see Fallout 2). Seeking to stop them gaining control of his work, James urges the Lone Wanderer to finish his work and find a G.E.C.K. before flooding the project's control room with massive amounts of radiation, preventing the Enclave's military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it and killing himself in the process, though Autumn survives. Taking the remaining project members to safety, the Lone Wanderer makes contact with the Brotherhood of Steel within the ruins of the Pentagon, now known as the Citadel. With their help, the Lone Wanderer travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K., which had been used as a testing site for the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV) and now as a breeding ground for the Super Mutants. The Lone Wanderer recovers the G.E.C.K. from within the Vault. But as they make their way out, the Wanderer is ambushed by Colonel Autumn and the Enclave and is captured.|$|E

Speeches were delivered at the Spottswood House, at the Dispatch corner, {{in front of the}} Enquirer office, at the Exchange Hotel, and other places. Bonfires were lighted at nearly every corner of every principal street in the city, and the light of beacon fires could be seen burning on Union and Church Hills. The effect of the illumination was grand and imposing. The triumph of truth and justice over wrong and attempted insult was never more heartily appreciated by a spontaneous uprising of the people.

2500|$|The {{original}} towers for the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge featured four deep, box-shaped struts (two {{below the}} roadway and two above), {{as well as}} being tapered from being [...] wide at the base to [...] at the top. The new towers of the replacement span were to be the same width both at the bottom and the top, and were to feature a deep X-bracing system with three -deep single X-brace struts below the road deck and a series of three double-X brace struts of varying depths above the roadway (top being , middle being , and the bottom being [...] ). Tower construction began January 1, 1949, and progressed rapidly. Work went ahead of schedule and by April 1949, the [...] steel cable saddles were prepared for lifting. On April 13, 1949, the north cable saddle on the east tower was bolted into place on a set of shims to allow workers <b>to</b> <b>rivet</b> the top plate into place. Then, disaster struck. That morning, an earthquake measuring 7.1 rattled the Puget Sound region. The earthquake caused the towers to sway [...] from vertical, causing the cable saddle to shear its bolts and fall off the tower [...] The saddle fell [...] below. It missed the pedestal, and plunged straight through a barge, to a final resting spot [...] {{below the surface of the}} Narrows, [...] away from the pedestal. The resulting impact sank the barge, taking a compressor and numerous other tools with it. Divers soon located the cable saddle in a deep hole during a slack tide (the only time divers could operate, and slack tides only occurred at night). After a three-day delay, it was raised to the surface, repaired (the impact bent a corner on it), and reinstalled. The earthquake delayed completion of both the east and west towers on the bridge. After the earthquake's aftershocks subsided, work resumed, and by July 17 both towers were announced as being completed.|$|E
40|$|The N. A. C. A. has {{conducted}} tests {{to provide more}} complete data than were previously available for estimating the effects of common surface irregularities on wing drag. The irregularities investigated included: brazier-head and countersunk rivets, spot welds, several types of sheet-metal joints, and surface roughness. Tests were also conducted to determine the over-all effect of manufacturing irregularities incidental <b>to</b> <b>riveted</b> aluminum alloy and to spot-welded stainless-steel construction. The tests {{were made in the}} 8 -foot high speed wind tunnel at Reynolds Numbers up to 18, 000, 000. The results show that any of the surface irregularities investigated may increase wing drag enough to have important adverse effects on high-speed performance and economy. A method of estimating increases in wing drag caused by brazier-head rivets and lapped joints under conditions outside the range of the tests is suggested.

2500|$|LMS {{advised a}} return <b>to</b> <b>riveted</b> {{construction}} due <b>to</b> doubts about its strength, {{and rather than}} risk delays {{due to a lack}} of welders, this was accepted. The welded design used two layers of armour plate, the inner being of steel that would weld readily without losing its properties. This two-plate system was retained when the design reverted <b>to</b> <b>riveted</b> construction. The use of riveted construction, the use of steel wheels instead of the intended aluminium and an increase in armour specification to [...] at the front of hull and turret increased the weight to a level where the tank suspension was at maximum load, leaving no room for later development of the design.|$|R
