5|$|After {{becoming}} {{familiar with}} their new shadows, the party travels to Talta village, befriending Marumaro on the way, who also possesses a magical shadow. Finding that <b>the</b> <b>villagers</b> from Talta have started to head towards {{the capital city of}} Jibral, the party takes off after them. Just outside Jibral, the party finds <b>the</b> <b>villagers</b> attacked by Steel-Eating Tigers. They are saved by the arrival of King Jibral and his forces, including Zola. Once <b>the</b> <b>villagers</b> are brought to Jibral, the King decides to implement a plan to destroy one of Nene's bases near Jibral using Shu and his friends along with Zola. Together, the party works with the warriors of Talta Village the Jibral Kingdom to besiege Nene's Mechat base. After the base is destroyed, the party heads north in search of Nene.

5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it.

A different version places the cherry tree {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled <b>the</b> <b>villagers</b> to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E

5|$|Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother! (often {{referred}} to simply as Happy Brothers) is an 1887 oil painting by the Serbian artist Uroš Predić. It shows four intoxicated youths walking through their village whilst {{the mother of}} one shouts her disapproval from the distance. The painting {{is said to have been}} inspired by a frequent sight in Predić's home village of Orlovat—that of drunken youths returning from the pub at dawn. Predić painted the composition hoping it would persuade <b>the</b> <b>villagers</b> to change their ways.
