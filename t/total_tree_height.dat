50|$|If {{the tree}} extends below eye level {{the same process}} is used to {{determine}} the length below eye level and that is added to height above eye level to determine <b>total</b> <b>tree</b> <b>height.</b> Different clinometers have different reading scales, but all apply the same function. Calculations are as above if it reads in degrees. If it has a percentage scale, then the percentage is multiplied by the distance to the tree to determine a height or extension above and below eye level. Others have a 66’ scale where if used at a distance of 66 feet from the tree the height above or below eye level can be directly read from the scale. Errors frequently accompany this type of measuring. The process assumes that the top of the tree is directly over the base of the tree. The tree top may be offset significantly from a point directly over the base (or level point on the trunk). Typical errors from this effect are often on the order of 10 to 20 feet. A bigger problem is misidentifying a forward leaning branch for the actual top of the tree. Errors associated with this mistake may yield measurements that are off many tens of feet and some errors of over forty feet and more have made it onto various champion tree lists, and in at least two cases, the errors have exceeded 60 feet.|$|E

30|$|<b>Total</b> <b>tree</b> <b>height</b> was {{generally}} not measured in these studies, which has presented some problems in previous analyses (e.g., Moore et al. 2014; Watt and Zoric 2010). However, {{it was possible to}} predict the total height of trees in many studies using the relationship between disc diameter and height up the stem at which the disc was sampled. For each tree, separate quadratic regression models were fitted to predict disc diameter as a function of height up the stem, and <b>total</b> <b>tree</b> <b>height</b> was then predicted by extrapolating these models to a diameter of zero. To ensure this procedure provided reliable predictions of tree height, the models were only fitted using discs cut at greater than 5 -m height, as above this height, stem taper was found to be adequately approximated by a quadratic model. Furthermore, predictions were only made when the diameter of the uppermost disc was less than 200  mm and where the uppermost disc was sampled from at least 70  % of the predicted <b>total</b> <b>tree</b> <b>height.</b> This procedure made it possible to estimate <b>total</b> <b>tree</b> <b>height</b> at 150 of the 219 sites where disc samples had been collected at multiple heights up the stem.

Traditional Swedish forestry practices include planting trees at evenly spaced rectangularities {{in order to}} maximize nutrient and light availability to individual trees, minimize branch diameter, and to encourage good stem form. In 1982, a study using Lodgepole pine was established to evaluate any differences in growth characteristics between planting rectangularities. This research study is a completely randomized block design rectangularity study where lodgepole pine was planted in three replications at five different rectangularities (0. 8 x 5 m, 1 x 4 m, 1. 33 x 3 m, 1. 46 x 1. 46 x 4 m, and 2 x 2 m) all at the same planting density of 2500 trees/hectare. At age 29, final harvest candidate trees were chosen in each rectangularity treatment, individual trees were divided into two competitive sectors relative to each dimension of the rectangularity, and growth differences were evaluated. Straightness and quality were positively correlated with each other in all rectangularities.

Missing <b>total</b> <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> {{at the start of}} each plot specific simulation run were predicted using Eq. [1], while subsequent height growth was predicted with Eq. [4]. Due to its importance on long–term simulations, the prediction of tree mortality was handled in two ways, namely an expansion factor method and a fixed cutpoint (Weiskittel et al. 2011 a). In the expansion factor method, the tree’s expansion factor was annually multiplied by the probability of survival (Eq. [5]), while in the fixed cutpoint method an entire tree record was killed if the probability of survival exceeded the optimal cutpoint derived from the species specific survival equations. Plots that were harvested or showed signs of either excessive mortality (> 20 % of total basal area) or excessive ingrowth (≥ 5 trees) were included up until the occurrence of the event. MB and RMSE were computed for key stand–level attributes like stem density and basal area.

For each tree, the estimated value of total height was adjusted incrementally and the difference between the actual and predicted diameters of the discs determined.

When tested using a dataset where <b>total</b> <b>tree</b> <b>height</b> was known, this approach was able to predict tree height to within 5 % of the measured value.
