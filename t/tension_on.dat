5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; their report came out {{five years after the}} first report from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|The elytra allow beetles to both fly {{and move}} through {{confined}} spaces, doing so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before take off. The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles {{attached to the}} wing base; {{as long as the}} <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In some day-flying species (for example, Buprestidae, Scarabaeidae), flight does not include large amounts of lifting of the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins. The altitude reached by beetles in flight varies. One study investigating the flight altitude of the ladybird species Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis using radar showed that, whilst the majority in flight over a single location were at 150–195m above ground level, some reached altitudes of over 1100m.|$|E

5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> one side of the tooth and compression {{on the other side of}} the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E

25|$|Acoustically, a djembe is a Helmholtz resonator: the {{frequency}} of the bass is determined by {{the size and shape of}} the shell and independent of the amount of <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> the skin. In contrast, the pitch of tones and slaps rises as the tension of the skin is increased. The bass has a frequency of 65–80Hz. Depending on the size of the drum and the amount of <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> the skin, tone frequency varies from 300Hz to 420Hz and slap frequency from 700Hz to 1000Hz, with audible overtones reaching beyond 4kHz.|$|E

25|$|After 1967 {{tensions}} between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots subsided.

Although Makarios had effectively abandoned enosis in favour of an ‘attainable solution’, many others continued to believe that the only legitimate political aspiration for Greek Cypriots was union with Greece. Makarios was branded a traitor to the cause by Grivas and, in 1971, he made a clandestine return to the island.|$|E
25|$|The 1910 Mexican Revolution {{had raised}} {{tensions}} {{along the border}} of Texas and Mexico. Immigration into the southern US states from Mexico rose, with nearly one million Mexicans entering the United States {{at the turn of}} the century. Land redistribution efforts in Mexico made Anglo-Americans nervous about disputed land claims between the United States and Mexico. This tension, mixed with fears that Mexico would side with Germany in the first World War, created extraordinary <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> the border.|$|E
25|$|Excessive <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> the tendons, ligaments, {{and joint}} {{capsules}} of the pastern area can strain the periosteum. The body compensates by growing bone at the stresspoint.
