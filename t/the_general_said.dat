500|$|Elements of the 82nd Airborne Division {{arrived in}} New Orleans September 3. The {{flooding}} {{was a challenge}} for the paratroopers when they first arrived. The division had just four boats at the time, however, the division quickly started getting Coast Guard, Navy and Marine assets placed under their control. Army Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the 82nd's commanding general, noted: [...] "We eventually became the 82nd 'Waterborne' Division," [...] <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and that really was our forte" [...] during search-and-rescue and security missions in flooded sections of the city.|$|E
500|$|Donayre {{became the}} center of an {{international}} controversy on November 24, 2008, when Peruvian media showed a YouTube video in which <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>said</b> [...] "We are not going to let Chileans pass by (...) [...] Chilean who enters will not leave. Or will leave in a coffin. And if there aren't sufficient coffins, there will be plastic bags". The video, dated to 2006 or 2007, was recorded during a [...] party at a friend's house attended by army officials and civilians. These comments caused widespread indignation in Chile, making headlines in the El Mercurio newspaper. The Peruvian president, Alan García, called his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, to explain that these remarks did not reflect official Peruvian policy. Bachelet declared herself satisfied with the explanations.|$|E

One of <b>the</b> <b>generals</b> <b>said</b> Hope {{was a first}} rate military target since he was worth a division; that that's about 15,000 men.

2500|$|In February 1915, a small {{committee}} in Alexandria approved {{a plan of}} Zeev Jabotinsky and Joseph Trumpeldor to form a [...] military unit from Russian Jewish émigrés from Palestine that would participate in the British effort to [...] "liberate" [...] Palestine from the Ottoman Empire. The British commander General Maxwell [...] met a delegation, led by Jabotinsky, on 15 March. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>said</b> he was unable, under the Army Act, to enlist foreign nationals as fighting troops, but that he could form them into a volunteer transport Mule Corps. Jabotinsky rejected the idea and left for Europe to seek other support for a Jewish unit, but Trumpeldor accepted it and began recruiting volunteers from among the Jews in Egypt who had been deported there by the Ottomans in the previous year. The British Army formed 650 of them into the Zion Mule Corps, of which 562 served in the Gallipoli Campaign.|$|E
2500|$|On May 12, 2010, {{after three}} months in {{military}} custody, <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>said,</b> according to the BBC, that the [...] "Sunday Leader" [...] newspaper had misquoted him, that he was innocent of any attempt to incite the public, and that the case {{was part of an}} attempt to silence him. Then, while still in military custody, Fonseka seemed to downplay his earlier claim that Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had ordered the killing of Tamil Tiger rebels as they were trying to surrender in May, 2009. The BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo noted, however, that Fonseka did not make a blanket denial that no war crimes had been committed, but rather stipulated that no war crimes took place to his knowledge. Next, in a June 7, 2010 interview with the BBC's Hard Talk programme Defence Secretary Rajapaksa threatened to execute Fonseka if he testified at an independent war crimes investigation, stating [...] "He can't do that..That is a treason. We will hang him if he do that." [...] The next day, June 8, 2010, General Fonseka denied having told lies or having committing treason when speaking of the possibility of war crimes being committed during fighting against Tamil Tiger rebels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{court martial}} {{was told that}} Dorothy Smith had {{undergone}} two months' treatment [...] for mental illness in 1951, and had attempted suicide while on the ship to Japan the year before. Her personal physician, Brigadier General Rawley E. Chambers, told the court that Dorothy Smith was subject to [...] "neurotic explosions," [...] that she had slashed her wrists a number of times, and that she once had assaulted another Army wife. [...] "I believe {{she would be able}} to tell right from wrong," [...] <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "But I do not believe that she had any ability to adhere to the right." [...] By six votes to three, the court martial found Dorothy Smith guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced her [...] "to be confined at hard labor for the rest of her natural life". A unanimous verdict of guilty would have meant a mandatory death sentence. The case was reviewed by Brigadier General Onslow S. Rolfe, the commanding officer of the Headquarters and Service Command of the Far East Command, and the Judge Advocate General. That he was junior in rank to Sullivan meant that his ability to overrule the former was constrained. [...] Meanwhile, Dorothy Smith was flown back to the United States in a Military Air Transport Service plane, which reached Travis Air Force Base near San Francisco on 25 February 1953. She was held at the Presidio of San Francisco, and then imprisoned at the Federal Prison Camp, Alderson, in West Virginia.|$|E
