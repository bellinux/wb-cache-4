5|$|In the 1950s, the Denver & Rio Grande Western {{began to}} phase out steam {{locomotives}} in favor of diesel locomotives, which require less maintenance. With the change in technology, Thistle faded in importance. Gradually the town shrank in population; the passenger depot was <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> in 1972 and the post office closed in 1974. By 1983, only a few families remained in Thistle.|$|E
5|$|Melody {{manages to}} grab the trident and returns it to King Triton, who then punishes Morgana by sending her {{to the bottom of}} the ocean frozen in a block of ice. Triton returns Ariel to human form, the wall {{separating}} Eric's castle from the sea is <b>torn</b> <b>down,</b> and contact between humans and merfolk is restored.|$|E
5|$|The Little Shop of Horrors was {{developed}} when director Roger Corman was given temporary access to sets {{that had been}} left standing from his previous film, A Bucket of Blood. Corman decided to use the sets in a film made in the last two days before the sets were <b>torn</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) is {{assisting}} the coroner's office in investigating the two deaths. Once completed, the OPP could launch a criminal investigation, if warranted. The Ministry of Labour {{will have an}} engineer examine for further structural problems, and thus whether the mall needs to be <b>torn</b> <b>down.</b> Investigating {{the cause of the}} collapse is the city's responsibility.|$|E
5|$|The early teams ran at Kincaid Field, {{constructed}} in 1902 as an athletic field.

Kincaid field was <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> in 1922.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Kona Lanes was a {{repeated}} topic at political events. One Costa Mesa city council candidate said {{he made a}} commitment to public service when the building was <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> with little resistance. Another would-be council member agreed that the demolition should never have happened.|$|E
5|$|When {{teaching}} {{was transferred to}} the Westholme site in 1984, the original schoolhouse was demolished.

5|$|After the Six-Day War, Jerusalem's {{municipal}} borders were {{expanded to}} include the Old City and beyond. Barricades that had lined the border were <b>torn</b> <b>down.</b> Many buildings on Mamilla's eastern end were in shambles from the fighting and lack of maintenance. Several historic buildings were condemned. One was the Stern House, which housed Zionist leader Theodor Herzl on his 1898 visit. However, popular outcry brought Supreme Court involvement {{which led to the}} temporary dismantling and reassembly nearby of this historical landmark.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire of the Palace of Whitehall in 1698, the surroundings of the Privy Garden changed dramatically. Most {{of the palace}} buildings had been burned down in the 1698 fire; others were <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> as {{the last vestiges of}} the old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With the demise of the Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the muddy}} subsoil of the site, {{work on the}} {{foundation}} continued past {{the work on the}} walls to 1581. In 1585, work on the first of the cathedral's chapels began and by 1615, the cathedral's walls reached to about half of their final height. Construction of the interior of the current cathedral began in 1623 and what is now the vestry was where Mass was conducted after the first church was finally <b>torn</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the renovation, {{walls and}} {{coverings}} were stripped away to reveal 1950s features. Drywall {{was removed from}} guest room walls to highlight the original masonry bricks.

Concrete columns in the lobby were stripped of mirrors added by Ramada so as to show their original design.|$|E
5|$|Few {{buildings}} are {{left on the}} north side of the highway. The most notable are the wooden Southern Pacific saltbox-style section house and workers' bunkhouse, both built in 1887.

5|$|He {{lived on}} for four more years, {{spending}} {{his days in}} his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, his damnatio memoriae. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed suicide. He died on 3 December 312.|$|E
5|$|In April 2002, Specht Properties was {{selected}} as the developer of the project after scoring higher with the council appointed committee formed to rate each of three developer's proposals, with Gerding/Edlen Development and Trammell Crow Company losing out to Specht. Construction on the complex began in June 2003 when an old grain store at the site was demolished {{to make room for the}} center. A total of eight buildings were <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> to make room the complex as part of a redevelopment of a brownfield site.|$|E
5|$|Like much of British post-war planning, {{regeneration}} of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by large, cheap tower blocks, brutalist architecture {{and expansion of}} roads. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversed, with the closure of some main roads and the regeneration of the Broadmead shopping centre. In 2006 {{one of the city}} centre's tallest post-war blocks was <b>torn</b> <b>down.</b> Social housing tower blocks have also been demolished to be replaced by low rise homes.|$|E

5|$|The Jews of the Papal States, {{numbering}} 15,000 {{or so in}} 1858, were {{grateful to}} Pope Pius IX because he had ended the long-standing legal obligation for them to attend sermons in church four times a year, based on that week's Torah portion and aimed at their conversion to Christianity. He had also <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> {{the gates of the}} Roman Ghetto despite the objections of many Christians. However, Jews remained under many restrictions and the vast majority still lived in the ghetto.|$|E
5|$|The North Mountain House was {{threatened}} by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss {{of much of the}} surrounding old-growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the village of Ricketts. The wooden addition to the stone house was <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> in either 1897 or 1903, and the land became a garden. The hotel closed in November 1903, and the fishing club and passenger train service ended with the closure.|$|E
5|$|The Sankt Laurentii Church Tower is {{all that}} remains of the Romanesque Sankt Laurentii Church, built of {{travertine}} in the 13th century. It was <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> after the Reformation leaving only the tower which was built {{at the beginning of the}} 16th century and now forms part of the former town hall on Stændertorvet. It contains a museum where archaeological finds from 1998 can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The border fortifications were {{progressively}} <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> {{and eventually}} {{abandoned in the}} months following its opening. Dozens of new crossings were opened by February 1990, and the guards no longer carried weapons nor made much effort to check travellers' passports. The guards' numbers were rapidly reduced; half were dismissed within five months of the opening. On 1July 1990 the border was abandoned and the Grenztruppen were officially abolished; all but 2,000 of them were dismissed or transferred to other jobs.|$|E
5|$|The {{house that}} once stood at 3448 Pinkney Street in North Omaha, Nebraska, {{was the first}} home of Malcolm Little with his birth family. The house was <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> in 1965 by new owners {{who did not know}} of its {{connection}} with MalcolmX. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and is now identified by a historic marker. In 1987 the site was added to the Nebraska register of historic sites and marked with a state plaque.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{transfer}} from the Coney Island Terminal to the Norton's Point Trolley to Sea Gate, via an elevated footbridge across Stillwell Avenue to the elevated trolley station. In 1948, the trolley was discontinued because it duplicated another trolley along a similar route (namely the McDonald Avenue Line). The trolley ramp spanning Stillwell Avenue and West 15th Street was <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> around this time.|$|E
5|$|When the New Jersey Department of Transportation started {{construction}} on upgrading the bypass, the fly-over ramp and on-ramp {{to and from}} Route172 were <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> for {{construction of a new}} interchange along a new local/express format. The overpass was closed on October 12, 2007 to begin the construction. The bridge was built by 1955 and was replaced in 2008. On January 2, 2009, the new exit ramp for Route18 to Route172 was reopened to traffic.|$|E
5|$|Brian Tierney is {{the fourth}} of five sons of James and Claire Tierney. Growing up in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, he {{attended}} Waldron Mercy Academy and later The Episcopal Academy. When he was seven, {{his family moved to}} Springfield Township, Pennsylvania. In 1975, at the age of eighteen, Tierney unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for township commissioner of Springfield. During the campaign supporters of his opponent in the Democratic primary had <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> his campaign posters and stole other campaign items. Tierney became a Republican after the primary when a few Republicans who said they would look out for his stuff during his primary campaign, invited him to a party meeting.|$|E
5|$|In 1745, Crossford Bridge– which dated back to {{at least}} 1367– was <b>torn</b> <b>down.</b> It {{was one of a}} series of bridges {{crossing}} the River Mersey destroyed by order of the government, to slow the advance of Jacobite forces during the Jacobite rising. The Jacobites repaired the bridge upon reaching Manchester, and used it to send a small force into Sale and Altrincham. Their intention was to deceive the authorities into believing that the Jacobites were heading for Chester. The feint was successful and the main Jacobite army later marched south through Cheadle and Stockport instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Sibley's parent, May Co., merged {{operations}} with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Kaufmann's. That same year, local chain AM's (Adam, Meldrum & Anderson Company) {{moved from the}} nearby Thruway Mall into the space originally planned for B. Altman. The owner of the Thruway Mall sued the AM's chain, claiming breach of contract; the chain would later be declared liable for damages to the Thruway Mall, which was subsequently <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> and rebuilt as a strip mall in the early 1990s. Finally, Hoyts sold the Walden Galleria theater complex to General Cinemas {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, opium dens {{used to be}} common in the Sungei Road area. The drugs were popular with workers looking for a cheap way to ease the {{hardship}} of the day's toil. The opium addicts were mainly poor, elderly people from working-class groups. In early 1991, a spate of fires destroyed more than 20 shophouses along Sungei Road. Most of the century-old shophouses, crumbling with age, had become potential fire hazards for its residents. The first fire incident left two people injured and 61 homeless. As a result, many of its buildings were <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> for safety reason and its inhabitants relocated in later years.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, the old shop house {{buildings}} were <b>torn</b> <b>down,</b> resulting in street peddlers displaying their wares on canvas sheets along the empty {{roads in the}} area. The peddlers did not pay rent, but the Singapore government forbade them from selling brand-new items. To {{keep up with the}} times, some of the peddlers put up their wares to sell on websites and eBay, especially those hard to sell items such as old photographs, badges, medals and other collector's items. The market remained until its final closure by the authorities on 10 July 2017.|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{analysis}} of the production of Psycho in his book Hitchcock at Work, while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably, {{the fact that the}} killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being <b>torn</b> <b>down,</b> and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for Vertigo.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{was born}} on April 23, 1977, to Reid and Nadija Mitchell. He has a sister named Chantal. His father works as a {{heavy-duty}} mechanic with Western Forest Products, while his mother is a Croatian-born immigrant {{who works as a}} terminal service agent for B.C. Ferries. Mitchell's grandfather, Les Mitchell, played amateur senior hockey and once earned a tryout with the New York Rangers during the Original Six-era. His grandfather, Les, scored the championship-winning goal for the Nanaimo Clippers in 1945. He said Les Mitchell was the last person to skate on the ice at the Civic Arena in Nanaimo before it was <b>torn</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|Opened in 1967, Wayzata Bay Center was {{constructed}} in two phases; the first phase was completed in 1964 while the second phase was completed in 1967. The mall initially featured several regional retailers, along with small businesses, but eventually made way for various national chains, including The Original Pancake House and True Value. After increasing vacancies throughout the center in the 2000s, a Minnesota construction firm purchased the center from United Properties for $16 million in 2009. Following the firm's purchase in 2011, the mall was shut and <b>torn</b> <b>down</b> {{to make way for}} a mixed-use retail and residential community center.|$|E
