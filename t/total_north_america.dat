40|$|We use the GEOS-Chem {{chemistry}} {{transport model}} {{to interpret the}} sources and sinks of CO 2 that determine variability of column-averaged volume mixing ratios (CVMRs), as observed by the SCIAMACHY satellite instrument, during the 2003 North American growing season.

However, it cannot reproduce the magnitude or variability of FSI-WFM-DOAS SCIAMACHY CVMRs. We use model tagged tracers to show that local fluxes largely determine CVMR variability over <b>North</b> <b>America,</b> with the largest individual CVMR contributions (1. 1 %) from the land biosphere. Fuel sources are relatively constant while biomass burning makes a significant contribution only during midsummer. We also show that non-local sources contribute significantly to <b>total</b> CVMRs over <b>North</b> <b>America,</b> with the boreal Asian land biosphere contributing close to 1 % in midsummer at high latitudes. We used the monthly-mean Jacobian matrix for <b>North</b> <b>America</b> to illustrate that:~ 1) North American CVMRs represent a superposition of many weak flux signatures, but differences in flux distributions should permit independent flux estimation; and 2) the atmospheric e-folding lifetimes {{for many of these}} flux signatures are 3 – 4 months, beyond which time they are too well-mixed to interpret.
