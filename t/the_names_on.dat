5|$|By {{the start}} of the 21st century it became evident that the soft stone of the Cenotaph was deteriorating badly as a result of water damage and frost. Recutting <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> the {{monument}} was discounted as a solution due to the long term damage this repeated work would cause to the Cenotaph's structure: {{the decision was made to}} expand the war memorial instead. A glass wall consisting of eight large panels 2.85m (9ft) by 1.2m (4ft) in size, was built alongside the Cenotaph at a cost of £130,000. The panels were engraved with the names of the World War I casualties and, in addition, those from Southampton who had died in later conflicts. The Memorial Wall included a total of 2,368 names from the First World War, 927 from the Second World War and three from subsequent conflicts. This addition to the Cenotaph was opened on 11 December 2011.|$|E
5|$|Each stop usually {{controls}} one rank of pipes, although mixtures and undulating stops (such as the Voix céleste) control multiple ranks. The name of {{the stop}} reflects not only the stop's timbre and construction, but also {{the style of the}} organ in which it resides. For example, <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> an organ built in the north German Baroque style generally will be derived from the German language, while the names of similar stops on an organ in the French Romantic style will usually be French. Most countries tend to use only their own languages for stop nomenclature. English-speaking nations as well as Japan are more receptive to foreign nomenclature. Stop names are not standardized: two otherwise identical stops from different organs may have different names.|$|E

25|$|The NFL adopted {{some of the}} {{innovations}} introduced by the AFL immediately {{and a few others}} in the years following the merger. One was including <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> player jerseys. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks {{to keep track of the}} official game time, instead of just having a stopwatch used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it. The AFL also introduced the two-point conversion to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the AFL than like the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the Super Bowl, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.|$|E

The 12 disciples might have represented the twelve original tribes of Israel, which would be restored once God's rule was instituted. The disciples were reportedly meant to be the rulers of the tribes in the coming Kingdom (Matthew 19:28, Luke 22:30). According to Bart Ehrman, Jesus' promise that the Twelve would rule is historical, because the Twelve included Judas Iscariot. In Ehrman's view, no Christians would have invented a line from Jesus, promising rulership to the disciple who betrayed him.|$|E
