25|$|The city of Pécs {{is located}} {{near to the}} border of Croatia. Its {{southern}} part is rather plain whereas its northern part belongs to slope of the Mecsek mountain. It has a very favorable climate by the border of a still flourishing woody area.

25|$|Experts soon {{agreed that}} the cause was a {{hydrogen}} explosion. Almost certainly the hydrogen was formed inside the reactor vessel because of falling water levels exposing zircaloy structures/fuel assembly cladding, which then reacted with steam and produced hydrogen, with the hydrogen subsequently vented into the containment building. When the hydrogen reached ignition concentration in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary containment building, an ignition source such as a spark triggered a hydrogen-oxygen explosion, blowing out the walls of this building from the inside.|$|E
25|$|On 20 November 1970, the two Warning Stars, {{using the}} call signs Frog 01 and Frog 02 respectively, took off ten minutes apart at 22:00 from Korat to take {{station at the}} low {{altitude}} Alpha orbit over the Gulf of Tonkin, with Frog 02 as a backup standby. The 17-man crews were advised in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature of the rescue mission and their role, providing MiG warning and directing Air Force F-4 Phantom CAP intercepts. As Frog 01 began its climb to the higher Bravo orbit, it experienced a ruptured oil line that forced the shutdown of one engine. As planned, Frog 02 became the primary aircraft when Frog 01 made an emergency landing at Danang.|$|E

500|$|The precise date of {{composition}} for this cantata is unknown, {{but it is}} {{generally considered to be}} an early work. The English Bach scholar Richard Jones notes that [...] "although it survives only in a later manuscript copy", its stylistic features are evidence of an earlier date: its text comprises [...] "selected psalm verses only, without any free madrigalian verse", it has no recitative, and the compositional approach [...] "still breathes <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth century".|$|E
500|$|The Christmas Day episodes, {{written by}} Simon Ashdown, {{drew on the}} show's early history to mark the {{occasion}} of Pauline's exit, which was particularly emphasised {{by the use of}} flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family. The critic for The Times, Tim Teeman, commented that [...] "Wendy Richard as Pauline had <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl." [...] In addition, her parting scene with the other EastEnders long-serving [...] "grand dame" [...] Dot Cotton (played by June Brown) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: [...] "The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot... Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{described}} as a [...] "brave livlylike [...] boy", Gloucester became ill with convulsions when he was three weeks old, so his mother moved him into Craven House, Kensington, hoping that the air from the surrounding gravel pits would have a beneficial effect on his health. His convulsions were possibly symptomatic of meningitis, likely contracted at birth and which resulted in hydrocephalus. As was usual among royalty, Gloucester {{was placed in the}} care of a governess, Lady Fitzhardinge, and was suckled by a wet nurse, Mrs. Pack, rather than his mother. As part of his treatment, Gloucester was driven outside every day in a small open carriage, pulled by Shetland ponies, to maximise his exposure to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravel pits. When the effectiveness of this treatment exceeded their expectations, Princess Anne and her husband acquired a permanent residence in the area, Campden House, a Jacobean mansion, in 1690. It was here that Gloucester befriended Welsh body-servant Jenkin Lewis, whose memoir of his master is an important source for historians.|$|E

2500|$|Deane further {{wrote that}} [...] "the evil effects of {{asbestos}} dust have also instigated a microscopic {{examination of the}} mineral dust by HM Medical Inspector.

2500|$|A new tragic {{experience}} persuaded me {{that air}} could also carry decaying organic matter. In November {{of the same}} year, an individual was admitted with a discharging carious left knee. [...] the ichorous exhalations of the carious knee completely saturated the air of her ward. In this way the other patients were exposed and nearly all the patients in that room died. [...] The ichorous particles that saturated <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maternity ward penetrated the uteruses already lacerated in the birth process. The particles were resorbed, and childbed fever resulted.|$|E

2500|$|In 1914, Efron {{volunteered for}} the front and by 1917 he was an officer {{stationed}} in Moscow with the 56th Reserve. Tsvetaeva was a close witness of the Russian Revolution, which she rejected. On trains, she {{came into contact with}} ordinary Russian people and was shocked by the mood of anger and violence. She wrote in her journal: [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compartment hung only three axe-like words: bourgeois, Junkers, leeches." [...] After the 1917 Revolution, Efron joined the White Army, and Marina returned to Moscow hoping to be reunited with her husband. She was trapped in Moscow for five years, where there was a terrible famine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{manufacture}} of asbestos products {{began on the}} site in 1879, and by 1970 the factory had an annual output of 2,250,000 yards of asbestos cloth and [...] of asbestos yarn. The dangerous nature of asbestos fibres had first been suspected in 1898, when Factory Inspector Lucy Deane reported: [...] "The evil effects of asbestos dust have also instigated a microscopic examination of the mineral dust by HM Medical Inspector [...] Clearly revealed was the sharp glass-like jagged nature of the particles, {{and where they are}} allowed to rise and to remain suspended in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room in any quantity, the effects {{have been found to be}} injurious as might have been expected." [...] In 1924 a 33-year-old Turner's employee, Nellie Kershaw, became the first officially recognised victim of asbestosis but the firm refused to accept responsibility for her death, saying it would [...] "create a precedent". Her family received no compensation, and she was buried in a pauper's grave in Rochdale.|$|E
2500|$|So in {{love with}} praise, both popular and in the highest circles, is Wilberforce, observes Hazlitt, that he was even half {{inclined}} {{to give up his}} favorite cause, abolition of the slave trade, when William Pitt, the Prime Minister, was set to abandon it, and he sided with Pitt in approval of the repressive measures then imposed by the government in Britain and the government's later severe measures during the period of the Napoleonic Wars and afterward. [...] "He has no mercy on those who claim a property in negro-slaves as so much live-stock on their estates ... but not a word has he to say, not a whisper does he breathe against the claim set up by the Despots of the Earth over their Continental subjects, but does every thing in his power to confirm and sanction it! He must give no offence. ... He preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages; and tolerates its worst abuses in civilized states." [...] To [...] "render signal services to mankind" [...] requires greater moral strength than Wilberforce possesses: what is needed is [...] "a severity, a sternness, a self-denial, and a painful sense of duty" [...] that in Wilberforce's case vanish in exchange for a nod of approval from the king or the Prime Minister. Even in Wilberforce's acts of independence from his party's political standpoint, Hazlitt notes a subtle balancing of motives. In the words of Wilberforce biographer William Hague, who quotes Hazlitt's Spirit of the Age criticism, [...] "Hazlitt considered that Wilberforce meant well, but would never risk becoming unpopular with the ruling establishment: 'He ... reaps the credit of independence without the obloquy ... He has all <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most perfect independence, and gains a character for impartiality and candour, when he is only striking a balance between the éclat of differing from a Minister on some vantage ground, and the risk or odium that may attend it.|$|E
