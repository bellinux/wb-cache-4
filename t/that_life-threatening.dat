Recently we experienced a case of a 56 -year-old woman with breast cancer who developed severe hyponatremia with generalized seizure after the first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Her laboratory test showed a serum sodium of 116 mmol/L. Her hyponatremia was initially treated with hypertonic saline solution and furosemide. She completely recovered without neurological deficits after slow correction of the serum sodium concentration over two days.

40|$|Despite {{continuous}} {{improvements in}} the catheter-basedtreatment of coronary artery disease (CAD), our field continues to struggle with the concept that percutaneous intervention may not prevent myocardial infarction or death in the stable patient. The main reason behind this controver-sial but rather accepted statement is <b>that</b> <b>life-threatening</b> coronary events arise most frequently from lesions that escape proper diagnosis and treatment. As a result, our efforts in clinical practice are almost totally consumed by the treatment of lesions that have limited impact on {{the natural history of}} atherothrombosis and CAD. Thus, it is imperative to reflect on this paradox, and do something about it. One way to start is to implement some of the knowledge we have acquired pertaining to our understanding of plaque rupture and thrombosis. We all agree that atherothrombosis evolves from nonobstructive CAD with specific plaque composi...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{colonoscopy}} {{has become}} an invaluable tool in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} diseases of the colon and rectum. Colonoscopy is still an invasive exam with several complications. The most common complications are perforation and bleeding, which occur in up to 1 % after diagnostic colonoscopy and 3 % of patients undergoing therapeutic colonoscopy. Less common complications include pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, colonic volvulus, hernia incarceration, retroperitoneal abscess and mesenteric tear. Splenic rupture is a rare and potentially lethal colonoscopic complication with less than 45 cases reported in the world. The overall incidence is 0. 004 %. Mechanisms of injury and available treatment options remain discussed. We present a case of splenic rupture after colonoscopy with polypectomy in a 73 -year-old woman managed first with nonoperative treatment and nine days later with surgical treatment. As the indications for colonoscopy expand, including the introduction of mass screening for colorectal cancer, endoscopists should be increasingly aware of <b>that</b> <b>life-threatening</b> complication after colonoscopy and know the emergency treatment...|$|E

40|$|A 37 -year-old woman {{presented}} with malaise, upper abdominal pain and fever {{seven months after}} renal transplantation. She was seronegative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and had received a kidney from a seropositive donor. She had received CMV prophylaxis (oral ganciclovir) for three months after transplantation. During this period all tests for CMV remained negative. On admission, she {{presented with}} symptoms compatible with an acute abdomen and with deterioration of renal function. On emergency laparotomy a perforation of the ileum was found. The resected specimen showed an ulcer with vasculitis {{at the site of}} perforation, with both microscopic (owl's eye inclusion bodies), as well as immunohistochemical evidence for a CMV infection. CMV can reactivate (usually in the first three months) after transplantation, sometimes resulting in serious morbidity. The use of antiviral prophylaxis during and after transplantation has certainly decreased the number and severity of CMV infections. This case illustrates <b>that</b> <b>life-threatening</b> infections such as CMV can still emerge a long time after transplantation.

40|$|Electrolyte {{disorders}} in hypothyroidism are frequently subtle and rarely observed in clinical practice. A 50 -year-old woman {{was admitted to}} the emergency room with complaints of nausea, weakness, and lethargy. Her medical history revealed total thyroidectomy two years earlier. She was commenced on L-thyroxine after the surgery. However, the patient stopped the treatment for three months. Thyroid function tests showed free T 3 0. 80 pg/ml (n: 1. 8 - 4. 2), free T 4 < 0. 20 ng/dl (n: 0. 8 - 1. 9), TSH 56. 84 microU/ml (n: 0. 4 - 4. 0). Her biochemical and laboratory investigations were normal, except for a plasma sodium value of 114 mmol/L (n: 135 - 145). Hypertonic saline treatment with L-thyroxine was immediately started. Symptomatic hyponatremia caused by hypothyroidism was the direct consequence of cessation of L-thyroxine treatment. The patient was followed up for a year and still using L-thyroxine (0. 1 mg). In conclusion, it should be kept in mind <b>that</b> <b>life-threatening</b> hyponatremia may occur in patients with total thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism; L-thyroxine should be immediately started if stopped for any reason...|$|E

It is our opinion that children with PS who develop an episode of autonomic status epilepticus and those living in remote areas with no quick access to emergency departments should be initiated on AED therapy to minimize the risk of experiencing a subsequent potentially fatal seizure. We further suggest that the use of benzodiazepines in this syndrome should only be administered during the early stage of the seizure, since administration of this class of drugs during an established autonomic status epilepticus can result in further respiratory depression...|$|E

This prediction is inferred from personal health information that is built by big data in Cloud.

40|$|Atherosclerosis {{has been}} induced {{experimentally}} in several species (1, 2). However, {{only a few}} investigators have reported <b>that</b> <b>life-threatening</b> sequelae of atherosclerosis, e. g. cardiac infarcts, have been reproduced experimentally in some individual laboratory animals (3 - 7). We {{do not know why}} experimental atherosclerosis in laboratory animals has been so rarely accompanied by severe consequences, but many laboratories are now investigating possible differences in the clotting mechanism and other factors as causal. To aid in understanding this discrepancy between the high incidence of cardiac infarcts in man and the low incidence in laboratory animals, we developed a method by which atherosclerosis and its sequelae could be produced in rats. The rat was believed to be resistant to the induction of atherosclerosis (1, 7 - 22), but recently these older concepts have been revised (23 - 27). The rat can be induced to reproduce the equivalents of almost all the major arteriopathies that occur in man (28). It does not respond to atherogenic regimes so readily as do the rabbit or the chicken, which is an advantage in that a more clear cut elaboration of th...|$|E
