25|$|Perhaps {{nothing in}} the {{exhibition}} exemplifies <b>this</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Gottfried Helnwein's 'Mickey'. His portrait of Disney's favorite mouse occupies an entire wall of the gallery; rendered from an oblique angle, his jaunty, ingenuous visage looks somehow sneaky and suspicious. His broad smile, encasing a row of gleaming teeth, seems more a snarl or leer. This is Mickey as Mr. Hyde, his hidden other self now disturbingly revealed.|$|E
25|$|There is now (~2014) a retro {{movement}} {{which is}} {{resulting in a}} slow increase in internet connected BBS and nodes. Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH are being used between systems. This means you can telnet to many BBS worldwide as cheaply as ones next door. Also Usenet and internet mail has been added, along with long file names to many newer versions of BBS software, some being free-ware, resulting in increasing use. The deaf and blind are also able to access <b>this</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> {{the internet as a}} whole as interfaces for them deal mostly with ASCII text which exists in most BBS. They find it helps them communicate without the complications of pictures and audio in their internet mail and communication in general. Nodelists are no longer declining in all cases.|$|E
500|$|Personally, Burnside {{was always}} very popular, both {{in the army and}} in politics. He made friends easily, smiled a lot, and remembered everyone's name. His {{professional}} military reputation, however, was less positive, and he was known for being obstinate, unimaginative, and unsuited, both intellectually and emotionally for high command. Grant stated that he was [...] "unfitted" [...] for the command of an army and that no one knew <b>this</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Burnside himself. Knowing his capabilities, he twice refused command of the Army of the Potomac, accepting only the third time when the courier told him that otherwise the command would go to Joseph Hooker. Jeffry D. Wert described Burnside's relief after Fredericksburg in a passage that sums up his military career: ...|$|E

500|$|The tour {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} critical acclaim. Cory Moss from MTV wrote that [...] "music {{might make the}} world go round, but costumes and theatrics make it more fun. Nobody knows <b>this</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the Material Girl." [...] Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH commented that [...] "you'd struggle {{to find a better}} show than Drowned World and you'd find it difficult to find a mainstream artist who can command near-universal respect for anything like as long as this fine lady. One could almost judge the artist by what was left out [...] she displayed that temptress quality which has beguiled us for nearly two decades and that, combined with her exquisite music, is why Madonna is so special." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote: [...] "Though her Cowgirl image is easily her least significant incarnation to date, Drowned World proves that Madonna is still unmatched in her ability to lift cultural iconography into the mainstream. [...] Those who thought Madonna hung up her handcuffs along with the notorious Sex book should look again closely. With its themes of chaos, dominance, and, ultimately, celebration, Madonna's Drowned World explores her ever-fervid intrigue with both imposed and pious restraint." ...|$|E
2500|$|Any {{attempt to}} make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain. They {{grew up in the}} U.S., their views and beliefs were formed there.

60|$|General Burnside was {{an officer}} who was {{generally}} liked and respected. He was not, however, fitted to command an army. No one knew <b>this</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> himself.
