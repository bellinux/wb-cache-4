5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules is <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the time machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E
25|$|The {{incorporation}} into domestic law of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights by the Human Rights Act 1998 has since {{had a profound}} effect on the development of the English law of confidentiality. Article 8 provides <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. In Campbell v MGN Ltd, the House of Lords held that the Daily Mirror had breached Naomi Campbell’s confidentiality rights by publishing reports and pictures of her attendance at Narcotics Anonymous meetings.|$|E
25|$|Kabbalah Centre {{teaches the}} Kabbalistic concept of Klippot. The idea is <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> {{a direct and}} clear {{connection}} to the upper metaphysical-spiritual world of the Light (Ein Sof, unbounded God), but that this channel is blocked by Klippot, restricting the spiritual energy from entering the physical body. It is through study and practice of Kabbalah teachings and Jewish law (which the Kabbalah Centre says is early Rabbinistic construction to aid in practicing Kabbalah without revealing its secrets) that one removes Klippot, and it is by violence and negative behavior that one adds Klippot.|$|E

25|$|In many congregations it is {{customary}} to {{call all}} eligible {{members of the}} congregation for an aliyah to the Torah on Simhat Torah. To accommodate this the first five aliyot are reread so <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> an opportunity to recite the blessing. To save time, some congregations call people up in groups. Others hold a series of separate minyanim for the Torah reading. In a minority of Orthodox congregations women receive aliyot in single-gender tefillah groups (prayer groups consisting only of women, who pray together), and only men are called to the Torah {{in front of the whole}} congregation.|$|E
25|$|The rule of {{fair hearing}} {{is the other}} of the two pillars of natural justice. It is {{encapsulated}} in the Latin maxim audi alteram partem, which implies <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> {{a right to be}} heard and that none ought therefore to be condemned unheard. This principle must be observed by courts, tribunals, arbitrators and all persons or bodies having the duty to act judicially, save where their application is excluded expressly or by necessary implication. The need for fair hearing is important as it forms a part of good procedure by reflecting a universal sense of fair play.|$|E
25|$|Roquentin's {{difficulties}} as {{arising from}} man's inherent existential condition. His seemingly special circumstances (returning from travel, reclusiveness), which {{goes beyond the}} mere indication of his very real depression, are supposed to induce in him (and in the reader) a state that makes one more receptive to noticing an existential situation <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has,</b> but may not be sensitive enough to let become noticeable. Roquentin undergoes a strange metaphysical experience that estranges him from the world. His problems are not merely a result of personal insanity, without larger significance. Rather, like {{the characters in the}} Dostoevsky and Rilke novels, they are victims of larger ideological, social, and existential forces that have brought them to the brink of insanity. Sartre's point in Nausea is to comment on our universal reaction to these common external problems.|$|E

25|$|After the funeral, Kōichi, Shige and Keizō leave immediately, {{with only}} Noriko not returning. After they leave, Kyōko is angry {{with them and}} voices her {{complaints}} to Noriko about her siblings by deriding them over being selfish to their family. She believes that Kōichi, Shige and Keizō don't care {{how hard it was}} for their father when he lost their mother. Kyōko believes that strangers and even Noriko would've been more respectful towards her. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyoko's disappointment with her siblings, she also explains <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> their own life to lead and that the drift between parents and children is inevitable. She convinces Kyoko not to be too harsh on her siblings because one day she too will understand how hard it is for them to have to take time from both their families and their own lives.|$|E

Goethe wanted to love and complained that he couldn’t be loved, but everyone else could be loved. But he wished, he didn’t have an expectancy to work his will to love. Kierkegaard responds to him in this way: ...|$|E
500|$|In the Catholic Herald, Alexander Lucie-Smith wrote <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> Widmerpools {{in their}} lives; these are usually [...] "impenetrable egomaniacs... who have {{nevertheless}} carried all before them".

One might point out that our current Prime Minister [...] has certain shades of Widmerpool, and like him, went to Eton".|$|E
500|$|The film's most-quoted line of dialogue, {{spoken by}} Octave, is [...] "You see, in this world, {{there is one}} awful thing, and that is <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> his reasons." [...] Renoir's {{sentiment}} of objective humanism for the film's characters is articulated by Octave's remark and shows his empathy for the people he was simultaneously criticizing. Richard Roud praised Renoir's role in the film, observing that Renoir's honesty compelled him to include his own role in his social criticism: [...] "he {{did not wish to}} stand outside. And Renoir/Octave serves as the standard against which reality and fiction can be measured." [...] In his original outline for the film, Renoir said he intended all the characters to be sincere and that the film would have no villains.|$|E

500|$|Jackson began {{suffering}} from severe depression and anxiety, leading her to chronicle {{the experience in}} her sixth album, The Velvet Rope, released October 1997. Jackson returned with {{a dramatic change in}} image, boasting vibrant red hair, nasal piercings, and tattoos. The album is primarily centered on the idea <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> an intrinsic need to belong. Aside from encompassing lyrics relating to social issues such as same-sex relationships, homophobia and domestic violence, it also contains themes of sadomasochism and is considered far more sexually explicit in nature than her previous release, Janet. The record was hailed as [...] "her most daring, elaborate and accomplished album" [...] by The New York Times, while Billboard ranked it as [...] "the best American album of the year and the most empowering of her last five." [...] The album debuted at number one on the Billboard200 and was certified triple platinum, selling over ten million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Marge {{begins to}} train for the event, {{practicing}} rhythmic gymnastics. However, the family believes that her methods are unsuitable for the extreme task at hand and get her professional help. She learns boxing from Dredrick Tatum, wrestling from former Yale wrestler Mr. Burns, jujitsu and Judo from Akira, and bullying from Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney. Now fully trained, she enters the ring (after the announcer introduces her {{as one of his}} [...] "Moms I'd Like to Fight") with Englebrit and is immediately knocked to the ground. Bart wants to stand up for his mother and runs into the stadium to take her place, but is thoroughly thrashed by Englebrit. Marge witnesses this and effectively beats Englebrit, winning their bet. Marge pulls down the ring's microphone and begins to give a speech about the demise of the violent sport. She realizes, however, <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> already left the building to watch a drunken brawl in the parking lot.|$|E

[...] "When you get into the studio, everything just comes out," [...] she said. [...] "All your creative juices are there. I don't [...] leave. I'll still be in there until all hours, and it's {{nice to be able to}} do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going on , and I think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use <b>that.</b> <b>Everyone</b> <b>has</b> their own thing, and I use writing." [...] Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the pop rock album features a darker theme when compared to Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004).|$|E

500|$|Kierkegaard’s {{discourse}} {{has to do}} {{with the}} difference between wishing and willing in the development of a particular expectancy. [...] "As thought becomes more absorbed in the future, it loses its way in its restless attempt to force or entice an explanation from the riddle." [...] Expectancy always looks to the future and can hope, but regret, which is what Goethe did in his book The Sorrows of Young Werther, closes the door of hope and love becomes unhappy. Kierkegaard points to [...] "faith as the highest" [...] expectancy because faith is something <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has,</b> or can have. He says: [...] "The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him but is that by which he is like him; that by which he possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all." ...|$|E
500|$|On 30 January 1972 Lee's first wife, Gladys Merredew, {{died in a}} fire {{at their}} seventeenth-century home in Oare, Kent which also left Lee hospitalised. According to actor Jack Warner, [...] "Bernard and Gladys had a lovely seventeenth-century cottage in the Kent village of Oare, {{and it was there}} she died tragically in a fire early in 1972. Bernard and Gladys were trapped in their bedroom when the fire started on the ground floor. Bernard escaped through a window and ran to get a ladder in an attempt to rescue Gladys, but unhappily was unsuccessful. It was an awful end to a long and happy marriage." [...] In February 1972 Lee was mugged and robbed by two youths. After the mugging and fire, Lee turned to drink, [...] By chance Lee met Richard Burton in a pub, who, upon hearing of Lee's problems, gave him a cheque for $6,000 {{together}} with a note saying <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> a spot of trouble once in a while. Burton's gift assisted Lee in overcoming his depression. In 1975 both Lee and Lois Maxwell accepted roles in their usual Bond characters in the poorly received French James Bond spoof, From Hong Kong with Love.|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2011, 4s {{release date}} in the United States was {{confirmed}} on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while {{this is not how}} I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> been so anxious to hear my new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4.
