5|$|In {{the case}} of small installations, {{convenience}} may outweigh cost. There is {{a wide range of}} small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where <b>there</b> <b>really</b> is no source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to airships– in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} <b>there</b> <b>really</b> is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>really</b> are two {{different}} kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in {{two different}} ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear {{in the field of}} the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field is the first thing to be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.|$|E

500|$|Bradman's game evolved with experience. He {{temporarily}} adapted {{his technique}} during the Bodyline series, deliberately {{moving around the}} crease {{in an attempt to}} score from the short-pitched deliveries. At his peak, in the mid-1930s, he had the ability to switch between a defensive and attacking approach as the occasion demanded. After the Second World War, he adjusted to bat within the limitations set by his age, becoming a steady [...] "accumulator" [...] of runs. However, Bradman never truly mastered batting on sticky wickets. Wisden commented, [...] "f <b>there</b> <b>really</b> is a blemish on his amazing record it is... the absence of a significant innings on one of those 'sticky dogs' of old".|$|E

Acheson formed a working group under the United States National Security Council (NSC) executive secretary Sidney Souers, consisting of R. Gordon Arneson, Paul Nitze and Fisher, who served as the State Department's legal adviser on the project. It was Arneson's view that each member of the working group were of one mind. He said, [...] "The four principals in the State Department were Acheson, Nitze, Fisher and myself.

500|$|The Harrier II Plus is {{very similar}} to the Night Attack variant, with the {{addition}} of an APG-65 multi-mode pulse-Doppler radar in an extended nose, allowing it to launch advanced beyond-visual-range missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM. To make additional space for the radar, the angle-rate bombing system was removed. The radars used were taken from early F/A-18 aircraft, which had been upgraded with the related APG-73. In addition to the AIM-120, the AV-8B Plus can also carry AGM-65 Maverick and AGM-84 Harpoon missiles. According to aviation author Lon Nordeen, the changes [...] "had a slight increase in drag and a bit of additional weight, but <b>there</b> <b>really</b> was not much difference in performance between the [...] Night Attack and radar Harrier II Plus aircraft".|$|E

He had felt the desire to increase the amount of political content in his lyricism as he grew into adulthood, noting that the [...] "climate" [...] surrounding his aging produced feelings of responsibility in the songs he wrote. Armstrong said, [...] "As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge song structure ... it opens up your mind to this different way of writing, where <b>there</b> <b>really</b> are no rules." [...] In addition to the album's political content, it also touches on interpersonal relationships and what Dirnt labeled [...] "confusion and loss of individuality." ...|$|E

[...] He informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues.

500|$|Around 100 {{tracks were}} used on [...] "Schoolin' Life"; they were roughly split with 50 {{for the music}} and 50 for the vocals. As stated by Swivel, musically {{the aim of the}} mix was to take a large number of tracks and create a perfect balance. So, he used Waves’ Metaflanger on the {{percussion}} and some of the snares, and spent some time EQ’ing. Swivel explained that there was much parallel processing on the lead vocal. The lead-vocal bus was multed to a second bus, {{and one of them was}} entirely crushed on a 50:1 compression ratio which was totally limited and with a very low threshold. He elaborated, [...] "It creates a very gritty distorted sound in <b>there,</b> <b>really</b> low to taste, and it fills in the lead vocal very nicely. The crushed vocal runs quietly underneath." ...|$|E

[...] Air India had cooperated with Hergé, aiding his research by providing him reading material, contemporary photographs, and film footage of India and Nepal, particularly Delhi and Kathmandu.
