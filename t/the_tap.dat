40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{productivity}} and the susceptibility to <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> panel dryness (TPD) of Hevea brasiliensis are determined by the intrinsic feature of each clone but also by <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> system. Thus, in order to establish <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> system that minimizes the TDP occurrence an experiment was carried out in Côte d'Ivoire with four high yielding clones including, PB 235, PB 255, IRCA 18 and IRCA 111. Five tapping systems (d 2 6 d/ 7 0 /y, d 3 6 d/ 7 4 /y, d 4 6 d/ 7 6 /y, d 5 6 d/ 7 8 /y, d 6 6 d/ 7 10 /y) were applied to these clones, corresponding to a range of 100 % to 30 % of <b>tapping</b> intensities. <b>The</b> results show that the occurrence of TPD is closely related to <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> intensity and <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> system which consists in tapping twice per week with one day rest (S/ 2 d 3 6 d/ 7 4 /y), was found to be <b>the</b> best <b>tapping</b> system.

40|$|The latex {{dilution}} reaction during <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> {{flow course}} {{has been well}} documented and associated with <b>the</b> facilitation of <b>tapping</b> latex flow. However, its underlying mechanism has not experimentally examined. The latex total solid content, osmotic potential and phloem turgor pressure change during <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> flow course were simultaneously measured to investigate the cause of water movement during <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> flow course. It was found that there are three different stages for the laticifer water equilibrium during <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> flow course. <b>The</b> tapping-induced rapid turgor pressure drop is the cause of the first stage water influx into laticifers, while osmoregulation prevails during water exchange {{in the second and third}} stages of tapping flow. Meanwhile, aquaporin expressions were, for the first time, investigated during <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> flow course. <b>The</b> rapid transcript up-regulation of HbPIP 1, HbPIP 2; 1 and HbPIP 2; 3 contributes to the latex dilution reaction. However, their activity gating cannot be ruled out. Ethrel stimulation can significantly dilute the corresponding latex fractions during <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> flow course due to its up-regulations of HbPIP 1, HbPIP 2; 1 and HbPIP 2; 3. Nevertheless, the latex dilution reaction pattern for the Ethrel treated trees did not change, except for a lower degree of dilution compared with the un-treated trees. All these results suggest that both phloem turgor pressure and aquaporins are involved in the latex dilution reaction during <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> flow course...|$|R
25|$|Thread forming is {{performed}} using a , or , which closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes.

Note that <b>the</b> <b>tap</b> drill size differs from that used for a cutting tap and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break <b>the</b> <b>tap.</b> Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} of phloem solute generally falls from leaves to roots. However, a local increase in latex total solid content (LILTSC) was identified near <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> cut of rubber trees. To understand {{the mechanism of}} ethephon-stimulated latex yield, the formation and ethephon (an ethylene releaser) alleviation of the LILTSC near <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> cut were examined. It {{was found that the}} LILTSC near <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> cut of a tapped rubber tree was caused by the tapping-accelerated rubber biosynthesis which began following <b>the</b> first <b>tapping</b> and became significant after <b>the</b> fourth <b>tapping.</b> Ethephon stimulation markedly reduced the LILTSC. The latex yield change pattern upon ethephon stimulation was associated with the kinetic change of LILTSC and the decomposition dynamic of ethephon into ethylene. Once the LILTSC was reduced by ethylene release upon ethephon stimulation, the latex yield increased; however, when the ethylene release upon ethephon stimulation receded, the LILTSC was restored and the effect of ethephon stimulation dissipated. The reduction of LILTSC by ethephon stimulation could be ascribed to the translocation property of ethylene in plants and its regulation of aquaporins. Because maximum ethylene release upon tapping-cut-ethephon-application occured close to <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> cut, <b>the</b> aquaporins were more up-regulated in this region, leading to a reduction of the LILTSC and an increase in latex yield. All these results suggest that the LILTSC near <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> cut was caused by tapping; the ethephon-induced aquaporin up-regulation and LILTSC reduction are involved in the mechanism of ethephon-promoted latex yield...|$|R
30|$|Unlike other gestures, the R^ 2 and T_diff {{values of}} the {{synthesized}} motion curves for <b>the</b> <b>tapping</b> gesture are not significantly improved.

Thus, the tracking instabilities have a smaller effect on the shape of motion curves and timing differences. Moreover, when the speed of gesture execution is fast, controlling the instability using changes in the position of gesture execution becomes less efficient.|$|R
