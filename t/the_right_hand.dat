40|$|We {{implement}} soft leptogenesis in a warped five dimensional scenario {{with two}} branes on the orbifold boundaries coming from an S 1 /Z 2 symmetry, and supersymmetry broken on the IR brane. The SM hypermultiplet fields (fermions and Higgs) {{live in the}} UV brane and we allow the vector supermultiplets corresponding to the gauge bosons and a hypermultiplet corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrino {{to live in the}} bulk. We assume that there are Majorana mass terms for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrino superfield fixed on each brane {{and that there is a}} Yukawa term involving <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrino, <b>the</b> left handed neutrino and the Higgs fixed on the UV brane. Supersymmetry is broken by a constant “superpotential ” on the IR brane, which induces an F-term for the radion hypermultiplet. This F-term leads to a B-term for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> sneutrinos as well as a soft SUSY breaking gaugino mass in the 4 D theory for the zero modes. The gaugino mass naturally induces an A-term for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> sneutrino, left handed sneutrino and the Higgs to be formed through gaugino mediation with a non-trivial CP violating phase.

Although <b>the</b> inflationary scenario is quite appealing for the solution of the horizon and the flatness problem [2], it is difficult to formulate a particle physics model consistently.
