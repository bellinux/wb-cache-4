40|$|Abstract — 2 -Dimensional meshes are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used Network-on-Chip (NoC) topology for on-chip communication in many-core processor arrays due to their low complexity and excellent match to rectangular processor tiles. However, 2 D meshes may incur local traffic congestion for applications with significant levels of traffic with non-neighboring cores, resulting in long latencies and high power consumption. In this paper, we propose an 8 -neighbor mesh topology and a 6 -neighbor topology with hexagonal-shaped processor tiles. A 16 -bit DSP processor and the corresponding processor arrays are implemented in all three topologies. The hexagonal processor tile and arrays of tiles are laid out using industry-standard CAD tools and automatic place and route flow without full-custom design, and result in DRC-clean and LVS-clean layout. A 1080 p H. 264 /AVC residual video encoder and a 54 Mbps 802. 11 a/ 11 g OFDM wireless LAN baseband receiver are mapped onto all topologies. The 6 -neighbor hexagonal grid topology incurs a 2. 9 % area increase per tile compared to the 4 -neighbor 2 D mesh, but its much more effective inter-processor interconnect yields an average <b>total</b> <b>application</b> area reduction of 21 %, an average power reduction of 17 %, and a <b>total</b> <b>application</b> inter-processor communication distance reduction of 19 %.
