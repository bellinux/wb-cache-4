50|$|For the 1988 model year, the 944 Motronic DME was updated, {{and newly}} {{incorporated}} anti-lock braking and airbags. Because of the ABS system, <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>offset</b> changed to 52 mm and Fuchs wheels {{were no longer}} an option.|$|E
5000|$|The {{track was}} widened by 10 mm, <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>offset</b> changed from ET45 to ET38 {{along with the}} wheel {{diameter}} which rose from 16" [...] to 17" [...] to accommodate Brembo brakes which were added to enhance braking.|$|E
50|$|The hub of an offset {{wheel is}} between {{the center and the}} inside edge of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>Offset</b> wheels provide less grip than a centerset wheel, but more than a side-set wheel. Similarly, they break loose more easily than a centerset wheel, but less easily than a side-set wheel. These wheels usually feature square edges for more {{traction}} around corners or in carves. Off-set wheels are the most common wheel, typically used and designed for Downhill but they are used for all the other disciplines as well.|$|E
5000|$|The 38 was {{specially}} designed with an [...] "offset" [...] suspension, {{with the car}} body situated asymmetrically between <b>the</b> <b>wheels,</b> <b>offset</b> to <b>the</b> left using suspension arms of unequal length. Although in theory this was better suited for the ovals (which have only left turns), for example by evening out tyre wear between the two sides, in practise the handling was sufficiently idiosyncratic that the concept never caught on widely.|$|R
5000|$|In other words, using <b>the</b> stock <b>wheel</b> <b>offset</b> {{number as}} <b>the</b> {{starting}} point, a lower off set number makes <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> stick out more {{and with a}} higher number it sticks out less. (Lower is out more, higher is in more.) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The helix flute {{grinding}} {{was important}} to machine a complex revolving tool. The geometric parameters (especial its rake angle, flute depth and flute width) have essential effect on the performances of the tool. Using the 6 UPS parallel grinding machine developed from BEIHANG, especially after analyzing its special machining and structure features, this paper gave general analysis to all factors which will influence the flute shaping. According to the moving relationship between grinding <b>wheel</b> and <b>the</b> tool, a simulation modeling system was established. This system could be adopted to optimize and quantitative design that influence parameters deeply. The parameters refer to <b>the</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> defluxion, <b>the</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> thickness, <b>the</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>offset</b> position along <b>the</b> X direction, and the flute depth. Experiments were carried out to verify the influence results...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the weight}} bias of the GT-R LM heavier {{in the front}} and power {{primarily}} directed at the front axle, <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> are <b>offset</b> to balance the car. Tyres in the front are 14 in wide, while the rear tyres are only 9 in wide. [...] Cooling for the engine, gearbox, and flywheel systems is located in the nose of the car, allowing the bodywork around the cockpit to be utilized as airflow tunnels. The use of the tunnels required the turbochargers to be placed on top of the engine, exhausting out the top of the bodywork in front of the windshield. The rear drivetrain is designed without traditional halfshafts that would be required to traverse the tunnels, opting instead for the epicyclic gearing system to work around the tunnels.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} help make the car more functional, as well as to {{distinguish}} it from the naturally aspirated version, Porsche added an NACA duct in the hood and air intakes in the badge panel in the nose, 15-inch spoke-style alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes with five-stud hubs and a five-speed transmission. Forged 16-inch flat <b>wheels</b> of <b>the</b> style used on the 928 were optional, but fitment specification was that of the 911 which <b>the</b> 924 shared <b>wheel</b> <b>offsets</b> with. Internally, Porsche called it the [...] "931" [...] (left hand drive) and [...] "932" [...] (right hand drive), much like the 911 Carrera Turbo, which had been [...] "Type 930". These designations are commonly used by 924 aficionados.|$|R
5000|$|The Piranha {{design was}} of {{close-coupled}} Canard [...] arrangement, with a shoulder-mounted, low aspect ratio main wing of near-delta plan. Seven hard-points for weapons were planned, with four under-wing pylons {{and one on}} the aircraft center line rated at 500 kg, plus rails on the aircraft's wingtips for air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder or the R.550 Magic. A single cannon, either the heavy, powerful 30 mm Oerlikon KCA or the lighter Mauser BK-27, would be mounted on the aircraft's center line, with <b>the</b> nose <b>wheel</b> slightly <b>offset</b> as a result.|$|R
50|$|When {{selecting}} aftermarket wheels, a {{wheel with}} too little positive offset will {{be closer to}} edge of the fender, and one with too much positive offset will tuck inside the fender and be closer to <b>the</b> suspension components. <b>Wheel</b> width, <b>offset</b> and tire size all determine the way a particular wheel/tire combination will work on a given car. Offset also affects the scrub radius of the steering and it is advisable {{to stay within the}} limits allowed by the vehicle manufacturer. Because <b>wheel</b> <b>offset</b> changes <b>the</b> lever-arm length between the center of the tire and the centerline of the steering knuckle, the way bumps, road imperfections and acceleration and braking forces are translated to steering torques (bump-steer, torque-steer, etc.) will change depending on <b>wheel</b> <b>offset.</b> Likewise, <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> bearings will see increased thrust loads if <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> centerline is moved away from the bearing centerline.|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of holonomic omnidirectionul vehicle which {{consists}} of wheel mechanisms without free rollers but with conventional tires is presented. We first present a concept of <b>the</b> new driving <b>wheel</b> mechanism with a tire in the conventional style such QS a rubber tire or a pneumatic tire,"Offset Steered Driving Wheel". The configuration of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> has an <b>offset</b> distance between a wheel axle and a steering axle along a direction of wheel traveling. We then describe the kinematics and the control method of <b>Offset</b> Steered Driving <b>Wheel</b> to provide an omnidirectional and holonomic capability for a vehicle by actuating a wheel axis and a steering axis independently. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> is non-holonomic system however, we introduce a control strategy to avoid a non-holonomic constraint...|$|R

Only filters that projected unique filter features on flat-fields were studied {{because it was}} those filter features that showed the rotation error as a filter wheel moved from one position to another.

50|$|Wildfire and Evingson bikes {{were used}} in the Iditarod Trail races {{beginning}} in 2000. Also that year, Mike Curiak from Colorado set a record on the Iditarod Trail in the IditaSport Extreme race to Nome on a modified Marin bike with Remolino rims and tires. Surly Bikes released the Pugsley frame, in 2005, and began producing Large Marge 65 mm rims and Endomorph 3.8 in tires in 2006. The Pugsley frame, rim and tire offerings made fatbikes commercially available in local bike shops worldwide. The Pugsley bikes also featured <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> <b>wheel</b> and frame build.|$|R
50|$|Popular {{bodies for}} racing are the 98mm {{wheelbase}} {{bodies of the}} McLaren and Ferrari Enzo. The Enzo allows for a very wide track due to <b>the</b> extreme <b>offset</b> <b>wheels</b> and low center of gravity with {{quite a bit of}} steering bite due to the extreme nose on the car, while the McLaren offers lightweight and very dynamic, nimble handling. 94mm chassis are also popular for racing due to lower polar moment of inertia and weight distribution. Classic bodies include Lancia Stratos, Lotus Europa, Porsche 934 and 935, Lamborghini Countach, Shelby Cobra and many others.|$|R
50|$|The {{line through}} the {{steering}} axis creates a pivot point around which the tire turns. If these lines intersect at the road surface, a zero scrub radius would be present. When the intersection is {{below the surface of}} the road, this is positive scrub radius. Conversely, when the lines intersect above the road, negative scrub radius is present. The point where the steering axis line contacts the road is the fulcrum pivot point on which the tire is turned. Scrub radius is changed whenever there is a change in <b>wheel</b> <b>offset.</b> For example, when <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> are pushed out from the body of the car the scrub radius becomes more positive. Older cars tended to have very close to zero scrub radius but often on the positive side, while newer cars with ABS tend to have a negative scrub radius (this is why most newer cars have <b>wheels</b> <b>offset</b> more inboard).|$|R
50|$|The {{benefit of}} such a system is {{primarily}} the reduction of unsprung weight which improves handling and ride. The suspension {{does not have to}} resist twisting when the brakes are applied. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> don't enclose <b>the</b> brake mechanism allowing greater flexibility in <b>wheel</b> <b>offset,</b> and placement of suspension members. It is also much easier to protect the brake mechanism from the outside environment, and protect it from water, dust, and oil. Of secondary importance is flexible brake pipes are avoided; rigid pipes allow increases in brake fluid pressure, allowing for a smaller disc to manage a given braking torque.|$|R
5000|$|The {{configuration}} {{results in}} inherently good {{balance of the}} reciprocating parts, a low center of gravity, and a very short engine length. The layout also lends itself to effective air cooling. The shape of the engine suits it better for rear engine and mid-engine designs, where the low center of gravity is an advantage; in front engine designs the width interferes with the ability of <b>the</b> front <b>wheels</b> to steer. However, it is an intrinsically expensive design to manufacture, and somewhat too wide for compact automobile engine compartments, which makes it more suitable for luxury sports cars, cruising motorcycles, and aircraft. [...] Only a few auto makers, including Porsche and Subaru, currently use horizontally opposed engines. Porsche {{continues to be the}} most prominent manufacturer of flat-6 engine luxury sports cars, while Subaru uses it in its all-wheel drive cars, where the difficulties of fitting the engine between <b>the</b> front <b>wheels</b> are <b>offset</b> by <b>the</b> efficiency of adding four-wheel drive to the layout. In the past a number of other manufacturers have used them, notably Preston Tucker in the 1948 Tucker Sedan and Chevrolet in the 1960s Corvair with flat-6 air-cooled engines. The CitroÃ«n DS was originally intended to be fitted with an air-cooled flat-6, but this never materialised.|$|R

Others followed since 2014 Rocky Mountain, Felt, Kona, Pivot and many more. Since 2014, Doral bicycles has utilized their Mongoose brand to make fatbikes even {{more accessible to}} the general public, with models such as the Beast, Dolomite, Hitch, and Malus selling for around $200, considerably less than their higher-priced predecessors.|$|R
50|$|The Sandusky, however, was {{the first}} {{locomotive}} to feature counterweights in its driving <b>wheels</b> to <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> force of the piston stroke and the combined weight of <b>the</b> axle, <b>wheels</b> and piston rod against the railroad track.

40|$|In March of 2001, {{a routine}} {{analysis}} of FR 533 N VISFLAT images revealed an anomaly: <b>the</b> filter <b>wheel</b> {{appeared to be}} offset by about 0. 42 Â° in some images.

These offsets are not a recent phenomena, and {{have been found in}} data as far back as mid- 1994. This document describes a more exhaustive analysis of <b>the</b> filter <b>wheel</b> rotation anomaly: flatfield images for all available filters in the archive were inspected to determine if they exhibited similar behavior.

40|$|Trajectory {{tracking}} of mobile wheeled chairs using internal shaft encoder and inertia measurement unit(IMU), exhibits several complications and accumulated {{errors in the}} tracking process due to <b>wheel</b> slippage, <b>offset</b> drift and integration approximations. These errors can be realized when comparing localization results from such sensors with a camera tracking system. In long trajectory tracking, such errors can accumulate and result in significant deviations which make data from these sensors unreliable for tracking. Meanwhile the utilization of an external camera tracking system {{is not always a}} feasible solution depending on the implementation environment. This paper presents a novel sensor fusion method that combines the measurements of internal sensors to accurately predict the location of <b>the</b> <b>wheeled</b> chair in an environment. The method introduces a new analogical OR gate structured with tuned parameters using multi-layer feedforward neural network denoted as "Neuro-Analogical Gate" (NAG). The resulting system minimize any deviation error caused by the sensors, thus accurately tracking <b>the</b> <b>wheeled</b> chair location without the requirement of an external camera tracking system. The fusion methodology has been tested with a prototype Mecanum wheel-based chair, and significant improvement over tracking response, error and performance has been observed...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> {{overshot}} <b>wheel</b> was a later {{innovation in}} waterwheels and was around {{two and a}} half times more efficient than the undershot. <b>The</b> undershot <b>wheel,</b> in which <b>the</b> main water <b>wheel</b> is simply set into the flow of the mill race, suffers from an inherent inefficiency stemming from the fact that <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> itself, entering <b>the</b> water behind the main thrust of the flow driving <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> followed by <b>the</b> lift of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> out of <b>the</b> water ahead of the main thrust, actually impedes its own operation. <b>The</b> overshot <b>wheel</b> solves this problem by bringing the water flow to the top of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> water fills buckets built into <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> rather than <b>the</b> simple paddle <b>wheel</b> design of undershot <b>wheels.</b> As <b>the</b> buckets fill, the weight of the water starts to turn <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> water spills out of the bucket on the down side into a spillway leading back to river.
