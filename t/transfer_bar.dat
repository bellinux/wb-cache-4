The Colt Cowboy, as it was named, was designed to be more affordable than the Single Action Army. It was offered with barrel lengths of 4.75 inches, 5.5 inches, and 7.5 inches. The 7.5 inch variant was discontinued in 1999, as was the 4.75 inch variant, which was reintroduced in 2002. Manufacturing of the Colt Cowboy was discontinued in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> is {{also used}} in revolvers and some exposed hammer rifles, but works the {{opposite}} way from a hammer block. The <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> has the spur {{that would otherwise be}} on the hammer, or encloses a firing pin similar to autoloading designs. The hammer itself cannot contact a loaded cartridge, but must instead strike the <b>transfer</b> <b>bar,</b> which then contacts the cartridge primer with the spur or pin. The <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> is normally positioned out of line with the hammer's travel, but is moved into place by the normal action of the trigger, providing similar [...] "drop safety" [...] to a firing pin block.|$|E
5000|$|The Single-Six is {{currently}} produced as the New Model Single-Six. The term [...] "New Model" [...] simply means that this model includes Ruger's <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> mechanism for increased safety, allowing one {{to carry the}} revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. Prior to 1973, the Single-Six was produced without the <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> mechanism, making it less safe to carry with all six chambers loaded, and with the hammer resting on a loaded chamber. The <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> safety allows the weapon to fire only when the trigger has been pulled. Ruger provides the <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> safety upgrade free of charge for owners of any old model Single-Six.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the gun is}} fired, {{the hammer}} does not {{actually}} strike the firing pin. Under normal firing circumstances a small steel bar (called a <b>transfer</b> <b>bar)</b> is raised as the trigger is pulled, placing it into a position between the firing pin and the hammer itself. The falling hammer strikes the <b>transfer</b> <b>bar,</b> which in turn strikes the firing pin, discharging the weapon.

50|$|In 1974 Ruger {{patented}} a <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> {{safety system}} for their single-action revolvers and discontinued {{the production of}} the Bearcat, which was not readily adaptable to the new <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> design. In 1993, Ruger brought back the Bearcat as the New Bearcat, now incorporating the <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> system, and also introducing a stainless steel variant.Some time in the early '80s, Bill Ruger gave an interview to a writer with the RugerCollector's Association (RCA) and talked about the Bearcat. He said that the Bearcat was the first revolver for which the Ruger engineersdeveloped the <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> and that they could easily have made it that way in 1974. They dropped it, Bill said, because of a mistakeby the marketing department. When that department sent out the 1974 catalog and order forms to the distributors, they forgot to includethe Bearcat. When the orders came back without orders for the Bearcat, they assumed that there was no demand and the dropped it. Today,only old members of the Ruger Collector's Association are aware of the true story of what really happened to the original Bearcat, since that story was published in the Ruger Collectors Journal and is a part of their history.|$|E

25|$|Until the 1970s, when older-design revolvers such as Colt Single Action Armys and Ruger Blackhawks were {{re-engineered}} with drop safeties (such as {{firing pin}} blocks, hammer blocks, or <b>transfer</b> <b>bars)</b> that prevent {{the firing pin}} from contacting the cartridge's primer unless the trigger is pulled, safe carry required the hammer being positioned over an empty chamber, reducing the available cartridges from six to five, or, on some models, in between chambers on either a pin or in a groove for that purpose, thus keeping the full six rounds available. This kept the uncocked hammer from resting directly on the primer of a cartridge. If not used in this manner, the hammer rests directly on a primer and unintentional firing may occur if the gun is dropped or the hammer is struck. Some holster makers provided a thick leather thong to place underneath the hammer that both allowed the carry of a gun fully loaded with all six rounds and secured the {{gun in the holster}} to help prevent its accidental loss.|$|R

50|$|Unlike the Blackhawk, the Old Army did {{not make}} use of Ruger's <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> safety; instead the {{revolver}} relied upon a series of safety notches between each chamber on the cylinder like some models of the remington/colt or other black powder revolvers of the mid-19th century had.|$|E
5000|$|The GP100 is {{manufactured}} in [...]357 Magnum, [...]38 Special, [...]22 Long Rifle, [...]44 Special and [...]327 Federal Magnum calibers. Available Barrel lengths are 3" [...] (76mm), 4.2" [...] (107mm) and 6" [...] (152mm) with partial or full length underlugs. [...] Blued Steel, or Stainless Steel finishes {{are available with}} stainless model numbers preceded by a [...] "K". The Firing pin of the GP100 is mounted inside the frame. The <b>Transfer</b> <b>bar</b> of the GP100 is connected directly to the trigger. The <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> must be present between the hammer and the firing pin {{in order for the}} cartridge to be fired. The <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> only assumes the required position when the trigger is pulled completely rearward. GP100 models are available with fixed or adjustable sights. Fixed sight models are designated by a [...] "F" [...] suffix model number. When the cylinder is closed and the gun is at the point of firing, the cylinder crane is locked into the frame at the front and rear of the crane and by the cylinder lock {{at the bottom of the}} crane opening. The GP100 disassembles into three major modules with only limited use of tools. This allows the user to easily clean the revolver after shooting. The design of the gun eliminates the need for a frame [...] "sideplate", a feature which contributes to the GP100's reputation for strength.|$|E
5000|$|A gas trap system {{involves}} 'trapping' {{combustion gas}} as {{it leaves the}} muzzle. This gas impinges on a surface that converts the energy to motion that, in turn cycles {{the action of the}} firearm. Hiram Maxim patented a muzzle-cup system in 1884 described in [...] though it is unknown if this firearm was ever prototyped. John Browning used gas trapped at the muzzle to operate a 'flapper' in the earliest prototype gas-operated firearm described in [...] The Danish Bang rifle used a muzzle cup blown forward by muzzle gas to operate the action through <b>transfer</b> <b>bars</b> and leverage. Other gas-trap rifles were early production US 'gas-trap' M1 Garands, German Gewehr 41 (both Walther and Mauser models), and Chinese General Liu rifle. These systems are longer, heavier, dirtier and more complex than later gas-operated firearms. Despite these disadvantages, they used relatively low pressure gas and did not require a hole in the barrel. The American and German governments both had requirements that their guns operated without a hole being drilled in the barrel. Both governments would first adopt weapons and later abandon the concept. All US M1 Garand rifles were retrofitted with long-stroke gas pistons.|$|R

50|$|The early {{models of}} the Blackhawk still {{operated}} {{the same way as}} the Colt, in that the hammer was half-cocked to load and unload and that the firearm was not safe to carry with all six chambers loaded due to the hammer resting upon the sixth chamber. In 1973, in order to eliminate accidents occurring from the hammer jarring against a round loaded in the sixth chamber, Ruger introduced the New Model Blackhawk. The New Model Blackhawk did not require the hammer to be half-cocked for loading and unloading, and it employed a <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> mechanism which prevented the cartridge under the hammer from being fired without the trigger being pulled. The New Blackhawk was seen as limiting firearms accidents and legal liability. Ruger then began offering a retrofit program, offering free <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> conversions to earlier variants of the Blackhawk.|$|E
50|$|The {{firing pin}} {{mechanism}} {{was designed by}} Roger A. Hunziker. It {{is very similar to}} the system of Smith and Wesson revolvers. The firing pin is {{not a part of the}} hammer. Instead, it floats freely in the frame while under string pressure, so it does not rest against the percussion cap of any of the rounds in the cylinder. The hammer has a special feature: the trigger is not squeezed and thus will not be in contact with the firing pin. Instead, it rests a few millimeters back. There is also a <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> between the hammer and firing pin. This allows the hammer to hit the firing when the bar is up and the trigger is pulled. But when the trigger is not pulled, the firing pin cannot be hit3. This is why this system is called a <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> system.|$|E
50|$|There is no <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> on {{the firing}} pin but a {{blocking}} bar on the hammer, should it slip off the thumb when cocking the pistol. A heavier cylinder was fitted into the stronger frame.

50|$|During World War I, Punnett {{successfully}} applied {{his expertise}} {{to the problem}} of the early determination of sex in chickens. Since only females were used for egg-production, early identification of male chicks, which were destroyed or separated for fattening, meant that limited animal-feed and other resources could be used more efficiently. Punnett's work in this area was summarized in Heredity in Poultry (1923). With Michael Pease as his assistant, he created the first auto-sexing chicken breed, the Cambar, by <b>transferring</b> the <b>barring</b> gene of the Barred Rock to the Golden Campine.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the years}} the Model 15 has been {{produced}} with several barrel lengths, with 4" [...] (standard) and 2" [...] (1964-1988) being the most common. In 1972 S&W released a stainless steel version as the Model 67. In 1997 the hammer and internal lockworks were modified from an on-the-hammer firing pin / internal hammer block to a floating firing pin / MIM flat hammer, and kept the hammer block that, unlike a <b>transfer</b> <b>bar</b> safety design, moves up with the trigger pull. The hammer hits a <b>transfer</b> <b>bar,</b> transferring the strike to the firing pin, while the block in a hammer block system moves down with the trigger pull, unblocking the hammer from the firing pin, allowing the hammer to strike the firing pin. These two safety systems work oppositely, but achieve the same goal of only allowing the gun to fire when the trigger is pulled all the way.|$|E
50|$|Most {{double-action}} revolvers have no external safety devices; {{a sufficiently}} firm trigger pull will always result in firing. The heavy trigger pull required to cock and then fire the firearm usually prevents accidental discharges due to dropping or mishandling the gun.
