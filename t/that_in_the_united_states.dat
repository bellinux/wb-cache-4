5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it has been {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added {{to the top of a}} pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid was {{discovered}} in the mid 1990s and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$ 2.90 USD per day while <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> as of 2016 is about US$13.79 per day. It appears to be more cost-effective than alternatives such as vancomycin, mostly because of the ability to switch from intravenous use to administration by mouth sooner.|$|E
5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
