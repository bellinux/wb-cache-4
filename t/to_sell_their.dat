5|$|Although {{the custom}} had {{no basis in}} law and {{frequently}} resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, {{the attitude of the}} authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local Poor Law Commissioners forcing husbands <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> wives, rather than having to maintain the family in workhouses.|$|E
5|$|For {{many centuries}} thereafter, the {{settlements}} around the Mont Blanc massif comprised a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats. Some {{farmers in the}} valley of Chamonix joined their counterparts from the neighbouring valleys of Maurienne, Beaufortain and Tarentaise and crossed the Alps into southern Germany, Austria and northern Italy <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> products and bring back goods for sale in local markets.|$|E

Upon purchasing this share, he appointed Chris Mort as chairman, while gaining more shares, owning 93.19% of the club by 29 June 2007. This figure reached 95% on 11 July 2007, forcing the remaining shareholders <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> shares.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, the Spanish {{government}} decided {{to sign a}} contract with the French company GIAT to begin production of the AMX-30. However, it was not the advantages of the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision. Rather, it was the UK's unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> L7 tank-gun, the low cost of the AMX-30, and the French offer to allow Spain to manufacture the tank, that led the Spanish Army to favor the French armored vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In this period, one of {{the major}} {{incentives}} for the growth of Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia. For instance, Braşov was granted a staple right in 1369 with respect to the trade in cloth from Poland or Germany. Thereafter, foreign merchants had <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> most sought-after merchandise, broadcloth to the tradesmen of Braşov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange for animals, cotton, wax and honey.|$|E

5|$|The Black Hawk War {{gave the}} young captain Abraham Lincoln his brief {{military}} service, although he never {{participated in a}} battle. Other participants who later became famous included Winfield Scott, Zachary Taylor, and Jefferson Davis.

5|$|The {{difficulty}} in acquiring Masters badges {{has made the}} tournament {{one of the largest}} events on the secondary-ticket market. A majority of the badges for the Masters are delivered to the same group of patrons, fans, and members each year, and these perennial ticket holders sometimes decide <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> badges through large ticket marketplaces such as StubHub, TicketCity, and VividSeats. Some of these marketplaces will allow fans to purchase a Masters badge for a single day, as opposed to the traditional 4-day pass.|$|E
5|$|The {{holding company}} of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, {{is a private}} limited company, with {{approximately}} 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousand small shareholders.|$|E

5|$|The {{price of}} the {{imported}} ice varied according {{to the amount of}} economic competition; in Havana, Tudor's ice sold for 25 cents ($3.70 in 2010 terms) per pound, while in Georgia it reached only six to eight cents ($0.90–$1.20 in 2010 terms). Where Tudor had a strong market share, he would respond to competition from passing traders by lowering his prices considerably, selling his ice at the unprofitable rate of one cent ($0.20) per pound (0.5kg); at this price, competitors would typically be unable <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> own stock at a profit: they would either be driven into debt or if they declined <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> <b>their</b> ice would melt away in the heat. Tudor, relying on his local storage depots, could then increase his prices once again. By the middle of the 1820s, around 3,000 tons (3 million kg) of ice was being shipped from Boston annually, two thirds by Tudor.|$|E
5|$|Trautmann {{was born}} on 22 October 1923 in Walle, a middle class area in west Bremen, living with his father who worked in a {{fertiliser}} factory by the docks, and his mother Frieda, a housewife. He had a brother, Karl-Heinz, three years his junior, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship. The bleak economic climate of the early 1930s forced the Trautmanns <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> house and move to an apartment block in the working class area of Gröpelingen, where Bernhard lived until 1941.|$|E
5|$|Following a final {{appearance}} at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions {{were removed from the}} Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee. Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> submissions {{during the course of the}} Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.|$|E

5|$|French cuisine varies {{according}} to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate {{the success of the}} hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{first major}} {{achievement}} came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were {{backed by the}} local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Microsoft {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers, paying Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested that Microsoft write a new operating system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft wrote the operating system, but also continued <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.|$|E

5|$|In the {{preparation}} for possible entry into World War II, the Turkish government introduced a tax, the Varlık Vergisi, which disproportionately targeted Turkey's non-Muslim residents. Many Armenians, and other non-Muslim populations, were forced <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> property at significantly reduced prices through public auctions {{in order to}} pay for the sudden tax hike or have the properties confiscated by the state. In addition, the law allowed authorities to confiscate the property of any relative of a taxed person {{in order to pay}} the tax. From this tax, the Turkish government collected 314,900,000 liras or about US$270 million (80% of the state budget) from the confiscation of non-Muslim assets.|$|E
5|$|One famous {{demonstration}} of Dunstan's charismatic style and media savvy came in January 1976. A psychic predicted that, due to Dunstan and the state's social liberalisation—which {{he saw as}} sinful—God would destroy Adelaide with a tsunami caused by an earthquake. This was publicised by the media, prompting a not insignificant number of residents <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> property and leave; some businesses had clearance sales while many who decided to stay indulged in doomsday parties. Dunstan promised {{to stand on the}} seashore at Glenelg and wait for the imminent destruction. He did so on 20 January, the day of the predicted storm, and nothing happened, although he made newspaper headlines in the United Kingdom for his defiance.|$|E

David Gordon Hines (1915-2000) (as Commissioner of Co-operatives from 1959 to {{independence in}} 1962 {{and then as a}} civil servant until 1965) developed the movement by encouraging eventually some 500,000 farmers to join co-operatives.|$|R
