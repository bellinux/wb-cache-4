40|$|This Closure Report (CR) {{presents}} information supporting {{closure of}} Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 562, Waste Systems, and provides documentation supporting the completed corrective actions and confirmation that closure objectives for CAU 562 were met. This CR {{complies with the}} requirements of the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) that was agreed to by the State of Nevada; the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Management; the U. S. Department of Defense; and DOE, Legacy Management (FFACO, 1996 as amended). CAU 562 consists of the following 13 Corrective Action Sites (CASs), located in Areas 2, 23, and 25 of the Nevada National Security Site: · CAS 02 - 26 - 11, Lead Shot · CAS 02 - 44 - 02, Paint Spills and French Drain · CAS 02 - 59 - 01, Septic System · CAS 02 - 60 - 01, Concrete Drain · CAS 02 - 60 - 02, French Drain · CAS 02 - 60 - 03, Steam Cleaning Drain · CAS 02 - 60 - 04, French Drain · CAS 02 - 60 - 05, French Drain · CAS 02 - 60 - 06, French Drain · CAS 02 - 60 - 07, French Drain · CAS 23 - 60 - 01, Mud <b>Trap</b> <b>Drain</b> and Outfall · CAS 23 - 99 - 06, Grease Trap · CAS 25 - 60 - 04, Building 3123 Outfalls Closure activities began in October 2011 and were completed in April 2012. Activities were conducted according to the Corrective Action Plan for CAU 562 (U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office [NNSA/NSO], 2011). The corrective actions included No Further Action and Clean Closure. Closure activities generated sanitary waste and hazardous waste. Some wastes exceeded land disposal limits and required offsite treatment prior to disposal. Other wastes met land disposal restrictions and were disposed in appropriate onsite or offsite landfills.

40|$|Corrective Action Unit 562 {{is located}} in Areas 2, 23, and 25 of the Nevada Test Site, which is {{approximately}} 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. Corrective Action Unit 562 is comprised of the 13 corrective action sites (CASs) listed below: • 02 - 26 - 11, Lead Shot • 02 - 44 - 02, Paint Spills and French Drain • 02 - 59 - 01, Septic System • 02 - 60 - 01, Concrete Drain • 02 - 60 - 02, French Drain • 02 - 60 - 03, Steam Cleaning Drain • 02 - 60 - 04, French Drain • 02 - 60 - 05, French Drain • 02 - 60 - 06, French Drain • 02 - 60 - 07, French Drain • 23 - 60 - 01, Mud <b>Trap</b> <b>Drain</b> and Outfall • 23 - 99 - 06, Grease Trap • 25 - 60 - 04, Building 3123 Outfalls These sites are being investigated because existing information on {{the nature and extent}} of potential contamination is insufficient to evaluate and recommend corrective action alternatives. Additional information will be obtained by conducting a corrective action investigation before evaluating corrective action alternatives and selecting the appropriate corrective action for each CAS. The results of the field investigation will support a defensible evaluation of viable corrective action alternatives that will be presented in the Corrective Action Decision Document. The sites will be investigated based on the data quality objectives (DQOs) developed on December 11, 2008, by representatives of the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection; U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office; Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture; and National Security Technologies, LLC. The DQO process was used to identify and define the type, amount, and quality of data needed to develop and evaluate appropriate corrective actions for CAU 562. Appendix A provides a detailed discussion of the DQO methodology and the DQOs specific to each CAS. The scope of the corrective action investigation for CAU 562 includes the following activities: • Move surface debris and/or materials, as needed, to facilitate sampling. • Conduct radiological surveys. • Perform field screening. • Collect and submit environmental samples for laboratory analysis to determine {{the nature and extent of}} any contamination released by each CAS. • Collect samples of source material to determine the potential for a release. • Collect samples of potential remediation wastes. • Collect quality control samples. This Corrective Action Investigation Plan has been developed in accordance with the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order that was agreed to by the State of Nevada; DOE, Environmental Management; U. S. Department of Defense; and DOE, Legacy Management (FFACO, 1996; as amended February 2008). Under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order, this Corrective Action Investigation Plan will be submitted to the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection for approval. Fieldwork will be conducted following approval of the plan...|$|E

25|$|Washout toilets have a flat {{platform}} with a shallow pool of water. They are flushed by a {{jet of water}} from the back that drives excreta into the trap below. From there, the water flow removes it into the sewage system. An advantage of the design is that users will not get splashed from below. Washout toilets have a shallow pool of water into which waste is deposited, with a <b>trapped</b> <b>drain</b> just behind this pool. Waste is cleared out from this pool of water by being swept over into the trap (usually either a P-trap or an S-trap) and then beyond into a sewer by water from the flush. Washout pans were amongst the first types of ceramic toilets invented and since the early 1970s are now only found in a decreasing number of localities in continental Europe. A washout toilet is a kind of flush toilet which were once predominantly used in Germany, Austria and France. It was patented in Britain by George Jennings in 1852 and remained the standard toilet type in Britain throughout the 19th century.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{transient}} {{analysis of}} an AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) device is pre-sented. Drain–current dispersion effects are investigated when gate or drain voltages are pulsed. Gate-lag and drain-lag turn-on measurements are analyzed, revealing clear mechanisms of current collapse and related disper-sion effects. Numerical 2 -D transient simulations consid-ering surface traps effects {{in a physical}} HEMT model have also been carried out. A comparison between experimen-tal and theoretical results is shown. The presence of donor type traps acting as hole traps, due to their low energy level of 0. 25 eV relative to the valence band, with densi-ties> 1 e 20 cm- 3 (> 5 e 12 cm- 2), uniformly distributed at the HEMT surface, and interacting with the free holes that accumulated at the top surface due to piezoelectric fi elds, accounts for the experimentally observed effects. Time constants close to 10 µs are deduced. Some additional fea-tures in the measured transient currents, with faster time constants, could not be associated with surface states.

50|$|Basement {{floor drains}} that connect to {{sanitary}} sewers {{need to be}} filled regularly to prevent the trap from drying out and sewer gas from escaping into the basement. The <b>drain</b> <b>trap</b> can be topped up automatically by the condensation from air conditioners or high-efficiency furnaces. A small tube from another downpipe is sometimes used to keep the trap from drying out. Health Canada advocates the use of special radon gas <b>traps</b> for floor <b>drains</b> that lead to soil or to a sealed sump pump. In areas where storm and sanitary sewers are combined, {{and there is the}} risk of flooding and sewage backing up, backwater valves in all basement drains may be mandated by code and definitely are recommended even if not mandated.|$|R

40|$|In this letter, {{we report}} an {{approach}} to quantitative study {{of the relationship between}} the oxide charge <b>trapping</b> over the <b>drain</b> extension due to electrical stress and the off-state drain leakage current. It is found that positive charge <b>trapping</b> over the <b>drain</b> extension leads to a significant increase in the off-state drain current if the edge direct tunneling (EDT) is dominant in the drain current but in contrast, it leads to a reduction in the drain current if the band-to-band tunneling in the Si surface is dominant. A quantitative relationship between the charge trapping and the off-state drain leakage current in the EDT regime is established. From the measurement of the off-state current in the EDT regime, the charge trapping can be determined by using the approach developed in this study. © 2004 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

This work aims to study the device hard breakdown and performance degradation under HBM equivalent ESD stress. Severe ESD stress level could catastrophic melt the device structure due to large amount of local heat generation.

Some builders in the Washington, DC area are required by local code to install passive stacks, and radon mitigators have observed many installation problems. Two basic types of passive stack problems have been found: poor installation and basement depressurization.

I.E., most kitchen sinks evacuate water with a -inch drain pipe, which feeds into a larger 4-inch drain pipe on the main plumbing stack before heading to a septic tank or to the city sewage system. This means that, barring intrusion by tree roots or other debris into buried piping, {{the vast majority of}} household drain clogs occur in the smallest-diameter piping, usually in the pop-up or <b>drain</b> <b>trap,</b> where they can be reached easily by a hydro-mechanical device's water hose.|$|R

50|$|Cihuatán was {{apparently}} {{established in the}} 8th or 9th century AD on a previously uninhabited site, and occupation was relatively brief, not lasting {{more than a century}} or so. The founding of the city coincides with the abandonment of major Classic period cities in the surrounding region, which had strong links to the Maya cities of Honduras. The founding of Cihuatán may have been a by-product of the disruption caused by the Classic Maya collapse and corresponding shift in trade routes. Although the ethnic identity of the site elite is unknown, the architectural style of the structures outside of the ceremonial core of the city is recognisably Maya. About 100 to 150 years after it was founded, Cihuatán was destroyed by a massive fire that spread rapidly throughout the city. Excavated evidence indicates that those inhabitants that did not die in the flames fled, abandoning their belongings.

40|$|Ego-ryo, {{a unique}} way of {{catching}} ayu fry fish on Amori-river system, Kagoshima prefecture, was studied {{on the structure of}} fishing devices used, the actual operation, and the catches. The fish were caught from the 1 st of March to the end of April at the nine fishing grounds established between 5. 2 - 9. 9 km upstream of the river mouth. Each fishing ground was constructed from a flat floor (150 m long, 20 m wide), an embankment hemmed on each side, and a wooden weir of the upper end and fence nets with traps of the lower end surrounded. Once fish schools came in the fishing grounds, the weir was shut to keep out the inflow of water causing drainage of water in the ground. The drainage stimulated the fish to rush into the <b>trap.</b> This <b>draining</b> technique which leads them into the trap has not been known in any other ayu fry fishery in Japan.

40|$|A {{complete}} reliability {{study of}} the DC and RF characteristics for InGaAs nMOSFETs with aluminium oxide/ hafnium oxide dielectric is presented. The main stress variation at high frequencies is related to a threshold voltage shift, whereas no decrease {{is found in the}} maximum of the cut-off frequency and RF-transconductance. Constant gate stress leads to a charge build up causing a threshold voltage shift. Furthermore, electron <b>trapping</b> at the <b>drain</b> side degrades the performance after hot carrier stress. The maximum DC-transconductance is reduced following constant gate bias stress, by an increase in charge trapping at border defects. These border defects at the channel/high-k interface are filled by cold carrier trapping when the transistor is turned on, whereas they do not respond at high frequencies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{efficient}} {{strategy for}} enhancing the lymph node deposition of rapidly drained liposomes from the interstitial injection site is described. Subcutaneously injected small-sized immuno-poly(ethyleneglycol) -liposomes (immuno-PEG-liposomes), containing 10  mol% mPEG 350 –phospholipid and 1 mol% PEG 2000 –phospholipid in their bilayer and where IgG 1 is coupled to the distal end of PEG 2000, not only drain rapidly from the interstitial spaces into the initial lymphatic system, but also accumulate efficiently among {{the lymph nodes}} draining the region when compared with non-PEG-bearing immunoliposomes where IgG is directly coupled to the phospholipid. Liposome deposition among the draining lymph nodes, however, was further enhanced dramatically following an adjacent subcutaneous injection of a pentameric IgM against the surface attached IgG molecules (IgM:IgG, 10 : 1) without compromising vesicle drainage from the interstitium. This is suggested to arise either {{as a result of}} formation of large immuno-aggregates within the lymphatic vessels with subsequent transport to and trapping among the regional lymph nodes and/or following IgM binding to Fc receptors of the lymph node sinus macrophages forming a platform for subsequent <b>trapping</b> of <b>drained</b> IgG-coupled liposomes.
