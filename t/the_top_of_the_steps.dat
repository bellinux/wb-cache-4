5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{construction}} workers and counter-protesters moved across City Hall Park toward city hall. They mounted the steps, planted their flags at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> then attempted to gain entrance. Police on duty at city hall initially barred them, but soon the mob pushed past. A few workers entered the building. A postal worker rushed onto the roof of city hall and raised the U.S. flag there to full mast. When city workers lowered the flag back down to half-mast, {{a large number of}} construction workers stormed past the police. Deputy Mayor Richard Aurelio, fearing the building would be overrun by the mob, ordered city workers to raise the flag back to full mast.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} {{wanted to}} have a gathering place outside of home and work where the characters could meet. After a trip to Seattle, and seeing the many burgeoning coffee shops, the production designer suggested to producers that they use a coffee shop. Unlike many of the relatively modern coffee shop designs prevalent in Seattle, the production designer opted for a more warm and inviting style which would appear more established and traditional. Stools were specifically omitted to avoid any similarity to the bar on Cheers. Several Los Angeles coffee shops were used for reference. A bookcase was added on the back wall, suggesting patrons could grab a book and read while they enjoyed their coffee. The show used three versions of the interior set depending on how much space other sets for each episode required. If there was not space for the full set, a smaller version that omitted the tables closest to the audience could be used. If there wasn't space for that set, a small back section {{of the back of the}} cafe at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> could be set up under the audience bleachers. A set was also used on occasion for the exterior patio.|$|E

500|$|The {{other boys}} carry out equally barbaric acts: {{the two boys}} at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link-boy's torch; {{the boys in the}} {{foreground}} are throwing at a cock (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French, and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tailâ€”tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat; and {{in the rear of the}} picture another cat tied to two [...] is thrown from a high window. In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom. The absence of parish officers who should be controlling the boys is an intentional rebuke on Hogarth's part; he agreed with Henry Fielding that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the lack of care from the overseers of the poor, who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring.|$|E
2500|$|The Exorcist (1973) {{was set in}} the {{neighborhood}} and partially filmed there. In the movie's climactic scene, the protagonist is hurled down the 75-step staircase at the end of 36th Street NW, which connects Prospect Street with M Street below. The staircase {{has come to be known}} as the [...] "Exorcist steps". A false front was built onto the house at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> so that the bedroom windows would immediately overlook the steps. The real structure is considerably set-back.|$|E
2500|$|The Ken Ausburn Track {{begins at}} the end of Northfields Avenue (near the University of Wollongong and Wollongong Botanic Garden). It climbs up a steep grass path and turns into a section of wooden steps and a boardwalk. At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> is a plaque {{indicating}} several bird species to be found on the track. Near this is an oddly out of place lemon tree. It follows a level path to an open grass area where it then reaches the Lawrence Hargrave Memorial Sculpture, situated in an open grass area. The sculpture was made from 1988 to 1989 by Herbert [...] "Bert" [...] Flugelman, and is of stainless steel and part of the University of Wollongong Art Collection.|$|E

2500|$|Seward's son, Frederick, {{appeared}} at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> in his nightclothes. As Powell reached the second floor, Frederick ordered Powell to stop. Seward's daughter, Fanny, {{stuck her head}} out of her father's bedroom door and warned the men that Seward was sleeping. She {{then returned to the}} bedroom. Powell said he was delivering medicine, and Frederick asked for the bottle. Powell gave it to him, then pulled out his revolver and pulled the trigger with the barrel of the gun against Frederick's chest. The revolver misfired, and Powell pistol-whipped Frederick over and over. Bell fled the house screaming [...] "Murder! Murder!" [...] and raced to the office of General Christopher C. Augur next door for help. Terrified, Herold tied Powell's horse to a tree and fled on his own steed.|$|E
2500|$|The David Student Union (DSU) is a $36 million, [...] {{facility}} whose construction {{began in}} 2003 and opened September 9, 2006. Constructed in a [...] "Neo-Georgian" [...] architectural style, {{the first floor}} contains the campus Convenience Store, parallel the DSU dining facilities: The Discovery Bistro, Discovery Cafe, Chick-fil-A, Discovery Pizza, and Regatta's. The campus Bookstore and Convenience Store closed during the Fall 2010 semester {{in favor of an}} online bookstore and instead contains a student lounge, admissions office, and apparel store. All on-campus students receive a mailbox and access to a full-service Post Office located {{on the second floor of}} the DSU. Four large conference rooms named for past U.S. Presidents are located around a central lobby area at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps.</b> The Ballroom is also located on the second floor. The building provides offices for Student Life, The Captain's Log, Career Development, International Studies, Academic Advising, and others. Private desks with computers are provided for students as well as quiet study sections and recreational areas. The building was named in honor of William R. and Goldie R. David.|$|E
2500|$|Some photographers {{have found}} {{creative}} ways around these limitations. Louie Liotta of The New York Post told John Tierney {{he holds his}} camera near the ground, pointing upward, and walks with it for a short distance, {{in order to get}} a shot of the defendant's face as he or she is ducking downwards to avoid the cameras. Andrew Savulich of the Daily News looks for unusual angles and juxtapositions, once putting the station house's sleeping cat in the foreground. To catch the defendant's face, he stands near the front door at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps.</b> [...] "For some reason, even when a guy has decided to duck his head, he usually lifts it for a second when he starts to go down steps", he explains. [...] "You sometimes catch this lost-in-space look, the eyes fixed at a distance, as if he's trying very hard to be somewhere else." [...] Jim Estrin of the Times says the police officers at the door sometimes block that shot for him, so he starts in the middle, shooting as he runs, and then gets on the other side of the police car for a shot as the defendant enters.|$|E
