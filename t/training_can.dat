5|$|Diving may be {{performed}} for various reasons, {{both personal and}} professional. Recreational diving is purely for enjoyment and has several specialisations and technical disciplines to provide more scope for varied activities for which specialist <b>training</b> <b>can</b> be offered, such as cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and deep diving.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is quick}} to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct <b>training</b> <b>can</b> become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs {{requires}} a regular exercise routine to keep them healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Training</b> <b>can</b> {{help the}} user {{make use of}} their AAC system to {{communicate}} effectively with others, to control their environment through communication, and to make choices, decisions and mistakes. Skilled users of AAC show communicative competence in four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic. Linguistic competence refers to language skills in the person's native language {{as well as the}} linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.|$|E
50|$|Sweden and Norway {{have the}} same ATC system and the same voltage, meaning that <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> {{generally}} cross the border without being specially modified. Sweden and Denmark have different ATC systems and different voltage, so only specially modified <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> cross the border. The Oresundtrains (X31) {{and some of the}} X2000 <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> do that.|$|R
50|$|The Allahabad-Bhusawal {{section is}} {{classified}} as 'B' class where <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> run up to 130 km/h. On the branch lines <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> run up to 100 km/h.|$|R
50|$|On a simple, non-computerised layout {{only one}} <b>train</b> <b>can</b> run {{independently}} on either {{a two or}} three-rail system (two trains if combined with overhead lines). On the insulated three-rail type, two <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> run independently (three trains if combined with overhead lines).|$|R
25|$|Perturbation <b>training</b> <b>can</b> {{help improve}} gait asymmetries {{of the knee}} joint.|$|E
25|$|<b>Training</b> <b>can</b> {{be one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} techniques to help combat excessive barking in dogs. Acquiring the help of a professional dog trainer can often help reduce an animal's barking.|$|E
25|$|Training {{is usually}} done during {{business}} hours, {{as often as}} five times a week. <b>Training</b> <b>can</b> take from 2 to 8 weeks at which time one is dialyzed incenter, often in a separate home hemodialysis training unit.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> {{share the}} same track.|$|R
50|$|The <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> be {{built in}} various configurations. The two-car variant is known as (EZT 37 WE), three-car (EZT 36WE), four-car (EZT 31 WE) and six-car (EZT 35 WE). The <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> have {{interiors}} built suitable for commuter and suburban trains but also for long distance routes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> be used {{under an}} {{agreement}} between Deutsche Bahn and NordWestBahn with tickets available nationwide. Between Rastede and Oldenburg Central Station fares are set by the Verkehrsverbund Bremen/Niedersachsen (Transport Association of Bremen/Lower Saxony). Tickets for local <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> be bought from a machine on the train.|$|R
25|$|Training is {{essential}} for optimum results. A number of institutions, including ACL Services Ltd., offer training on computer-aided audit techniques including continuous auditing through automation. <b>Training</b> <b>can</b> be conducted either on-site or remotely, depending on the need of companies.|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} suggests, Shelties can {{and have been}} used as sheepdogs and still {{participate}} in sheepdog trials to this day. Herding dogs conduct livestock {{from one place to another}} by causing fear-flocking and flight behavior. The instinct to herd is primarily a product of breeding. No amount of <b>training</b> <b>can</b> substitute this trait.|$|E
25|$|A trainee {{must learn}} how to present {{evidence}} before the court in clear, forceful testimony. Fledgling examiners in the later stages of <b>training</b> <b>can</b> get {{a glimpse into the}} legal process as well as a better sense of this aspect of their work through participation in a mock trial or by attending court hearings to observe the testimony of qualified examiners. These are guidelines and not requirements.|$|E

25|$|Computer-based ship {{simulators}} {{provide a}} training environment for learning skills to steer a ship. <b>Training</b> <b>can</b> {{be programmed to}} replicate a variety of ship sizes and environmental conditions. Scenarios depicted in 3-D graphics range from making course corrections in open waters to maneuvering in port, rivers, or other shallow waters. Cost compared to a real vessel is low. Mariners learn responses to dangerous situations, such as steering failure, {{in the safety of}} a virtual environment.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers {{who feel}} {{confident}} in their own abilities and those of their squad are {{far less likely to}} suffer from combat stress reaction. Training in stressful conditions that mimic those of an actual combat situation builds confidence in the abilities of themselves and the squad. As this <b>training</b> <b>can</b> actually induce some of the stress symptoms it seeks to prevent, stress levels should be increased incrementally as to allow the soldiers time to adapt.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{training}} in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until {{more than a decade}} after medical school. Furthermore, surgical <b>training</b> <b>can</b> be very difficult and time-consuming.|$|E
50|$|This railway {{line was}} {{upgraded}} and since July 2014 <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> run on most distance with {{a speed of}} 160 km/h for passenger trains, and 120 km/h for freight trains. The fastest passenger <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> cover the distance of 225 km between Bucharest and Constanta {{in less than two}} hours.|$|R
5000|$|In Training Day, as the 2 main {{characters}} are driving through South Central Los Angeles {{next to the}} Blue Line tracks, a <b>train</b> <b>can</b> be heard sounding off its horn right before it passes them in the opposite direction. Shortly afterwards, another Blue Line <b>train</b> <b>can</b> be seen on an elevated bridge.|$|R
50|$|The <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> work in {{multiple}} {{of up to}} 3 sets.|$|R
25|$|Endurance training: In female {{endurance}} athletes, {{large volumes}} of <b>training</b> <b>can</b> lead to decreased bone density and {{an increased risk of}} osteoporosis. This effect might be caused by intense training suppressing menstruation, producing amenorrhea, and {{it is part of the}} female athlete triad. However, for male athletes, the situation is less clear, and although some studies have reported low bone density in elite male endurance athletes, others have instead seen increased leg bone density.|$|E
25|$|In Norway, conscripts {{who have}} {{completed}} their initial period of military <b>training,</b> <b>can</b> {{be transferred to}} the auxiliary police Politireserven (PR) rather than joining the military reserves. The PR is managed by the Mobile Police, and is intended to reinforce the regular police in case of national emergencies or disasters. The PR only exists in the central eastern part of the country. After a ten-day introduction course, and with refresher courses every few years, the PR troops can be used for armed or unarmed guard duties, border and traffic checkpoints, and for public order duties.|$|E
25|$|Parent {{mediated}} interventions offer {{support and}} practical advice to parents of autistic children. A 2002 Cochrane Review found only two relevant studies, with {{small numbers of}} participants, and no clinical recommendations could be made due to these limitations. A {{very small number of}} randomized and controlled studies suggest that parent <b>training</b> <b>can</b> lead to reduced maternal depression, improved maternal knowledge of autism and communication style, and improved child communicative behavior, but due to the design and number of studies available, definitive evidence of effectiveness is not available.|$|E
50|$|Most of the Howrah-Delhi {{main line}} is {{classified}} as ‘A’ class line where <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> run up to 160 km/h but in certain sections speeds may be limited to 120 - 130 km/h. The Howrah-Bandel-Bardhaman sector and the Sitarampur-Patna-Mughalsarai sector {{is classified as}} ‘B’ class line where <b>trains</b> <b>can</b> run up to 130 km/h.|$|R

25|$|Recreational diver {{training}} courses range from minor specialties which require one classroom session {{and an open}} water dive, and which may be completed in a day, to complex specialties which may take several days to weeks, and require several classroom sessions, confined water skills training and practice, and {{a substantial number of}} open-water dives, followed by rigorous assessment of knowledge and skills. Details on the approximate duration of <b>training</b> <b>can</b> be found on the websites of most certification agencies, but accurate schedules are generally only available from the specific school or instructor who will present that course, as this will depend on the local conditions and other constraints.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} of mountain <b>training</b> <b>can</b> {{be judged by}} the fact that only 15 out of the 200 soldiers in the 100th Separate Guards Reconnaissance Company and the 1st Airborne Company of the 345th Guards Airborne Regiment reached the summit of Peak Harvest in the Alay Mountains at an altitude of 4000 meters. On 27 July 1968, paratroopers were landed on the slopes of Lenin Peak at an altitude of 7100 meters. This group included ten men from the regiment. Before this dropping, a landing on the foot of Lenin Peak took place at an altitude of 6100 meters by 36 conscripts of the regiment under the command of Captain George Taynasa. According to the military authorities, the 111th was to land in Xinjiang and capture Urumqi in the event of large-scale conflict with China.|$|E
25|$|Diver <b>training</b> <b>can</b> {{be divided}} into entry level training, which are those skills and {{knowledge}} considered essential for the diver to dive unsupervised at an acceptably low level of risk by the certifying agency, and further skills and knowledge which allow better performance and extend the environmental capacity of the diver. There is a significant variation in entry level training, with some training agencies requiring the bare minimum as specified by RSTC and ISO, and others requiring a greater level of competence with associated assumption of lower risk to the diver and dive buddy. Entry level training may include skills for assisting or rescue of another diver, {{but this is not}} always the case. Divers without rescue training are routinely assigned to dive as buddy pairs to follow organizational protocols. This is not generally a contravention of the training agencies' recommendations.|$|E
