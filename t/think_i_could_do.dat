25|$|After playing all 16 games {{during the}} 1998 and 1999 seasons, {{he spent the}} 2000 season out of {{football}} after his contract with the Packers was not renewed. Before the 2001 training camp, he worked out and lived for a time with Fred Roll, his former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas, and subsequently returned to Green Bay for training camp in July at a perceptibly more svelte 339 pounds — and once again equipped with his former quickness. He was re-signed by the Packers on March 23, 2001, after which Brown announced, “If I didn’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this anymore, I wouldn't be here".|$|E
500|$|Edmondson has {{discussed}} the surprised reaction he encountered upon assuming {{the role of}} Abra, stating: [...] "I'm sure people are surprised I'm in it, but I don't give a toss. I have always liked it. It's like any soap - if you watch it, you get stuck in. I love working on it." [...] He has mentioned {{that he is the}} only cast member to have been a fan of the show since its 1999 conception, that both he and his youngest daughter Freya often watch it together [...] "as a bonding exercise", and going as far as to describe the role as [...] "a dream". Commenting on his decision only ever to reprise the role of Abra on short term contracts, Edmondson has stated that: [...] "I don't think I could handle any longer. The regulars on the show work very, very hard. Basically I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> what they do and still be alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was amazed at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E

500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Peter Neal {{was making a}} short film {{documentary}} about the Experience, titled Experience (also known as See My Music Talking). [...] On December 19, 1967, he captured Hendrix playing an impromptu solo version of [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'". [...] The filming took place during a publicity photo session at the London studio of photographer Bruce Fleming, who had photographed the British album cover for Are You Experienced. [...] For the shoot, a twelve-string Zemaitis acoustic guitar restrung for a left-handed player was conveniently on hand. [...] Hendrix, seated on a stool against a white backdrop, sang while playing the guitar. [...] After a false start, he settles into the song, which biographer Keith Shadwick describes as [...] "100 percent country blues... s with great feeling, however artificial {{the circumstances of the}} session may have been". [...] Hendrix's acoustic guitar playing shows familiarity with the styles of Lead Belly, Robert Johnson, and Skip James. [...] Music writer Michael Fairchild compares some of his guitar techniques to those found in 1928 recordings by Tommy Johnson, such as [...] "Big Fat Mama" [...] and [...] "Big Road Blues". [...] The guitar was tuned down two whole steps (C–F–B–E–G–C), perhaps influenced by Lead Belly's twelve-string style. [...] At the end of the 3:05 performance, Hendrix laughs it off with [...] "Did you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that?" [...] In addition to the 1968 documentary, the [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'" [...] performance is included in the 1973 film Jimi Hendrix and accompanying soundtrack album (re-released on Blues). [...] In the UK, it was released by Reprise Records as a single in 1973 with the Experience's adaptation of B.B. King's [...] "Rock Me Baby" [...] recorded at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 as the B-side.|$|E
500|$|SFX {{magazine}} {{noted that}} when the character was first announced, {{some members of the}} public questioned the morality of featuring such a character in a science fiction action series. In August 2010 a reporter from entertainment website AfterElton also stated to the shows executive producers that some of their readers had been upset and concerned about details of the storyline. Pullman's casting as Danes was announced on 15 December 2010. Prior to his role as Danes, Pullman was best known to audiences for his portrayal of the President of the United States in Independence Day. When Pullman asked executive producer Julie Gardner why the production team sought to cast him in role, she replied that it was because he was perceived as [...] "America's sweetheart", which he interpreted to mean they were looking to destabilise viewers. Torchwoods creator, Russell T Davies, noted that upon expressing an interest in casting [...] Pullman, he was told [...] "you haven't got a chance." [...] Though Pullman was aware of Torchwood, having had a friend who'd [...] "evangelized" [...] the series, he had not watched the series before being cast. Upon reading the scripts, Pullman commented that he had been impressed at how well the series [...] "knows itself" [...] and the strength of each character's individual voice. In an interview with Zap2it he remarked that he thought he was given the best role in the series. Pullman noted that he was prepared for the role having played other troubled characters in the past and re-iterated that it was the writing that attracted him to the part adding [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> a child murderer just for a child murderer's sake".|$|E
2500|$|Javier Bardem {{became the}} first Spanish actor to win an Oscar. [...] "Thank you to the Coens for being crazy enough to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that and put {{one of the most}} horrible hair cuts in history on my head," [...] Bardem said in his {{acceptance}} speech at the 80th Academy Awards. He dedicated the award to Spain and to his mother, actress Pilar Bardem, who accompanied him to the ceremony.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{too much}} for Mrs. Travers. [...] "I! Create it!" [...] she exclaimed, indignantly, but under her breath. [...] "How on earth <b>do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I quite see that; {{and really}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> better than pass {{a few years}} on a man-of-war, for after that I should be fit for any work I might find to do.” ...|$|R

2500|$|For Rucker it {{was largely}} an issue of musical genre and the high school group {{changing}} his thinking on it: [...] "I knew the song, and {{to me it was}} such a perfect bluegrass tune that I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. But they did a country version of it, with drums and pedal steel. I was like, 'Wait a minute. That would be a great country song.'" [...] On deciding to go country with it, Rucker says: ...|$|E
2500|$|Jaffe {{eventually}} set {{three conditions}} for the casting of Brando: That {{he would have to}} take a fee far below what he typically received; he'd have to agree to accept financial responsibility for any production delays his behavior cost; and he had to submit to a screen test. Coppola convinced Brando to a videotaped [...] "make-up" [...] test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the character's puffed cheeks). Coppola had feared Brando might be too young to play the Don, but was electrified by the actor's characterization as the head of a crime family. Even so, he had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental actor. Brando had doubts himself, stating in his autobiography, [...] "I had never played an Italian before, and I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it successfully." [...] Eventually, Charles Bluhdorn, the president of Paramount parent Gulf+Western, was won over to letting Brando have the role; when he saw the screen test, he asked in amazement, [...] "What are we watching? Who is this old guinea?" [...] Brando was signed for a low fee of $50,000, but in his contract, he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: 1% of the gross for each $10million over a $10million threshold, up to 5% if the picture exceeded $60million. According to Evans, Brando sold back his points in the picture for $100,000, as he was in dire need of funds. [...] "That $100,000 cost him $11million," [...] Evans claimed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] he protested. [...] "I {{begin to}} {{understand}} Mannering's firmness now.

Why not, indeed? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that, Edgar, yet I {{will not}} go by Cliffe, but {{straight}} to Hoo. I can then travel as I like, and shall not have to join in talk with Dame De Courcy nor the others, nor feel that my bad horsemanship makes me a jest." ...|$|R
