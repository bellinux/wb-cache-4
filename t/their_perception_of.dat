5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified many interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Some of these interventions are evidence-based; others are not. However, previous {{research has}} also found that parents select interventions for their children with ASD {{on the basis of}} several factors other than the evidence base, including their emotional representations <b>of</b> ASD and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the timeline, consequences, and causes of ASD. Other research has found that people’s cultural worldviews influence their decision-making on a variety of social and political issues. The current study examined the relationships between these factors and parents’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the efficacy of evidence-based and non-evidence-based interventions. Contrary to previous research, for parents of children with ASD, <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> intervention efficacy were not affected by their emotional representations <b>of</b> ASD or <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the timeline or consequences of ASD. There was a relationship between parents’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the causes <b>of</b> ASD and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the efficacy of some interventions.

25|$|Superficial {{similarities}} between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes {{are thought to}} be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W-shape. Although cuttlefish cannot see color, they can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their retina (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye changes focus by shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, there is no blind spot, because the optic nerve is positioned behind the retina.|$|E

25|$|Seniors’ {{subjective}} health remains {{relatively stable}} while objective health worsens with age. Furthermore, {{it seems that}} the perceived health improves with age when objective health is controlled in the equation. This phenomenon is known as the paradox of ageing. People's expectations concerning health co-evolve with the health norms surrounding one's age. Elderly people often associate their functional and physical decline with the normal ageing process. The elderly may actually enhance <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> their own health through social comparison; for instance, the older people get, the more they may consider themselves in better health than their same-aged peers. Hence, the older a person becomes and the more their actual health declines, the greater the potential role is for social comparison processes to create a gap between a person's objective and subjective health.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the convergent evolution in perching and patrolling site preferences of Hemipepsis ustulata with other hilltopping insects of the Sonoran Desert. The high mountain ridges attract the males of various hilltopping insect species, including tarantula hawk wasps, various butterflies, and bot flies. Among these ridges, certain locations {{are much more}} likely to be occupied by territorial males. Additionally, these preferred territories appear to be stable from year to year, and different species appear to have similar preferences for available sites. Preferred territories tend to be large, visual targets, jutting high on mountain ridges. These observations were confirmed by a study using artificial landmarks. This similar ranking preference for territories suggests a widespread convergence among the capacity of hilltopping insects’ compound eyes in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> what constitutes a conspicuous landmark feature.|$|E

25|$|Among humans, {{the missionary}} {{position}} {{is the most}} commonly used sex position. In his seminal study Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), which focused on American women, researcher Alfred Kinsey stated that 91% of married women surveyed reported using this position most often, whereas 9% reported using it exclusively. A The Journal of Sexual Medicine study entitled What Kind of Erotic Film Clips Should We Use in Female Sex Research? An Exploratory Study selected 18 film clips out of a sample of 90 that were found by the women studied to be particularly mentally appealing and visually arousing. 21% of the original 90 involved the missionary position, but 33% of the final 18 involved missionary. Fewer than 10% of sexually active persons rarely or never use the missionary position. According to Francoeur, the Brazilian Bororo Indians eschew missionary, finding it insulting for either partner to be above the other during sex. Balinese shun the man-on-top position in favor of the Oceanic position due to <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the former as being impractical and clumsy. The Cashinahua people use the missionary position to stay stable when they have sex in a forest stream to avoid insect bites. The inhabitants of Inis Beag practice the missionary position exclusively, with very limited foreplay. In addition to humans, the missionary position is also used by certain other species including bonobos, gorillas, and armadillos.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} thesis that organizational personality is related to applicants’ attraction to an organization through a process which involves need motivation, expectancy beliefs, and applicants’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> person-organization fit.

Specifically, this research investigated the hypothesis that organizational personality information is useful to applicants because it helps individuals to determine <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> fit. A sample of students (N = 198) and working adults (N = 198) participated in an online experiment. Findings indicated that individuals’ beliefs about the instrumentality of desirable work related outcomes are essential to determining <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> fit and organizational attraction. Additionally, organizational personality perceptions interacted with need motivation to affect <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> fit and organizational attraction. For instance, <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> fit mediated the influence of the interaction between need for achievement and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> innovativeness on organizational attraction. The interaction of need motivation and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> organizational personality helped individuals to better determine <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> fit and subsequent attraction toward organizations. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The present {{research}} study examines the possible relationship between students’ career decision-making self-efficacy (CDMSE) and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> family members’ {{job satisfaction and}} job insecurity. The {{present research}} uses a quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional research design, on a sample of 148 subjects drawn from a sample of first year Psychology students from the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. The Career Decision Self-Efficacy scale {{was used to measure}} career decision-making self-efficacy (Betz & Taylor, 2001), Warr, Cook and Wall’s (1979) Overall Job Satisfaction scale to measure job satisfaction (Short, 1996) and the Job Insecurity scale developed by Ashford, Lee and Bobko (1989) to measure job insecurity. The statistical procedures used to analyse the data, included correlations to test the first hypothesis, which proposed a relationship between students’ CDSME and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> family members’ job satisfaction and the second hypothesis, assumed a relationship between students’ CDMSE and their family members’ job insecurity. A Stepwise Multiple Regression was performed to examine the above hypotheses.

40|$|The study {{expanded}} the sexual vs non-sexual categorization of clothing ads by adopting a three-category measure: non-sexual, suggestive, and provocative imagery. Results indicate that non-sexual advertisements were ranked most appealing. Data were gathered {{in three stages}} using a pre-survey, a focus group discussion, and a post-survey. A convenience sample was used to recruit 30 participants comprising 11 men and 19 women; they were recruited from Concordia University to participate in one of four group interviews. Pre- and post-survey results indicate the lower the degree of sexual explicitness, the greater the perceived appeal. In terms of gender differences, {{women are more likely}} than men to rank non-sexual advertisements as appealing. In contrast, men are more likely to rank provocative advertisements as appealing.
