Eli asks Samuel what he had been told, insisting that he be told the whole truth, and so Samuel does; Eli reacts by saying that God will do as he judges best.|$|E

25|$|In their imaginative use of {{traditional}} iconography the artists {{put us in}} touch with a wealth of theological tradition that had developed over centuries and had marked with its symbols the meditative road into the depth dimension. Behind the pictures in these volumes we meet not only the theology of an individual Christian but also a theology expressive of the collective witness of many generations who drew their strength from the contemplation of the realities to which their symbols pointed. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> could prevent a miniature from the Hours of Catherine of Cleves from becoming an effective help of Christian meditation today.|$|E
25|$|The Attorney General is a non-cabinet {{minister}} {{who leads the}} Attorney General's Office. The rule that no Attorney General may be a cabinet minister is a political convention rather than a law, and {{for a short time}} the Attorney General did sit in cabinet, starting with Lord Birkenhead in 1915 and ending with Douglas Hogg in 1928. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> prohibits Attorneys-General from attending meetings of the cabinet, and on occasion they have been asked to attend meetings to advise the government on the best course of action legally. Despite this it is considered preferable to exclude Attorneys General from cabinet meetings so as to draw a distinct line between them and the political decisions on which they are giving legal advice. As a government minister, the Attorney General is directly answerable to Parliament.|$|E
25|$|US {{officials}} believe that al-Qaeda was helping organize {{a campaign of}} terror in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan. Their strategy was to force Pakistan to move its troops to the border with India, thereby relieving pressure on al-Qaeda elements hiding in northwestern Pakistan. In 2006 al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir; this has worried the Indian government. However the Indian Army Lt. Gen. H.S. Panag, GOC-in-C Northern Command, said to reporters that the army has ruled out the presence of al-Qaeda in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir; furthermore he said that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> can verify reports from the media of al-Qaeda presence in the state. He however stated that al-Qaeda had strong ties with Kashmiri militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed based in Pakistan. It has been noted that Waziristan has now become the new battlefield for Kashmiri militants fighting NATO in support of al-Qaeda and Taliban. Dhiren Barot, who wrote the Army of Madinah in Kashmir and was an al-Qaeda operative convicted for involvement in the 2004 financial buildings plot, had received training in weapons and explosives at a militant training camp in Kashmir.|$|E

500|$|In {{one of the}} few {{negative}} reviews, Brian Gibson of Vue Weekly {{described the}} film as [...] "deadly dull" [...] and a [...] "visual overstatement". Other reviews criticised the decision to split the novel into two cinematic parts, with Ben Mortimer of The Daily Telegraph writing [...] "Deathly Hallows– Part 2 isn't a film. It's HALF a film... it's going to feel somewhat emotionless." [...] Other critics wrote of the film's runtime; Alonso Duralde from The Wrap said, [...] "If there's one substantial flaw to the film, it's that this cavalcade of people and places and objects can barely fit in the 130-minute running time." [...] Rebecca Gillie from The Oxford Student gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "at the end of [...] <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> stays with you once you've left the cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|Technical {{director}} Lisa Forsell {{explained that}} {{to enhance the}} richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: [...] "Digital matte paintings are {{a way to get}} a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> is just throw-away." ...|$|E

But after ten minutes' farther continuation of these amenities, during which it did at last come home to his brain that she was merely laughing at him, he began to think that he might possibly escape, and leave her there in possession of his chamber.|$|R

500|$|Not all reviewers {{gave the}} film {{positive}} reviews. New York magazine's David Edelstein claimed {{in his review}} to [...] "have no idea what {{so many people are}} raving about. It's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and—hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype—a metaphor for itself." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer explained the film's development as [...] "pretty much what we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times commented [...] "there is a lot to see in Inception, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan's idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, and too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness." [...] David Denby, writing in The New Yorker, considered the film not nearly as much fun as Nolan imagined it to be, concluding, [...] "Inception is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else." ...|$|E
500|$|Southey {{intended}} Madoc {{to rival}} {{the works of}} Homer, and Coleridge believed that the poem {{would be better than}} the Aeneid. However, Madoc received mixed reviews from critics; while one critic believed it was comparable to John Milton's Paradise Lost, another felt that it was unreadable. In letter written by William Wordsworth on 3 June 1805, he claimed that he was [...] "highly pleased with it; it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced, and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much, except perhaps young Llewllyn whose situation is highly interesting, and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece [...] The Poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind Imagination in the true sense of the word, and knowledge of human Nature and human heart. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> shows the hand of the great Master". He followed this with a letter on 29 July 1805 saying [...] "Southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a Hero. The character of Madoc is often very insipid and contemptible [...] In short, according to my notion, the character is throughout languidly conceived". Dorothy Wordsworth, William's sister, wrote on 11 June 1805 to claim that [...] "We have read Madoc with great delight [...] I had one painful feeling throughout, that I did not care as much about Madoc as the Author wished me to do, and that the characters in general are not sufficiently distinct to make them have a separate after-existence in my affection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Observers often {{identified}} Bloom with deconstruction in the past, but {{he himself}} never admitted to sharing {{more than a}} few ideas with the deconstructionists. He told Robert Moynihan in 1983, [...] "What I think I have in common with the school of deconstruction is the mode of negative thinking or negative awareness, in the technical, philosophical sense of the negative, but which comes to me through negative theology...

2500|$|As part of {{the broad}} musical {{education}} given her by her father, Clara Wieck learned to compose, and from childhood to middle age she produced a good body of work.
