5|$|Construction of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter began {{seven months}} after the {{official}} announcement, in January 2008. By July, the Flying Unicorn and Enchanted Oak Tavern were closed. The Flying Unicorn then began an almost two-year refurbishment which transformed it into the Flight of the Hippogriff. The Enchanted Oak Tavern was later demolished. A bridge was built to connect The Lost Continent with Jurassic Park allowing guests to avoid the construction zone that was to become the Wizarding World. Construction progressed with the Hogwarts Castle slowly taking shape. By September 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Dueling</b> Dragons entrance was moved to Jurassic Park {{to make room for}} construction of Hogsmeade. One month later, the old entrance was demolished. By September 2009, the top shell of Hogwarts Castle was completed. On September 15, an announcement was made detailing what was going {{to be included in the}} Wizarding World. In early 2010, Universal increased its marketing of the area, which included newspaper advertisements, billboards and television commercials. <b>The</b> <b>Dueling</b> Dragons were closed for some maintenance before being transformed into the Dragon Challenge. Construction was completed by June 1, 2010, when the area began soft openings.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, there were two {{accidents}} (one serious) caused by what {{is believed to be}} loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster. The most serious accident was when a man got struck with an object and had to get his eye removed due to the amount of damage. On the same day that the man got hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove <b>the</b> <b>dueling</b> aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E

50|$|Players {{started the}} game off {{with their first}} duel with a set number of {{ammunition}} for their weapons; the player’s robot had {{a total of three}} weapons indicated by all three buttons on the controller. Once the player completed <b>the</b> <b>duel,</b> they would go through a type of Bonus Stage that would qualify them for <b>the</b> next <b>duel</b> as well as increase their score and money. Players could then purchase more ammunition or even new weapons for their robot at a local shop. Players had to time their attacks and aim precisely for key locations of their opponents body. Some enemies could regenerate missing parts of their body (including their head) while some enemies depended on particular mechanical parts to evade fire.If the player ran out of ammunition for all their weapons before <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> was over, they would lose a life and restart <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> over (with <b>the</b> same amount of ammunition they started <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> with). If <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> timer ran out before <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> was over, <b>the</b> player would also lose a life and restart <b>the</b> <b>duel.</b>|$|R

After a {{month of}} fighting, which left 33 people dead, President Mahmoud Abbas attempted to incorporate the Hamas-led Executive Force into the security apparatus loyal to the president. Hamas rejected Abbas' order, and instead announced plans to double {{the size of its}} force. On 6 January 2007, Abbas outlawed the Executive Force and ordered its disbandment. Fighting continued until a cease-fire was implemented on 30 January. <b>The</b> <b>dueling</b> announcements raised the prospect of an intensified armed standoff. Abbas's only means of enforcing the order appeared to be coercive action by police and security units under his command, which were relatively weak in the Gaza Strip, Hamas's stronghold.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the duel, Zaretsky gets {{several more}} chances to prevent the duel from happening. Because dueling was {{forbidden}} in the Russian Empire, duels were always held at dawn. Zaretsky urges Lensky to get ready shortly after 6o'clock in the morning (chapter 6, stanza XXIII), while the sun only rises at 20 past 8, because he expects Onegin to be on time. However, Onegin oversleeps (chapter 6, stanza XXIV), and arrives on the scene more than an hour late. According to <b>the</b> <b>dueling</b> codex, if a duelist arrives more than 15 minutes late, he automatically forfeits the duel. Lensky and Zaretsky have been waiting all that time (chapter 6, stanza XXVI), even though it was Zaretsky's duty to proclaim Lensky as winner and take him home.|$|E

50|$|Practices varied, however, {{but unless}} the {{challenger}} {{was of a}} higher social standing, such as a baron or prince challenging a knight, the person being challenged was allowed to decide the time and weapons used in <b>the</b> <b>duel.</b> <b>The</b> offended party could stop <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> at any time if he deemed his honour satisfied.

500|$|The EP has {{received}} generally mediocre reaction from critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{wrote that the}} EP doesn't have many [...] "first-rate songs" [...] and that only [...] "99 Ways to Die" [...] made an impression. The Rolling Stone Album Guide was dismissive of the EP; the staff reviewer commented that the album is worth hearing only for [...] "99 Ways to Die". Dean Golemis of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the album is [...] "typical Megadeth" [...] featuring [...] "fast-forward riffing" [...] and [...] "snooty snarling" [...] vocals. Carlos Ramirez from Noisecreep felt that the album contains many underrated songs that [...] "also deserve {{their time in the}} spotlight" [...] and highlighted <b>the</b> <b>dueling</b> guitar leads by Mustaine and Friedman featured in [...] "Go to Hell".

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{treats the}} historical, cultural, and rhetorical functions of dueling in Southern Literature. Southern writers explore {{the role of}} <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> 2 ̆ 7 s codified violence in sustaining the oppression of African-Americans, women, and poor whites. These writers also employ <b>the</b> <b>duel,</b> with its emphasis upon ritualized insults, challenges, replies, and silences, {{to examine the relationship}} between violence and language. ^ Chapter one provides the historical background for the literary analysis of subsequent chapters, exploring how southern gentlemen embraced the aristocratic pretensions of <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> while northerners largely abandoned the practice. Chapter two explores the apologistic writing by William Gilmore Simms who uses <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> as a measure of inherent nobility for his characters. Chapter three reveals the manner by which E. D. E. N. Southworth and Augusta Jane Evans conflate the language of <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> with <b>the</b> language of seduction to critique the relationship between male power and the oppression of women. Chapter four examines a similar use of rhetoric by Thomas Bangs Thorpe, Mark Twain, and George Washington Cable who explore the formalized violence of dueling as a justification for the brutality perpetrated against slaves. In chapter five, an analysis of <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> in works by Thomas Nelson Page and William Faulkner reveals the ambivalence of post-bellum writers to <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> 2 ̆ 7 s simultaneously aristocratic and barbaric manifestations. Chapter six examines the modern literary perception of <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> by Robert Penn Warren, who rejects the tradition of a southern romanticism that <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> helped to perpetuate. ^ Viewed in the light of these authors, <b>the</b> <b>duel</b> becomes an extended metaphor for the structures of power that create, and ruthlessly sustain, the social position of the white elite. ...|$|R

500|$|The {{video was}} {{developed}} {{as an independent}} Madonna clip devoid of any footage from the Bond film, but was still Bond-inspired. It portrayed Madonna in a torture chamber as a prisoner and also fight sequences where the singer duels with herself. Post-production and visual effects for the video was done by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC). They created [...] "invisible" [...] effects for the fighting sequences, allowing Madonna to shoot two characters. Traktor explained that every shot of the video used some visual effects, co-ordinated by the group's lead artist, Christophe Allender. The directors {{did not want to}} use too many shots for <b>the</b> <b>dueling</b> scenes, which they believed would have restricted their creative freedom. Additional post-production effects included composing the fight sequence as a cohesive theme, adding blood to the wounds inflicted on Madonna, and adding digital stills of windows against the greenscreen where the shots were taken. The final shot showed the characteristic gun barrel sequence from the Bond films. MPC artist Ziggy Zigouras used a 2K resolution shot and tailored it according to Traktor's specifications. Finally, instead of grading the film print, MPC used the negatives to achieve crisper and cleaner images.|$|E

[...] "Blind" [...] is about Davis' drug problems (mostly amphetamines) and how he would feel scattered when he was under the influence. Davis told Metal Hammer that on the album's second track, [...] "Ball Tongue", he [...] "didn't sing a goddamn word in that song. I couldn't describe what I wanted to do, so that's how it came out.

He either had a pierced tongue or had a wart on his tongue and he gave Korn a really hard time. [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] is about how many nursery rhymes have dark meanings. The song explores the concept of nursery rhymes. Davis relates: [...] "'Shoots and Ladders' uncovers the hidden messages in nursery rhymes, the first songs many of us ever hear. 'Shoots and Ladders', to set the record straight, calls out nursery rhymes for what they really are. I choose each rhyme for a different reason—'Baa Baa Black Sheep' has racist overtones. 'London Bridge' talks of all the people of London dying (from the Black Plague, as does 'Ring Around the Roses').
