5|$|Lysacek {{ended his}} season {{by winning the}} bronze medal at the 2006 World Championships in Calgary, Alberta. He was once again troubled by illness, having been {{administered}} three different antibiotics to fight a bacterial infection, which at one point, caused him <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> <b>up</b> blood. He rose from seventh place in the short to finish third {{on the strength of}} his free-skating program. After the World Championships, Lysacek toured with Champions on Ice as a full member of the cast.|$|E
25|$|Following this defeat, Aerts regained some of {{the weight}} {{that he had lost}} for his match against dreadlocked karate man Ewerton Teixeira at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 in Seoul Final 16 on October 2, 2010. A close match, it was decided by an extra round {{unanimous}} decision (10-9, 10-9, 10-9) in favour of Aerts who then qualified for the K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 Final on December 11. In his 17th appearance at the K-1 WGP, he defeated Mighty Mo by first-round KO in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals, he {{came face to face with}} his archrival Semmy Schilt, in a fight where he was a huge underdog due to his age and Schilt's success in the 2009 Grand Prix. After being cut above the eye and finishing the fight with a swollen face, Aerts won a brilliantly fought decision. However, he had taken a lot of damage in the fight with Schilt and started <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> <b>up</b> blood in his changing room after the fight. He was overwhelmed by a less damaged and much fitter and bigger Alistair Overeem and lost by first-round TKO. Though he was defeated, he broke three world records in K-1: He became the oldest man (at 40 years old) to ever make it to the K-1 World Grand Prix Final, he marked the most amount of appearances (6) that any fighter had ever made it to the Final, and also became the first person to ever beat Semmy Schilt in a tournament.|$|E

2500|$|The Dublin {{section of}} the Grand Canal was opened on 23 April 1796, while Portobello Harbour came into use in 1801. [...] In 1812 Richmond Basin, Portobello, (later called the [...] "City Basin"), located between Lennox Street and the canal, was opened as a water {{reservoir}} for {{the south side of}} the city. From 1860 investigations of the water quality coming from the Basin showed that it was not up to standard – in particular, levels of sulphuric acid were relatively high. Public representatives from Rathmines were unwilling <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> <b>up</b> the necessary money for a new water-works, but the will of the majority prevailed, and the new Vartry Reservoir was completed in 1863.|$|E

2500|$|The {{underlying}} {{principle of}} medieval medicine was {{the theory of}} humours. This {{was derived from the}} ancient medical works, and dominated all western medicine until the 19th century. The theory stated that within every individual there were four humours, or principal fluids - black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood, these were produced by various organs in the body, and they had to be in balance for a person to remain healthy. [...] Too much phlegm in the body, for example, caused lung problems; and the body tried <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> <b>up</b> the phlegm to restore a balance. The balance of humours in humans could be achieved by diet, medicines, and by blood-letting, using leeches. The four humours were also associated with the four seasons, black bile-autumn, yellow bile-summer, phlegm-winter and blood-spring.|$|E

2500|$|If water {{enters the}} airways of a {{conscious}} person, the person will try <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> <b>up</b> {{the water or}} swallow it, often inhaling more water involuntarily. [...] When water enters the larynx or trachea, both conscious and unconscious persons experience laryngospasm, in which the vocal cords constrict, sealing the airway. [...] This prevents water from entering the lungs. Because of this laryngospasm, in the initial phase of drowning, water generally enters the stomach and very little water enters the lungs. Though laryngospasm prevents water from entering the lungs, it also interferes with breathing. In most persons, the laryngospasm relaxes some time after unconsciousness and water can then enter the lungs causing a [...] "wet drowning". [...] However, about 7–10% of people maintain this seal until cardiac arrest. This has been called [...] "dry drowning", as no water enters the lungs. [...] In forensic pathology, water in the lungs indicates that the person was still alive {{at the point of}} submersion. Absence of water in the lungs may be either a dry drowning or indicates a death before submersion.|$|E
2500|$|July {{would see}} much {{turnover}} in the roster as the Cardinals struggled {{to regain their}} equilibrium. On July 5 Jeff Weaver was acquired from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in a trade, and two days later, Sidney Ponson, previously plagued with injuries and ineffectiveness and demoted to the bullpen, was released. At {{the end of the}} month, St. Louis traded Héctor Luna to Cleveland for Ronnie Belliard, who took the second base job that Luna and Miles had shared, and acquired relief pitcher Jorge Sosa from Atlanta for a minor leaguer. Chris Duncan started getting more and more playing time in the outfield and responded with a [...]324 average for the month. In other developments, Jason Marquis, who gave up thirteen runs in a start against the White Sox in June, gave up twelve runs in a 14-5 disaster against the Atlanta Braves on July 18. Marquis became the first big-league pitcher since Chubby Dean of the 1940 Philadelphia Athletics <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> <b>up</b> twelve runs in a game twice in the same season.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThree {{patients}} with very similar clinical symptoms, i. e. hemoptysis and <b>coughing</b> <b>up</b> of staples {{some time after}} volume-reducing surgery, are described. There was no deterioration in lung function, nor in the patient's well-being, which could be ascribed <b>to</b> the <b>coughing</b> <b>up</b> of the staples. Thus, staples can some time after volume reducing surgery erode out into the bronchi and be <b>coughed</b> <b>up,</b> often with some small amounts of blood. This has no clinical significance other than the disturbing symptoms. Possibly, the calf pericardium used as strenghtener of the suture lines will with time cause an immunological reaction, causing destruction of the foreign material and thereby dislodging the staples...|$|R
50|$|Local {{symptoms}} {{may occur}} {{due to the}} mass of the tumor or its ulceration. For example, mass effects from lung cancer can block the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia; esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult or painful to swallow; and colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel, affecting bowel habits. Masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps. Ulceration can cause bleeding that, if it occurs in the lung, will lead <b>to</b> <b>coughing</b> <b>up</b> blood, in the bowels to anemia or rectal bleeding, in the bladder to blood in the urine and in the uterus to vaginal bleeding. Although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer, the initial swelling is usually painless. Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen.|$|R

50|$|Ascaris lumbricoides, a roundworm, infects humans when an {{ingested}} fertilised egg {{becomes a}} larval worm (called rhabditiform larva) that penetrates {{the wall of}} the duodenum and enters the blood stream. From there, it is carried to the liver and heart, and enters pulmonary circulation to break free in the alveoli, where it grows and molts. In three weeks, the larva passes from the respiratory system <b>to</b> be <b>coughed</b> <b>up,</b> swallowed, and thus returned to the small intestine, where it matures to an adult male or female worm. Fertilization can now occur and the female produces as many as 200,000 eggs per day for a year. These fertilized eggs become infectious after two weeks in soil; they can persist in soil for 10 years or more.|$|R
