50|$|By 1950, {{the company}} entered the Canadian market. The company also {{researched}} and patented Dianodic, including a zinc-Dianodic, to combat pitting and <b>tuberculation</b> in industrial cooling water systems. Also in the 1950s, sales passed the $2 million-per-year mark.|$|E
50|$|Shells of Calycoceras asiaticum {{may reach}} a {{diameter}} of about 20 cm. The larger phragmocones may reach 59 - 72 mm in diameter. Coiling is moderately involute. All ribs show strong subspinose tubercles. C. asiaticum asiaticum and C. asiaticum spinosum are very similar, the latter has much more robust <b>tuberculation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Oregonia bifurca can {{be readily}} {{distinguished}} from O. gracilis in having shorter rostral horns that curve away from each other, triangular postorbital spines closer to the eyes and pointing more forward, a wider {{front end of the}} carapace, and long and slender dactyli on their walking legs. The <b>tuberculation</b> in O. bifurca is finer than in O. gracilis.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell is}} white, {{with a broad}} {{chestnut}} band below the periphery. The <b>tuberculations</b> of the periphery are often long, spinose. There is usually arevolving row of nodules below {{the middle of the}} body whorl.|$|R

50|$|The size of {{an adult}} shell varies between 15 mm and 30 mm. The shell is white, with a broad {{chestnut}} band below the periphery. The <b>tuberculations</b> of the periphery are short. There is usually a revolving row of nodules below {{the middle of the}} body whorl.|$|R
50|$|Pachydiscidae {{species are}} {{moderate}} to large in size, evolute to rather involute, and vary in section from inflated and depressed to high-whorled and compressed. They are {{distinguished from the}} Desmoceratidae by strong ribbing at some growth stage, that normally crosses the venter uninterrupted, and by the tendency to develop strong <b>tuberculation,</b> {{at least on the}} umbilical shoulder.|$|E
50|$|Species in {{the genus}} Conus sensu stricto {{can be found}} in the {{tropical}} and subtropical seas of the world, at depths ranging from the sublittoral to 1,000 m. They are very variable in some of their characters, such as the <b>tuberculation</b> of the spire and body whorl, striae, colors and the pattern of coloring. Many fossil species have been described; they are extensively distributed, and first appear in Cretaceous strata.|$|E
50|$|Golden ghost crabs {{can easily}} be {{distinguished}} from all other species by their large size, their golden yellow colouration, and the rough <b>tuberculation</b> on their claws. The only similarly sized species {{in the region is}} the horned ghost crab, which are also easily distinguishable as they are the only ghost crab in Australia exhibiting spikes (exophthalmy) on the tips of their eyestalks. Younger individuals may be identified through the examination of their stridulating ridges and the shape of their gonopods.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{an adult}} shell varies between 12 mm and 24 mm. G.W. Tryon thought this species to be a synonym of Clavus pulchella (Reeve, 1845) (described as Drillia pulchella). He stated that the {{differences}} were only in the <b>tuberculations</b> being less sharp and the color not so bright, with a brownish tinge.|$|R
40|$|An adult female hairworm was vomited from a {{domestic}} {{dog with a}} cough in Hiroshima Prefecture. The worm body was long and slender, measuring 42. 5 cm in length and 1 mm in maximum width. The specimen showed microscopically the smooth cuticular without <b>tuberculations.</b> This case is the first record of Gordius sp. infection in a dog in Japan...|$|R
50|$|The {{body has}} a rough {{appearance}} because the dorsal scale keels are accentuated into protuberances or <b>tuberculations.</b> This is most apparent {{on the scale}} rows {{on either side of}} the body with a decreasing intensity in the lower rows. The vertebral scales are about as prominently keeled as the fourth row down on the flanks (with the vertebral scales as the first row).|$|R
50|$|A {{suite of}} species {{attributed}} to Schloenbachia {{have been described}} from Upper Cretaceous sediments in California and Oregon (Chico Formation and equivalents), including among others Schloenbachia chicoensis, S. knighteni, S. multicostata, S. oregonensis, and S. siskiyouensis. These differ {{in the nature of}} the ribbing, <b>tuberculation,</b> and keel as well as the degree of compression or inflation of the shell.Most come from northern California and Oregon, however two species Schloenbachia knighteni and Schloenbachia siskiyouensis have been found in the coastal mountains in southern California east of Santa Anna.|$|E
50|$|Ductile Iron is {{commonly}} used in place of cast iron pipe for fluid distribution systems, the idea of lining the formerly cast iron and currently ductile iron was put into practice {{for the first time}} in Charleston, South Carolina in 1922. The purpose of installing a cement/mortar lining to the interior wall of the pipe is to reduce the process of <b>tuberculation</b> inside the pipe network. The cement/mortar lining provides an area of high pH near the pipe wall and provides a barrier between the water and the pipe, reducing its susceptibility to corrosion.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{shape of}} {{the main body of}} the shell is oblong or conical. In the oblong form, it has a {{protuberance}} in the middle, but tapers at each end. The upper portion (the siphonal canal) is corkscrew-shaped, while the lower end (the spire) is twisted and tapering. Its colour is dull, and the surface is hard, brittle and translucent. Like all snail shells, the interior is hollow. The inner surfaces of the shell are very shiny, but the outer surface exhibits high <b>tuberculation.</b> In Hinduism, the shiny, white, soft shankha with pointed ends and heavy is the most sought after.|$|E
50|$|L. elvensis is {{the type}} species of Lepidotes. It was {{described}} by Ducrotay de Blainville in 1818. It is known from an almost complete specimen housed in the Paris Museum of Natural History. The specimen measures up to 75 cm long. The specimen is from the Upper Lias, in Bavaria. The specimens P. 7406, P. 7407, P. 7408, P. 2014, P. 2054, P. 3529a, P. 3529b, 18992, 18993/94 19662, 32421, and 32422 have all been assigned to this species. The external bones of this species are smooth, but some have sparsely-placed coarse <b>tuberculations</b> (protuberances). The frontal bone {{is more than twice}} the length of the parietal in the specimens. It also has a comparatively narrow marginal symphysis (articulation).|$|R

The new species is a small-sized Gracixalus (male snout-vent length ca. 22 mm) and is morphologically similar to G. gracilipes, but is easily distinguished from it by its dorsal tan color in life, absence of white spot on lower lip, and black markings on its foot webbing. The new species also clearly differs {{from all the other}} members of the genus by the combination of small body size, triangular snout, and light yellowish brown dorsum without distinct <b>tuberculations.</b> Problems of phylogeny and taxonomy of the genus Gracixalus are briefly discussed...|$|R

In R. traquairi, the rostrum is sharply pointed, {{extending}} beyond the snout, and the tubercles are small and irregularly placed. In R. tuberculatus, the rostrum is bluntly pointed, and the tubercles are large and plentiful. The species, R. parvulus, has a blunt rostrum that does not extend beyond the snout, and lacks <b>tuberculation</b> altogether. [...] The average skull length of R. traquairi is about 11 centimetres.

40|$|Abstract: The {{fossil record}} of the callianassid genus Glyptu-rus (Decapoda, Axiidea) is re-evaluated. Our {{systematic}} revi-sion, both of extant and fossil taxa, is based on major cheliped morphology only, thus providing an important impetus for palaeontological studies. Both spination and tu-berculation of chelipeds are herein considered of great taxo-nomic importance. Presence of spines on the upper margins of the merus and propodus and the lower margin of the car-pus are significant for generic assignment, whereas the extent of <b>tuberculation</b> on lateral surfaces of the propodus is impor-tant for assignment at the species level. Altogether, four extant and six exclusively fossil species of Glypturus are recognized. Several extinct callianassid taxa are now transferred to the genus, namely Callianassa berryi, Callianassa fraasi, Callian-assa munieri, Callianassa pugnax and Callianassa spinosa; Cal...|$|E
