50|$|For a {{long time}} the Egyptians' strategically-advantageous locale allowed them to remain free from enemy attacks. Egypt was {{considered}} to be peaceful in the ancient world. They never considered training an army for the sake of invasion or defense of their own province. During the 15th Dynasty, a tribe known to be the Hyksos surprised the Egyptians when they marched into Egypt in the Second Intermediate Period with chariots. At this time, weapons superior to those possessed by the Egyptians were being developed further away in Asia. Tribes using these new and sophisticated weapons started to conquer new lands and at the same <b>time</b> <b>exchange</b> their knowledge of weapons with other civilizations. The Hyksos were among these invaders. Many historians believe that the Hyksos came from Mesopotamia, although the exact location is still a mystery. The invaders used composite bows as well as improved recurve bows and arrowheads. Unlike the Sumerians, they had horse-drawn chariots and not donkeys, they wore mailed shirts and metal helmets. They were also armed with superior daggers and swords.Before the Hyksos invasion, the Egyptians did not have a cavalry because, it is believed, their small horses were not strong enough to support a rider. It was from the Hyksos charioteers that the use of horses in warfare was introduced to Egyptian culture. When, after a civil war with the Hyksos rulers, the Egyptians came to power once again, they continued to use horse-drawn chariots in their armies.|$|E

40|$|Being an estuary {{with the}} {{occasional}} appearance of hypoxia, the Pearl River estuary was selected to investigate its vertical exchange process by a validated 3 -D numerical model. The concept of vertical <b>exchange</b> <b>time</b> was used to quantify the vertical exchange process and was calculated by adding a conservative tracer to the hydrodynamic model. The results revealed vertical <b>exchange</b> <b>time</b> has significant seasonal variation modulated by seasonally changed external forcing, and has similar structure with spatial variation in salinity. During the wet season, remarkably long vertical <b>exchange</b> <b>times</b> (> 50 days) occurred at the lower estuary under 10 m depth, which was coincident with the frequently reported hypoxic zone. The entire Pearl River estuary was occupied by water mass with a vertical <b>exchange</b> <b>time</b> of < 5 days during the dry season, which indicated the estuary's health condition during this period. Further analyses revealed the seasonal trend of vertical <b>exchange</b> <b>time</b> was closely related with salinity stratification and river runoff in which the lowest vertical <b>exchange</b> <b>times</b> can be estimated by linear regressions in certain stages. Tide modulated these <b>exchange</b> <b>times</b> in different time scales. Spring tide better mixed the water column and thus facilitated the vertical exchange process compared with neap tide. As a result, minimum vertical <b>exchange</b> <b>time</b> during spring tide was about 10 days shorter than that during neap tide. Flood-ebb tide also modulated vertical <b>exchange</b> <b>time</b> in the Pearl River estuary.
