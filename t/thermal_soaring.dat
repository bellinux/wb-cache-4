50|$|Thermal lift {{is often}} used by birds, such as raptors, {{vultures}} and storks. Although thermal lift was known to the Wright Brothers in 1901, it was not exploited by humans until 1921 by William Leusch at the Wasserkuppe in Germany. It was not until about 1930 {{that the use of}} <b>thermals</b> for <b>soaring</b> in gliders became commonplace.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>soaring</b> uses {{columns of}} warm, rising air called {{thermals}} to provide lift for a glider. <b>Thermal</b> <b>soaring</b> gliders are normally launched with a bungee cord catapult, a winch or towed by a powered model aircraft. A discus launch glider (DLG) is simply launched {{into the air}} with a spinning motion much like a discus throw.|$|E

50|$|The Czerwiński Sparrow, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the de Havilland Canada glider, was a single seat glider, designed and built {{by a group of}} de Haviiland engineers in Canada in 1942. It was intended to popularise gliding and be suitable for both basic training and <b>thermal</b> <b>soaring.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used source of lift is created by the sun's energy heating the ground which in turn heats the air above it. This warm air rises in columns known as <b>thermals.</b> <b>Soaring</b> pilots quickly become aware of land features which can generate thermals and their trigger points downwind, because thermals have a surface tension with the ground and roll until hitting a trigger point. When the thermal lifts, the first indicator are the swooping birds feeding on the insects being carried aloft, or dust devils or a change in wind direction as the air is pulled in below the thermal. As the <b>thermal</b> climbs, bigger <b>soaring</b> birds indicate the thermal. The thermal rises until it either forms into a cumulus cloud or hits an inversion layer, {{which is where the}} surrounding air is becoming warmer with height, and stops the thermal developing into a cloud. Also, nearly every glider contains an instrument known as a variometer (a very sensitive vertical speed indicator) which shows visually (and often audibly) the presence of lift and sink. Having located a thermal, a glider pilot will circle within the area of rising air to gain height. In the case of a cloud street, thermals can line up with the wind, creating rows of thermals and sinking air. A pilot can use a cloud street to fly long straight-line distances by remaining in the row of rising air.|$|R
50|$|The Gnome {{made its}} first flight, under aero-tow, on 1 May 1955. It handled safely and well but its {{performance}} was as poor as Schneider had predicted; its low aspect ratio wing producing high drag at the low speeds used in <b>thermals.</b> No <b>soaring</b> flights were made. During 1955, some alterations {{were made to the}} fuselage to clear the tail from the ground. When the Gnome was offered for manufacture in kit form no definite orders were received and development ended in 1956. The sole prototype then flew with the Port Pirie gliding club.|$|R
500|$|A {{fibrous layer}} {{deep in the}} breast muscles can hold the wings rigidly {{horizontal}} for gliding and soaring. Thus they use <b>thermals</b> for <b>soaring</b> to heights of 3000m (10,000ft) or more, combined both with gliding and with flapping flight in V formation, to commute distances of up to [...] to feeding areas. Pelicans also fly low (or [...] "skim") over stretches of water, using a phenomenon known as ground effect to reduce drag and increase lift. As the air flows between the wings and the water surface it is compressed to a higher density and exerts a stronger upward force against the bird above. Hence substantial energy is saved while flying.|$|R
50|$|Nanolights are {{somewhat}} slower than purpose-built microlights. Because {{they are so}} light, they are often used for <b>thermal</b> <b>soaring.</b> The engine is used to launch the aircraft to a safe altitude and to find a thermal. It is then turned off and the pilot uses thermal lift alone to gain altitude.|$|E

50|$|White storks {{rely on the}} uplift of air <b>thermals</b> to <b>soar</b> and glide {{the long}} {{distances}} of their annual migrations between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. For many, the shortest route would take them over the Mediterranean Sea; however, since air thermals do not form over water, they generally detour over land to avoid the trans-Mediterranean flights that would require prolonged energetic wing flapping. It {{has been estimated that}} flapping flight metabolises 23 times more body fat than soaring flight per distance travelled. Thus, flocks spiral upwards on rising warm air until they emerge at the top, up to 1200 - 1500 m above the ground (though one record from Western Sudan observed an altitude of 3300 m).|$|R
50|$|The Akaflieg Darmstadt D-28 Windspiel (Italian Greyhound) was a single-seat, {{high-performance}} sailplane {{designed in}} Germany {{in the early}} 1930s. Intended to exploit a growing understanding of <b>thermal</b> <b>soaring,</b> it was small and manoeuvrable, with a 12 m span; silk-covered for lightness, it weighed less (empty) than its pilots. It held the world straight-line distance record {{for a time in}} 1934.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, <b>thermal</b> <b>soaring</b> birds, such as Rüppell's vultures, tend to {{have much}} smaller wing {{loadings}} and aspect ratios. Because the fastest rising air occurs {{in the center of}} a thermal, these birds optimize their flight behavior by achieving very tight turning radii. In other words, these birds {{tend to have}} smaller wings relative to body mass, which renders them less stable in gliding but gives them much more maneuverability so that they are capable of executing very tight turns.|$|E

500|$|Pelicans are [...] and nest colonially. Pairs are monogamous for {{a single}} season, but the pair bond extends only to the nesting area; mates are {{independent}} away from the nest. The ground-nesting (white) species have a complex communal courtship involving a group of males chasing a single female in the air, on land, or in the water while pointing, gaping, and thrusting their bills at each other. They can finish the process in a day. The tree-nesting species have a simpler process in which perched males advertise for females. The location of the breeding colony is constrained by the availability of an ample supply of fish to eat, although pelicans can use <b>thermals</b> to <b>soar</b> and commute for hundreds of kilometres daily to fetch food.|$|R

It is {{approximately}} 10 miles from State College and approximately midway between Altoona and Lock Haven in the Bald Eagle Valley. Visitors can look at an entire wall of U.S. National and World records that have been set from this airfield.|$|R
50|$|It {{does not}} {{generally}} migrate far, {{at least not}} out of its breeding range; but usually makes short migratory movements which are influenced by rainfall. It makes local movements in Kenya and has also been found to migrate from North to South Sudan with the rainy season. It may also migrate regularly to and from South Africa. However, little is actually known about this bird’s general migratory movements. Due to apparent observed variation in migratory patterns throughout Africa, the yellow-billed stork has been termed a facultative nomad. It may migrate simply to avoid areas where water or rainfall conditions are too high or too low for feeding on prey. Some populations migrate considerable distances between feeding or breeding sites; usually by using <b>thermals</b> to <b>soar</b> and glide. Other local populations {{have been found to}} be sedentary and remain in their respective habitats all year round.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{time after}} the riot the Navy cut {{trenches}} across the Runways at Hourglass Field. The field was no longer useful {{for any kind of}} racing but became a popular spot for radio-controlled model aircraft, especially <b>thermal</b> <b>soaring</b> gliders flown by members of the Torrey Pines Gulls R/C Soaring Society, through the 1980s. In 1969 Miramar College opened on the site of Hourglass Field as a training facility for San Diego law enforcement and firefighting personnel.

5000|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>soaring</b> {{is often}} {{combined}} with slope soaring. Thermals from elsewhere can drift {{in over the}} hill to combine with the hill lift or they can be formed by the hill itself, if the slope is angled to the sun causing the slope to heat up faster than in the surrounding areas. The resulting warm air will then flow upwards pulling in air from the valley below, causing a wind up the slope. The lift is thus a combination of ridge lift and thermal. This has produced a new term, [...] "slermal", to describe the mixture of both slope lift and thermal activity coming up the hill face.|$|E
50|$|The {{turkey vulture}} is awkward {{on the ground}} with an ungainly, hopping walk. It {{requires}} a great deal of effort to take flight, flapping its wings while pushing off the ground and hopping with its feet. While soaring, the turkey vulture holds its wings in a shallow V-shape and often tips from side to side, frequently causing the gray flight feathers to appear silvery as they catch the light. The flight of the turkey vulture is an example of static soaring flight, in which it flaps its wings very infrequently, and takes advantage of rising <b>thermals</b> to stay <b>soaring.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bacchus Marsh {{airfield}} (YBSS) is {{the largest}} gliding site in the southern hemisphere, and double the size of other gliding facilities in Australia. The site {{offers a variety of}} <b>soaring</b> conditions. <b>Thermal</b> conditions enable <b>soaring</b> for most of the year, and are sufficiently reliable to enable cross country flying from September to April. Late in the afternoon though, lift can be damped with sea breeze fronts moving in from the south east. The higher terrain to the north and north west can lead to the development of wave and ridge lift especially during the winter months. Frontal lift is also frequently seen at the site.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{training}} starts {{regularly in the}} winter months with theoretical education. The practical training starts during spring and summer mainly using the glider L-23 Super Blanik or G-103 Twin Astir. The continuative and sport training is intended for the GLD qualification holders. The student pilots gradually gain the knowledge of flying in the <b>thermals</b> or dynamic <b>soaring</b> near the slopes. Pilots gradually converse to single seated gliders with higher performance. The purpose of the training is to prepare the pilots for sport soaring in such way that the pilot is able to obtain the silver FAI-D badge. Sport pilots of Aeroclub Zbraslavice participate regularly in many soaring competitions, they {{are members of the}} Czech national soaring team and gradually reach exceptional results.|$|R

5000|$|F3B is the {{original}} sailplane competition category defined by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). Originally called [...] "Thermal Soaring" [...] it is now called [...] "Multitask Soaring." [...] F3B is a flat field, <b>thermal</b> <b>soaring</b> category where the glider is launched {{with the help of}} an electric winch. There are three tasks to perform. Thermal duration, where the goal is to keep flying for 10 minutes and land on the spot; distance, flying the maximum number of laps in four minutes; and speed, flying the minimum time to cover four laps of 150 m each. The three tasks have to be flown with the same plane, changing only weight between tasks. Duration is flown at the minimum weight, typically around 2 kg. Speed is flown up to the maximum of 5 kg but typically around 3-4 kg depending on the wind and lift. Distance can be flown at a wide variety of weights, depending on the thermal conditions available. Heavier to fly faster and lighter to fly slower.|$|E
50|$|As {{understanding}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>soaring</b> {{grew in the}} 1930s, glider pilots and designers became aware of two conflicting requirements for cross country flights. The aircraft needed good climb characteristics and low stalling speeds to enable tight turns within thermals but high speeds in the sinking air between them. These respectively called for low and high wing loadings on wings with high and low camber. Several designs, e.g. the 1938 Akaflieg Hannover AFH-4 and the later LET L-13 Blaník and Beatty-Johl BJ-2, had added large area slotted Fowler flaps on the inner part of the wing to increase camber and add area when extended. These satisfactorily reduced stall speed {{and with it the}} turn radius, but disappointed hopes of improving climb rates because of vortex generation (induced drag) at the tips of the flaps, seriously decreasing the lift to drag ratio. A solution to this problem was to extend the whole trailing edge, including the ailerons, and this route was taken by both the disappointing, heavy and complicated Operation Sigma Sigma, the more successful but still heavy and complex Akaflieg München Mü27 and the World Championship winning 15 m class Akaflieg Braunschweig SB-11.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using <b>thermals</b> to <b>soar</b> in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|R

40|$|Bats seldom soar {{because it}} is {{behaviour}} generally {{associated with the use}} of thermals, which are normally of insuf®cient strength at night to support the behaviour. Daylight ¯ying bats, however, such as the Samoan ¯ying fox Pteropus samoensis may be able to exploit <b>thermals</b> for <b>soaring.</b> This may give the bats one of two advantages. It may reduce the energy costs of transport because gliding ¯ight is much cheaper than active ¯apping ¯ight. However, because less endogenous heat is generated by soaring, a second advantage may be that it reduces the thermal stress placed on these bats. Thermal stress is a factor that we have shown previously probably constrains the daylight ¯ying behaviour of this species. Observations of the patterns of soaring behaviour at two sites on American Samoa in March and October 1995 supported the predictions of the energy saving but not the hyperthermia avoidance hypothesis. Soaring was a common behaviour under all conditions and was used extensively when conditions did not pose a threat of hyperthermia. In March, the bats also adopted ¯ight patterns over time that exposed them to areas of the valleys where insolation was greatest, presumably increasing their risk of hyperthermia but bringing energy saving bene®ts. Modelling the expected heat ¯ows during soaring and ¯apping ¯ight using an established model revealed that soaring reduced the risk of hyperthermia, when ¯ying in the shade of clouds, because of the energy savings resulting from reduced endogenous heat production. However, when soaring in sunlight, these savings are more than offset by the increased exogenous heat uptake, because a greater proportion of the wing surface is exposed when soaring. Despite its low endogenous energy cost, soaring in sunlight is not thermally advantageous, and the behaviour of the bats re¯ected this fact.
