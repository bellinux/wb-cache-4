Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed free intraabdominal fluid. The urethragram showed spreading contrast material into the abdominal cavity. Laparoscopic exploration revealed a 3 -cm-length perforation {{at the top of the}} bladder. The injury was repaired in a two fold fashion. Post-operative follow-up was uneventful. The second case was a 3 -year-old boy fell from the second floor of his house on the ground. He had <b>traumatic</b> <b>lesion</b> on his lower abdomen and a pelvic fracture. Due to bloody urine drainage, a cystography was performed and an extravasation from the dome of the bladder into the peritoneum was detected. On laparoscopy, a 3 -cm long vertical perforation at the dome of the bladder was found. The perforation was repaired in two layers with intracorporeal suture technique.

40|$|<b>Traumatic</b> <b>lesions</b> are {{commonly}} found in archaeological skeletal samples and provide useful information about various behavioral and cultural aspects of the populations. Our aim was to evaluate {{the relationship between the}} distribution and types of skeletal <b>traumatic</b> <b>lesions</b> and the different life-styles of past populations. We examined three necropolises in central Italy. Pozzilli (VI–IV century BC) and Quadrella (I–IV century AD) are from the same geographical area (Molise) but belong to different periods; Novilara (IX–VI century BC) is located in Marche but belongs to the Iron Age like Pozzilli. The lesions observed at Pozzilli seem not to be accidental, whereas the traumas observed at Quadrella can be attributed to occasional, unintentional events. Cranial injuries observed at Novilara strengthen the hypothesis that the population was composed, at least in part, of warriors.

30|$|It was {{possible}} to find evidence for skeletal <b>traumatic</b> <b>lesions</b> {{in a total of}} 70 skeletons. Of these ten percent (7 individuals) had a <b>traumatic</b> skeletal <b>lesion</b> in one of the four body regions examined (head, arms, legs and torso). It appears that the legs were the least affected region of the body and the arms the most affected. Of the seven individuals with <b>traumatic</b> skeletal <b>lesions,</b> four had lesions in only one region, two had lesions in two regions and one skeleton showed <b>traumatic</b> <b>lesions</b> in three regions of the body. This last individual was attacked and killed by numerous blows with a sharp instrument. The frequency of trauma was virtually the same for men and women (p =  0.92) and individuals with and without <b>traumatic</b> skeletal <b>lesions</b> died at very similar ages (p =  0.27). The sample comes from a rather special cemetery: the individuals paid to be buried in the cloister walk of a friary, but they still had to be worthy of praise as devoted Catholics. It is therefore less likely they died as a consequence of violence or that they committed suicide. In this light the low level of skeletal trauma caused by violence is to be expected. The case of the USD 295 is an exception to the rule, as his unusual trauma proves.|$|R

40|$|Background and objectivesThe SCI Community Survey is {{the largest}} {{consumer}} survey of its type ever undertaken in Canada (n= 1549 participants including 412 with a non-traumatic lesion). The primary aim was to identify the most salient needs for services after returning to community living. MethodThirteen domains were identified as relevant for the Survey, including home accessibility, personal services, transportation, healthcare and job training. ResultsData showed that expressed needs for services are higher in participants with <b>traumatic</b> <b>lesion</b> compared to non-traumatic lesion (ex. : technical aids and equipment, 93 % vs. 82 % short-distance transportation, 87 % vs. 77 %, housing accessibility 86 % vs. 71) suggesting more incapacities in people with <b>traumatic</b> <b>lesion.</b> The percentage of participants with met needs (to a great extent or completely) exceeded 70 % for needs related to transportation, housing accessibility, technical aids and equipment, general health care and personal services. However, less than 50 % of participants considered needs related to emotional counselling, recreation and leisure, income support as fulfilled. These proportions do not differ between people with traumatic or non-traumatic lesion. Several environmental factors hindered the participants’ capacity to fulfil their needs for services, particularly the availability, the cost and the process to get the services and, to some instances, the lack of SCI knowledge of healthcare providers.
