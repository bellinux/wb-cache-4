5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of <b>the</b> <b>prop.</b> While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E
5|$|A further {{challenge}} for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times a stunt dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A prosthetic Beagle was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. <b>The</b> <b>prop</b> was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series Carnivàle and the film The Chronicles of Riddick.|$|E
5|$|Director Rob Bowman {{initially}} {{thought that}} the episode could be filmed in five days, two fewer than usual. However, it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent only on the sickbay set. He later said that he simply shot the framework for the clips to be added in later, and never saw a final cut of the episode. Production assistant Eric A. Stillwell was responsible for selecting the clips {{that went into the}} episode, with 21 different clips included. <b>The</b> <b>prop</b> used on Riker to fight the infection was created from drawings by designer Rick Sternbach.|$|E
50|$|During preproduction, <b>the</b> <b>props</b> master {{develops}} a props breakdown. This is essentially mapping out the logical progression of each <b>prop</b> throughout <b>the</b> story. During shooting, <b>the</b> <b>props</b> master maintains <b>the</b> logical progression by ensuring <b>the</b> <b>props</b> are positioned in their correct logical place for each scene according to <b>the</b> <b>props</b> breakdown. If <b>the</b> logical progression of a prop changes during shooting, <b>the</b> <b>props</b> breakdown is revised {{to reflect the}} change.|$|R
5000|$|Often {{included}} in the tech are <b>the</b> final show <b>props.</b> These props differ from rehearsal props {{because they are not}} just placeholders, they are <b>the</b> <b>props</b> {{to be used in the}} actual production. This is so that a performer can become acquainted with <b>the</b> true <b>prop</b> before <b>the</b> actual performance so as not to look awkward when using it. It is also to test the durability of <b>the</b> final <b>prop,</b> as well as how <b>the</b> <b>props</b> will look under the final stage lighting.|$|R
30|$|Decreasing {{proppant}} size improves proppant {{transport and}} increases <b>the</b> <b>propped</b> fracture length. A 40 / 70 mesh proppant has <b>the</b> largest <b>propped</b> fracture length, while a 12 / 20 mesh size proppant has <b>the</b> least <b>propped</b> fracture length.|$|R
5|$|Lead {{production}} designer Richard Hudolin flew to Los Angeles, 1996 {{to gather}} material from Stargate for reference {{and found the}} original film prop stored outside in the Californian desert. Although <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> had severely disintegrated, he could take a detailed mould for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, lock the chevrons, and be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper, a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the props}} in The Wrath of Khan had been reused from The Motion Picture, or scrounged from other productions, but for The Search for Spock Winter wanted to design uniquely Star Trek items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated {{on many of}} <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> designs, {{creating}} updated and sleeker versions of the original television series communicators and phasers. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation tricorder was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than blinking lights, to suggest the props were real and manufactured.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the guns}} seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol {{modified}} by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; {{because of the high}} power requirement, the helium–neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>props</b> [...] "prop up" [...] the hooker in the scrum. They {{form part}} of {{the front row of}} the scrum and push against <b>the</b> opposition's <b>props.</b> <b>The</b> loosehead <b>prop</b> is {{positioned}} {{to the left of the}} hooker and his head will be on the outside of the scrum when it engages. The tighthead is to the right of the hooker with his head positioned between the opposition hooker and <b>the</b> opposition loosehead <b>prop.</b> <b>The</b> <b>prop's</b> main role is to provide stability at the scrum and support the hooker in quickly winning the ball. At <b>the</b> line-out, <b>the</b> <b>prop's</b> role is to support the jumper as they compete for the ball. They are usually positioned at the front of the line-out with a jumper in between them. They are also often involved in lifting jumpers when receiving kick-offs. While scrummaging is still seen as their main responsibility, modern props are also expected to contribute in the attack and defence.|$|R

5|$|Prior to 2003, {{the tournament}} format was a Limit Hold'em tournament, but in 2004, No-Limit Hold'em became the standard. The 2006 tournament, with 1,232 entrants, {{was the largest}} field ever for the event. Since its inception, with the {{exception}} of 2008, the Casino Employees event has started {{on the first day of}} the WSOP. Much of the drama encountered at the Casino Championship often involves informal rivaliries between dealers and proposition players. Proposition players are people hired to play poker, with their own money, at casinos to get games started or to ensure that they do not die out. Thus, while both <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> and dealer are casino employees, they sit on opposite sides of the table.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} chase, when Bond's Aston Martin {{crashes into}} a wall because of the mirror and the chase {{immediately}} preceding it, were filmed on the road {{at the rear of}} Pinewood Studios Sound Stages A and E and <b>the</b> <b>Prop</b> Store. The road is now called Goldfinger Avenue. Southend Airport was used for the scene where Goldfinger flies to Switzerland. Ian Fleming visited the set of Goldfinger in April 1964; he died a few months later in August 1964, shortly before the film's release. The second unit filmed in Kentucky, and these shots were edited into scenes filmed at Pinewood.|$|E
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. <b>The</b> <b>prop</b> came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
5000|$|Props in a {{production}} originate from off stage {{unless they have}} been preset on the stage before <b>the</b> production begins. <b>Props</b> are stored on a prop table backstage near the actor's entrance during production then generally locked in a storage area between performances. The person in charge of handling <b>the</b> <b>props</b> is generally called <b>the</b> <b>props</b> [...] "master" [...] (aka Propmaster) however, varying positions also include coordinators, production assistants and interns as may be needed for a specific project.|$|R

50|$|Several {{cartoons}} {{involve a}} theme where the shop's owner leaves, and <b>the</b> <b>props</b> {{come to life}} and party. <b>The</b> <b>props</b> would return to their quiet state if they knew the owner is coming back. But {{in the case of}} Antique Antics, Krazy gets to join the party, and the statues don't seem to mind. The film concludes with Krazy getting himself a mug of ale.|$|R
5|$|Greg Jein, {{best known}} as the builder of the alien {{mothership}} from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime Star Trek fan who had constructed the props for The Final Frontier, but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from Buck Rogers, while the frong was detailed with a prop from Buckaroo Banzai. Elements from The Final Frontier were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in The Final Frontier became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the zero gravity scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.|$|E
5|$|The climatic vault heist {{required}} {{four weeks}} of preparation with every scene and camera angle determined in advance. The filmmakers hired stunt director Spiro Razatos and stunt coordinator Jack Gill to direct the second-unit action filming. The pair initially began research for the stunt by testing the capabilities of <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> vaults and the Dodge Chargers driven by Diesel and Walker. Filmed {{on the streets of}} Hato Rey, the chaotic scene demanded specific timing that had to be synchronized with the various character interactions also occurring during the scene. Razatos chose to use a series of camera cars including a crane-mounted camera atop a Porsche Cayenne, which allowed him to film from a variety of angles and heights while the vehicles were in motion, and a Subaru Impreza with a steel cage built around it that allowed for tracking shots. The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford would occasionally accidentally collide with the vault, creating a shower of sparks that inadvertently became useful footage. Padelford also developed a top-mount dual-drive system for the Chargers that allowed a stunt driver to control the vehicle from the roof, while the actor focused on their performance inside the car.|$|E
5|$|The writers {{intended}} to play off {{the idea of}} a hidden character being able to hear conversations revealing secrets. An initial idea of Pemberton's was to have a large parcel on a table at the birthday party, but with Maggie—on whose birthday the episode would be set—absent. Other characters would repeatedly ask where Maggie was, until it was revealed that her head was in the parcel. This idea developed into the possibility of a hollow cake hiding a character, a device used in the final episode. For the writers, there is humour in characters spending time talking earnestly to a cake; they noted that <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> cake had features resembling a face. In the editing stage, the production team kept reintroducing the cake in order to remind viewers of its presence. The original script ended with a knife being plunged into a fake cake followed by the revelation, contrary to viewers' expectations, that no one was under it at the time; instead, the writers upped the drama in the story, making it possible that any of the characters injured. For the writers, the original plot was, in a sense, darker, as some characters got away with wrongdoing in a way they do not in the final version.|$|E
50|$|The storyline for {{the second}} serial to feature the Daleks, The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964), {{required}} <b>the</b> <b>props</b> to be used extensively on location. Consequently, serial designer Spencer Chapman and manufacturer Shawcraft Engineering devised a tricycle arrangement, incorporating three pneumatic tyres, to replace the original castors and carry <b>the</b> <b>props</b> over uneven ground. Enlarged fenders were then created to hide the revised undercarriage.|$|R

25|$|The 112 and 114 are {{conventional}} layout monoplanes {{with the}} main wing set low and a mid-mounted horizontal stabilizer. This places the stabilizer outside <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> wash, and results in heavier handling at lower speeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{front row}} of the scrum {{traditionally}} included the hooker with <b>the</b> two <b>props</b> on either side. All three may {{be referred to as}} front-rowers, but this term is now most commonly just used as a colloquialism to refer to <b>the</b> <b>props.</b>|$|R
50|$|When an {{airplane}} flies in icing conditions, ice can accumulate on the wings.
