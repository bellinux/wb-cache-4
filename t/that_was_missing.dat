5|$|In 1991, bodies {{believed}} to be those of the Imperial Family and their servants were finally exhumed from a mass grave in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who still ruled Russia when the grave was originally found. Once the grave was opened, the excavators realized that instead of eleven sets of remains (Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Tsarevitch Alexei, the four Grand Duchesses, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia; the family's doctor, Yevgeny Botkin; their valet, Alexei Trupp; their cook, Ivan Kharitonov; and Alexandra's maid, Anna Demidova) the grave held only nine. Alexei and, according to the late forensic expert Dr. William Maples, Anastasia were missing from the family's grave. Russian scientists contested this, however, and claimed it was Maria's body <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing.</b> The Russians identified Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest Grand Duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave. They estimated {{the height and width}} of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact. A Russian forensic expert said none of the skulls attributed to the Grand Duchesses had a gap between the front teeth as Maria did.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the presumed}} burial {{site of the}} {{imperial}} family and their servants was excavated in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who were still ruling Russia at the time. The grave only held nine of the expected eleven sets of remains. DNA and skeletal analysis matched these remains to Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, {{and three of the}} four grand duchesses (Olga, Tatiana and presumably Maria). The other remains, with unrelated DNA, correspond to the family's doctor (Yevgeny Botkin), their valet (Alexei Trupp), their cook (Ivan Kharitonov), and Alexandra's maid (Anna Demidova). Forensic expert William R. Maples decided that the Tsarevitch Alexei and Anastasia's bodies were missing from the family's grave. Russian scientists contested this conclusion, however, claiming it was the body of Maria <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing.</b> The Russians identified the body as that of Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest grand duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave.

5|$|In {{their first}} drive {{of the second}} quarter, the Golden Bears found success <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> since their first drive of the game. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers {{completed}} a short pass, then scrambled for 24yards and a first down. California ran the ball three times for another first down, then Rodgers connected with Chase Lyman on a 33-yard touchdown toss. The score was California's first since the opening drive {{of the game and}} cut Virginia Tech's lead to 21–14 with 9:10 remaining before halftime. The Hokies recovered the post-touchdown kickoff at their 20-yard line and began a scoring drive of their own. At first, the Hokies moved slowly, spending six plays to move just 14yards, gaining a first down in the process. Then, facing a third down and seven, Randall completed a 25-yard pass to Richard Johnson. This was followed by another long pass—this one a 31-yarder—to Marcus Vick. On the play immediately following, Kevin Jones ran for seven yards and a Virginia Tech touchdown. The Tech score made the game 28–14 with 5:09 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

25|$|Ernest Hébrard {{envisioned a}} monumental axis for Thessaloniki that {{stretched}} {{from what is}} now Aristotelous Square on the seafront to Venizelou Square and the Roman Forum. The axis began at Aristotelous Square, which {{was intended to be}} named after Alexander the Great. Throughout his plan for Thessaloniki, Hébrard implemented an element <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> from the pre-1917 architecture of the city: imposing façades. For the monumental axis, the architect used elements from Byzantine and Western architecture rather than Ottoman architecture, to stress the city's connection with the Byzantine Empire. This style is most evident at Aristotelous Square, with a few building facades implementing some of Hébrard's original ideas. Additionally, a statue of Alexander the Great was to be placed {{in the middle of the}} square.|$|E

500|$|Surviving Byzantine art {{is mostly}} {{religious}} and with exceptions at certain periods is highly conventionalised, following traditional models that translate carefully controlled church theology into artistic terms. Painting in fresco, illuminated manuscripts and on wood panel and, especially in earlier periods, mosaic {{were the main}} media, and figurative sculpture very rare except for small carved ivories. [...] Manuscript painting preserved to the end some of the classical realist tradition <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> in larger works. [...] Byzantine art was highly prestigious and sought-after in Western Europe, where it maintained a continuous influence on medieval art until {{near the end of}} the period. [...] This was especially so in Italy, where Byzantine styles persisted in modified form through the 12th century, and became formative influences on Italian Renaissance art. [...] But few incoming influences affected Byzantine style. By means of the expansion of the Eastern Orthodox church, Byzantine forms and styles spread to all the Orthodox world and beyond. Influences from Byzantine architecture, particularly in religious buildings, can be found in diverse regions from Egypt and Arabia to Russia and Romania.|$|E
500|$|David Kronke of the Los Angeles Daily News {{wrote that}} the show [...] "returns to its wicked wit, dialing back but {{certainly}} not eradicating the melodrama." [...] He complimented the four main actresses for their comedic relief and concluded: [...] "Rarely does a show unjump the shark this well; it's back in fine form, calibrating its humor and its menace just right." [...] New York Daily News writer David Bianculli compared the premiere to the show's second season, noting that the episode showed [...] "an assurance and a knowing playfulness <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> most of last year." [...] He complimented Cherry and Greenstein's script and approved the storylines for each character. Bianculli opined that the episode returned {{the quality of the}} show's first season and concluded: [...] "Pass the word: If you've given up on 'Desperate Housewives,' it's time to return to the neighborhood." [...] Entertainment Weekly Lindsay Soll identified Eva Longoria as the episode's strongest performer, declaring that she [...] "definitely looks like the one to watch this season." [...] Soll was glad to see that the Susan character was [...] "a little more toned down and less accident-prone than usual," [...] and called the scenes with Susan and Mike touching. Additionally, she opined that Laurie Metcalf [...] "did a brilliant job of playing the classic TV nosy neighbor," [...] but expressed her confusion over the Orson storyline.|$|E
500|$|Wayne Robins from Newsday {{believed}} that the song exemplified the [...] "kind of random pop we'd get if [...] William Burroughs were the program director of a Top 40 radio station." [...] Burt compared the song and Madonna's delivery of the lyrics with the dialogues spoken by Shakespeare's Juliet, and found similarity in the, [...] "Sweet so would I, Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing" [...] from the play, with the lyrics of [...] "Cherish". Allen Metz, {{one of the authors}} of The Madonna Companion, felt that [...] "Cherish" [...] as the opening song of the B-side of Like a Prayer, reaffirmed the sweet and happy romanticism <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> from the A-side of the album. [...] "As much a child of pop" [...] he says, [...] "as of the church, Madonna is restored by music's healing power, in this case with a mixture of classic sweet soul and L.A. pop moderne." [...] Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, felt that the song was typical of Madonna's previous musical endeavors, and would have been more suitable for her third studio album, True Blue, whose songs mainly dealt with romance and relationships. Music critic J. D. Considine, while reviewing the Like a Prayer album for Rolling Stone complimented the song for creating an effective balance, contrasting its lighthearted nature with the trauma of [...] "Oh Father", the next song. Considine also found retro-rock references in the song.|$|E

500|$|Slash's Snakepit's {{music was}} often {{described}} as hard rock and blues rock with elements of southern rock. The band were also {{often described as}} Slash's solo or side project though Slash maintained {{that they were a}} band, stating [...] "everybody wrote, everybody had equal input even though I had my name on it." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer J.D. Considine noted the differences between Guns N' Roses and Slash's Snakepit on their first album, stating that [...] "Guns ' Roses typically treat the melody as {{the most important part of}} the song, most of what slithers out of the Snakepit emphasizes the playing." [...] He noted that singer Eric Dover [...] "conveys the raw-throated intensity of a hard-rock frontman" [...] and [...] "he avoids the genre's most obvious excesses." [...] The riff to [...] "Good to Be Alive" [...] drew a comparison to Chuck Berry while the musicianship on the album was praised. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated that [...] "there's little argument that Slash is a great guitarist" [...] who is [...] "capable of making rock and blues clichés sound fresh". Reviewing Ain't Life Grand for Allmusic, Steve Huey described second singer Rod Jackson as [...] "a combination of '80s pop-metal bluster and Faces-era Rod Stewart" [...] with a [...] "touch of Aerosmith", a description that he felt also fitted the band as a whole. He noted, though, that Slash's guitar playing was [...] "tame" [...] and stated that the main problem of the album was the songwriting, though it was [...] "still a passable, workmanlike record that will definitely appeal to fans of grimy, old-school hard rock." [...] Malcolm Dome of Classic Rock stated that [...] "from the moment that [...] "Been There Lately" [...] opens, there's a vibe here <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> before" [...] and that Ain't Life Grand showed [...] "purpose, direction and individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to most bibliophiles of his time, Uzanne was chiefly {{interested in the}} creation of new, luxurious bibliophile works, collaborating closely with printers, binders, typographers and artists (especially the Symbolists and early Art Nouveau artists). Among them were such painters as James McNeill Whistler, Adolphe Lalauze and Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly—who wrote the preface of Le bric-à-brac de l'amour (1879)—, the writer Jean Lorrain, and jewellery artists and exponents of Japonisme such as Henri Vever. One of the main artists collaborating with Uzanne was the Belgian Félicien Rops, who illustrated some of his books and created the cover illustration for Le Livre Moderne, and who called Uzanne [...] "the Bibliophile's dream". The overall quality of Uzanne's books was remarked upon by The New York Times when reviewing his 1894 work La Femme à Paris: [...] "The book is a highly-artistic achievement in a typographical sense... This artistic element and the style of the author... elevate the work from its sphere of usefulness into the sphere of pure literature. It will be serviceable a century from now to students of our civilization." [...] Other symbolic works of art were Féminies (1896), in which Rops illustrated many scenes of worldly life, or Son Altesse la femme (Her Highness Woman, 1885), on which he drew a naked witch in the chapter on medieval women. In the work he explored the lives of women at all levels of French society of his time. But also, according to Silverman, Uzanne associate feminism with a dangerous debauchery of sexual and moral investment, making full use a series of medical and philosophical sources, with the intention of proving the inability of women to merge into public life and the labour market, because of their temperament. Uzanne further indicated that the female figure and ornaments were essential in the French decorative arts, something <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> in the early 20th century.|$|E
