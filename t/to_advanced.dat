5|$|Dragon's Egg is a 1980 {{hard science}} fiction novel by Robert L. Forward. In the story, Dragon's Egg is {{a neutron star}} with a surface gravity 67billion times that of Earth, and {{inhabited}} by cheela, intelligent creatures {{the size of a}} sesame seed who live, think and develop a million times faster than humans. Most of the novel, from May to June 2050, chronicles the cheela civilization beginning with its discovery of agriculture <b>to</b> <b>advanced</b> technology and its first face-to-face contact with humans, who are observing the hyper-rapid evolution of the cheela civilization from orbit around Dragon's Egg.|$|E
5|$|Finucane was {{now one of}} the 45 {{pilots in}} his class to have {{completed}} 100 hours of piloting time on aircraft since he joined the RAF. After completing basic flight training on 28 October 1938, Finucane was classed as an average pilot, but deemed to be competent enough to be assigned <b>to</b> <b>advanced</b> flying school. With effect from the following day, he was granted a short-service commission as an acting pilot officer (on probation) and sent to 8 Flying Training School, RAF Montrose in Scotland. On 12 November, he left King's Cross railway station travelling on the Flying Scotsman to Glasgow, arriving at Montrose after a 10-hour journey.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{following}} the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularisation, and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world.

5|$|Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd list {{four main}} methods of {{creating}} machinima. From simple <b>to</b> <b>advanced,</b> these are: {{relying on the}} game's AI to control most actions, digital puppetry, recamming, and precise scripting of actions. Although simple to produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating the realization of a preconceived film script. For example, when Rooster Teeth produced The Strangerhood using The Sims 2, a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group had to create multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods. Individual instances were selected at different times to produce appropriate actions.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression <b>to</b> <b>advanced</b> kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Using Mendeleev's {{nomenclature}} for unnamed and undiscovered elements, roentgenium {{should be}} known as eka-gold. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called unununium (with the corresponding symbol of Uuu), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms <b>to</b> <b>advanced</b> textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it element 111, with the symbol of E111, (111) or even simply 111.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily {{in the form of}} short-term money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders {{in the wake of the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows <b>to</b> <b>advanced</b> economies from developing countries, as reflected by global imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Older gravestones in the {{cemetery}} are generally cut from limestone, and the gravestones placed after 1900 are predominantly made of polished granite. Most of the gravestones have weathered significantly. The gravestones are generally rounded or rectangular in shape, and are placed on small stone foundations. The gravestones of prominent local leaders are more ornate in character, including that of Captain David Pugh and his family, who are buried under a large obelisk that lists the names of his three wives and their respective children. Nixon's gravestone is deteriorating due <b>to</b> <b>advanced</b> weathering; it is made of limestone and contains a carving of an open book. Following {{the purchase of a}} rectangular land tract around 1990, {{the cemetery}} was expanded on the east side. This section of the cemetery is excluded from the church's historically-recognized boundaries, as it was not associated with the church during the period of its greatest significance.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{thereafter}} McGovern {{was sworn}} in as a private at Fort Snelling in Minnesota. He spent a month at Jefferson Barracks Military Post in Missouri and then five months at Southern Illinois Normal University in Carbondale, Illinois, for ground school training; McGovern later maintained that both the academic work and physical training were the toughest he ever experienced. He spent two months at a base in San Antonio, Texas, and then went to Hatbox Field in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for basic flying school, training in a single-engined PT‑19. McGovern married Eleanor Stegeberg on October 31, 1943 during a three-day leave (lonely and in love, the couple had decided to not wait any longer); his father presided over the ceremony at the small Methodist church in Woonsocket. After three months in Muskogee, McGovern went to Coffeyville Army Airfield in Kansas for a further three months of training on the BT‑13. Around April 1944, McGovern went on <b>to</b> <b>advanced</b> flying school at Pampa Army Airfield in Texas for twin-engine training on the AT‑17 and AT‑9. Throughout, Air Cadet McGovern showed skill as a pilot, with his exceptionally good depth perception aiding him. Eleanor McGovern followed him to these different duty stations, and was present when he received his wings and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant.|$|E

5|$|The game retains some {{platforming}} traits; {{the player}} may disembark {{from a vehicle}} and explore the environment {{in a manner similar}} to that of the previous games. On foot the duo can grab ledges, swim underwater, balance on tightropes and perform basic jumps. Kazooie's spanner can also be used as a melee weapon outside of the vehicle, in addition to levitating lopsided vehicles. Banjo and Kazooie have limited attack power and agility on foot at first, but the duo can upgrade their speed, stamina and strength by visiting Boggy's gym in the game's hub world. Scattered around the game's six worlds are musical notes, which serve as currency for the player to purchase certain items such as blueprints, parts, and access <b>to</b> <b>advanced</b> vehicles. Musical notes vary in value as determined by its colour; gold, silver or bronze. Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts also features an online multiplayer; players can compete in challenges such as races and combat over Xbox Live. In addition, players can share their own vehicle designs and blueprints online.|$|E
5|$|There {{are still}} working brewery horses in other areas, such as Wadworth Brewery's Shire horses in Devizes, Wiltshire, but working teams are {{becoming}} increasingly rare. In some areas, such as the New Forest, local farmers and commoners use horses to round up thousands of semi-feral ponies grazing on the open Forest during the drift season, and Britain's mounted police use horses in crowd control, but other than such niche areas, the horse in Britain today is kept almost entirely for recreational purposes. They compete in all equestrian disciplines, carry riders from novice <b>to</b> <b>advanced</b> on trekking and trail-riding holidays, work in riding schools, provide therapy for the disabled, and are much-loved companions and hacks. The horses and riders of Great Britain have won numerous medals for eventing in equestrian sports at the Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|During June, Australians {{also contributed}} to the defence of the Allied beachhead against German air and naval attacks. No. 453Squadron and the RAAF fighter pilots in RAF units {{continued}} to fly patrols over the beachhead in the week after D-Day, but only rarely encountered German aircraft. From 11 June the Australian squadron's aircraft frequently operated from airfields built at Normandy, and on the 25th of the month it and the other units of No.125 Wing moved from the UK <b>to</b> <b>Advanced</b> Landing Ground B11 within the beachhead near Longues-sur-Mer. By late June, No.453 Squadron and the other RAF Spitfire units were regularly attacking German positions in Normandy as well as providing air defence for the Allied forces in the area; during the month the squadron flew more than 700 sorties. A small number of Australians posted to RAF squadrons equipped with Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers also attacked German vehicles and positions in direct support of the Allied ground troops throughout the month. No.456 Squadron, which was one of four night fighter squadrons assigned to protect the beachhead, frequently met German aircraft and shot down twelve of them in the week after the landing. Australian fighter ace Flight Lieutenant Nicky Barr, who had escaped from German custody in Italy during 1943, also briefly served in an air support control unit in Normandy. Barr landed at Omaha Beach on 9 June, but returned to the UK three days later as his commanding officer believed that German forces would execute Barr if they recaptured him.|$|E
