With minor changes to the chemical structure of talopram (figure 6), including a single 6-cyano (CN) substitution, {{scientists were}} able to convert talopram into a potent SSRI, called citalopram. But citalopram can also be viewed as a constrained analogue of paroxetine.|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, heroin {{was shown}} to engender cocaine-like discriminative stimulus (DS) effects; however, the mechanisms underlying the cocaine-like effects of heroin are unknown. The present study evaluated {{the extent to which}} the shared DS effects of heroin and cocaine involve common monoaminergic mechanisms of action. In squirrel monkeys discriminating co-caine (0. 3 mg/kg) from saline, heroin engendered full or partial substitution for cocaine in three of four monkeys. Pretreatment with the selective dopamine transport inhibitor 1 -(2 -[bis(4 -flu-orophenyl) methoxy]ethyl) - 4 -(3 -phenylpropyl) piperazine (GBR 12909) dose dependently enhanced the cocaine-like DS effects of heroin in these three monkeys as well as the DS effects of cocaine in all subjects. Neither <b>talsupram,</b> a noradrenergic transport inhibitor, nor prazosin, a noradrenergic antagonis...|$|E
