40|$|Plasmodesmata linking <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap {{and root}} in primary roots Zea mays are {{restricted}} to approx. 400 protodermal cells bordering approx. 110000 microns 2 of the calyptrogen of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap. This area is less than 10 % of the cross-sectional area of the root-tip at the cap junction. Therefore, gravitropic effectors moving from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap to <b>the</b> <b>root</b> can move symplastically only through a relatively small area in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>root.</b> Decapped roots are non-responsive to gravity. However, decapped roots whose caps are replaced immediately after decapping are strongly graviresponsive. Thus, gravicurvature occurs only when <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap contacts <b>the</b> <b>root,</b> and symplastic continuity between <b>the</b> cap and <b>root</b> is not required for gravicurvature. Completely removing mucilage from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> tip renders <b>the</b> <b>root</b> non-responsive to gravity. Taken together, {{these data suggest that}} gravitropic effectors move apoplastically through mucilage from the cap to <b>the</b> <b>root...</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>roots</b> of Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils to a {{depth of}} 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of <b>the</b> <b>roots,</b> which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. <b>The</b> <b>roots</b> grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} vibrating electrode, {{the pattern of}} naturally occurring electric currents around 1 -day-old primary roots of Lepidium sativum L. growing vertically downward and the current pattern following gravistimulation of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> has been examined. A more or less symmetrical pattern of current was found around vertically oriented, downward growing <b>roots.</b> Current entered <b>the</b> <b>root</b> at <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap, <b>the</b> meristem, {{and the beginning of}} the elongation zone and left <b>the</b> <b>root</b> along most of the elongation zone and in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> hair zone. After <b>the</b> <b>root</b> was tilted to a horizontal position, we observed current flowing acropetally at the upper side of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap and basipetally at the lower side within about 30 seconds in most cases. After a delay of several minutes, acropetally oriented current was also found flowing along the upper side of the meristematic zone. The apparent density of the acropetal current in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap region increased and then decreased with time. Gravitropic curvature was first visible approximately 10 minutes after tilting of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> to <b>the</b> horizontal position. Since the change in the pattern of current in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap region precedes bending of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> and is different for the upper and lower side, a close connection is suggested between the current and the transduction of information from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap to <b>the</b> elongation zone following graviperception in the cap...|$|R

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> while burrowing. This can injure <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts.

He preached that God ordained power into the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common people to understand God's laws they {{had to be able to}} read the Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E
40|$|Two {{functionally}} distinct sets of meristematic cells {{exist within}} root tips of pea (Pisum sativum) : <b>the</b> <b>root</b> apical meristem, which {{gives rise to}} the body of the root; and <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem, which gives rise to cells that differentiate progressively through the cap and separate ultimately from its periphery as border cells. When a specific number of border cells has accumulated on <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap periphery, mitosis within <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem, but not the apical meristem, is suppressed. When border cells are removed by immersion of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> tip in water, a transient induction of mitosis in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem can be detected starting within 5 min. A corresponding switch in gene expression throughout <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap occurs in parallel with the increase in mitosis, and new border cells begin to separate from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap periphery within 1 h. The induction of renewed border cell production is inhibited by incubating root tips in extracellular material released from border cells. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that operation of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem and consequent turnover of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap is self-regulated by a signal from border cells...|$|R
