40|$|Plasmodesmata linking <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap {{and root}} in primary roots Zea mays are {{restricted}} to approx. 400 protodermal cells bordering approx. 110000 microns 2 of the calyptrogen of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap. This area is less than 10 % of the cross-sectional area of the root-tip at the cap junction. Therefore, gravitropic effectors moving from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap to <b>the</b> <b>root</b> can move symplastically only through a relatively small area in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>root.</b> Decapped roots are non-responsive to gravity. However, decapped roots whose caps are replaced immediately after decapping are strongly graviresponsive. Thus, gravicurvature occurs only when <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap contacts <b>the</b> <b>root,</b> and symplastic continuity between <b>the</b> cap and <b>root</b> is not required for gravicurvature. Completely removing mucilage from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> tip renders <b>the</b> <b>root</b> non-responsive to gravity. Taken together, {{these data suggest that}} gravitropic effectors move apoplastically through mucilage from the cap to <b>the</b> <b>root...</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>roots</b> of Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils to a {{depth of}} 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of <b>the</b> <b>roots,</b> which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. <b>The</b> <b>roots</b> grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} vibrating electrode, {{the pattern of}} naturally occurring electric currents around 1 -day-old primary roots of Lepidium sativum L. growing vertically downward and the current pattern following gravistimulation of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> has been examined. A more or less symmetrical pattern of current was found around vertically oriented, downward growing <b>roots.</b> Current entered <b>the</b> <b>root</b> at <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap, <b>the</b> meristem, {{and the beginning of}} the elongation zone and left <b>the</b> <b>root</b> along most of the elongation zone and in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> hair zone. After <b>the</b> <b>root</b> was tilted to a horizontal position, we observed current flowing acropetally at the upper side of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap and basipetally at the lower side within about 30 seconds in most cases. After a delay of several minutes, acropetally oriented current was also found flowing along the upper side of the meristematic zone. The apparent density of the acropetal current in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap region increased and then decreased with time. Gravitropic curvature was first visible approximately 10 minutes after tilting of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> to <b>the</b> horizontal position. Since the change in the pattern of current in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap region precedes bending of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> and is different for the upper and lower side, a close connection is suggested between the current and the transduction of information from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap to <b>the</b> elongation zone following graviperception in the cap...|$|R

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> while burrowing. This can injure <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts.

He preached that God ordained power into the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy.

40|$|Two {{functionally}} distinct sets of meristematic cells {{exist within}} root tips of pea (Pisum sativum) : <b>the</b> <b>root</b> apical meristem, which {{gives rise to}} the body of the root; and <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem, which gives rise to cells that differentiate progressively through the cap and separate ultimately from its periphery as border cells. When a specific number of border cells has accumulated on <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap periphery, mitosis within <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem, but not the apical meristem, is suppressed. When border cells are removed by immersion of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> tip in water, a transient induction of mitosis in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem can be detected starting within 5 min. A corresponding switch in gene expression throughout <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap occurs in parallel with the increase in mitosis, and new border cells begin to separate from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap periphery within 1 h. The induction of renewed border cell production is inhibited by incubating root tips in extracellular material released from border cells. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that operation of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap meristem and consequent turnover of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> cap is self-regulated by a signal from border cells...|$|R
