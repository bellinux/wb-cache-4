5|$|Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) notifies Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) that a {{group of}} <b>Trill</b> {{scientists}} will be arriving soon at Deep Space Nine to perform experiments related to wormhole physics. The <b>Trill</b> are a species formed of both a humanoid host and a symbiont, which are implanted into them. The symbionts live far longer than the hosts, and are moved into a new host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax symbiont. Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the <b>Trill</b> scientists are aboard, but she turns it down. Upon Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) notices that they are very familiar with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) later informs Kira about the non-association rules that <b>Trill</b> follow regarding the family and friends of former hosts, and says that hosts of the Dax and Kahn symbionts have previously been married to each other.|$|E
5|$|As Ezri Tigan was {{the only}} unjoined <b>Trill</b> {{available}} on board, she agreed to be joined to the symbiont {{even though she was}} unprepared and did not previously seek to be joined to one. Following the procedure, Ezri — now known as Ezri Dax — spent time at the Symbiosis Institute on <b>Trill</b> to learn to adapt to her new state. Because of her new state, Ezri's romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended, as she later explained to her family that he reminded her of a past host's son.|$|E
5|$|Mozart did {{not write}} down a cadenza for the movement, or at least there is no {{evidence}} of him having done so. Many later composers and performers, including Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni and Gabriel Fauré, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential <b>trill.</b> The omission of the customary <b>trill</b> is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise {{successfully}} rendezvous in time {{to bring}} aboard the new host, a female (Nicole Orth-Pallavicini), much to Dr. Crusher's surprise. She helps with the other <b>Trill</b> to transplant Odan into the new host, and both Riker and Odan fully recover. When Odan attempts to continue their relationship, Dr. Crusher is uncomfortable, knowing both that the <b>Trill</b> appear to have no preferences on gender orientation, and that Odan will continue to live on {{in any number of}} hosts' bodies. Odan admits he still loves Dr. Crusher, but understands her confusion and discomfort, and promises to never forget her or their short time together. And Dr. Crusher replies that she loves Odan too; in Odan's new, female host body, Odan then kisses the inner wrist of her hand.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's song is a {{sequence}} of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short <b>trill.</b> The shrill pseep flight call is intermediate between the soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit and the water pipit's short, thin fist.|$|E

Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), who brings it on board the Enterprise, where it and its quickly-produced offspring are treated as adorable pets. The animals purr a relaxing <b>trill</b> that the crew find soothing. Klingons, however, find tribbles annoying, and the feeling is mutual: tribbles hiss and shriek whenever they are near Klingons.|$|E
5|$|The Wagiman phonemic {{inventory}} {{is quite}} typical for a northern Australian language. It has six {{places of articulation}} with a stop and a nasal in each. There are also a number of laterals and approximants, a <b>trill</b> and a phonemic glottal stop (represented in the orthography by 'h'). Wagiman also has a vowel inventory that is standard for the north of Australia, with a system of 5 vowels.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster of}} keys {{at the bottom}} of the upper joint (protruding {{slightly}} beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the <b>trill</b> keys and are operated by the right hand. These give the player alternative fingerings that make it easy to play ornaments and trills. The entire weight of the smaller clarinets is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on what is called the thumb-rest.

For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the <b>trill</b> 'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.|$|E
5|$|This flycatcher has a loud, high-pitched song. It is {{also known}} to give a fast chuit-chuit-chuit-chuit-chuit-chidi-didi song, and {{occasionally}} single notes of chuit are made in a slow series of calls. When foraging in pairs, tufted tit-tyrants have been observed using a perr-reet call to stay in contact with each other. The species' contact call {{has been described as}} a pluit-pluit.

5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, <b>trill</b> calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E

5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} dry, open country with some trees and small bushes, such as heaths, forest clearings or newly planted woodland. The male European nightjar occupies a territory {{in spring and}} advertises his presence with a distinctive sustained churring <b>trill</b> from a perch. He patrols his territory with wings held in a V and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Wing clapping also occurs when the male chases the female in a spiralling display flight. The European nightjar does not build a nest, and its two grey and brown blotched eggs are laid directly on the ground; they hatch after about 17–21 days and the downy chicks fledge in another 16–17 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{thematic}} material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the recapitulation. Mozart manages to recapitulate all of the themes in the home key of C minor. The themes are necessarily compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form contain few virtuosic moments for the soloist. The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, {{which has not been}} heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of triplets from the piano. The recapitulation concludes with the piano playing arpeggiated sixteenths before a cadential <b>trill</b> leads into a ritornello. The ritornello in turn leads into a fermata that prompts the soloist's cadenza.|$|E
5|$|Dax confides in Sisko {{that she}} knows she {{is in love with}} her former wife. He tells her that <b>Trill</b> customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never be joined with a new host, but that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to the realization that the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E

50|$|<b>Trilling</b> sees Rudyard Kipling as {{a writer}} {{belonging}} “irrevocably to our past;” specifically, the past of childhood, where a justified rejection of him represents “our first literary-political decision.” Kipling, <b>Trilling</b> writes, was “one of liberalism’s major intellectual misfortunes.” <b>Trilling</b> describes Kipling as unlovable because of the mindlessness of his ideas, most especially of his “mindless imperialism,” which made readers react against him as a dangerous proponent of nationalism and national values. In so doing, <b>Trilling</b> argues, Kipling did damage to the very national values he cared so much about.|$|R
5|$|Odan (Franc Luz), a mediator, boards the Enterprise to {{negotiate}} a peace treaty between two hostile races. Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) is charmed by the man, and the two share a love affair during the trip. Odan refuses to use the transporter and requests that a shuttle and pilot be provided for him; Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) honors this request. During the mission, the shuttle is attacked by a dissident faction and Odan is mortally injured. While {{trying to save the}} alien in sickbay, Dr. Crusher comes to learn that Odan is a <b>Trill,</b> a species which symbiotically lives within its host's body. It is a further revealed by Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) that the transporter would have harmed the symbiotic lifeform. Following the death of Odan's host body, Commander Riker volunteers to allow Odan use him as a host to conduct the necessary negotiations until a new host arrives.|$|E

Dr. Crusher is puzzled and full of emotion as she later confides to Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and wonders about the true depth of her feelings for Odan. With some effort, Odan in Riker's body manages to convince the delegates from the warring planets to work with him. However, Riker's body begins to deteriorate due to the incompatibility of different biologies. The ship transporting the new host has encountered engine malfunctions. Dr. Crusher does everything she can to extend Riker's and Odan's chances while the Enterprise races to meet the <b>Trill</b> ship, and has a deeply emotional moment with Captain Picard.|$|E

40|$|In communication, vocal {{signals are}} often used for {{long-range}} signaling. Yet, little experimental evidence {{is available on the}} role of territorial signals across territory boundaries and their effectiveness at different propagation distances. In many songbird species, song overlapping and rapid broadband <b>trills</b> are used and perceived as agonistic signals, yet they differ in their propagation distance. <b>Trills</b> degrade quickly over distance, suggesting that their agonistic function may decrease faster over distance than that of song overlapping. Here, we tested whether different signaling distances of a rival affect singing responses of a territorial male and whether such distance effects differ when a rival uses rapid broadband <b>trills</b> or song overlapping. We exposed male nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos) to songs of simulated rivals broadcast from 2 distances outside their territories. Each subject was exposed either to a moderate alternating playback without <b>trills</b> or to an agonistic playback, that is, to an alternating playback with <b>trills</b> or to an overlapping playback without <b>trills.</b> Irrespective of the treatment, males sang more songs containing <b>trills</b> in response to near than to far playback. As expected, males responded more strongly to the 2 agonistic treatments than to the moderate treatment. However, males did not clearly decrease responsiveness to playback containing <b>trills</b> broadcast from afar. This indicates that <b>trills</b> maintain their agonistic function even at distances at which information encoded in frequency bandwidth is degraded. Taken together, our results show that information encoded in signals used for resource maintenance is important also in communication across territory boundarie...|$|R
