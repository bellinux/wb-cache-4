5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for {{how to set up}} these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> salubrious.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started by}} {{focusing}} on the game's hardware. The staff first debated what type of monitor to use: black and white or color. They reasoned that using advanced technology would better establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor. The developers estimated that the game would require 4colors, but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16colors. At the time, the designers believed <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> than they would ever need for a game. The monitor's resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game's presentation. Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language. The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.|$|E
5|$|In 1833, his son Minh Mạng {{was faced}} with a {{rebellion}} led by Lê Văn Khôi, which started after the tomb of Khôi's father Lê Văn Duyệt was desecrated by imperial officials. The rebels took control of the citadel and the revolt continued until the imperial forces took control of the citadel in 1835. Following the capture of the citadel, Minh Mang ordered its razing and replacement with a smaller square stone-built structure, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable to attacks. On February 17, 1859, the citadel was captured during the French invasion after less than a day of battle and significant amounts of military supplies were seized. Realising {{that they did not have}} the capacity to hold the fort against Vietnamese attempts to recapture it, the French razed it with explosives, before withdrawing their troops.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based {{on the degree of}} separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which the tips of the arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E
5|$|Industrial Zen is {{a studio}} album {{recorded}} by English jazz musician John McLaughlin in 2006. It {{was released on}} 22 May 2006 by Verve Records as a compact disc. Following the release of Thieves and Poets (2003), he began creating an album <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> ambitious and one that he could consider unique to him. He collaborated with various musicians for the project, such as vocalist Shankar Mahadevan, saxophonist Bill Evans, and tabla player Zakir Hussain. A jazz fusion and electric jazz album, Industrial Zen features the use of several instruments, including drums, keyboards, the electric bass, and the tabla. Additionally, McLaughlin wrote and produced all eight songs that appear on the record.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the dire wolf, North America was invaded by the genus Xenocyon (ancestor of the Asian dhole and the African hunting dog) that was as large as the dire wolf and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare, and it is assumed that they could not compete with the newly derived dire wolf. Stable isotope analysis provides evidence that the dire wolf, Smilodon, and the American lion competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores included the extinct North American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), the modern cougar (Puma concolor), the Pleistocene coyote (Canis latrans), and the Pleistocene gray wolf <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> massive and robust than today. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey.|$|E

5|$|One of Morgan's stated {{interests}} was to lead {{a program}} of research into household practices; {{she did not want}} to teach traditional home economics principles if they could not be supported by science.

Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional home economics graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and teaching in the basic sciences.|$|E
5|$|Paul Tremo (1733/34–1810) was {{the head}} chef at the court of King Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski of Poland. He was born in Berlin, {{in a family of}} French Huguenots.

He followed the king to Saint Petersburg after the latter's abdication in 1795, but returned to Warsaw after his death in 1798. His cooking style combined Polish, French and other west European influences. As a mentor to aspirant Polish chefs and author of recipes which circulated in handwritten copies, he was instrumental in the development of modern Polish cuisine <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> moderate and cosmopolitan than old Polish cookery.|$|E

5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> than a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Second Constitutional Settlement was {{completed}} in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus' legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general imperium proconsulare, or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus' proconsular imperium into imperium proconsulare maius, or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire. Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13BC.|$|E
