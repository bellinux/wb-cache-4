5|$|After failing his {{examinations}} Serevi {{quit school}} {{and continued to}} play for his local club Rewa. Although he trained with the team, he was omitted from playing as the coach, Jo Rauto, thought he was <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> would get hurt. He was eventually selected {{to play for the}} senior provincial side when he was 17. Several months later he was asked to join the Nabua Rugby Club – under the guidance of coach Ratu Kitione Tuibua – by his uncle Vesito Rauluni. Serevi's Nabua team were highly successful in Fiji's sevens tournaments.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish was <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> the ground station's geographical position was out of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Elba {{operated}} the observation balloon through 1913. The following year, she was modified {{to serve as}} a depot ship for three seaplanes, and she entered service in this new role on 4 June 1914. During this period she operated Nieuport IV seaplanes. She was the first dedicated seaplane tender of the Italian navy, though seaplanes had already been operated aboard several battleships and cruisers. Elba was nevertheless <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> too old for her intended role, and she was retired in 1916. She remained in the Italian inventory until 4 January 1920, when she was sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 18th {{to the early}} 19th century, the {{building}} was also known {{by a number of}} names, including the Palazzo del Tribunale, the Palais de Justice and the Gran Corte della Valletta. By the mid-19th century the building was deemed <b>too</b> <b>small,</b> <b>and</b> the courts were gradually moved to Auberge d'Auvergne between 1840 and 1853. The Castellania was then abandoned, before being briefly converted into an exhibition centre, a tenant house and a school.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the {{township}} {{was covered with}} a dense forest. Walnut trees, Poplar, Oak, Ash, Elm, Maple, Beech, and Sycamore were commonly found. Smaller numbers of Buckeye, Spicebush and Willow were found, <b>too.</b> <b>Small</b> prairies <b>and</b> wetlands were scattered throughout the area.|$|R
5|$|HMS Unrivalled (P45) was a U-class {{submarine}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during World War II. The boat {{has been the only}} ship of the Royal Navy to ever bear the name Unrivalled. Completed in 1942, the boat spent most of the war in the Mediterranean. She sank a number of small merchant ships and naval auxiliaries, but major success eluded her during the war. <b>Too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> slow for the post-war environment, Unrivalled was scrapped in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{the city}} bought the two private systems. Some {{elevated}} lines ceased service immediately while others closed soon after. Integration was slow, but several connections were built between the IND and BMT; these now operate as one division called the B Division. Since the IRT tunnels, sharper curves, and stations are <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> therefore can not accommodate B Division cars, the IRT remains its own division, the A Division. However, many passenger transfers between stations {{of all three}} former companies have been created, allowing the entire network {{to be treated as}} a single unit.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Bayern {{purchased}} {{land near}} the Allianz Arena {{with the purpose}} of building a new youth academy. In 2015 the project, estimated to cost €70 million, was started, after overcoming internal resistance. The main reasons for the project were that the existing facilities were <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> that the club, while very successful at senior level, lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at youth level. The new facility is scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Harry Holtby {{was born}} on 18 September 1990 in Erkelenz, West Germany. He began playing {{football}} {{at the age of}} four with amateur side Sparta Gerderath, a club with whom his father had also previously played, before signing for Borussia Mönchengladbach when he was 11-years old. He spent three seasons in Gladbach's academy before the club let him go in 2004, deeming him to be <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> slow to make it as a professional footballer. Following his release, Holtby elected to sign for Alemannia Aachen in the second tier of German football at the age of 14.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 1939, {{the head}} of RAF Bomber Command Air Chief Marshal Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt hosted a conference {{on the state of}} Bomber Command. Among the many {{problems}} with operational readiness, he noted that that RAF bombs were much <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> that bombsight technology was obsolete. Given the problems of obtaining a modern bombsight, he pressed {{for the creation of a}} high-speed bomber design that could safely attack at low levels.|$|E
5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987 the United States Geological Survey {{published}} {{a report on}} the mineral resources of Sabinoso. They concluded that [...] "no identified mineral resources were found in the study area." [...] While they identified some occurrences of uranium associated with the Chinle Formation, the deposits were <b>too</b> <b>small,</b> scattered <b>and</b> low-grade to constitute a viable resources for uranium.|$|R
60|$|Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy {{almost to}} speak, preceded {{the young lady}} to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel had vacated for her. It, <b>too,</b> was <b>small</b> <b>and</b> cold by candlelight. The colliers' wives only lit fires in {{bedrooms}} in case of extreme illness.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{this boat}} is <b>too</b> <b>small,</b> <b>too</b> slow, <b>and</b> {{inadequate}} for commercial fishing. In its day, it could support a family, and sometimes two, but it now serves mainly as a pleasure craft. These boats {{can be found}} {{as far north as}} Alaska and as far south as San Diego. In spite of its downturn, its value as a small craft continues to be seen in similar hulls built {{in other parts of the}} world such as South Africa, Chile, Egypt, and India.|$|R
5|$|The {{sizes of}} both moons are {{calculated}} {{with the assumption}} that they have the same infrared albedo as Haumea, which is reasonable as their spectra show them to have the same surface composition. Haumea's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from ground-based telescopes, the moons are <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common albedo, the inner moon, Namaka, which is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka, would be about 170km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|A fresh wave of {{concerns}} about France followed in the 1880s, accompanied {{by the introduction of}} still more powerful naval artillery and fast warships and torpedo boats, resulting in a fresh wave of modernisation. An electronically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. New, quick-firing guns were installed at Hurst to enable the castle to engage the newer vessels. Calshot was brought back into service as a coastal fort, with a new battery of quick-firing guns protecting a boom across the estuary. The original 16th-century parts of fortifications such as Southsea and Calshot were <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> unsuitable for modern weapons, however, and were instead used for mounting searchlights, range and direction finding; in some cases their fabric was left to slowly decline.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack as the RAAF lacked modern {{aircraft}} and the RAN was <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> unbalanced to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. Additionally, the Army, although large, contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response to this threat most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Government appealed to the United States for assistance. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to Burma while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.|$|E
5000|$|A new [...] {{was built}} in 1979 with heated {{changing}} rooms and shower facilities, as well as catering facilities. However, due to a rapid growth in membership, the clubhouse became <b>too</b> <b>small</b> by 1991, <b>and</b> a further extension was added.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} signs {{such as the}} one at Cahore Point in Wicklow were built <b>too</b> <b>small</b> {{initially}} <b>and</b> so larger signs were built over them at a later stage. A number of the signs still exist in varying states of repair, mostly along the west of the country and in addition some of have been renovated {{such as the one}} in Loop Head, County Clare.|$|R
50|$|The Leven to Thornton section {{continued}} and through passenger trains ran to Edinburgh, {{and at first}} it seemed that this could continue; but passenger business on those trains <b>too</b> was <b>small</b> <b>and</b> a huge loss was incurred in running the trains; the line between Thornton and Leven closed to passengers on 6 October 1969.|$|R
5|$|Airport {{security}} was introduced on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} terminal capacity and the terminal had to be expanded. Makeshift solutions were used, such as plywood boards to allocate people through the security check. In late 2004, the airport started planning an all-new terminal building, as the old terminal was deemed both <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> out of date. Construction of the NOK-115-million terminal started on 24 October 2006. As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based landing system, on 29 October 2007. The new terminal opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored indoors and included a new helicopter terminal. Thon Hotel Torghatten opened in October 2009 and an airport surveillance radar was installed in 2010, making Brønnøysund the first regional airport in Norway to have one.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Elba {{spent much}} of her career abroad. She participated in the {{blockade}} of Venezuela during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03 and was present in East Asia during the Russo-Japanese War in 190405. In February 1904, her crew witnessed the Battle of Chemulpo Bay between Japanese and Russian warships; after the battle ended in Russian defeat, Elba and British and French cruisers picked up survivors. She took part in the Italo-Turkish War in 191112 but saw no action, being used primarily to blockade Turkish ports in the Red Sea. In 1914, Elba was converted into the first seaplane tender of the Regia Marina, with equipment to handle three seaplanes. This service did not last long, however, as she was <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> too old. Decommissioned by 1916, the old warship was sold for scrap in January 1920 and broken up.|$|E
50|$|In {{the tale}} of Cupid the honey thief, the child-god is stung by bees when he steals honey from their hive. He cries and runs to his mother Venus, {{complaining}} that so small a creature shouldn't cause such painful wounds. Venus laughs, and points out the poetic justice: he <b>too</b> is <b>small,</b> <b>and</b> yet delivers the sting of love.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Models with gauge-Higgs {{unification}} {{on a flat}} {{space are}} typically affected by common problems, the main of which are the prediction of a <b>too</b> <b>small</b> top <b>and</b> Higgs mass and a too low compactification scale.
