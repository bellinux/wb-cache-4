40|$|Feedback is {{certainly}} among {{essential elements of}} a learning environment and developing an effective feedback process is highly desirable. Evidence from literature (e. g. Walker 2009; Ferguson 2011; Orsmond & Merry 2011; Bailey & Garner 2010) show that detailed feedback to students could enhance their learning. Moreover, early informative feedback is an essential requirement for encouraging students to change their performance in future (Brown et al. 1997). Feedback can take many shapes and forms. It can be simply a final grade or a comprehensive descriptive response for an assessment. Nevertheless, it should be designed and provided {{in a way that}} it could manage students' expectations, learning process need and be consistent and supportive of course material. There are challenges, however, when engineering students carry out a course in management where content and feedback processes are somewhat different from other scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>units</b> they often have. These <b>technical</b> <b>units</b> unlike management units seem to provide more objective, measurable often linear understanding of a knowledge area. Therefore, education process in general and feedback mechanism specifically should help students to deal with this disparity between management and <b>technical</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the international NGO WaterAid supports decentralised local governments in Mali to fulfil their role of service authorities within a service delivery approach for rural water services. WaterAid provides capacity support to local governments by creating and financing municipal WASH <b>Technical</b> <b>Units</b> that, in turn, provide direct support to community management of rural water supply. The paper compares this model to another approach for supporting rural water service providers in Mali {{in terms of}} the activities, scale and costs of direct support provided through each model. The paper finds that the model of WASH <b>Technical</b> <b>Units</b> promoted by WaterAid provides a more comprehensive set of support activities than the alternative approach suggested in national policy. The costs of the <b>Technical</b> <b>Units</b> are within international benchmarks for the expenditure on direct support suggested to be necessary for basic sustainable rural water services, but it is not yet clear how local governments in Mali can finance the costs of such an approach in the long term. Therefore, greater debate is needed in the national water sector about which aspects of support to rural water service providers are most important and what combination of actors can provide and finance this support...|$|R
