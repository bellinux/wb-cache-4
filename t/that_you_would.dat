5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We were talking about how you sometimes know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be better at love if only you were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|Among {{evidence}} demonstrated toward Heirens's {{guilt is}} the fingerprint {{evidence on the}} Degnan ransom note and on the doorjamb of Frances Brown's bathroom door. However, suspicions on the veracity of doorjamb fingerprints found at the Brown crime scene have arisen, including charges that the police planted the fingerprint since it allegedly looks like a rolled fingerprint, the type <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> find on a police fingerprint index card. Both sets of prints have come under serious question as to their validity, good faith collection and possible contamination; even the possibility of their being planted.|$|E

25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you feel <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E

The first thing <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{do would be to}} run away and hide. And then, besides, it would be very wicked for you to kill a man in <b>that</b> way. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> be very likely to get {{yourself}} hung for murder. Besides, the Bible says that we must not resist evil; so you should not talk so coolly about shooting a man." ...|$|R

He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics." ...|$|E
500|$|Public {{sympathy for}} You was high, but white {{employers}} of the Chinese workers pressed officials for action {{to be taken}} against him. [...] Accordingly, You was arrested on August 7 and in October 1901 was tried and convicted for the murder of Oscar Bloom. [...] Contrary to the jurors' belief <b>that</b> <b>You</b> <b>would</b> receive a light sentence, the judge ordered that You be hanged. [...] The execution was scheduled for January 31, 1902.|$|E

500|$|Kate Mulgrew {{suggested}} that the show incorporate a new and stronger antagonist, saying: [...] "We need [...] to encounter enemies of such ferocity, enemies who in fact are quite lethal and frightening. Enemies <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> watch and say, 'Oh, boy, {{how are they going}} to get out of this one?' I don't think the Kazon hit the bill." [...] Mulgrew felt the crew's mission to get home was a more compelling storyline than those related to the Kazon, whom she criticized as [...] "great big stupid giants".|$|E
500|$|Structural {{problems}} with the undercroft of the garden were discovered in the early 21st century and the garden was closed and fenced off in 2004. The memorial remained fenced off for seven years and fell into disrepair as the city council lacked the funds {{to carry out the}} necessary repairs, though access was granted to representatives of the Royal British Legion to lay wreaths during Remembrance Sunday services. The journalist Martin Bell remarked on the condition of the memorial in 2007: [...] "to find a war memorial in a state like <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have to go to Iraq".|$|E
500|$|... "Amy's Choice" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Gavin Fuller, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was {{positive about the}} episode, calling it [...] "probably the strongest all-round script we've had this year, chock full of good lines". He added, [...] "The concept of aliens inhabiting elderly people and turning them psychotic was wittily realised, particularly the bizarre sight of them laying siege to Amy and Rory's cottage with household and gardening implements". He concluded that it [...] "was one of those stories <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> only find in Doctor Who, and shows once again that the series can provide genuine thought-provoking, interesting drama alongside its thrills and spills".|$|E

500|$|Having {{successfully}} completed and published the other {{books on the}} geology and zoology of the voyage, Darwin spent eight years on a major study of barnacles. Two volumes on Lepadidae (goose barnacles) were published in 1851. While he was still working on two volumes on the remaining barnacles, Darwin learnt to his delight in 1853 that the Royal Society had awarded him the Royal Medal for Natural Science. Joseph Dalton Hooker wrote telling him that [...] "Pordock proposed you for the Coral Islands & Lepadidae, Bell followed seconding on the Lepadidae alone, & then followed such a shout of paeans for the Barnacles <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have [...] to hear." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Praise You In This Storm" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics following {{the release of}} Lifesong. Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today said [...] "it's vertical in focus and a typical-sounding power ballad, but it's {{not hard to imagine}} people latching on to its powerful Job-like expression of faith and hope.". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout praised it as [...] "sonic" [...] and called it a [...] "passionate and emotional worship experience". Brian Mansfield of USA Today felt that the song's lyric [...] "I was sure by now <b>that</b> <b>You</b> <b>would</b> have reached down and wiped our tears away/Stepped in and saved the day/But once again, I say 'Amen,' and it's still raining" [...] would resonate with listeners.|$|E
500|$|Visitors to Seeon {{included}} Prince Felix Yusupov, {{husband of}} Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, who wrote, [...] "I claim categorically {{that she is}} not Anastasia Nicolaievna, but just an adventuress, a sick hysteric and a frightful playactress. I simply cannot understand how anyone can be in doubt of this. If you had seen her, I am convinced <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> recoil in horror at the thought that this frightful creature could be a daughter of our Tsar." [...] Other visitors, however, such as Felix Dassel, an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916, and Gleb Botkin, who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik's brother, were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine.|$|E
