40|$|Currently, mould {{design and}} <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process {{parameters}} <b>of</b> transfer moulding for electronic packages are done manually in a trial-and-error manner. <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> parameters is largely dependent on <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> engineers. <b>The</b> paper describes an intelligent process design system for transfer moulding of electronic packages {{that is used}} to determine optimal mould design parameters and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process parameters mainly based on case-based reasoning, artificial neural networks and a multiobjective optimization scheme. <b>The</b> system consists <b>of</b> two modules: a case-based reasoning module and a process optimization module. The former module is used to determine initial mould design parameters and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process parameters while the latter module is used to determine optimal mould design parameters and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process parameters. Implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intelligent system has demonstrated that the time for <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> optimal mould design parameters and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process parameters can be greatly reduced, and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> parameters recommended by <b>the</b> system can contribute to <b>the</b> good quality <b>of</b> moulded packages.

5|$|Although Khan {{has bought}} Jasmine a house, she rejects his advances, {{saying that she}} has never seen him as being more than a friend. Angry and disappointed, Khan slaps her and tells her to leave. He angrily destroys <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film she is cast in, leaving with her a twenty-four-hour {{deadline}} to accept his proposal. Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.|$|E
5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens. This was {{due in part to the}} fact that <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E

5|$|Mitra had met Ray on <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> River, where Mitra {{was allowed}} to observe the production, take {{photographs}} and make notes about lighting for personal reference. Having become friends, Mitra kept Ray informed about the production and showed his photographs. Ray was impressed enough by them to promise him an assistant's position on Pather Panchali, and when production neared, invited him to shoot the film. As the 21-year-old Mitra had no prior filmmaking experience, the choice was met with scepticism by those who knew of the production. Mitra himself later speculated that Ray was nervous about working with an established crew.|$|E
