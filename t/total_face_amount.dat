50|$|After {{reviewing}} {{a series}} of life insurance strategies {{over a period of}} two years, Arthur Kramer applied for seven insurance policies in mid-2005 from three different insurance companies with a <b>total</b> <b>face</b> <b>amount</b> of $56.2 million. He created two insurance trusts to own these policies and designated his adult children Andrew Kramer, Rebecca Kramer and Liza Kramer as the trust beneficiaries. Shortly after the policies were issued and as a way to provide additional support and gifts to his children during his lifetime, he directed his children to sell their beneficial interests in the trusts to outside life settlement investors that had indicated an interest in owning these policies for an immediate lump sum payment of $660,000. In connection with receiving the $660,000, Arthur and his children then executed {{a series of}} documents with outside investors stating that the sale of the policies was {{in the best interest of}} their family and that they had sufficient time to analyze the strategy of selling their policy rights to third parties. The sale occurred before Arthur paid the first premium on any of the policies.|$|E

5000|$|The {{insurance}} policies for World Trade Center buildings 1 WTC, 2 WTC, 4 WTC and 5 WTC had a collective <b>face</b> <b>amount</b> of $3.55 billion.

The insurance companies took the opposite view, and the matter went to court. Based on differences in the definition of [...] "occurrence" [...] (the insurance policy term governing the amount of insurance) and uncertainties over which definition of [...] "occurrence" [...] applied, the court split the insurers into two groups for jury trials on the question of which definition of [...] "occurrence" [...] applied and whether the insurance contracts were subject to the [...] "one occurrence" [...] interpretation or the [...] "two occurrence" [...] interpretation.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the health-related {{quality of life}} of patients visiting a tertiary referral centre for facial palsy, and to analyse factors associated with health-related quality of life, using the FaCE Scale instrument. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The Facial Nerve Center at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, a tertiary referral centre. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a peripheral facial palsy visiting the centre for an initial consultation between August 2007 and June 2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The <b>total</b> <b>FaCE</b> score and the FaCE social function subdomain. Multiple regression models were developed to identify factors associated with the <b>total</b> <b>FaCE</b> score and FaCE social function score. RESULTS: A total of 794 patients {{with a mean age of}} 47. 0 +/- 16. 0 years were analysed in this study, of which 59. 9 % were female. The mean House-Brackmann, Sunnybrook, <b>total</b> <b>FaCE</b> and FaCE social function scores were 3. 6 +/- 1. 5, 48. 2 +/- 21. 2, 47. 3 +/- 19. 3 and 55. 5 +/- 19. 2, respectively. Increasing age (r = - 0. 229, P < 0. 001) was associated with a lower <b>total</b> <b>FaCE</b> score. Female gender (r = - 4. 422, P = 0. 033) and increased duration of palsy (r = - 0. 018, P = 0. 041) were associated with lower FaCE social function scores. CONCLUSIONS: While counselling patients on what to expect during the recovery process after facial paralysis is an important part of any clinical visit, FaCE score correlations suggest that female patients with chronic facial palsy and increased age constitute a patient category that may require additional time and attention to prevent or mitigate psychosocial dysfunction...|$|R

50|$|A {{juvenile}} {{life insurance}} policy typically requires a minimum of $700 of annual premium, which provides approximately $100,000 of face value. The policy owner may utilize the gift tax exclusion amount (up to $13,000 per person per year per child, in 2010) to help pay the annual premium and avoid gift tax liability. <b>Face</b> <b>amounts</b> for juvenile life insurance policies of this type range from $100,000 to $10,000,000.|$|R
50|$|Other {{permanent}} {{life insurance}} policies {{do not have}} built in cash values.

40|$|I n a {{reversal}} of the rapid upward trend of recent years, the <b>face</b> <b>amount</b> of long-term private activity tax-exempt bonds in 1986 decreased to $ 29. 9 billion. This volume, which represented a 75 percent decrease from the 1985 volume of $ 122. 0 billion was the smallest since 1981. (Private activity bonds are bonds issued by State and local Governments that provide a benefit for private businesses, organizations, or individuals.) In contrast, the <b>face</b> <b>amount</b> of public purpose tax-exempt bonds continued to increase in 1986 to $ 115. 5 billion. However, as shown in Figure A, the total dollar volume of all types of tax-exempt bonds declined by 33 percent in 1986 to $ 145. 7 billion [1]. The primary factor affecting the issuance of tax-exempt bonds in 1986 was tax reform, which had four main effects: 1.

5000|$|Variable {{universal}} {{life is a}} type of permanent life insurance, because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time {{as long as there is}} sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy. With most if not all VULs, unlike whole life, there is no endowment age (the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount, which for whole life is typically 100). This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole Life. With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the <b>face</b> <b>amount</b> specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the <b>face</b> <b>amount</b> is all that is paid out. Thus with either death or endowment, the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years. However, some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase [...] "paid up additions" [...] to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time.|$|R
