The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within <b>the</b> <b>subconscious</b> of Malkovich.|$|E

(The Prophet Jeremiah) “The heart has its reasons, of which reason knows nothing” (Blaise Pascal, Pensees). “If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed ” (Jesus of Nazareth) E. Stanley Jones introduced {{the idea of}} theunconverted subconscious in his spiritualautobiography A Song of Ascents (1968). He referred to this concept {{not in terms of}} salvation and eternal life in Christ per se, but with regard to an un-surrendered part of the soul or psyche that often gets left behind during and after conversion and spir-itual regeneration. According to Jones, <b>the</b> uncon-verted <b>subconscious</b> can {{play a major role in}} the spir-itual walk of believers. Examples of this can be seen in those who live incongruent and defeated lives, struggle with impulse control and addictive behav-iors, experience serious psychological dysfunction and relationship difficulties, fail to heal from experi-ences of the past, and suffer great emotional pain. However, Jones never fully developed the concept of <b>the</b> unconverted <b>subconscious,</b> nor did he attempt to explain the connection between <b>the</b> unconverted <b>subconscious,</b> spiritual deadness and derailment, and psychopathology in the life of the Christian. As we have further explored the idea of <b>the</b> unconvert-ed <b>subconscious</b> both personally and in the lives of our clients, we have realized that it is a concept replete with clinical implications and applications— even for those who do not work from a psychody-namic perspective.

Finally, the Predator started to court Carol (who did not know that the Predator was a part of herself) and battled Hal Jordan for her love.

25|$|P-Orridge's {{work was}} {{particularly}} {{influenced by the}} early 20th-century English artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare, who shared his disdain for mainstream morality and fascination with sexuality and the human body. P-Orridge adopted Spare's views on sigils, coming to see their own work {{as a form of}} sigil magic. Spare's sigilisation process entailed writing down one's desires, before crossing out any letters that are repeated and then combining the remaining letters into an abstract design, or sigil; the magician must then focus on that sigil and mentally absorb it, and – according to Spare's claims – psychic energies operating on <b>the</b> <b>subconscious</b> ensure that the original desire is manifested in reality. P-Orridge adopted this theory, believing that their work operates according to its principles.|$|E

The gift of his wife, given only allegedly by the caliph, is a technique used by many occultists in order to discern messages from <b>the</b> <b>subconscious</b> mind or from other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen, writing only on a simple sheet of paper and when the person's eyes are shut. In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William Shakespeare's works.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{the term}} Ego in the Discourses does not follow the Freudian definition, {{although}} generally it refers to the same concept and many parallels can be drawn. Baba makes no mention of the Id or the Super-ego, but only the distinction between the implicit and the explicit ego. The latter finds manifestation in consciousness, whereas the former remains in <b>the</b> <b>subconscious</b> mind. Isolated subconscious tendencies stored in the implicit ego must come to the explicit side {{to take part in a}} conscious process. Yet the explicit ego is very intricately organized and has self-protection mechanisms that act as a repressive barrier to subconscious tendencies. Since spiritual progress requires all subconscious tendencies to gradually pass through the conscious part of the mind and become refined and eventually eliminated, the explicit ego has to be weakened, under certain conditions, to permit this to happen.|$|E
25|$|Nelson's work {{revolves}} around a personal language of symbols and archetypes. The {{subjects of the}} paintings change from piece to piece and from project to project but {{the core of the}} work stems from his own personal lexicon of archetypal symbols. Nelson's work from 2000-2010 touches on Chicago Imagism, Funk Art, and outsider art, emphasizing simplified images. The works are rich in materiality. Surfaces are thick with densely saturated pigments and heavily worked with layers of drawing...even the drawings have dimension, with the paper lifting off its backing. As Kathryn M. Davis writes in ArtNews, Nelson’s “sly paintings conjure cartoons, found signage, and modern hieroglyphs, and tie them together with lusciously patinated surfaces. Nelson describes his own process: “The unconscious is like a reservoir. Themes emerge, some that are humorous, others that are cryptic and vague.” His work presents an idiosyncratic slant on the human figure and a psychological take on human nature. Though not wholly human the beings in Nelson's artwork reflect the shifting role of <b>the</b> <b>subconscious</b> self, part animal and part human, part nature and part culture.|$|E
