5|$|Tolkien's {{portrayal}} of goblins in The Hobbit was particularly influenced by George MacDonald's The Princess and the Goblin. However, MacDonald influenced Tolkien more profoundly than just to shape individual characters and episodes; his works further helped Tolkien form his whole <b>thinking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of fantasy within his Christian faith.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of <b>thinking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation {{may be seen}} as part of the background to the later development of attachment theory, there are many significant differences between the two. At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little research in this area and no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development of attachment theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from ethology, cybernetics, information processing, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. The first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised <b>thinking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E

25|$|Guderian's {{leadership}} was supported, fostered and institutionalised by his {{supporters in the}} Reichswehr General Staff system, which worked the Army to greater and greater levels of capability through massive and systematic Movement Warfare war games in the 1930s. Guderian's book incorporated the work of theorists such as Ludwig Ritter von Eimannsberger, whose book, The Tank War (Der Kampfwagenkrieg) (1934) gained a wide audience in the German army. Another German theorist, Ernst Volckheim, wrote a huge amount on tank and combined arms tactics and was influential to German <b>thinking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of armoured formations but his work was not acknowledged in Guderian's writings.|$|E

Now, the Americans are increasingly realising the futility of insisting on a rollback of India's nuclear programme.

25|$|Macleod was {{appointed}} Secretary of State for the Colonies in October 1959. He had {{never set foot}} in any of Britain’s colonies, but the Hola massacre had helped focus his <b>thinking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inevitable end of Empire. He told Peter Goldman of the Conservative Research Department that he intended to be the last Colonial Secretary, although he later wrote that he “telescoped events rather than creating new ones”. He saw Nigeria, British Somaliland, Tanganyika, Sierra Leone, Kuwait and British Cameroon become independent. He made a tour of Sub-Saharan Africa in 1960. He would often find himself in conflict with the more conservative Duncan Sandys, whom Macmillan had appointed Commonwealth Secretary as a counterweight to Macleod. Although Macmillan sympathised with Macleod’s aspirations, he was sometimes disturbed at the speed with which he progressed matters, and did not always come down on his side in political disputes.|$|E
25|$|Harry Haywood (February 6, 1898 – January 4, 1985) was {{a leading}} figure in both the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). His goal was to connect the {{political}} philosophy of the Communist Party with the issues of race. In 1926, he joined other African-American Communists and travelled to the Soviet Union to study the effect of Communism on racial issues found in the United States. His work there resulted in his selection {{to be the head}} of the Communist Party's Negro Department. The party platform changed by the late 1930s and began to stray away from advocating for African-American self-determination. As the party's platform changed over time, Haywood lost his stance within the party. His work also included creating a group to help the Scottsboro boys case. Haywood was also an author. His first book was Negro Liberation, published in 1948. After he was expelled from his affiliating party, he wrote an autobiography called Black Bolshevik, which was also published in 1978. He contributed major theory to Marxist <b>thinking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> national question of African Americans in the United States. He was also a founder of the Maoist New Communist movement.|$|E

500|$|The halt {{order has}} been the subject of much {{discussion}} by historians. Guderian considered the failure to order a timely assault on Dunkirk to be one of the major German mistakes on the Western Front. Rundstedt called it [...] "one of the great turning points of the war", and Manstein described it as [...] "one of Hitler's most critical mistakes". B. H. Liddell Hart interviewed many of the generals after the war and put together a picture of Hitler's strategic <b>thinking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> matter. Hitler believed that once Britain's troops left continental Europe, they would never return.|$|E
500|$|The {{downturn}} in the United States economy in 1852 led Marx and Engels to wonder if a revolutionary upsurge would soon occur. However, the United States' economy was too new to play host to a classical revolution. The western frontier in America always provided a relief valve for the pent-up forces that might in other countries cause social unrest. Any economic crisis {{which began in the}} United States would not lead to revolution unless one of the older economies of Europe [...] "caught the contagion" [...] from the United States. In other words, economies of the world were still seen as individual national systems which were contiguous with the national borders of each country. The Panic of 1857 broke the mould of all prior <b>thinking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world economy. Beginning in the United States, the Panic spread across the globe. Indeed, the Panic of 1857 was the first truly global economic crisis.|$|E

On one occasion, {{when they were}} having difficulty in the heat, Jardine said: [...] "Thank God we have one bowler in the side"—referring to Verity. The two men admired each other greatly. Verity {{was impressed with the}} depth of Jardine's <b>thinking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game and his intelligence, enjoying tactical discussions with him on the voyage to Australia. According to Alan Hill, Verity did not relish the Bodyline tactics on that tour but supported his captain's stance completely. Verity even named his second son Douglas after Jardine. Jardine considered Verity to be the best slow left-arm bowler of all time, writing: [...] "I venture to doubt whether any other bowler of his type has proved such a master on all kinds of wickets... No captain could have a greater asset on his side than Verity. He would make a great captain himself." [...] Historian David Frith writes that Verity was [...] "probably the cricketer [...] admired above all others", while Bob Wyatt believed the two men were very similar in outlook, temperament and desire to succeed.|$|E
