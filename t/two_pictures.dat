5|$|At {{the start}} of World War Two the British Government created the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, and {{appointed}} Kenneth Clark as its Chairman. Despite the public hostility between Clarke and himself, Nevinson was disappointed not to be offered a commission by WAAC. He submitted three paintings to WAAC in December 1940 which were also rejected. He worked as a stretcher-bearer in London throughout the Blitz, during which his own studio and the family home in Hampstead were hit by bombs. WAAC eventually purchased <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> from him, Anti-aircraft Defences and a depiction of a fire-bomb attack, The Fire of London, December 29th – An Historic Record.|$|E
5|$|Lister {{explained}} {{that she and her}} fellow cast members filmed on many locations, including army barracks. They filmed at Tatenhill Airfield, where staff had been told to remain secretive about the storyline. She also revealed that she was the only cast member out of her, Batley and Kelly who performed the aired skydiving for real. A Hollyoaks producer released <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> of funeral wreaths, one reading 'Zoe' and the other 'Sarah', in order to confuse viewers further as to whom the victim would be. On-screen after the skydive and Sarah's subsequent death, Lydia framed Zoe for the murder she committed, leading to her arrest.|$|E

5|$|The courts {{eventually}} {{decided the}} Warner Bros. lawsuit in Cagney's favor. He {{had done what}} many thought unthinkable: taking on the studios and winning. Not only did he win, but Warner Bros. also {{knew that he was}} still their foremost box office draw and invited him back for a five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, with no more than <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> a year. Cagney also had full say over what films he did and did not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.|$|E
5|$|Copper medals {{were struck}} to commemorate {{each of the}} contestants. The obverse side of these {{contained}} {{a picture of the}} respective fighter; the reverse had the Latin inscription Bella! Horrida bella! (a quotation from Virgil which can be translated as wars, horrible wars) and the words Strength and magnanimity in the case of Perrins, and Science and intrepidity for that of Johnson. Chaloner has speculated that these may have been produced by his employers and says that they bear similarities with the work of a French die maker called Ponthon who was supplying the firm with industrial items from at least 1791. The National Portrait Gallery holds <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> of the Banbury fight, one being an etching published by George Smeeton in 1812, and the other by Joseph Grozer in 1789.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Pool of Radiance game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, {{which describes}} secrets {{relating to the}} game and the concepts behind it. The booklet guides players through the character creation process, explaining how to create a party. The game also included the 38-page Adventurer's Journal, which provides the game's background. The booklet features depictions of fliers, maps, and information that characters see in the game. The package also included a translation decoder wheel. After the title screen, a copy protection screen was displayed consisting of <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> and a line. The player was required to use the decoder wheel to line up the pictures, then enter the word revealed on the decoder wheel. After three unsuccessful attempts, the game automatically shut down.|$|E

25|$|In 1918, Houdini {{signed a}} {{contract}} with film producer B. A. Rolfe to star in a 15-part serial, The Master Mystery (released in January 1919). As was common at the time, the film serial was released simultaneously with a novel. Financial difficulties resulted in B. A. Rolfe Productions going out of business, but The Master Mystery led to Houdini being signed by Famous Players-Lasky Corporation/Paramount Pictures, for whom he made <b>two</b> <b>pictures,</b> The Grim Game (1919) and Terror Island (1920).|$|E

25|$|In The Murder of Lee Oswald and The Warren Commission Torsten Billman incisively commented {{events in}} the wake of the {{assassination}} of president John F. Kennedy.

25|$|Gable's {{arrival in}} Hollywood {{occurred}} fortuitously. MGM {{was looking to}} expand its stable of male stars and he fit the bill. He first worked mainly in supporting roles, often as the villain. He made <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> in 1931 with Wallace Beery, a supporting role in The Secret Six, then with his part increasing in size to almost match Beery's in the naval aviation film Hell Divers. MGM's publicity manager Howard Strickling developed Gable's studio image, playing up his he-man experiences and his 'lumberjack in evening clothes' persona.|$|E

He stated in a report on MLB.com that the few possessions that they took for safekeeping were their marriage certificate, three wedding photographs, birth certificates, and <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> of his children with Pope Benedict, taken {{while they were in}} Rome last year.

25|$|After Manet's {{death the}} <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> hung {{on either side}} of the 1877 {{painting}} Jean-Baptiste Faure in the Role of Hamlet. From this arrangement Stoichiţă concludes that the choice of this Spanish influenced painting was meant to evoke a renewed parallel to Velázquez. Another message derived from the juxtaposition is that the self-portraits could almost be read as Manet in the Role of Manet. Juliet Wilson-Bareau, however, points out that Manet probably did not intend the pictures to be so displayed, as it was Léon Leenhoff who had the pictures framed and hung them {{on either side of}} the Faure portrait.|$|E
25|$|For 2008, Alonso {{switched}} {{back to one}} of {{his previous}} helmet designs, the yellow-blue coupled with a slight outward surrounding white helmet. Besides the rear helmet, Alonso also attached <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> of a spade, ace and heart symbol signifying his status as a double world champion. Alonso's return to the style of an old-fashioned helmet was because he re-joined the team Renault at that time. The design he used in the 2009 season was replacing the blue to a bright red helmet at the top and the bottom. The design was based on Michael Schumacher's helmet.|$|E
25|$|Virgin Media had {{displayed}} a V+ in their Oxford Street store using polarised glasses and trialled over a private {{video on demand}} network using a HD stream interlaced with <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> in 2009. In March 2010, during the Ideal Home Show at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Virgin Media showcased a reel of 3D content – including sport and video games – as a taste of its plans for 3D television. Virgin confirmed plans to start offering 3D content to subscribers via its on-demand platform rather than launching a static channel. The demo used active glasses but Virgin Media said that its 3D service would also support passive glasses.|$|E

25|$|The crank became {{common in}} Europe {{by the early}} 15th century, seen {{in the works of}} those such as the {{military}} engineer Konrad Kyeser (1366after 1405). A rotary grindstone − the earliest representation thereof − which is operated by a crank handle is shown in the Carolingian manuscript Utrecht Psalter; the pen drawing of around 830 goes back to a late antique original. A musical tract ascribed to the abbot Odo of Cluny (ca. 878−942) describes a fretted stringed instrument which was sounded by a resined wheel turned with a crank; the device later appears in two 12th century illuminated manuscripts. There are also <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> of Fortuna cranking her wheel of destiny from this and the following century.|$|E
25|$|Cassatt {{saw that}} works by female artists were often {{dismissed}} with contempt unless {{the artist had}} a friend or protector on the jury, {{and she would not}} flirt with jurors to curry favor. Her cynicism grew when one of the <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> she submitted in 1875 was refused by the jury, only to be accepted the following year after she darkened the background. She had quarrels with Sartain, who thought Cassatt too outspoken and self-centered, and eventually they parted. Out of her distress and self-criticism, Cassatt decided that she needed to move away from genre paintings and onto more fashionable subjects, in order to attract portrait commissions from American socialites abroad, but that attempt bore little fruit at first.|$|E
25|$|Although {{children}} perceive {{rhythmic patterns}} {{in their native}} language at 7–8 months, they {{are not able to}} reliably distinguish compound words and phrases that differ only in stress placement, such as ‘HOT dog’ vs. ‘hot DOG’ until around 12 years of age. Children in a study by Vogel and Raimy (2002) were asked to show which of <b>two</b> <b>pictures</b> (i.e., a dog or a sausage) was being named. Children younger than 12 years generally preferred the compound reading (i.e., the sausage) to the phrasal reading (the dog). The authors concluded from this that children start out with a lexical bias, i.e., they prefer to interpret phrases like these as single words, and the ability to override this bias develops until late in childhood.|$|E
