500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album's content, [...] "It's a pretty exhausting record. It's quite dense and I {{think some of the}} decisions we made don't always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking a lot more about what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to put something away and move on." ...|$|E
500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms {{of the quality of the}} show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E
500|$|After the 2001 NPC, Crusaders' captain Todd Blackadder left New Zealand to play rugby in Scotland. During the 2002 Super 12 pre-season, half-back Justin Marshall {{questioned}} {{which of}} the senior players were going to step into Blackadder's leadership role for the tough matches. Hammett took the comment [...] "as {{a slap in the}} face", as [...] "one player doesn't make a team." [...] Hammett later said [...] "I took it that way, and I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others must have as well, because we all ended up stepping up!" [...] Subsequently, the Crusaders went through the season unbeaten, including a 96–19 victory over the New South Wales Waratahs. He again played for the All Blacks in 2002, starting against Australia and South Africa in the Tri-Nations. The 2002 NPC season was Hammett's last, and although Canterbury were knocked out in their semi-final, they managed to retain the Ranfurly Shield. Hammett's last match was his 76th for Canterbury.|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{people are going}} to be impressed with her growth also because when she made <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the records that people have heard by now, she was just starting to rap." ...|$|R

Meier, a Catholic {{priest and}} a {{professor}} of theology at the University of Notre Dame, has stated [...] "...I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confusion {{comes from the fact that}} people claim they are doing a quest for the historical Jesus when de facto they’re doing theology, albeit a theology that is indeed historically informed..." [...] Meier also wrote that in the past the quest for the historical Jesus has often been motivated more by a desire to produce an alternate Christology than a true historical search.|$|E
2500|$|Lynch {{has said}} that he is [...] "not a {{political}} person". However, he has expressed admiration for former US President Ronald Reagan. Describing his political philosophy, he stated, [...] "at that time, I thought of myself as a libertarian. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations." [...] Lynch continued to state that [...] "I don't know if there even is a Libertarian party. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The Black Sheep Boy is a fantastical {{character}} that crops {{up here and}} there on the album. In the lyrics pretty much anything in quotes {{is the voice of}} the Black Sheep Boy. I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dirtier, rougher, more obtuse songs are the product of the Black Sheep Boy." ...|$|E

5000|$|Smith {{was raised}} in a Baptist {{household}} and went to a Catholic school, but he no longer identifies himself as religious. Though he is not a Scientologist and has denied rumors claiming him {{as a member of the}} Church of Scientology, he has spoken favorably about it, saying [...] "I just <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideas in Scientology are brilliant and revolutionary and non-religious." ...|$|E
5000|$|With Codes and Keys, the {{experimental}} {{side of the}} band was drawn out more through production than a set songwriting process. Nicholas Harmer stated: [...] "The making of this album {{was a little more}} open-ended as far as submitting different ideas if there were openings or holes for ideas to be submitted, but I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimentation came from the production side more than it did from the writing side." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jerry Rice, an NFL Hall of Famer {{who was a}} wide {{receiver}} for the Raiders at that time, was quoted as saying, [...] "I was very surprised that he waited till the last second and I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players they were surprised also {{so in a way}} maybe because he didn't like the Raiders he decided 'Hey look maybe we should sabotage just a little bit and let Jon Gruden go out and win this one.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Executive {{producer}} Falchuk {{stated that}} season four will not revolve around relationships {{as much as}} past seasons, commenting, [...] "Relationships in general will be less of a focus this year, I personally <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> these characters are more interesting not in relationships. And I <b>think</b> with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> them we will be exploring that. Whether they break up or not, we’re really focused on giving them more individual stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was to Jon like {{a ray of}} {{sunshine}} piercing through a fog. [...] "I'll make it Spain," [...] he said, [...] "Mother won't mind; she's never been there. And my father <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Goya." ...|$|R

5000|$|Of his {{inspiration}} for the Deadline Diaries series, Baker has said: “The idea for Deadline Diaries really sprung from me browsing the mystery-thriller section and realizing there are rarely ever any journalists as the hero. There are plenty of cops, private eyes, lawyers, {{and a lot of}} bloody vampires. ... I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> romanticism of the journalism profession that inspired me when I entered it in the early 1990s has been lost. A lot of the cynicism is deserved.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Chris Wolstenholme also said: [...] ""New Born", I think {{between the}} three of us is {{probably}} one of our favourite tracks off Origin of Symmetry. It is a good live track. I think it's one of the songs which showcases the experimental side of the band. It is not really a conventional pop song. I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reason for choosing these songs is that we went for the heavier more direct kind of songs rather than going for anything too mellow".|$|E

5000|$|For Artwork, McCracken {{described}} their genre as [...] "gross pop". Allman described the album's style: [...] "It's gonna be pretty raw. I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stuff {{is very much}} more poetic and lyrical, and the sound is more retro and raw with less production". On their fifth album Vulnerable, Bert McCracken stated {{that there is a}} lot of hip hop influence, beats and drum and bass kind of stuff, but it is also still a The Used record with many soft and heavy, brutal, sharp, bright sounds, and the tempos are anywhere from ultra-slow to super fast and heavy.|$|E
5000|$|Yet his {{presence}} was compelling and characteristically welcomed {{by those who}} would otherwise be in disagreement. Many years later, Germaine Greer noted his influence on her: ...Harry, the utopian anarchist who had admired her red stockings, who believed people were perfect and who was not weighed down by the tremendous forces the anarchistic pessimists felt bore down on them all the time. [...] "Alas, I understand him much better now," [...] she said, twenty years later.

50|$|Individual {{approaches}} to prejudice reduction are {{not dependent on}} intergroup interaction. These approaches only require that an individual be exposed to some relevant information and/or engage in an activity intended to reduce prejudice. There are two main types of individual {{approaches to}} prejudice reduction: affective strategies that target what and how you feel, and cognitive strategies that target what and how you <b>think.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} affective and cognitive strategies is based on laboratory findings. As most of these studies consist of one-time sessions, it is unclear how long the positive effects of the strategies last. Also, there is not much knowledge {{about the extent to which}} these strategies are effective in situations outside of the laboratory.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the albums {{widespread}} {{critical acclaim}} and a Best New Music nod from Pitchfork, Tatum {{reflected on the}} albums recording process in 2013, stating: [...] "Nocturne felt like {{it took a long}} time for me. I took my time and it was really spread out, with months in between writing songs. There was so much thought put into that record, so much of me being a perfectionist, like, Okay, this really has to sound a certain way. In a lot of ways, I listen to that record now and think I thought way too hard on this. To me, it’s sort of missing something… even though Im so proud of that record and I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs are good.
