In April 1923, Zeeland was converted to cabin- and third-class passenger service only. Zeeland began her last Red Star voyage on 8 October 1926. Transferred to the Atlantic <b>Transport</b> <b>Line</b> in 1927, the liner was renamed SS Minnesota and began tourist service between London and New York in April.

25|$|Since 1902, IMM had an {{agreement}} with James Pirrie, chairman of Harland & Wolff {{and member of the}} management of the White Star Line, stating that the vessels of the company will be built by Harland & Wolff for all the time. Ships of the company were also shifting from one company to another, like the Belgic, built for the White Star Line, which was transferred to the service of the Red Star Line under the name , or the Regina became the Westernland. This allowed the IMM to schedule a ship each day from the United Kingdom, and passengers to change their tickets to a position equivalent to another vessel of the company. Baker retired {{from the direction of the}} Atlantic <b>Transport</b> <b>Line</b> shortly after its integration with the IMM, and was replaced by Philip Franklin. He later became vice president of IMM, while Griscom was replaced as president by Joseph Bruce Ismay in 1904 (who was also president of the White Star Line).|$|E

Baker of Baltimore and the Atlantic <b>Transport</b> <b>Line.</b> While under de facto American ownership, she would fly the British flag, due to the economies of the navigation laws of the period. The Mississippi was launched on August 29, 1890 and began her maiden voyage, from London, on October 28, 1890.

2500|$|The {{goals of}} PIP-II include {{a plan to}} {{delivery}} 1.2MW of proton beam power from the Main Injector to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment target at 120GeV and the power near 1MW at 60GeV with a possibility to extend the power to 2MW in the future. The plan should also support the current 8GeV experiments including Mu2e, g−2, and other short-baseline neutrino experiments. These require an upgrade to the linac to inject to the Booster with 800MeV. The first option is to add 400MeV [...] "afterburner" [...] superconducting linac {{at the tail end}} of the existing 400MeV. This requires moving the existing [...] linac up [...] However, there are many technical issues with this approach. The preferred option is to build a new 800MeV superconducting linac to inject to the Booster ring. The new linac site will be located on top of a small portion of Tevatron near the Booster ring in order to take advantage of existing electrical and water, and cryogenic infrastructure. The PIP-II linac will have low energy beam <b>transport</b> <b>line</b> (LEBT), radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ), and medium energy beam <b>transport</b> <b>line</b> (MEBT) operated at the room temperature at with a 162.5MHz and energy increasing from 0.03MeV. The first segment of linac will be operated at 162.5MHz and energy increased up to 11MeV. The second segment of linac will be operated at 325MHz and energy increased up to 177MeV. The last segment of linac will be operated at 650MHz and will have the final energy level of 800MeV.|$|E
2500|$|IMM {{was founded}} by {{shipping}} magnates Clement Griscom of the American Line and Red Star Line, Bernard N. Baker of the Atlantic <b>Transport</b> <b>Line,</b> J. Bruce Ismay of the White Star Line, and John Ellerman of the Leyland Line. The Dominion Line was also amalgamated. The project was bankrolled by J.P. Morgan & Co., led by financier J. P. Morgan. The company also had working profit-sharing relationships with the German Hamburg-Amerika and the North German Lloyd lines. The trust caused great concern in the British shipping industry and led directly to the British government's subsidy of the Cunard Line's new ships RMS Lusitania and RMS Mauretania {{in an effort to}} compete. However, IMM dramatically overpaid to acquire some of the amalgamated companies, due to overestimation of potential profits.|$|E
