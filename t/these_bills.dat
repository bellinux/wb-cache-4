5|$|As {{its first}} {{enforcement}} legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing black Americans citizenship and {{equal protection of}} the law, though not the right to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several Freedmen's Bureau bills. President Andrew Johnson vetoed <b>these</b> <b>bills,</b> but Congress overrode his vetoes to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, the C {{submitted}} another {{bill for}} Parliamentary consideration seeking {{to increase its}} capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways to allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used. A separate bill was published {{at the same time}} by the London Electric Railway (LER, a company formed by the UERL in 1910 through a merger of the BS, GNP and CCE), which included plans to construct tunnels to connect the C at Euston to the CCE's station at Camden Town. Together, the works proposed in <b>these</b> <b>bills</b> would enable the CCE's trains to run over the C's route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, the Mint {{had begun}} to strike {{copper-nickel}} clad coins instead of silver, due to rises in bullion prices. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, and none, initially, were minted in the new metal. Beginning in 1969, legislators sought to reintroduce a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died in March of that year, {{there were a number}} of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While <b>these</b> <b>bills</b> generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President Richard Nixon, who had served as vice president under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing the new coin on December 31, 1970.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{legislative}} session of Bradley's term, 75 bills were filed, including {{a ban on}} the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, a measure to make carrying a concealed weapon a felony, and a bill banning gambling at racetracks and church fairs. Competing measures affecting pool halls were introduced – one would have lifted most of the restrictions on their operation while another would have banned them altogether. Bradley added an anti-lynching law to the legislative agenda. However, none of <b>these</b> <b>bills</b> were acted on; {{the vast majority of the}} Assembly's attention during the session was focused on the election of a U.S. Senator.|$|E

30|$|The {{past several}} years has seen an {{increase}} in the electronic storage of patient records using Electronic Health Records (EHR). Data is typically stored in two formats: structured and unstructured. Structured data is stored in a form which can be directly queried and results returned as a normalized data structure. Structured data includes ICD- 10 codes and patient demographics. ICD- 10 codes are commonly used for billing purposes and may not include a complete picture of the patient. Additionally, <b>these</b> <b>billing</b> codes may be assigned based on financial reimbursement incentives rather than accuracy [8].|$|R

40|$|Mobile network {{operators}} often bill their customers {{based on their}} network usage. For this purpose, operators collect information about billable events, such as calls, text messages, and data usage. In recent years, operators have realized that they can monetize <b>these</b> <b>billing</b> records by selling insights extracted from them. In this thesis, a multi-stage data analysis algorithm is presented that uses <b>these</b> <b>billing</b> records for travel mode classification. This algorithm identifies whether a mobile phone user has traveled using a public transportation bus or using another transportation mode. The billing records collected by a network operator contain the time at which a billable event happened, {{as well as the}} network cell from which the event originated. The coverage area of each network cell is known to the operator. Therefore, the billing records of a mobile phone user give an overview of that user’s approximate location at different times. This data can be used to discover the sequence of network cells that the user has traveled through during a trip. Travel mode classification algorithms in literature analyze long-distance or medium- distance trips. The data analysis algorithm presented in this thesis is novel for analyzing and classifying short-distance, intra-city trips. To classify mobility traces, it uses publicly available bus timetable data and road network infrastructure data. The accuracy of the classification algorithm is evaluated using a two-fold cross-validation analysis...|$|R
