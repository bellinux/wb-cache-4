6000|$|Though Walker desired {{nothing so}} much in the world at that moment as the liberty to knock down his wife, his sense of {{prudence}} overcame his desire for justice: if that feeling may be called prudence on his part, which consisted in a strong wish to cheat the bailiff into the idea that he (Walker) was an exceedingly respectable and wealthy man. Many worthy persons indulge in this fond notion, that they are imposing upon the world; strive to fancy, for instance, that their bankers consider them men of property because they keep a <b>tolerable</b> <b>balance,</b> pay little tradesmen's bills with ostentatious punctuality, and so forth--but the world, let us be pretty sure, is as wise as need be, and guesses our real condition with a marvellous instinct, or learns it with curious skill. The London tradesman is one of the keenest judges of human nature extant; and if a tradesman, how much more a bailiff? In reply to the ironic question, [...] "What's a hundred and fifty pounds to you?" [...] Walker, collecting himself, answers, [...] "It is an infamous imposition, and I owe the money no more than you do; but, nevertheless, I shall instruct my lawyers to pay it {{in the course of the}} morning: under protest, of course." ...|$|E
40|$|Antipsychotic {{medications}} are the gold-standard treat-ment for schizophrenia, and {{are often}} prescribed for other mental conditions. However, the efficacy and side-effect profiles of these drugs are heterogeneous, with large interindividual variability. As a result, treat-ment selection remains a largely trial-and-error pro-cess, with many failed treatment regimens endured before finding a <b>tolerable</b> <b>balance</b> between symptom management and side effects. Much of the interindi-vidual variability in response and side effects is due to genetic factors (heritability, h 2 ~ 0. 60 â€“ 0. 80). Pharmaco-genetics is an emerging field that holds the potential to facilitate {{the selection of the}} best medication for a particular patient, based on his or her genetic infor-mation. In this review we discuss the most promising genetic markers of antipsychotic treatment outcomes, and present current translational research efforts that aim to bring these pharmacogenetic findings to the clinic in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Tourism {{development}} {{has been part of}} national strategy to accelerate economic growth, enhance the landscape development based on sound economic system, improve the welfare of the people and improve the quality of life. In order to protect the interests of all stakeholders, each development must be planned, monitored, and controlled so it will be more <b>tolerable</b> and <b>balanced</b> between economic, social and ecological culture. It is appropriate that if every tourist destination adhered to the concept of sustainability which has always wanted to increase quality of life in the long run, based on the principles of continuity. With this, North Sumatra province has been selected to conduct a more detailed view of the potential for growth and volatility based on what is happening at the moment. In general, this study is designed to examine, evaluate, and identify the elements in the concept of sustainable tourism development in the study area. It will discuss how various elements within the dimension of economic, social and ecological are associated or deem to have relationship to the development of sustainable tourism. The study took into account the views of some 300 respondents which were randomly selected, and data were analysed using SPSS software for regression, ANOVA, correlation coefficients / determination and significance. The results show that essentially all of the elements / dimension are having some kind of relationships to sustainable development. However there are no significant relationship on the elements of religious, cultural and human resources in the social dimension to support sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of realising Coasean bargains to remove the presence of externalities in a libertarian system of exclusive spectrum rights {{through the creation of}} various economically motivated easements. We advocate that dynamic spectrum access (DSA) techniques can be used to enable rights holders reduce or eliminate the effects of externalities through local bargaining. Many of the objections to the promotion of market-based exclusive-rights assignment systems concern the ability of rights holders to enforce their spectrum rights, so as to extract maximal value. In an increasingly fragmented and less-regulated spectrum landscape, there will be an inevitable chafing of rights at the boundaries between the users of neighbouring blocks of spectrum; the spectral activities of one network may impinge on the ability of a neighbouring network to extract maximum value from its exclusively assigned spectrum. Nonetheless, it is argued {{that it is possible to}} reduce, or eliminate, the existence of such externalities through the adjustment and exchange of rights through value-extraction-focussed bargaining. In essence, this represents a shift from a mindset of unilaterally enforcing rights to one of mutual remediation of any encroachment. Such an approach may offer a non-Pigouvian remedy to both the under-utilisation and over-utilisation of packages of exclusive rights to spectrum, allowing neighbours to find a <b>tolerable</b> level (a <b>balance)</b> of interference. This paper posits that DSA techniques will have a key role to play in the development of new DSA-based Coasean bargains which will be necessary to address a variety of coexistence issues that will arise between systems operating in neighbouring blocks of exclusively assigned spectrum...|$|R
