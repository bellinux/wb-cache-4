The first section of the study looks at retirement planning in general to give an understanding of how an individual can effectively save for retirement. Next, the study deals specifically with the saving habits of <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> generation. This section discusses the relevant statistics concerning <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> generation and their lack of retirement saving. The last half of the study deals with a survey conducted about saving habits of individuals. This section looks at the generational differences in five factors of retirement savings: Social Security, aversion to technology, expected age of retirement, self-leadership, and perception of risk. Conclusions were then drawn from the findings of the study to give reasons why <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> generation is not saving adequately for retirement.

The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism.

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} an exploratory attempt at studying the purchasing behaviour of both <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts {{in relation to}} the five stages of the consumer decision making (CDM) model. The {{purpose of this study is}} to (1) analyse and compare the attitudes and behaviours of both <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts in their purchasing behaviour in high ticket purchases, and (2) examine in greater depth the information search stage of the CDM model adopted by these two mentioned cohorts {{in relation to the}} purchase of a motor vehicle. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were conducted and information was gathered from 50 respondents between the ages of 18 - 32 and 45 - 63. Results from the Independent samples T-test, One sample T-test and the Pearson correlation test found that both <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts were equally involved in their search for information on motor vehicles, particularly searching for information on the Internet. Results from further tests also revealed that Generation Y is more likely to seek advice from friends and family members, and also recommending the same model of motor vehicle and/or brand to friends and family members. Additionally, findings showed that Generation Y consumers favoured brands more than <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> consumers, particularly when choosing motor vehicle brands. Further findings revealed that the more involved <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts positioned themselves towards the purchase of the motor vehicle, the more information they searched. Finally, findings from the study revealed that internal information search is initially used by both <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts, however there needs to be more research carried out for the usage of external information in the consumer decision making process. Recommendations made to marketing practitioners within this thesis can be summarised as follows. Firstly, more information should be made readily available and easily accessible to <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts through print and other forms of media such as the Internet, televisions and radios. Secondly, marketing practitioners should attract <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and retain Generation Y consumers through loyalty programs and building communications based on the needs, wants and perceived relevance as depicted by these consumers. Accordingly, this will produce favourable word-of-mouth promotions and recommendations by <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y consumers...|$|R
25|$|In {{the last}} 50 years {{there have been}} great changes toward gender {{equality}} in industrialised nations such as the United States of America. With the feminist movement of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women had also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right {{back out of the}} labor force when the men returned home from war to raise children born in the generation of <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomers.</b> In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force in record numbers, they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period.|$|E

Results: The majority of experts were identified as <b>baby</b> <b>boomers</b> and made use of phrases associated with <b>the</b> popular <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> image, such as ‘cashed up’, ‘reinventing retirement’ and ‘sea change’.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the motivational differences across the major generations and the specific cusps between <b>the</b> Veterans and <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomers,</b> between <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomers</b> and Generation X, and between Generation X and Generation Y. ^ Data were collected from 1, 098 self-selected employees of a large healthcare system in the Midwest.

Significant differences in the sources of motivation among the four generations and the cusps of generations for four of the five MSI subscales were identified. ^ Intrinsic process motivation was found to be significantly higher for Generation Y than Generation X, <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomers,</b> and <b>the</b> cusp between <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation X. Intrinsic process was also significantly higher for Generation X than <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomers</b> and <b>the</b> cusp between <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation X. ^ Instrumental motivation of Generation Y was significantly higher than Generation X, <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomers,</b> and <b>the</b> cusp between <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation X.
