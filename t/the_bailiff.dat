5|$|The moot {{mound of}} Secklow Hundred has been found, {{excavated}} and reconstructed – {{it is on}} the highest point in the central area and is just behind the Library in modern Central Milton Keynes. Only one medieval manor house survives: the 15th century Manor Farmhouse in Loughton. There are sites of other manor houses in Great Woolstone, Milton Keynes village and Woughton on the Green. The oldest surviving domestic building is Number22, Milton Keynes (village), the house of <b>the</b> <b>bailiff</b> of the manor of Bradwell.|$|E

To which I answer: <b>the</b> <b>bailiff's</b> mother did it. And, what is more, gloried in doing it--not, observe, {{as an act of}} hostility to my relatives, but simply as a duty that lay on her conscience.|$|R

50|$|In 1617 a Privy Council {{decision}} clarified {{the division}} of civil and military responsibilities between <b>the</b> <b>Bailiffs</b> and <b>the</b> Lieutenant Governors in Guernsey and Jersey.

5|$|In {{the early}} fourteenth century, Lihou {{may have become}} the origin of a local legend about a wealthy Bailiff of Guernsey who {{attempted}} to have an innocent peasant executed on false charges of theft of silver cups. In either 1302 or 1304, a priory servant called Thomas le Roer was alleged to have murdered one of the monks. <b>The</b> <b>Bailiff</b> and several assistants attempted to apprehend Le Roer {{but he did not}} surrender and was subsequently killed by Ranulph Gautier, one of the Bailiff's assistants. Gautier tried to find sanctuary in a nearby church and eventually fled to England, before returning to Guernsey when the king pardoned him. However, some years later Gautier was tortured to death in Castle Cornet, but it is not known why.|$|E
5|$|This {{success in}} turn {{led to a}} vogue in America and the West for Japanese movies {{throughout}} the 1950s, replacing the enthusiasm for Italian neorealist cinema. For example, {{by the end of}} 1952 Rashamon was released in Japan, the United States, and most of Europe. Among the Japanese filmmakers whose work, as a result, began to win festival prizes and commercial release in the West were Kenji Mizoguchi (The Life of Oharu, Ugetsu, Sansho <b>the</b> <b>Bailiff)</b> and, somewhat later, Yasujirō Ozu (Tokyo Story, An Autumn Afternoon)—artists highly respected in Japan but, prior to this period, almost totally unknown in the West. Kurosawa's growing reputation among Western audiences in the 1950s would make Western audiences more sympathetic to the reception of later generations of Japanese filmmakers ranging from Kon Ichikawa, Masaki Kobayashi, Nagisa Oshima and Shohei Imamura to Juzo Itami, Takeshi Kitano and Takashi Miike.|$|E
5|$|Malick {{spent years}} working on other projects, {{including}} a stage production of Sansho <b>the</b> <b>Bailiff</b> and a script known as The English-Speaker, spending $2 {{million of the}} producers' money, half of which for writing. In 1990, he met with James Jones' widow Gloria and his daughter Kaylie about adapting The Thin Red Line into a film. By January 1995, Geisler and Roberdeau were broke and pressured Malick to decide which one he would complete. They approached Malick's former agent, Mike Medavoy, who was setting up his own production company, Phoenix Pictures, and he agreed to give them $100,000 to start work on The Thin Red Line. Medavoy had a deal with Sony Pictures and Malick began scouting locations in Panama and Costa Rica before settling on the rain forests of northern Australia. In April 1997, three months before filming, Sony pulled the plug while crews were building the sets in Queensland, because new studio chairman John Calley did not think Malick could make his movie with the proposed $52 million budget. Malick traveled to Los Angeles with Medavoy to pitch the project to various studios. 20th Century Fox agreed to put up $39 million of the budget with the stipulation that Malick cast five movie stars {{from a list of}} 10 who were interested. Pioneer Films, a Japanese company, contributed $8 million to the budget, and Phoenix added $3 million.|$|E

5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants. It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants, consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the defendants separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants. Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. <b>The</b> <b>bailiff</b> proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the defendants. The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E

The same night they asked for peace, but <b>the</b> <b>bailiff</b> and the people of Ladoga did not grant it; and they killed all the prisoners and ran into forests, after abandoning their ships.

In the Georgian era, patronage of such seaside places (such as nearby Brighton) gave it a new lease of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a County Borough, responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex (East); less than one hundred years later, in 1974, that status was abolished.|$|E

Meyerbeer's opera had previously been staged at the Théâtre italien and was performed by an almost entirely Italian company led by Pasta and Domenico Donzelli. In Le rossignol, Lays once more played his favourite character of <b>the</b> <b>bailiff,</b> while the principal female role of Philis was taken by Laure Cinti-Damoreau, a pupil of Rossini, soon to become the leading lady in the composer’s French operas.|$|E
25|$|Following the August 1944 British {{refusal to}} allow the {{evacuation}} of civilians from the Channel Islands, as proposed by the Germans, <b>the</b> <b>Bailiff</b> of Jersey with the agreement of the German authorities was allowed {{to send a message}} to Britain in November 1944 stating the level of food reserves available to the civilians with the request for Red Cross relief. In the autumn of 1944 various escapees had passed similar messages to the British about conditions in the Islands.
