5|$|The artery is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima artery is of surgical importance; {{due to its}} relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding in surgery of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of the artery is especially important during <b>tracheostomy</b> and thyroidectomy. Because the artery is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin {{from one of the}} bigger vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss. The artery, if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity.|$|E
5|$|The first {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) of Brussels. In his landmark book published in 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into the trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently. Antonio Musa Brassavola (1490–1554) of Ferrara successfully treated a patient suffering from peritonsillar abscess by tracheotomy. Brassavola published his account in 1546; this operation {{has been identified as}} the first recorded successful tracheotomy, despite the many previous references to this operation. Towards the end of the 16th century, Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) described a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. Fabricius was the first to introduce the idea of a <b>tracheostomy</b> tube. In 1620 the French surgeon Nicholas Habicot (1550–1624) published a report of four successful tracheotomies. In 1714, anatomist Georg Detharding (1671–1747) of the University of Rostock performed a tracheotomy on a drowning victim.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to assess current {{practice}} of performing <b>tracheostomies</b> in patients after major cardiothoracic surgery, critically ill cardiology patients and patients with extracorporeal cardiac support, to evaluate the safety of procedure and determine the timing of <b>tracheostomies</b> and the duration of mechanical ventilation.|$|R
30|$|Patient age, gender {{distribution}} and APACHE II scores were similar during the observation period. There {{was a significant}} {{reduction in the number of}} procedures compared to 2009 and there was also a clear trend for performing <b>tracheostomies</b> later from 2012. In 2014 there was a dramatic reduction in the number of procedures, with apparently increased mortality. However, overall outcome of the patients ventilated for > 5 days with or without <b>tracheostomies</b> has been unchanged during the years. In 2014 none of the <b>tracheostomies</b> were performed to enable the reduction of sedation and all of them were preceded by at least one attempt for extubation.|$|R
5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a <b>tracheostomy</b> tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
25|$|<b>Tracheostomy</b> — When {{patients}} require {{mechanical ventilation}} for several weeks, a <b>tracheostomy</b> {{may provide the}} most suitable access to the trachea. A <b>tracheostomy</b> is a surgically created passage into the trachea. <b>Tracheostomy</b> tubes are well-tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. <b>Tracheostomy</b> tubes may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected {{to be difficult to}} wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.|$|E

25|$|Cricothyrotomy — Patients {{requiring}} emergency airway management, in whom {{tracheal intubation}} has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical {{opening in the}} cricothyroid membrane.

25|$|Medical {{management}} generally involves {{efforts to}} prevent pulmonary complications, since lung infections can be fatal in patients lacking the muscle strength necessary to clear secretions via coughing.

25|$|Surgery {{can include}} laser {{excision}} of small vocal cord lesions, partial laryngectomy (removal {{of part of}} the larynx) or total laryngectomy (removal of the whole larynx). If the whole larynx has been removed the person is left with a permanent <b>tracheostomy.</b> Voice rehabilitation in such patients can be achieved through 3 important ways - esophageal speech, tracheoesophageal puncture or electrolarynx.

25|$|Inflammation of the {{epiglottis}} {{is known}} as epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is mainly caused by Haemophilus influenzae. A person with epiglottitis may have a fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. For this reason, acute epiglottitis is considered a medical emergency, {{because of the risk}} of obstruction of the pharynx. Epiglottitis is often managed with antibiotics, racemic epinephrine (a sympathomimetic bronchodilator that is delivered by aerosol), and may require tracheal intubation or a <b>tracheostomy</b> if breathing is difficult. Behind the root of the tongue is an epiglottic vallecula which is an important anatomical landmark in intubation.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the modern positive-pressure {{ventilators}} were based mainly on technical developments by the military during World War II to supply oxygen to fighter pilots in high altitude. Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and {{was the beginning of}} modern ventilation therapy. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a <b>tracheostomy</b> tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.|$|E
25|$|Because PPS can fatigue facial muscles, {{as well as}} cause {{dysphagia}} (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking) or aphonia (inability {{to produce}} speech), persons with PPS may become malnourished due to difficulty eating. Compensatory routines can help relieve these symptoms such as eating smaller portions {{at a time and}} sitting down whilst eating. PPS with respiratory involvement requires special management such as breathing exercises, chest percussion with a stethoscope on regular occasions for observation of the disease and management of secretions. Failure to properly assess PPS with respiratory involvement can increase the risk of missing aspiration pneumonia (an infection of the lower respiratory tract) in an individual. Severe cases may require permanent ventilation or <b>tracheostomy.</b> Sleep apnoea may also occur. Other management strategies that may lead to improvement include smoking cessation, treatment of other respiratory diseases and vaccination against respiratory infections such as influenza.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 16th century, anatomist and surgeon Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) {{described}} a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. He advised using a vertical incision and was the first to introduce the idea of a <b>tracheostomy</b> tube. This was a straight, short cannula that incorporated wings to prevent the tube from advancing too far into the trachea. He recommended the operation {{only as a last resort}} in cases of airway obstruction by foreign bodies or secretions. Fabricius' description of the tracheotomy procedure is similar to that used today. Julius Casserius (1561–1616) succeeded Fabricius as professor of anatomy at the University of Padua and published his own writings regarding technique and equipment for tracheotomy, recommending a curved silver tube with several holes in it. Marco Aurelio Severino (1580–1656), a skillful surgeon and anatomist, performed multiple successful tracheotomies during a diphtheria epidemic in Naples in 1610, using the vertical incision technique recommended by Fabricius. He also developed his own version of a trocar.|$|E

40|$|Speech {{prosthesis}} aspiration A 68 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of laryngeal cancer status post-laryngectomy was referred to the emergency room for an abnormal chest CT scan. The scan showed a small dense object in the distal aspect of the left mainstem bronchus at the orifice of the left lower lobe and left upper lobe bronchus consistent with an aspirated foreign body (figure 1). Upon our evaluation, the patient denied having cough, haemoptysis, shortness of breath or any history of aspiration episodes. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed a foreign object embedded in the mucosa at the carina of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe bronchus. We removed the object and were surprised to discover that it was a speech prosthesis (figure 2). Only a few cases of prosthetic appliances aspiration in patients with permanent post-laryngectomy tracheal stoma were reported. 1 We believe that the presence of such a stoma should be added to the risk factors for foreign body aspiration. In patients with <b>tracheostomies,</b> recollection of the aspiration event may be absent and symptoms may appear only after complications develop.

25|$|The Renaissance saw {{significant}} {{advances in}} anatomy and surgery, and surgeons became increasingly open to surgery on the trachea. Despite this, {{the mortality rate}} failed to improve. From 1500 through 1832 there are only 28 known descriptions of successful tracheotomy in the literature. The first detailed descriptions on tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) of Brussels. In his landmark book published in 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into the trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently.

Antonio Musa Brassavola (1490–1554) of Ferrara treated a patient suffering from peritonsillar abscess by tracheotomy after the patient had been refused by barber surgeons.

500|$|Since {{mechanical}} ventilation can worsen a pneumothorax, it can force {{air into the}} tissues; when subcutaneous emphysema occurs in a ventilated patient, it {{is an indication that}} the ventilation may have caused a pneumothorax. It is not unusual for subcutaneous emphysema to result from positive pressure ventilation. [...] Another possible cause is a ruptured trachea. [...] The trachea may be injured by <b>tracheostomy</b> or tracheal intubation; in cases of tracheal injury, large amounts of air can enter the subcutaneous space. An endotracheal tube can puncture the trachea or bronchi and cause subcutaneous emphysema.|$|E
500|$|A {{tracheal}} tube is a catheter that is {{inserted into the}} trachea for {{the primary purpose of}} establishing and maintaining a patent (open and unobstructed) airway. Tracheal tubes are frequently used for airway management in the settings of general anesthesia, critical care, mechanical ventilation and emergency medicine. Many different types of {{tracheal tube}}s are available, suited for different specific applications. An endotracheal tube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal). It is a breathing conduit designed to be placed into the airway of critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients in order to perform mechanical positive pressure ventilation of the lungs and to prevent the possibility of aspiration or airway obstruction. The endotracheal tube has a fitting designed to be connected to a source of pressurized gas such as oxygen. At the other end is an orifice through which such gases are directed into the lungs and may also include a balloon (referred to as a cuff). The tip of the endotracheal tube is positioned above the carina (before the trachea divides to each lung) and sealed within the trachea so that the lungs can be ventilated equally. A <b>tracheostomy</b> tube is another type of tracheal tube; this [...] curved metal or plastic tube is inserted into a <b>tracheostomy</b> stoma or a cricothyrotomy incision.|$|E

The mean number of ICU admissions with sCAP per year was inversely correlated with hospital mortality. Many other parameters that are often claimed {{to be associated with}} better or worse outcome (like differences in antibiotic therapy) did not correlate with outcome.|$|R
