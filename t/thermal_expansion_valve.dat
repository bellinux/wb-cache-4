5000|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (often {{abbreviated}} as TEV, TXV, or TX valve) is {{a component}} in refrigeration {{and air conditioning}} systems that controls the amount of refrigerant and or voltage flow into the evaporator or electrical compartment thereby controlling the superheat or voltage, depending on the situation, at the outlet of the evaporator, or in the disconnect box. Thermal expansion valves are often referred to generically as [...] "metering devices". TXV's have been notorious for electrical failure/damage.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> is a {{key element}} to a heat pump; the cycle that makes air conditioning, or air cooling, possible. A basic {{refrigeration}} cycle consists of four major elements, a compressor, a condenser, a metering device and an evaporator. As a refrigerant passes through a circuit containing these four elements, air conditioning occurs. The cycle starts when refrigerant enters the compressor in a low-pressure, moderate-temperature, gaseous form. The refrigerant is compressed by the compressor to a high-pressure and high-temperature gaseous state. The high-pressure and high-temperature gas then enters the condenser. The condenser converts the high-pressure and high-temperature gas to a high-pressure liquid by transferring heat to a lower temperature medium, usually ambient air.|$|E
50|$|The {{condensed}} and pressurized liquid refrigerant is next {{routed through}} the receiver-drier, that is, a one way desiccant and filter cartridge that both dehydrates the refrigerant and compressor lubricant oil mixture {{in order to}} remove any residual water content (which would become ice inside the expansion valve and therefore clog it) that the vacuum done prior to the charging process didn't manage to remove from the system, and filters {{it in order to}} remove any solid particles carried by the mixture, and then through a <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant, lowering its temperature. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the evaporator coil in the passenger compartment.|$|E

40|$|The survey from US Department of Energy {{showed that}} {{about one-third of}} energy {{consumption}} in US is due to air conditioning and refrigeration systems. This significant usage of electricity in the HVAC industry has prompted researchers to develop dynamic models for the HVAC components, which leads to implementation of better control and optimization techniques. In this research, efforts are made to model a multi-evaporator system. A novel dynamic modeling technique is proposed based on moving boundary method, which can be generalized {{for any number of}} evaporators in a vapor compression cycle. The models were validated experimentally on a commercial supermarket refrigeration unit. Simulation results showed that the models capture the major dynamics of the system in both the steady state and transient external disturbances. Furthermore the use of MEMS (microelectromechanical) based Silicon <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves</b> (SEVs) have reportedly shown power savings as compared to the <b>Thermal</b> <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves</b> (TEVs). Experimental tests were conducted on a supermarket refrigeration unit fitted with the MEMS valves to explain the cause of these potential energy savings. In this study an advanced cascaded control algorithm was also designed to control the MEMS valves. The performance of the cascaded control architecture was compared with the standard <b>Thermal</b> <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves</b> (TEVs) and a commercially available Microstaq (MS) Superheat Controller (SHC). The results reveal that the significant efficiency gains derived on the SEVs are due to better superheat regulation, tighter superheat control and superior cooling effects in shorter time period which reduces the total run-time of the compressor. It was also observed that the duty cycle was least for the cascaded control algorithm. The reduction in duty cycle indicates early shut-off for the compressor resulting in maximum power savings for the cascaded control, followed by the Microstaq controller and then the <b>Thermal</b> <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valves...</b>|$|R

50|$|The vapor-compression uses a {{circulating}} liquid refrigerant as {{the medium}} which absorbs and removes {{heat from the}} space to be cooled and subsequently rejects that heat elsewhere. Figure 1 depicts a typical, single-stage vapor-compression system. All such systems have four components: a compressor, a condenser, a <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (also called a throttle valve or metering device), and an evaporator. Circulating refrigerant enters the compressor in the thermodynamic state known as a saturated vapor and is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, compressed vapor is then in the thermodynamic state known as a superheated vapor and it is at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed with either cooling water or cooling air flowing across the coil or tubes. This is where the circulating refrigerant rejects heat from the system and the rejected heat is carried away by either the water or the air (whichever may be the case).|$|E
5000|$|Phase-change cooling is an {{extremely}} effective way to cool the processor. A vapor compression phase-change cooler is a unit which usually sits underneath the PC, with a tube leading to the processor. Inside the unit is a compressor of the same type as in an air conditioner. The compressor compresses a gas (or mixture of gases) into a liquid. Then, the liquid is pumped up to the processor, where it passes through a condenser (heat dissipation device) and then an expansion device to vaporize the fluid; the expansion device used can be a simple capillary tube to a more elaborate <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve.</b> The liquid evaporates (changing phase), absorbing {{the heat from the}} processor as it draws extra energy from its environment to accommodate this change (see latent heat). The evaporation can produce temperatures reaching around [...] The gas flows down to the compressor and the cycle begins over again. This way, the processor can be cooled to temperatures ranging from , depending on the load, wattage of the processor, the refrigeration system (see refrigeration) and the gas mixture used. This type of system suffers from a number of issues but, mainly, one must be concerned with dew point and the proper insulation of all sub-ambient surfaces that must be done (the pipes will sweat, dripping water on sensitive electronics).|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to develop and demonstrate an integrated, on-line performance monitoring and diagnostic system with low cost sensors for air conditioning and heat pump equipment. Automated fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) has the potential for improving energy efficiency along with reducing service costs and comfort complaints. To achieve this goal, virtual sensors with low cost measurements and simple models were developed to estimate quantities that would be expensive and or difficult to measure directly. ^ A virtual refrigerant charge sensor (VRC) was extended with three approaches for determining refrigerant charge for equipment having variable-speed compressors and fans. Three different virtual refrigerant mass flow (VRMF) sensors were evaluated for estimating refrigerant mass flow rate. The first model uses a compressor map that relates refrigerant flow rate to measurements of condensing and evaporating saturation temperature, and inlet temperature measurements. The second model uses a compressor energy balance with the power consumption from a virtual compressor power (VCP) sensor and energy heat loss model, which is relatively independent of compressor and <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> faults that influence mass flow rate. The third model was developed using an empirical correlation for <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> (TXV) and electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> (EEV) based on an orifice equation. To assess the impact of faults on system performance, capacity, efficiency, and operating cost were evaluated using data for units tested in the laboratory and for data obtained from manufacturers. The impacts of faults were used in deciding thresholds for the FDD demonstration system. Information about capacity, power consumption, and energy efficiency can be used in real-time monitoring of the economic status of equipment and for decision support. ^ The complete diagnostic FDD system was implemented and demonstrated for a rooftop air conditioner (RTU) that incorporates integrated virtual sensors and fault impact evaluation for decision support. The FDD RTU demonstration system provided the following diagnostic outputs: 1) loss of compressor performance, 2) low or high refrigerant charge, 3) fouled condenser or evaporator filter, 4) faulty expansion device, and 5) liquid-line restriction. The tests also quantified the benefits of this technology with measurements of equipment performance and demonstrated implementation with low sensor costs. ...|$|R

The <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> {{model and the}} compressor model parameters {{play a crucial role}} in the system model's accuracy. In the past, these parameters have been estimated using a mass flow meter; however, this is an expensive devise and at times, impractical. In response to these constraints, a novel method to estimate the unknown parameters of the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model and the compressor model is developed. A gray box model obtained by augmenting the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model, the evaporator model, and the compressor model is used. Two numerical search algorithms, nonlinear least squares and Simplex search, are used to estimate the parameters of the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model and the compressor model. This parameter estimation is done by minimizing the error between the model output and the experimental systems output. Results demonstrate that the nonlinear least squares algorithm was more robust for this estimation problem than the Simplex search algorithm.

A split-system direct-expansion air conditioner was used to empirically determine temperature and return-air humidity indicators that could detect performance degradation resulting from degraded conditions. The air conditioner test bench was equipped with the ability to use either a short-tube orifice (STO) or a <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (TXV). The degraded conditions studied include low evaporator airflow, high and low-charge, and a blocked condenser coil. The work presented in this thesis is experimentally based which could identify degraded effects that fall outside of a simulation-based approach. It sought to utilize only low-cost temperature sensing means, although return-air humidity was an important factor for obtaining early detection over a wide range of operating conditions. It was empirically based rather than model based to reduce computation time with a real-time processor. Further, the current work differentiated between a system that uses a shorttube orifice (STO), or fixed-orifice expansion, and a system that uses a <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (TXV), or variable-orifice expansion. This thesis shows that low-cost temperature sensors could be used to detect the degraded conditions studied. However, it is also shown that indicators of low evaporator airflow depend on three loading factors; outdoor-air temperature, return-air temperature, and return-air humidity. In the literature, the humidity sensing point has been neglected by automated detection systems for failures and degraded conditions of low-tonnage air conditioners.

This set point is fixed for a specific system {{and is based on}} the flow characteristic of the installed electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> in variant opening and pressure drop. As common sense, at constant differential between condensing pressure and evaporating pressure, larger opening of <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> allows more refrigerant flowing through the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> into evaporator.

The experimental facility consisted of four major components: compressor, evaporator, <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve,</b> and condenser. An evaporative cooling unit was located upstream from the condenser. Thermal parameters, such as relative humidity, dry bulb temperature, and wet bulb temperature were measured to evaluate the effect of in-direct evaporative cooling on the system COP. The results indicated an inverse relation between the condenser inlet dry bulb temperature and the COP. The changes in specific enthalpy of the air across the evaporative cooled condenser were due to latent heat transfer and sensible heat exchanges, whereas the specific enthalpy changes for the conventional condenser were primarily caused by sensible heat exchanges. By using the evaporative cooling condenser to pre-cool the air, the saturation temperature drop through the condenser increased from 2. 4 °C to 6. 6 °C. It also resulted in an increase of the mass flow rate of refrigerant into the evaporator; this mass increase of liquid entering the evaporator consequently resulted in the increase of COP from 6. 1 % to 18 %. A power reduction up to 14. 3 % on the compressor was also achieved. Under partial load conditions, the DEC system showed a 20 % less COP reduction compared to the conventional system.

Many framework-type materials show negative <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> when internal cages are empty but positive <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> when additional atoms or molecules fill internal voids present. Here we show that redox intercalation offers an effective method to control <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> from positive to zero to negative by insertion of Li ions into the simple negative <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> framework material ScF 3, doped with 10...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the flexibility of network structures, and understand how network structures react to changing pressure and temperature. We were especially interested in network structures which show anomalous (very low or negative) <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> behavior. Materials which contract on heating (negative <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> materials) are of great importance since they can be mixed with other materials (normal <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> materials) to make composites which have zero <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion.</b> Materials with zero or low <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> have many applications in thermal shock-resistant materials, electronic devices, space telescope mirrors, stove tops, cook wares and so on. There are two types of low or negative <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> materials. Some anisotropic materials show positive <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> in one or two dimensions which is coupled with negative <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> in the other two or one dimensions. We studied anisotropic <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> behavior of cordierite, p-eucryptite, and NZP (NaZr 2 P 3 O 12). The problem with anisotropic materials is that microcracking occurs during the heating cycle. Isotropic materials have isotropic <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> which means tha...|$|R
