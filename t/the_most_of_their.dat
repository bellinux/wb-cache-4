5|$|The Australians {{were made}} to work hard for their 249, with only Bradman {{reaching}} 50. Harvey and Hamence passed 40 but could not convert their starts into large scores. Alec Coxon took 4/66 for the hosts and was selected for the Second Test. Yorkshire made 206 in reply, Toshack taking 7/81 and Johnston 3/101: together, they bowled 81.1 of the 90.1 overs in the innings. Like the Australians, the local batsmen struggled to make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> starts; eight batsmen reached double figures but none passed 40. Not wanting to tire his bowlers ahead of the Second Test, Bradman declared Australia's second innings with a lead of 328 runs and only seventy minutes of play remaining. Brown hit 113 and Bradman himself 86, putting on 154 for the second wicket. Yardley expressed his displeasure by bowling his part-timers and then promoting tailenders to {{the upper half of}} the order in the second innings. The Australians batted in leisurely fashion with no urgency to force a result. Bradman then allowed his second-string bowlers to deliver 24 of the 27 overs as the match petered into a draw. The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators.|$|E

25|$|The Mare's Nest is a 1964 book by David Irving, {{focusing}} on the German V-weapons campaign of 1944–45 and the Allied military and intelligence effort (Operation Crossbow) to counter it. The book covers {{both sides of the}} story– the Allied arguments over how to interpret intelligence concerning the status and existence of the V-weapons and the German debate over how to deploy the new weapons to make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> supposed capacity to reverse the tide of the war. During his research for the book, Irving discovered that the Allies had broken the German Enigma code, over a decade before that became public knowledge, but agreed to keep it secret. The Mare's Nest was well received by reviewers and those involved in Operation Crossbow and has been widely cited by authors writing about the V-weapons programme, even after the eclipse of Irving's reputation {{as a result of his}} Holocaust denial.|$|E
25|$|After an {{international}} break which saw Sebastian Giovinco further cement {{his place in}} Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's plans for Euro 2012 the following summer, Parma travelled to Champions League side Napoli, who had beaten giants Internazionale in their previous game by three goals to nil. Napoli had much of {{the ball in the}} early stages, but failed to make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> control of the ball, while Parma looked dangerous on the counter. This pattern continued into the second half before a Massimo Gobbi goal give Parma an unexpected lead just before an hour had passed. The left-back surged forward through Napoli's pedestrian midfield and laid the ball off to Sergio Floccari, who flicked the ball back into Gobbi's path, allowing Gobbi to slot home from point blank range. Napoli continued to press and eventually found an equaliser in a similar fashion to Parma's opener, Ezequiel Lavezzi supplying the backheel flick and playing the one-two with substitute Giuseppe Mascara. The sides were level for five minutes before Parma once again proved to have the more clinical instinct in front of goal. Francesco Valiani worked the ball out wide to Giovinco, who found Francesco Modesto sliding in at the back post to give Parma a 2–1 in the 82nd minute to momentarily put Parma seventh.|$|E

25|$|But {{the most}} {{significant}} system introduced in F1 was the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), a system that stores energy created by braking that is stored through a flywheel and this saved energy is then channeled to the car's drivetrain to increase acceleration. A few well funded teams had tested this technology the previous year {{but it was too}} experimental and all of the teams' KERS systems needed more development to the point where none of them would be ready for 2009. Due to the recession, many more rule changes were brought in to reduce the cost of Formula One. Initially a standardised engine was proposed, but this idea was rejected by the teams, who came up with their own cost-cutting measures. These included a huge reduction in testing times and an increase in the required engine and gearbox mileage. Many teams voiced concerns over the cost of KERS and have suggested a standardised unit, but so far no such opportunity exists. The new rules and regulations saw a new order in 2009, with new teams Brawn GP and Red Bull Racing and their drivers leading the way, with Ferrari and McLaren having a poor season. However Ferrari started by the British Grand Prix to make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> car with a string of podium finishes and a race victory in Belgium, while a redesign of the McLaren challenger helped Lewis Hamilton to win two races and gain more points than any other driver after it was upgraded at the German Grand Prix. After dominating {{the beginning of the season}} with six out of seven race wins, Jenson Button eventually clinched the Drivers' title in Brazil, with Brawn GP winning the Constructors' Championship in its only season, before being taken over by Mercedes. Rubens Barrichello, Jenson Button's teammate, was second in the Drivers' Championship for the whole season until he had a problem at the Brazilian Grand Prix and was overtaken (in points) by Sebastian Vettel, a Red Bull driver, who won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to finish eleven points behind Button. Also, the major manufacturer teams were starting to disappear rapidly due to the worldwide economy crisis. In addition to Ford/Jaguar which had left in 2004, Honda had departed in 2008 also due to uncompetitiveness, Toyota and BMW both departed entirely in 2009 (BMW sold Sauber, a team it had bought in 2005 after its split with Williams even though in 2010 the team was still called BMW Sauber), Renault changed their involvement as a full works effort to engine supplier in 2011 and Cosworth departed entirely as an engine supplier in 2013.|$|E

Zeffirelli's teenage leads, Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, had virtually no previous acting experience but performed capably and with great maturity. Zeffirelli has been particularly praised, for his presentation of the duel scene as bravado getting out-of-control.

500|$|Much of {{the first}} book of The Satanic Bible is taken from parts of Redbeard's Might Is Right, edited to remove the racism, anti-Semitism, and {{misogyny}} present in the original version. It challenges both the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, advocating instead a tooth-for-tooth philosophy. LaVey, through Redbeard, strongly advocates social Darwinism, saying, [...] "Death to the weakling, wealth to the strong!" [...] Humans are identified as instinctually predatory, and [...] "lust and carnal desire" [...] are singled out as part of humans' intrinsic nature. The Book of Satan suggests a hedonistic outlook, saying, [...] "I break away from all conventions that do not lead to my earthly happiness." [...] Indulgence is endorsed, and readers are encouraged to make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives. It criticizes both law and religious principles, instead suggesting doing only what makes one happy and successful. LaVey continues to denounce other religions, and he rails against what he considers to be arbitrary definitions of [...] "good" [...] and [...] "evil". Religion is criticized as a man-made construct, and the reader is urged to question everything and destroy any lies {{that he or she}} uncovers. Long-standing lies that are believed to be irrefutable truths are identified as the most dangerous. The last part of The Book of Satan is an adaptation of the Christian Beatitudes, changed to reflect the principles of LaVeyan Satanism.|$|E
500|$|Healey {{began his}} {{football}} career with Darlington while still a schoolboy, and was playing for Bishop Auckland as {{they won the}} Northern League title in the 1908–09 season. His play attracted attention. In February 1910, he was selected for an amateur international trial, and in March, he appeared for Sunderland's North-Eastern League team, creating two goals and scoring the last in a 6–0 defeat of Darlington. He made his Football League debut in April, in a 2–0 defeat away to Manchester United in the First Division. The Sunderland Daily Echo commented that he and fellow inside forward George Holley [...] "perhaps did not make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> opportunities, for when in possession in the shooting zone they failed to shoot with sufficient power." [...] He kept his place for the last home match of the season, against Bradford City, [...] "proved a keen worker", according to the Echo correspondent, and scored the first two goals in a 3–0 win. The first resulted from Bradford's goalkeeper Harry Maskrey losing the ball when attempting a clearance; he then [...] "seized Healey, but the latter struggled free and jumping over Maskrey he put {{the ball in the}} net". The second was a header from a corner. He missed Sunderland's last match of the season to play for Bishop Auckland in a 2–1 win against Scarborough that secured them the Northern League title. Sunderland retained Healey's Football League registration for each season up to 1913–14, but he played only once more for the first team, at Aston Villa in October 1911.|$|E
500|$|After {{the story}} and art were established, the team set {{to work on the}} graphics. Working on new {{hardware}} proved difficult for the young team, and the game ended up missing the initial deadline given by Sega, which was the Saturn Japanese launch on November 1994. One of the problems was that the Saturn hardware was only finalized in mid-1994, and without actual Saturn prototype to test their progress, the programmers initially had to work with hypothetical hardware performance. Team Andromeda created its own graphics library and mapping tools instead of using Sega's, in order to make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first game on the new system. The game's graphics and cutscenes were done with Softimage, and the 3D elements were programmed on SGI workstations using OpenGL. The programmers were eventually able to transition to the debug Saturn they had received, but the process was difficult and the game had a very low frame rate at first, before it could be locked at 20 FPS. The six levels of Panzer Dragoon are barren landscapes with ancient ruins, which is consistent with the [...] "simple" [...] style appropriate for the Saturn. The first two levels that the team programmed, a desert (level 2) and a forest (level 5), did not have any objects or anything besides sand and forest effects, again because the team was unsure how far the hardware could be pushed. Keeping CPU limitations in mind, simple tornado effects were added to level 2, so that it did not look too bland.|$|E
