By giving the students more responsibility for learning, language programs encouraged <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> to become more autonomous, to diagnose their own learning strengths and weaknesses, and to self-direct language learning process (Cohen & Weaver, 1998). Moreover, strategy training, if designed carefully and sensitively with the learners’ needs in mind, can become a key element in creative and self-directed language learning (Oxford et al., 1990; Ghahari & Basanjideh, 2015, 2017). <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> can benefit from coaching in learning strategies and need to become aware of the learning strategies through strategy instruction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} different levels of progress in asynchronous collaborative learning activities.

When introducing collaborative learning parallel to daily work tasks we cannot assume that all participants have the same possibility to actively engage. <b>Therefore</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> can be {{at different levels of}} progress in the collaborative learning activity. To facilitate collaborative activity the progress of the participants has to be synchronized in some way. The main problem addressed in this paper is the difficulty for participants to keep a common progress, to enable discussions, in asynchronous collaborative learning. To address this problem three methods for synchronization (synchronization points) are suggested: locked scenes, written instruction and collaborative production. The three methods were implemented and evaluated in an organization using a Net-scenario, the Net-scenario as a system and a methodology based on role-playing to initiate collaborative learning. This system was suitable to use in the evaluation since it can be used asynchronously as well as synchronously, supports distributed participants and is dependent on collaborative discussion concerning the content presented...|$|R

This is to say that the environment surrounding the learning of another language can influence what is actually being learned. Take for example the fact that most L2 learners are receiving input or teachings from similarly speaking bilinguals; Hauser-Grüdl, Guerra, Witzmann, Leray, and Müller (2010) believe that the language being taught has already been influenced by the other in the teachers' minds and, <b>therefore,</b> <b>the</b> input <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> is receiving will exhibit influence. These L2 learners will replicate influences because their input of the L2 is not as pure as input from a monolingual; meaning, what appears as CLI in the individual isn't really CLI of their L1 on their L2, but the effects of acquiring input that has already been modified. This theory has led some people to believe that all input for L2 learning will be affected and resemble CLI; however, this is not a well supported theory of CLI or its function in L2 acquisition.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Nowadays, early foreign {{language}} learning in the Netherlands is booming and generally preferred over language learning starting at a later stage due to its presumed positive effects on pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar acquisition (Groot & Deelder, 2014). In (early) second language acquisition classrooms, native speaker teachers are often preferred over non-native speaker teachers due the model of language they can present; native speakers have reached the so-called target L 2 learners try to obtain (Cook, 2008, p. 185). Furthermore, in the Netherlands, it is generally assumed that learners who are taught by a native speaker will become more proficient in the target language than learners who are taught by a non-native speaker, {{especially in terms of}} pronunciation (SLO, 2011). However, hardly any research has focused on whether this assumption is true. This research attempts to fill this gap by examining whether early English language learners taught by a native speaker attain a more native-like pronunciation than learners taught by a non-native speaker. Pupils of two Dutch primary schools were tested on their English pronunciation (segmentals), with one group following an early learning programme in which they were (partly) taught by a native speaker teacher, and another group following such a programme during which they were taught by a non-native speaker. Results show that learners taught by a non-native speaker produce more native-like consonants than speakers taught by a native speaker. In addition, learners taught by a non-native speaker produce fewer Dutch-like vowels than learners taught by a native speaker. However, it cannot be concluded with certainty that, <b>therefore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> taught by a non-native speaker also produced more native-like vowels. Yet, {{based on the results of}} this research, it can be concluded that, in terms of pronunciation, learners taught by a native speaker teacher are not more native-like than learners taught by a non-native speaker. It is arguable that being taught by a native speaker teacher does not lead to better pronunciation results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of {{language}} transfer in foreign language learning. The transfer often leads to a communicative gap, which is caused by the difference between a learner’s mother language (ML) and the target language (TL). This paper first analyzes the semantic relations between the ML and the TL. Then it proposes a CGM (Communicative Gap Model) because of the meaning difference between both languages. We have developed a computer assisted languagelearning system called Neclle (Networkbased Communicative LanguageLearning Environment) in order to support foreign language learning through communication using a text based chat tool. Neclle has a software agent called Ankle (Agent for Kanji Learning), which observes the conversation between a learner and a native speaker, looks up a communicative gap in <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> utterance automatically according to CGM, the student model and the word dictionary of both languages, intervenes into the conversation, and gives an instruction for bridging the gap. Then, <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> can not only be aware of the gap but also acquire its cultural background from the native speaker. In our case study, Chinese students used Neclle for Japanese language learning. Japanese language had incorporated with Chinese kanji but the meaning of a kanji sometimes differed between two languages. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>learners</b> who want to study Japanese language have to pay much attention to the meaning gap between Chinese and Japanese language.

40|$|D. Phil. Traditionally {{leadership}} {{was seen as}} synonymous with the executive authority of an organisation and in the school environment {{with that of the}} headmaster. However, a paradigm shift occurred and leadership is now viewed as attitudes, competencies and skills at three levels, namely the personal, interpersonal and professional levels, implying that every person is a leader {{in his or her own}} right. The idea of a leader as a value-driven, principle-centered and character-based person gathered momentum. The afore-mentioned qualities call for a special kind of self-knowledge that can partly be obtained from feedback to leaders on how stakeholders in the organisation perceive them and/or how their behaviour impacts on the organisation. Although school leadership gained momentum only in the past two decades, it has been realised that professionalism and the quality of leadership impact on the quality of teaching. It therefore seems important in the evaluation and improvement of teacher leadership to gain insight into how stakeholders, especially those (learners) who can speak authoritatively on their firsthand experiences of what is happening in class, perceive teacher leadership. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe learners' everyday experiences and interpretations of their teacher leadership in order to make recommendations to the stakeholders concerned. I embarked on an explorative-descriptive inquiry. To ensure high-quality research, I adhered to all the necessary criteria for reliable, valid and ethical research. In order to capitalise on both qualitative and quantitative research methods, and to compensate for the shortcomings of both, as well as to enrich the credibility of the study, I opted for a mixed-methods approach. In this study of an Afrikaans governmental high school in Gauteng, I made use of a symbolic interactionistic methodology to understand how learners perceive, understand and interpret their teacher leadership. Complying with ethical and professional considerations regarding research with children (namely access, protection against harm, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality) the study crystallised in two phases. In the first qualitative phase I made use of purposeful snowball sampling methods, and gained rich descriptions from learners and their parents regarding the learners' experiences of and perceptions about their teacher leadership. I used analytical methods based on the Chicago School of Symbolic /nteractionism to generate codes, which was categorised according to the leadership paradigm of personal, interpersonal and professional leadership. In a second phase, <b>the</b> universum of <b>learners</b> and teachers were included in a social survey. Two questionnaires were designed for <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> and teachers respectively. <b>The</b> <b>learner</b> questionnaire contained odd questions on demographic details, as well as hypotheses which were drawn from the codes and categories forthcoming from the first phase. However, from a symbolic interactionistic standing, I was not merely interested in <b>the</b> majority viewpoint. <b>Therefore</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> were once again given the opportunity to expand on their answers qualitatively. The teachers, in turn, were asked why they chose the teaching profession, and had to comment on what they thought <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> would have to say about their own, as well as their colleagues' leadership qualities as teachers.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the pedagogic practices of primary teachers in Ghana. The major goal was to identify innovative pedagogic practices, {{as well as to}} understand why the transmission practices continue to prevail in a majority of Ghanaian primary classrooms. Using a qualitative approach, the study tried to probe deeply into how and why teachers in Ghana engage with their practices, at the same time, how and where teachers manage to better support their <b>learners</b> in <b>the</b> face of their contextual difficulties. The theoretical framework for this study was based on Schulman’s theory on teacher knowledge. Schulman proposed that, for teachers to be able to support their learners, they must be able to combine content knowledge, curricular knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) : of the three he argued that it was PCK that teachers needed most in order to make sense of teaching. Thus this study has examined what constitutes teacher knowledge in Ghana and found that, primary teachers add on the traditional and cultural knowledge systems to teaching and learning processes in Ghana. The major instruments used for the study were observations and interviews. The study employed two stages of observations; the first stage of unstructured lesson observations of 40 teachers revealed pedagogic variations (supportive and unsupportive) in Ghanaian classrooms. The second stage of structured lesson observations enabled categorizations of the pedagogic practices. Follow-up interviews unearthed teachers’ views and understanding of their practices. The analysis of the study revealed two categories of primary teachers in Ghana; the traditional and innovative. All teachers in the study relied on the traditional and cultural knowledge systems; but whilst a majority (36 out of 40) validated their transmission rote practices from the culture, there were a few (6 out of 40) who had deeply reflected on the positive aspects of the culture making learning more flexible and supportive for their children. The study concludes that teachers in Ghana would experience more successes in their classrooms when they begin to embrace fully the positive aspects of the cultural knowledge. They will also begin to find alternative strategies to address the contextual challenges they often encounter in their classrooms. <b>Therefore</b> <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> cultural background ought to be promoted and embedded in the teaching as it stands as an all-inclusive and empowering agenda for the teaching practice.

The design of the research is the comparative study. The samples that the researcher used are 31 students. To get the sample the researcher uses a random sample. To obtain the research data the researcher uses test. Whereas, to find out a significant different score on the students’ speaking when they are taught by using a series picture and when they are taught by using a single picture, the researcher uses t-test formula. The result of data analysis shows that the student’s score taught by using a series picture is bigger than taught by using a single picture. Based on statistical analysis shows that (8, 846 > 2, 042). It means that there is a significant influence between score of teaching by using a series picture and by using a single picture. It can be concluded that the students get good scores in achieving speaking after taught by using a series picture.

3000|$|The domain {{knowledge}} representation is {{the base for}} the representation of <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> knowledge, which is usually performed as {{a subset of the}} domain knowledge. However, the representation of <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> knowledge is a moving target. The student’s knowledge level of a domain concept usually is affected by her/his knowledge level of other related domain concepts. For example, a new domain concept may be completely unknown to <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> but in other circumstances it may be partly known due to previous related knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>learner.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, domain concepts which were previously known by <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> may be completely or partly forgotten. Hence, currently they may be partly known or completely unknown. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> knowledge dependencies that exist between the domain concepts of the learning material, as well as their “strength of impact” on each other have to be represented. A solution to this is the theory of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs), which is used to model the behavior of complex systems (Leon et al. 2011). A FCM is a cognitive map within which the relations between the elements (e.g. concepts, events, project resources) of a [...] "mental landscape" [...] can be used to compute the [...] "strength of impact" [...] of these elements.|$|R

In accordance with the definition, the sematic errors cannot be avoided from <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> of English for Speaker of Other Language (ESOL). <b>Therefore,</b> <b>The</b> objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the common semantic errors made by ESOL learners in Malaysia and to fmd some factors why <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> did <b>the</b> errors in English. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> qualitative data were randomly collected from 20 students by using the diary note and documentation techniques. Furthermore, Oxford Advanced Leamer's Dictionary International Student's Edition was used as a tool to investigate whether the languages (words or phrases) are correct or error. Mter that, two native speakers were asked to validate whether the words or phrases made by <b>the</b> ESOL <b>learners</b> are error or not. Then, semi structured interview would be used to get the reason from the participants on why they did the errors. As a result, there are 20 English vocabularies commonly used by <b>the</b> ESOL <b>learners</b> and considered as sematic error. Moreover, there are three main causes why <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> get used to do the semantic errors in their English. In conclusion, the semantic errors do exist in the learners' English language. In so doing, English teacher should take an action to correct the students' English...|$|R

30|$|A learner {{model is}} a key {{component}} of any adaptive e-learning system as it maintains information about learners in order to provide them adaptation according to their current learning needs. Bull (2004) defined <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> model as follows “the learner {{model is a}} model of the knowledge, difficulties and misconceptions of the individual. As a student learns the target material, the data in <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> model about their understanding is updated to reflect their current beliefs” (Bull, p 47). Bull et al. (2001) also added that various information types could be stored in <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> model such as knowledge; interests; cognitive style; eagerness; helpfulness; interaction preferences; opinions of peers; and, user actions. The process of creating learner model, so-called learner modeling, requires numerous if not continuous observations of interactions between <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> and <b>the</b> computer. <b>Learner</b> interaction with <b>the</b> computer is rather restricted in traditional e-learning systems (limited to clicks, time that <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> invested in visiting a page, etc.) (Moreno-Ger et al. 2009; Stathacopoulou et al. 2007). This information does not accurately inform us how <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> have interacted with particular content. Did they actually read the content? Did they examine it? Or, did they simply leave the page without actually gaining anything (Moreno-Ger et al. 2009)? The lack of a variety of interactions between <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> and <b>the</b> traditional e-learning systems affects the certainty of the interpretations that could result in a misconstruction and <b>therefore</b> affect <b>the</b> accuracy of <b>learner</b> modeling process. In this context, educational games are not only considered as interactive didactic support that is able to increase <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> motivation and engagement, but also as the means to provide ample opportunities for <b>learner’s</b> interaction with <b>the</b> computer, which can be used to create reliable learner models. Therefore, using educational games (that represent a highly interactive content) to model <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> is a promising trend.|$|R

Where one is from shapes who one is as an individual and as a member of cultural and social groups, and infl uences how one views and interacts with people who are differ-ent from oneself, the “other. ” Using this theory as a framework, this article sug-gests that for peaceful coexistence of cultures to be a reality, multicultural edu-cation should approach multiculturalism {{in a way that makes}} coexistence possible because of the acceptance of difference without the imposition of one idea or set of ideas. Therefore, there cannot be a “one-size-fi ts-all ” model of mul-ticultural education. Since even researchers and theorists are not in agreement on what multiculturalism and multicultural education are, it is evident that the context in which multicultural education is taught must be considered for the concepts to be relevant and <b>therefore,</b> comprehensible, to <b>the</b> <b>learners.</b> This arti-cle compares and contrasts the contexts of the United States and Poland, focus-ing on the signifi cance of multicultural education in both places and how it is ap-proached in each place...|$|R
