The starting point is the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where many unique creatures reside, is blanketed by radioactive fog. Because the creatures that live inside <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> are unwilling to go anywhere without it, the town uses devices called fog condensers to turn <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> into liquid {{in order to protect}} its inhabitants.|$|E

Vineyards in these areas are often planted with cool-climate varieties like Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer and Riesling. At high elevations in Anderson Valley and nearby Mendocino Ridges beyond <b>the</b> <b>fog's</b> reach, these warmer pockets of lands will usually be planted with more warm climate varieties like Zinfandel. With the nearby Pacific bringing in a steady stream of moisture, rain during the harvest months can be an issue {{in this part of the}} county.|$|R

5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its fog which occurs most often {{in the spring and}} early summer because of the {{contrast}} between sea and air temperatures.

5|$|There {{are three}} major {{conflicting}} factions {{present in the}} expansion, all residing in separate areas: the Harbormen of Far Harbor; the synth (synthetic humans) colony of Acadia; and the Church of the Children of Atom. The Harbormen of Far Harbor are led by the town leader, Captain Avery, and seek to reclaim The Island from <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> that has gradually driven {{them out of their}} homes. The Children of Atom live in an old nuclear submarine base called the Nucleus and are led by High Confessor Tektus. Tektus is a fanatical follower of the Church of Atom who seeks to disable or destroy <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> condensers. The refuge for the synth colony of Acadia is an abandoned research center at the top of The Island; the group are led by a mysterious prototype synth called DiMA. DiMA is friendly to both the Harbormen and the Children so long as Acadia remains autonomous and isolated {{from the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|There {{was still}} fog on the plateau on 1 September, but by 15:00 CEST it was {{possible}} to fly a team there by helicopter. Because <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> stayed, the team retained work until 03:00 CEST in the night. In the following days, <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> lifted, making work and transport easier. By 5 September, all bodies had been recovered and the work at the plateau could be terminated. The recovery in the valley was completed two days later. The accident resulted in about 40 journalists staying in Svalbard to cover the story. The Norwegian authority's costs related to the investigation and other activities related to the accident were estimated at 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK).|$|E

Moore explained that his followers no longer recognized the centralist government of Santa Anna and instead remained faithful to the Constitution of 1824, which Santa Anna had repudiated. Castañeda revealed that he shared their federalist leanings, {{but that he was}} honor-bound to follow orders.|$|E

5|$|Craymen surprises Edge in Zoah and {{requests}} his help fighting the Empire. Paet tells Edge {{he can find}} the Tower by deactivating an ancient machine, Mel-Kava, that obscures the Tower's location with fog. In exchange for destroying an imperial base, the leader of Zoah gives Edge access to an ancient artifact that grants a vision of Mel-Kava's location. Edge and the dragon destroy Mel-Kava, clearing <b>the</b> <b>fog,</b> but are attacked again by Azel and Atolm. They shoot down Atolm and rescue Azel as she falls.|$|E
5|$|Having {{identified}} the culprit as Adachi, the party chases and locates him within the TV world. Adachi explains that his actions {{were out of}} both boredom {{and the belief that}} humanity is better off believing what it wants; his claims are dismissed by the party as the rantings of a madman. After fighting Adachi, he is possessed by Ameno-sagiri, the Japanese God of Fog, who reveals that <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> is harmful to people and will eventually cause humanity to fall into a permanent state of ignorance and transform into Shadows. Upon his defeat, he agrees to lift <b>the</b> <b>fog,</b> congratulating the party on their resolve. Defeated, the wounded Adachi agrees to assume responsibility for his actions and turns himself in. The game moves forward to the day before the protagonist must travel home. If the player returns to the Dojima residence, the game ends with the party sending the protagonist off as he departs Inaba. Alternatively, should the player be able to identify the unexplained cause of the Midnight Channel and attempt to resolve this plot element, the protagonist meets with the party, and together they decide to end the case for good.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry back at Chonui {{remained}} understrength. Half of {{the force}} had constituted Task Force Smith at Osan. B and C Companies were thus still refitting at Chochiwon, leaving A and D Companies {{to hold the line}} with a handful of replacements to fill the extra positions. The battalion numbered around 500 men in total. The 1st Battalion emplaced on hills overlooking the south road of Chonui, northwest of Chochiwon and prepared to meet and delay the advancing North Korean forces, while the 3rd Battalion emplaced behind it in reserve. Around 0555 on July 10, the Americans began to detect North Korean movement through the morning fog. Fifteen minutes after daybreak, a whistle blew, immediately followed by small arms fire on the American positions. American forces at first fired indiscriminately into <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> until the regimental commander, Richard W. Stephens, stopped them. At 0700 the 1st Battalion then came under heavy mortar fire, and A Company on the leftmost ridge was assailed with fire from higher ground by North Korean forces of the 4th Infantry Division. The American forces began using 4.2-inch mortars on the North Korean positions in order to prevent them from advancing directly on their positions. Around 0800 <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> began to lift, and the Americans spotted four T-34 tanks in the village and subsequently called for another airstrike.|$|E

With PhysX enabled, some areas contain smoke or fog which reacts to Batman moving through it, while with PhysX disabled <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> will not appear at all. Other effects include dynamic interaction with paper and leaves, surfaces which can be scratched and chipped, and dynamic, destructible cloth elements such as banners and cobwebs.

50|$|The {{police force}} in Norway was {{established}} during the 13th century. Originally the 60 to 80 sheriffs (lensmann) were predominantly used for {{writ of execution}} and to a less degree police power. In the cities there were originally gjaldker who had police power. The sheriffs were originally subordinate to the sysselmann, but from the 14th century they instead became subordinate to <b>the</b> <b>fogd</b> and <b>the</b> number of sheriffs increased. In the cities the police authority was transferred directly to <b>the</b> <b>fogd,</b> known as byfogd. By the mid 17th century there were between 300 and 350 sheriffs. With {{the introduction of the}} absolute monarchy in 1660 and subsequent strengthening of the civil service, the importance of the police increased. <b>The</b> <b>fogd</b> as such became part of the police structure, with their subordinates, the county governors, received a similar role as that of chief of police. The first chief of police was hired in Trondheim in 1686, thus creating the first police district, although his jurisdiction only covered the city. Additional chief of polices were hired in Bergen in 1692, Christiania (Oslo) in 1744 and Christianssand in 1776.|$|R
