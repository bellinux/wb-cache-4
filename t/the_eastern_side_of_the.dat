5|$|A {{significant}} portion of <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acropolis has been eroded away by the Copán River, although the river has since been diverted {{in order to protect}} the site from further damage.|$|E

5|$|A single {{dirt road}} {{leads to the}} {{lighthouse}} on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, {{where most of the}} island's egrets tend to nest. The Greenwich Department of Parks and Recreation oversees the island. No public tours of the lighthouse or island are available, but the lighthouse is the residence of caretakers.|$|E
5|$|A small {{offering}} chapel is adjoining <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main pyramid and {{is barely}} visible today. It {{consisted of a}} central two pillared room with a large quartzite false door and two narrow chambers on the sides. Like the mortuary temple, the chapel was floored with black basalt. Its walls however were made of Tura limestone and granite and were adorned with fine reliefs of offering scenes.|$|E

5|$|After Mawson {{slipped into}} a crevasse, they began to tie {{themselves}} to their sledges as a precaution. Ninnis developed photokeratitis (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride. They were also losing dogs; one broke his leg and was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a crevasse. On 24 November, the party reached <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier and ascended to the plateau.|$|E
5|$|An early medieval wall {{stands to}} the west of the Arch of Caracalla; it was built after the end of the Roman occupation, {{apparently}} some time in the 5th or 6th centuries, to protect <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's new residential area. It was oriented in a north-south direction and was constructed using stone looted from ruined buildings elsewhere in the abandoned areas of the city.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, the {{completed}} lower level {{portion of the}} highway, along with Route1 Extension on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Passaic River, was opened as {{the first part of}} the eventual high-speed connection between the Holland Tunnel and Newark. The upper level of Route139 (Hoboken Avenue Viaduct), which provided a multi-lane thoroughfare from Palisades Avenue to JohnF. Kennedy Boulevard, was also opened.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to walk or cycle to the arena from central Malmö via Kroksbäck and Kroksbäcksparken. An area reserved for the parking of up to 1,000 bicycles is located on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arena. There are areas for charter buses as well as taxis beside the arena's main and side entrances.|$|E
5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid, {{the ruins}} of a small {{satellite}} pyramid as well as of a mortuary temple have been discovered. Both have been heavily affected by stone robbing, which started as early as the New Kingdom and reached a climax during the Saite (664–525 BCE) and Persian (525–402 BCE) periods, making a modern reconstruction of the temple layout impossible.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Highland Mills, the Port Jervis Line, {{operated}} by Metro-North Railroad, crosses over {{on a high}} trestle. After crossing over Woodbury Creek and under the Thruway, NY32 runs along <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrow valley between Schunemunk and the Hudson Highlands. This section of highway runs through mostly wooded terrain as it leaves Woodbury for Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|When {{the system}} first posed {{a threat to}} Mexico at 0900 UTC on October 15, a {{tropical}} storm watch was posted {{for a portion of}} the central Baja California Peninsula. Six hours later, the watch was upgraded into a tropical storm warning, while tropical storm watches were issued to the north and south of the warning, respectively. At 2100 UTC on October 15, the tropical storm warnings was upgraded into a hurricane warning, while a tropical storm warning was declared along <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula. Early the next day, the tropical storm warning was extended southward, to include the capital of La Paz. On the afternoon of October 16, when the threat to the area increased, a hurricane warnings was posted for <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. Early the next day, all hurricane warnings were dropped, as Paul had deteriorated into a tropical storm. By 1500 UTC, all watches and warnings had been discontinued.|$|E
5|$|A general {{hospital}} {{is located in}} <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. Modern health care facilities exist only in Bangui but are poor, providing only minimal care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping {{in the city for}} sexual services pose a major risk of spreading the disease {{to other parts of the}} country. The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E

5|$|After Paradise Interchange, the busway passes under Darley Road, {{then over}} the Torrens {{for the last}} time. The terrain becomes steeper as the busway {{proceeds}} up along the outflow creek and past the northwestern side of the Hope Valley Reservoir. It proceeds north under Grand Junction Road, then swings east and north again to enter <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre precinct, where the guided busway ends at Tea Tree Plaza Interchange. Most buses continue on normal roads to service suburbs further afield.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} {{industries}} to arrive was the Manchester Patent Fuel Company, in 1898. The Trafford Brick Company arrived soon after, followed by J.W. Southern & Co. (timber merchants), James Gresham (engineers), and W. T. Glovers & Co. (electric cable manufacturers). Glovers also built a power {{station in the}} park, {{on the banks of}} the Bridgewater Canal. Most of these early developments were built on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park, while the rest of it remained largely undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate {{the presence of a}} mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The same goes for the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E
