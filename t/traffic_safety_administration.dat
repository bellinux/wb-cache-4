Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, {{were most likely to}} have car accidents. The National Highway <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Administration</b> through its Fatality Analysis Reporting System stated that auto fatalities continue to be {{the leading cause of death}} for young adults.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. National Highway <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Administration</b> (NHTSA) is {{conducting}} a study due in 2014 to establish whether lithium-ion batteries in plug-electric vehicles pose a potential fire hazard. The research is looking at whether the high-voltage batteries can cause fires when they are being charged and when the vehicles are involved in an accident. Both General Motors and Nissan have published a guide for firefighters and first responders to properly handle a crashed plug-in electric-drive vehicle and safely disable its battery and other high voltage systems.|$|E
50|$|Also {{for safety}} reasons, the US National Highway <b>Traffic</b> and <b>Safety</b> <b>Administration</b> has {{mandated}} that all 2008 vehicles {{sold in the}} US and manufactured on or after September 1, 2007 must be equipped with tire pressure monitoring systems. Because many of these sensors are inside the tire, there was a concern {{about whether or not}} canned tire inflators and sealants would affect the sensors’ ability to correctly operate. Manufacturers have been working on finding solutions to this new legislation.|$|R
25|$|In May 2009, Tesla {{issued a}} recall for 345 Roadsters {{manufactured}} before April 22, 2009. Tesla sent technicians to customers' homes {{to tighten the}} rear, inner hub flange bolts.

5|$|The Volt has won several awards, {{including}} the 2009 Green Car Vision Award, 2011 Green Car of the Year, 2011 North American Car of the Year, 2011 World Green Car, 2012 European Car of the Year, and 2016 Green Car of the Year. Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Administration</b> (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Administration</b> found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} we examine whether {{the top five}} {{executives}} of automakers engage in abnormal selling during various stages of auto recalls. We find no evidence of abnormal selling around the date the auto recall is publicly announced. However, we find that insider selling activity is concentrated around the one month before the date the defect report was received by the National Highway <b>Traffic</b> and <b>Safety</b> <b>Administration.</b> We further document that insider selling activity is more pronounced prior to auto recalls preceded by more severe customer complaints (number of accidents, injuries, fires etc.) or accompanied with larger declines in the manufacture’s share price. Collectively, we provide evidence consistent with insiders of automakers engaging in opportunistic trading activity {{at the expense of}} other shareholders...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{validity}} of self reported data on safety belt use and to consider the implications for research on injury prevention behaviors. METHODS: 1992 and 1993 self reported data on safety belt use {{were obtained from the}} Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and observational data were obtained from the National Highway <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Administrations</b> for 49 states in 1992 and 50 states in 1993. The ratio of self reported to observed belt use was calculated for each state, and linear regression models were used to examine the association between the two methods. RESULTS: There was variation between states, but the overall median ratio of self reported to observed safety belt use was 1. 05 in 1992 (interdecile range 0. 87 - 1. 36) and 1. 02 in 1993 (interdecile range 0. 87 - 1. 31). Self reports were substantially higher in southern states and in states with the lowest levels of observed use. Linear regression models indicated a moderately strong association between state estimates using both methods. For every percentage point increase in self reported data in 1993, observed safety belt use increased by 0. 95 percentage point. CONCLUSIONS: In the aggregate, self reported estimates were only 2 % to 5 % higher than observed estimates. This is a substantial improvement from previous studies. This is probably due to the increased prevalence of safety belt use and the declining effects of social desirability on self reported use. In general, {{the validity of}} self reported estimates of socially desirable injury prevention behaviors will be higher when the actual prevalence of the behavior is higher, but lower when this is not true...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a set of}} performance metrics and a performance measurement system developed {{for the evaluation of}} roadway departure warning systems. The work is part of an effort by the Department of Transportation's National Highway <b>Traffic</b> and <b>Safety</b> <b>Administration</b> (NHTSA) to develop quantitative measures of performance for the evaluation of highway safety systems. The work is also {{part of an effort to}} promote dual-use technologies between the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense. The Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology undertook the development of the performance measurement system. The approach for quantitative evaluation rests on establishing a baseline measurement of roadway departure that is of higher accuracy than the warning system under test. The output of the warning system is then compared to the baseline measurement to produce a quantitative measure of performance. The baseline measurement system is installed on a vehicle with the warning system. The baseline system achieves high accuracy by aiming a calibrated camera onto an area of the road adjacent to the vehicle. As the vehicle is driven and roadway departure maneuvers are performed, the output of the video camera, the vehicle's position (from a global positioning system and inertial sensors), and the output of the warning system are synchronized and digitally recorded. After a vehicle run is complete, a suite of software is used to automatically analyze the baseline video data to determine roadway departure. Since the video and other data remain available after the vehicle run, an operator (to establish the credibility of the baseline measurement) can verify a roadway departure. Also, the data can be analyzed to provide insight into the c [...] ...|$|R
