25|$|The most {{important}} elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Only one molecule {{is involved in}} a unimolecular reaction; it is transformed by an isomerization or a dissociation into one or more other molecules. Such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light. A typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the cis–trans isomerization, in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the <b>trans-form</b> or vice versa.|$|E

In E-Z isomerization, {{the thermal}} equilibrium lies well towards the <b>trans-form</b> {{because of its}} lower energy (~15 kJ mol−1 in stilbene). [...] The activation energy for thermal E-Z isomerization is 150–190 kJ mol−1 for stilbene, meaning that temperatures above 200°C are required to isomerize stilbene at a reasonable rate, but most derivatives have lower energy barriers (e.g. 65 kJ mol−1 for 4-aminostilbene). The activation energy of the electrocyclization is 73 kJ mol−1 for stilbene.|$|E

5000|$|The first drug, {{clomifene}} (2-4-(2-chloro-1,2-diphenylethenyl)phenoxy-N,N-diethylethanamine;2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate; {{see figure}} 6) has a chloro-substituent on the ethylene side chain which produces similar binding affinities as the later discovered drug tamoxifen. Clomifene {{is a mixture}} of estrogenic (cis-form) and antiestrogenic isomers (<b>trans-form).</b> [...] Cis and trans are defined in terms of the geometric relationships of the two unsubstituted phenyl rings. The two isomers of clomifene have different profiles, where the <b>trans-form</b> has activity more similar to tamoxifen while the cis-form behaves more like 17β-estradiol. Cis is approximately ten times more potent than trans. However, trans isomer is the most potent stimulator of epithelial cell hypertrophy since clomifene is antagonistic at low doses and agonistic at high doses. The antagonist isomers may cause inhibitory estrogenic effects in the uterus and mammary cancers, but the estrogenic isomer could combine with novel receptors to produce estrogen-like effects in bone.|$|E
