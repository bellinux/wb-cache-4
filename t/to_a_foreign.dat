5|$|A legend {{developed}} that England would not fall <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> invader {{as long as}} there were ravens at the Tower of London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that this is actually a romantic Victorian invention.|$|E

5|$|The THSR 700T {{trainset}} {{is based}} on the 700 Series Shinkansen trainset used by JR Central and JR West in Japan. This marked the first time Shinkansen technology was exported <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> country. Customization was focused on adapting to Taiwan's climate and geography, and the nose shape was optimized for tunnels wider than those in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Testament of Dr. Mabuse {{was based}} on {{elements}} of author Norbert Jacques' unfinished novel Mabuse's Colony. It was Lang's second sound film for Nero-Film and was his final collaboration {{with his wife and}} screenwriter Thea von Harbou. To promote the film <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> market, a French-language version of the film was made by Lang with the same sets but different actors with the title Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse.|$|E
5|$|Two Supreme Court justices had {{previously}} disagreed {{on this question}} while riding circuit. In United States v. Ravara (C.C.D. Pa. 1793), an indictment for sending anonymous and threatening letters <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> minister {{with a view to}} extort money, Justice James Wilson argued that the circuit court could be given concurrent jurisdiction; Justice James Iredell argued that it could not; Judge Richard Peters, of the District of Pennsylvania, sided with Wilson, and the case continued.|$|E

5|$|With {{modifications}} {{that were}} aimed at improving the ships endurance by including a diesel generator, it was launched as Velebit (P-01) in 1996. A few years later {{it was out of}} service because of the need to acquire a new set of batteries, which in turn, never happened. After unsuccessful attempts of selling it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> buyer, it was offered to various museums in Croatia with a final destination still pending.|$|E
5|$|A member may be disqualified if he {{is found}} to be of unsound mind, if he becomes {{insolvent}} or is an undischarged bankrupt, {{if he is}} convicted and sentenced to imprisonment of not less than one year or a fine of not less than S$2,000, or if he has lost his Singaporean citizenship or declared himself allied <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> country. Any questions as to membership or disqualification are determined by a tribunal convened in secret that consists of a Supreme Court judge appointed by the Chief Justice and two members appointed by the Council. The Constitution does not stipulate any procedure for the removal of a member besides disqualification and the member's own resignation.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E

5|$|Cartman's {{involvement}} with the fried chicken black market closely mirrors {{the plot of the}} 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman in the role of Tony Montana, and Colonel Sanders in the role of Alejandro Sosa. In the episode, Cartman travels <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> land to meet a dealer, usurps the illegal operation from his local boss, and is ultimately brought down because he becomes addicted to his own product, plot points that mirror the plot of Scarface. Specific scenes patterned after ones in Scarface, include one in which Cartman watches Tommy being executed by being hanged from a helicopter, and the final scene in which Cartman's compound is attacked by gunmen. The episode also includes references to the 1991 crime film New Jack City.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, both Mississippi-class {{ships were}} sold to Greece; {{this was the only}} sale of {{functional}} US battleships <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> government. From 1914 to the early 1930s, the ships were active in the Greek Navy, serving mostly in coastal defense and attack roles. In these missions and in the calmer waters of the Mediterranean, their limitations were less pronounced. They served in the Russian Civil War and the Greco-Turkish War. By the mid-1930s, they were relegated to reserve and auxiliary roles, and Idahos guns were removed to coastal fortifications. Both were sunk by German aircraft in 1941, and raised in the 1950s to be sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Sahil (Ganesh), a young Mumbaibased musician, plans {{a weekend}} getaway with his {{childhood}} friend, Jai (Pandit), a successful New York based businessman. The trip {{coincides with the}} latter's business meeting Mumbai. Sahil plans a weekend getaway to the Western Ghats, and arrives at the airport to receive Jai. Unaware of Sahil's plans, Jai starts a casual conversation with him and learns {{that he is not}} entirely happy with his boyfriend, Alex (Menon). Sahil in turn derives that Jai is struggling with his mother adjusting <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> environment.|$|E

5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's Dred Scott {{decision that}} black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about {{the constitutionality of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E
5|$|The New-York Tribune {{reported}} in late April that the Argentine government rejected a $17.5million offer for Moreno alone, {{which would have}} netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships ($12million). The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> country, put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships, which it eventually did. Similarly, news outlets {{reported in}} late 1913 and early 1914 that Greece had reached an accord to purchase Chile's first battleship as a counterbalance to the Ottoman acquisition of Rio de Janeiro, but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell {{one or both of}} the dreadnoughts, no deal was made.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's role as supreme judge {{could be}} {{temporarily}} duplicated by any official he designated {{in times of}} emergency or in distant borderlands where central government had little influence. This entailed a symbolic conferral of power, which was embodied in the Staff of Authority (Jiezhang 節杖). Roughly 2m (6ft) in height and decorated with ribbons, the Staff of Authority was often granted to an official with a specific errand, such as {{acting on behalf of}} the emperor as ambassador <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> country, appointing civilians to office, or immediately promoting a deserving military officer on the field of battle. Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.|$|E

5|$|The flag {{should be}} flown on the {{aircraft}} carrying the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister {{on a visit}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> country. Alongside the National Flag, {{the flag of the}} country visited should also be flown; however, when the aircraft lands in countries en route, the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead. When carrying the president within India, aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks; the flag is similarly flown on trains, but only when the train is stationary or approaching a railway station.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} reorganized and redesignated on 10 December 1971 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 220th Military Police Brigade, {{allowing}} it to command {{a larger number of}} military police units. On 16 April 1980 the brigade's command element was again reorganized as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 220th Military Police Brigade. Prior to the Iraq War, the brigade remained on reserve status, prepared to deploy if needed, but it was never called upon for any contingency operations or conflicts, as other active duty military police commands, primarily the 16th Military Police Brigade, were called upon to be deployed instead. By 1999, after 40 years of existence, the brigade had yet to be deployed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> theater of operations or participate in any conflicts or contingencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the sixth century was a period of {{political}} disorder in Arabia and communication routes were no longer secure. Religious divisions were an important cause of the crisis. Judaism became the dominant religion in Yemen while Christianity took root in the Persian Gulf area. In line with broader trends of the ancient world, the region witnessed a decline in the practice of polytheistic cults and a growing interest in a more spiritual form of religion. While many were reluctant to convert <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> faith, those faiths provided intellectual and spiritual reference points.|$|E
