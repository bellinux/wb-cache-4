40|$|The morphometrics and the bio-chemical {{characteristics}} of Crassostrea cuculata and Perna perna were studied. In the oyster, the length {{was found to}} be positively correlated with breadth and <b>total</b> body <b>weight.</b> There was also a positive relationship between the <b>total</b> body <b>weight</b> and the <b>total</b> muscle <b>weight.</b> In the mytilid the <b>total</b> body <b>weight</b> was positively correlated with length and <b>total</b> muscle <b>weight.</b> The muscle weight was also found to be highly correlated with the length. In both animals the relationship between the length and the <b>total</b> body <b>weight</b> was curvilinear. In the oyster, the protein content was found to increase with the <b>total</b> body <b>weight</b> and the <b>total</b> muscle <b>weight.</b> In the mytilid the protein content increased not only with the <b>total</b> body <b>weight</b> but also with the length.

5|$|More than 1,400 gastroliths (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) {{were found}} among the ribs and gastralia of {{specimen}} MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to <b>total</b> <b>weight,</b> 0.0022, supports the theory that these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such {{as the presence of}} a beak and a U-shaped, downturned jaw, are indicators of facultative (optional) herbivory among coelurosaurian theropods. In spite of these features, fish vertebrae and scales were also {{found among the}} gastroliths, which suggests that it was an omnivore. Ornithomimosaurs in general are thought to have fed on both plants and small animals.|$|E
5|$|Released in , {{four years}} after the launch of the {{original}} PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 2 Slimline was the first major redesign of the PlayStation 2. Compared to its predecessor, the Slimline was smaller, thinner, quieter and also included a built-in Ethernet port (in some markets it also has an integrated modem). In , Sony began shipping a revision of the Slimline which was lighter than the original Slimline together with a lighter AC adapter.

40|$|A core-based group-shared {{multicast}} tree is a {{shortest path}} tree rooted at core node that distributes packets {{to and from}} all group members. Traditionally, the bandwidth cost consumed by transmitting a packet via the tree is evaluated by the <b>total</b> <b>weights</b> of all the edges. And, the cost is minimized by constructing the multicast tree that has minimum <b>total</b> <b>weights</b> of edges to span all group members. However, when the local broadcasting operation is used to multicast a packet, {{we found that the}} cost is supposed to be evaluated by the <b>total</b> <b>weights</b> of all senders that include the core and all non-leaves. Since the multicast tree with the number of nodes {{greater than or equal to}} three has minimum cost only when the core is not a leaf, it leads us to find the multicast tree with the minimum number of non-leaves when each sender node has a unit weight. However, no polynomial time approximation scheme can be found for the minimum non-leaf multicast tree problem unless P NP = since the problem is not only NP-hard but also MAX-SNP hard. Thus, a heuristic is proposed to dynamically construct and adjust the multicast tree in a mobile ad hoc network. Experimental results show that our multicast tree has smaller number of non-leaves than others in the geometrically distributed network model. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{results showed}} that the inoculation, {{location}} and cultivar and their two and three ways interaction had a significant influence on the nodulation and grain yield.
