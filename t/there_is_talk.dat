500|$|Whenever <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> {{about new}} {{policies}} regarding new work time policies, {{there is often}} the argument for longer work hours {{in exchange for a}} shorter work week. For example, many are in favor of longer work hours such as [...] "three ten-hour days or four eight-hour days". However, this is often not the best work hours for people who take care of children, because children go to school for perhaps six hours a day, not eight or ten. Caretakers would prefer the opposite - shorter hours and longer weeks, such as six hour work days for six times a week, with limits on evening work and overtime, as well as flexible schedules. In order to lessen the burden of taking care of children and domestic duties as well as working in the paid sector, workplaces should consider policies that take into account the preferred work hours of caretakers. In addition, it is often the case now that many workers juggle domestic work and paid work. In order to get the most effective workers, companies should consider changing their policies in order to attract the best people in the field.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} {{of the use of}} NEXTEL Cup teams with their drivers in Busch Series races, most notably at NEXTEL Cup tracks where there are Busch Series support races. [...] This has been dubbed by Fox Sports announcer Mike Joy as [...] "Busch Whacking", and many underfunded (or one-car) teams have failed to qualify for these races because of this. [...] The 2006 season has been notable for those [...] "double duty" [...] drivers even traveling to sites where there are stand-alone races at Nashville Superspeedway, Kentucky Speedway, Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez and The Milwaukee Mile just to name a few, even on the rare weeks where there are no NEXTEL Cup races. [...] Kentucky was the big upset where one of the underfunded one-car teams took advantage and pulled off the big upset. [...] In the end, Kevin Harvick, who drives for Richard Childress Racing in the Cup series, won the 2006 championship on October 13, the second of his career having previously won in 2001. [...] <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> about limiting the number of [...] "Busch Whackers" [...] in each race or capping the double-dippers appearances for the entire season and even having a [...] "Chase for the NEXTEL Cup" [...] playoff system in place for the 2007 season since Harvick was so dominant during 2006 as NEXTEL Cup drivers won every race but two in the season.|$|E
