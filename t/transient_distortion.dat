In amplifiers, this problem {{can be traced to}} power supplies in some instances, to insufficient high frequency performance or to excessive negative feedback. Related measurements are slew rate and rise time. Distortion in transient response can be hard to measure. Many otherwise good power amplifier designs have been found to have inadequate slew rates, by modern standards. In loudspeakers, transient response performance is affected by the mass and resonances of drivers and enclosures and by group delay and phase delay introduced by crossover filtering or inadequate time alignment of the loudspeaker's drivers. Most loudspeakers generate significant amounts of <b>transient</b> <b>distortion,</b> though some designs are less prone to this (e.g. electrostatic loudspeakers, plasma arc tweeters, ribbon tweeters and horn enclosures with multiple entry points).|$|E

40|$|The {{geometrical}} {{changes of}} the processed material (process induced distortions) are a critical issue in pultrusion, since they affect the process dynamics (mainly the pull force), {{as well as the}} mechanical properties and geometrical precision of the final product.

In the present study, two different modelling approaches are implemented and compared to calculate the development of the distortions during the pultrusion of a graphite/epoxy composite rod. In both cases, the temperature and the degree of cure distributions are obtained from the thermo-chemical analysis, using a finite element and a finite volume approach, respectively.

A cross-section of the central "muscular " part of the pump shows only 30 % myofibrillar area {{and there is still}} less contractile tissue towards the anterior and posterior ends of the pump. The pump shortens and widens as the lining is opened and becomes longer and thinner when the lining closes, and swell-ing of the radial muscles normal to their line of action jams them together, providing anchorage for them to open the lining. But some parts of the radial musculature are squeezed outward when active so that the anterior muscles shorten by> 4 %, but the middle and posterior muscles by half this or not at all.

40|$|A {{prominent}} and influential hypothesis of vision suggests {{the existence of}} two separate visual systems within the brain, one creating our perception {{of the world and}} another guiding our actions within it. The induced Roelofs effect has been described as providing strong evidence for this perception/action dissociation: When a small visual target is surrounded by a large frame positioned so that the frame’s center is offset from the observer’s midline, the perceived location of the target is shifted in the direction opposite the frame’s offset. In spite of this perceptual mislocalization, however, the observer can accurately guide movements to the target location. Thus, perception is prone to the illusion while actions seem immune. Here we demonstrate that the Roelofs illusion is caused by a frame-induced <b>transient</b> <b>distortion</b> of the observer’s apparent midline. We further demonstrate that actions guided to targets within this same distorted egocentric reference frame are fully expected to be accurate, since the errors of target localization will exactly cancel the errors of motor guidance. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the various perceptual and motor effects of the induced Roelofs illusion without requiring the existence of separate neural systems for perception and action. Given this, the behavioral dissociation that accompanies the Roelofs effect cannot be considered evidence of a dissociation of perception and action. This indicates a general need to re-evaluate the broad class of evidence purported to support this hypothesized dissociation...|$|E
