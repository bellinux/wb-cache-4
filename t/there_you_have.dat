500|$|In 1599 {{additional}} {{trees were}} {{planted in the}} Walks, and stairs up to the Walks were also added. When Francis Bacon became treasurer in 1608 more improvements were made, since {{he no longer had}} to seek the approval of the Pension to make changes. In September 1608 a gate was installed on the southern wall, and various gardeners were employed to maintain the Walks. The gardens became commonly used as a place of relaxation, and James Howell wrote in 1621 that [...] "I hold [...] to be the pleasantest place about London, and that <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the choicest society".|$|E

The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week. In the much-watched interview, Grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, [...] "What the hell were you thinking?" [...] Grant answered, [...] "I think you know in life what's {{a good thing to do}} and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing. And <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it." ...|$|E

500|$|Monthly teen {{magazine}} Seventeen called Purr's bottle design [...] "cute". Miriam Lacey of Popsugar's spin-off website BellaSugar {{gave the}} perfume a favorable review {{and said it}} smelt [...] "like a fancier, less chemical-laden version" [...] of fruit-scented body sprays. In her review, Lacey also called Purr an [...] "upside-down" [...] fragrance, because unlike most perfumes which [...] "open with their prettiest notes and then end with a relatively generic bottom accord", Purr has a [...] "really nice caramel and sweet patchouli dry down that fans of Angel will adore, but to get <b>there,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to sit through a bunch of fruity opening notes". Lacey observed that its scent only lasted about 2 hours; {{she thought it would}} be better to spray it onto your hairbrush, [...] "since the oils on your scalp will help it last longer".|$|E

Darren {{is due to}} go on a date he has arranged and Nancy comes to watch him, Darren's date does not arrive. As the evening continues, the pair realise there is an attraction between them and agree to go home together. Dawson said that the pair have [...] "always sort of hated each other" [...] as they are opposites, explaining that [...] "She's a feminist and he's a male chauvinist pig!" [...] He felt for the pair to begin {{a relationship}} is a [...] "case of opposites attracting - for some reason it works". Dawson added that through the pair's [...] "pompous ways" [...] they have both been through [...] "hard times and been through them with each other because they've known each other for so long". He commented that the pair have [...] "never seen eye-to-eye, but I think that when they sit down and chat they realise they have a lot more in common than they think. In the past they just didn't want to accept that". E4 described the relationship this way: [...] "She's chalk and he's definitely more than a bit cheesy, but <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it; Darren and Nancy (Dancy) are now officially an item! They’re the original odd-couple!" ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1963, after Cox was {{discharged}} from the Army, he and Hendrix moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and formed a band called the King Kasuals. Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play with his teeth in Seattle and by now Alphonso 'Baby Boo' Young, the other guitarist in the band, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix learned to play with his teeth. He later commented: [...] "The idea of doing that came to me...in Tennessee. Down <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to play with your teeth or else you get shot. There's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage." [...] Although they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to Nashville's Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city's black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the Club del Morocco, {{and for the next}} two years Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners' Booking Association (TOBA), widely known as the Chitlin' Circuit. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R, and blues musicians, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, and Jackie Wilson.|$|E

McCreight noted: “My education being red school house and hard knocks, did not measure up to Hoover’s class. Rhoads is a fine fellow, Quaker, College-bred and rich.

2500|$|The first eleven episodes {{were set}} {{primarily}} in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about the}} setting of the third season stating, [...] "Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It’s really allowing us, as writers, to dig deep into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I think being in Neverland {{is going to have a}} profound effect on each of the characters. It’s really fun to see these characters and dig deep this year and explore what it’s like for Emma to [...] her parents. Neverland is really a place where we can sit down and think about that." [...] The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more [...] "complicated" [...] version of the character, with Kitsis saying, [...] "We have not yet met Peter Pan and we have not yet seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!" [...] In a further interview, Horowitz stated, [...] "Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up <b>there,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to keep yourself amused. However long Peter Pan has been there and for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our take on that and on the legend of Peter Pan. We have a way that it intertwines with our Once Upon a Time mythology that we're really excited to unveil." [...] At Disney's D23 Expo event, the creators hinted at romantic sparks between Emma Swan and Captain Hook, and revelations about how Hook became a pirate. On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney. Later that month, it was announced that the season finale will air on May 11, 2014 and have a duration of two hours.|$|E
