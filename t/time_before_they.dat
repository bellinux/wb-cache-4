5|$|At this point, relief {{arrived from}} an {{unexpected}} quarter—Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe. The Depression had already forced three teams to either shut down outright or suspend operations never to return. Additionally, the New York Americans had been wards {{of the league}} since 1936, and it {{was considered to be}} only a matter of <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> folded (they eventually did, in 1942). Smythe {{did not want to see}} the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire the Maple Leafs' former coach, Dick Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led the Maple Leafs to seven finals and one Cup in nine years. The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E

Disturbed by both the abduction and Black's rage, Catherine moves out of their family home with Jordan for a <b>time.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>they</b> can reconcile, Catherine dies in a virus outbreak orchestrated by the Millennium Group, who Black discovers are attempting to control the possibility {{of the end of the}} world at the turn of the millennium. Disgusted by the group's motives and actions, Black breaks rank and returns to work with the FBI in order to take them down.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 July, she was {{flagship}} of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, commander of the Harwich Force, as he took Carysfort, her half-sister , and eight destroyers to sea to patrol the sea lanes between Felixstowe and the Dutch coast. He split his forces to cover the two routes involved and encountered three German torpedo boats en route to attack merchant shipping in that area around 01:15 of the following morning. Hampered by an inopportune rain squall and a German smoke screen, Tyrwhitt's ships were only able to engage the Germans for a short <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> disengaged. Tyrwhitt then ordered Canterbury and her escort to intercept the fleeing Germans; they spotted six torpedo boats about a half-hour later and opened fire at 02:02. Visibility was poor because of another smoke screen laid by the Germans and the British ships were forced to disengage without inflicting any damage at 02:25 as they were approaching a minefield.|$|E

5|$|Over time, Vrataski trains Cage {{to excel}} in combat training. Frustrated by his {{continued}} failures to excel, he retreats to London to spare his own life, but discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Eventually receiving {{a vision of a}} dam in Germany, indicating that the Omega is hiding there, Cage and Vrataski spend many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski, who lost a loved one to the Mimics, is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic struggling to bleed him out and strip off his ability to reset <b>time.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>they</b> can slowly bleed him to death, Cage deliberately drowns himself to avoid the process.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{internal}} {{tensions and}} economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Nicholas II was deposed in early 1917, {{many members of}} the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were held under house arrest. The new government retired Kulikovsky from the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dowager Empress Marie, Grand Duke Alexander, Grand Duchess Olga, and Kulikovsky managed to escape to the Crimea where they lived for a <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> too were placed under house arrest at one of the imperial estates. As a commoner, Kulikovsky was permitted more freedom of movement than the Romanovs, and was occasionally able to leave the estate in a pony-cart, which allowed him to run errands, obtain food, and seek news of the outside. On 12 August 1917, Olga and Kulikovsky's first child and son, Tikhon, was born in the Crimea. He was named after one of the Grand Duchess's favorite saints, Tikhon of Zadonsk. Although the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, Tikhon received no titles because his father was a commoner.|$|E
5|$|Warfare in Normandy at {{the time}} was shaped by the {{defensive}} potential of castles and the increasing costs of conducting campaigns. The Norman frontiers had limited natural defences but were heavily reinforced with castles, such as Château Gaillard, at strategic points, built and maintained at considerable expense. It was difficult for a commander to advance far into fresh territory without having secured his lines of communication by capturing these fortifications, which slowed the progress of any attack. Armies of the period could be formed from either feudal or mercenary forces. Feudal levies could only be raised for a fixed length of <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> returned home, forcing an end to a campaign; mercenary forces, often called Brabançons after the Duchy of Brabant but actually recruited from across northern Europe, could operate all year long and provide a commander with more strategic options to pursue a campaign, but cost much more than equivalent feudal forces. As a result, commanders of the period were increasingly drawing on larger numbers of mercenaries.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of electric locomotives {{around the turn}} of the 20th century and later diesel-electric locomotives spelled the beginning of a decline in the use of steam locomotives, although it was some <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> were phased out of general use. As diesel power (especially with electric transmission) became more reliable in the 1930s, it gained a foothold in North America. The full transition away from steam power in North America took place during the 1950s. In continental Europe, large-scale electrification had replaced steam power by the 1970s. Steam was a familiar technology, adapted well to local facilities, and also consumed a wide variety of fuels; this led to its continued use in many countries until the end of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|With war {{breaking}} {{out between the}} Russians and the Turks, Britain {{realized that it was}} only a matter of <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> would be drawn into the conflict. The British Army was in the midst of a significant weapons transformation from smoothbore muskets to rifled muskets. While three of the four divisions of the field army in the Crimea had been supplied with the pattern 1851 Minie rifle-musket, the other regiments of the army around the Empire still carried the 1842 pattern smoothbore musket. By the end of 1853, the Enfield rifle-musket was approved by the War Department for the army and was put into production. The Enfield saw extensive action in the Crimean War, 1854–1856, with the first Enfield rifles being issued to troops from February 1855.|$|E
25|$|The Revolution {{permanently}} ended {{any chance}} of Catholicism becoming re-established in England. For British Catholics its effects were disastrous both socially and politically: Catholics were {{denied the right to}} vote and sit in the Westminster Parliament for over a century; they were also denied commissions in the army, and the monarch was forbidden to be Catholic or to marry a Catholic, this latter prohibition remaining in force until 2015. The Revolution led to limited tolerance for Nonconformist Protestants, although it would be some <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> had full political rights. It has been argued, mainly by Whig historians, that James's overthrow began modern English parliamentary democracy: the Bill of Rights 1689 {{has become one of the}} most important documents in the political history of Britain and never since has the monarch held absolute power.|$|E

25|$|Using his {{previous}} combat experience and personal leadership qualities, Honner maintained the 39th Battalion's cohesion and morale, {{and led them}} in a fighting withdrawal down the track, helping to blunt the Japanese advance towards Port Moresby until they were reinforced, and subsequently relieved, by the 2/14th Battalion. The 39th Battalion was then withdrawn from the line and rested {{for a brief period}} of <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> were recommitted to the fighting around Gona in December 1942. For his role during the capture of the Japanese beachheads around Gona and Sananada, Honner was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order. In January 1943, the 39th Battalion was withdrawn to Australia for rest and re-organisation. After reforming on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, they were subsequently disbanded on 3 July 1943, as {{the decision was made to}} redistribute the battalion's personnel to reinforce other units.|$|E

25|$|During combat, {{the player}} {{character}} is Agrippa, who can use various gladiatorial weapons such as swords, scimitars, maces, spears, bows, slingshots and flails. If Agrippa has severed {{the arm of}} an enemy, he can {{pick it up and}} also use it as a weapon. However, weapons can only be used for a certain amount of <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> break. During combat, a meter indicates the remaining vitality of Agrippa's weapon(s) and helmet (if he has one equipped). Agrippa can attack with his main weapon, his sub-weapon or shield, or with a two-handed weapon. The player can lock on to enemies to make Agrippa target them. Agrippa can also throw weapons at his enemies, and can fight with his fists, using strong and soft punches as well as shoulder tackles. If timed correctly, Agrippa can also steal weapons from his enemies, or knock their weapons out of their hands using a shoulder tackle. He can also attack from the ground by flinging sand into an approaching enemy's face, and he can attack downed enemies by stomping on them or stabbing them. If Agrippa stands behind a groggy enemy he can perform a suplex on them.|$|E

25|$|Richard was not {{personally}} {{responsible for the death}} of his wife's first husband, Edward of Westminster (the son of Henry VI), nor that of her father, Richard Neville (the Earl of Warwick). They were killed in the battles of Tewkesbury and Barnet, respectively, which restored Edward IV to the throne. Although only eighteen years old, Richard took part in both battles, but no contemporary records indicate him as being involved directly in either death. Richard was also not {{responsible for the death of}} Henry VI, who was probably murdered on the orders of Edward IV. Richard and his wife, Anne Neville, had known each other for a long <b>time</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> married, having spent much of their childhood in the same household. Henry VI's widow, Queen Margaret, would not have been seen at court since the much earlier Battle of Towton, which won the throne for Edward IV for the first time; she became Edward IV's prisoner until she returned to France. Richard was not responsible for the death of his elder brother, George (Duke of Clarence), who was executed by Edward IV for treason after he had rebelled against him. Richard was in the North of England when Edward IV died; this was five years after the execution of Clarence – and after a long period of peace.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDeveloping cardiac myocytes divide {{a limited}} number of <b>times</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> stop and terminally differentiate, but the {{mechanism}} that stops their division is unknown. To help study the stopping mechanism, we defined conditions under which embryonic rat cardiac myocytes cultured in serum-free medium proliferate and exit the cell cycle on a schedule that closely resembles that seen in vivo. The culture medium contains FGF- 1 and FGF- 2, which stimulate cell proliferation, and thyroid hormone, which seems to be necessary for stable cell-cycle exit. Time-lapse video recording shows that the cells within a clone tend to divide a similar number of <b>times</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> stop, whereas cells in different clones divide a variable number of <b>times</b> <b>before</b> <b>they</b> stop. Cells cultured at 33 °C divide more slowly but stop dividing at around the same time as cells cultured at 37 °C, having undergone fewer divisions. Together, these findings suggest that an intrinsic timer helps control when cardiac myocytes withdraw from the cell cycle and that the timer does not operate by simply counting cell divisions. We provide evidence that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p 18 and p 27 may be part of the timer and that thyroid hormone may help developing cardiac myocytes stably withdraw from the cell cycle...|$|R
