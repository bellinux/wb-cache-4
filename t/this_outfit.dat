25|$|As in {{the case}} of all Soul {{character}}s, Taki's character creation started with her weapon. During the early development of Soul Edge, Taki was conceived as a Yoshimitsu-like ninja character, armed with a long sword and wearing a loose outfit and large helmet covering her upper face. She underwent several major design changes before the game's release, evolving into an athletic, iron-masked, buxom woman with a chest size of 90cm/E (Soulcalibur IV measurements; her breasts have noticeably grew through the series), clad in a partially armored catsuit. Taki used variations of <b>this</b> <b>outfit</b> throughout the series; by default her primary costumes were colored crimson or navy blue. A cloth mask returns with Taki's primary costume in Soulcalibur, which is the only game in which her breasts are partially exposed. Taki has a demon-themed menpo iron mask with her blue-colored main costume in Soulcalibur III and a similar red costume is featured in Legends. Other demonic motifs have appeared on her armor since Soulcalibur.|$|E

500|$|The word [...] "ao dai" [...] was {{originally}} {{applied to the}} outfit worn at the court of the Nguyễn Lords at Huế in the 18th century. <b>This</b> <b>outfit</b> evolved into the áo ngũ thân, a five-paneled aristocratic gown worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Inspired by Paris fashions, Nguyễn Cát Tường and other artists associated with Hanoi University redesigned the ngũ thân as a modern dress in the 1920s and 1930s. The updated look was promoted by the artists and magazines of Tự Lực văn đoàn (Self-Reliant Literary Group) as a national costume for the modern era. In the 1950s, Saigon designers tightened the fit to produce the version worn by Vietnamese women today. The dress was extremely popular in South Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s. On Tết and other occasions, Vietnamese men may wear an áo gấm (brocade robe), {{a version of the}} ao dai made of thicker fabric.|$|E

Rendon rented a studio and hired John MacBurney—whom Abraham constany argued with—to do the makeup. MacBurney [...] "privately complained" [...] to EMI Latin that Abraham was difficult to deal with. Rendon and MacBurney, however, found Selena [...] "real easy to work with". Selena picked out the outfit for herself to wear in the cover picture; <b>this</b> <b>outfit</b> included a black top with a mesh see-through midriff, a long-sleeve black jacket with black-and-white striped long sleeves, a wide black leather belt, and tight black pants. She chose a pose where she runs her fingers through her hair, a pose that Abraham was noticeably bothered with. In 1998, the outfit that she wore for the album cover was added to a museum that her family operates in Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E

[...] On the other hand, UGO ranked the [...] "Sexy Mileena" [...] from Deception as second best on the 2011 list of the gaming's [...] "most stylin' alternate costumes" [...] and called her {{one of the most}} interesting characters in the game for having [...] "a perfect 10 body" [...] but [...] "a -22 face," [...] adding that <b>this</b> <b>outfit</b> [...] "basically ramps up the sex appeal to volcanic levels."

500|$|Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, called simply Elvis, {{aired on}} December 3, 1968. Later {{known as the}} '68 Comeback Special, the show {{featured}} lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band {{in front of a}} small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley clad in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock-and-roll days. Bill Belew, who designed <b>this</b> <b>outfit,</b> gave it a Napoleonic standing collar (Presley customarily wore high collars because he believed his neck looked too long), a design feature that he would later make a major trademark of the outfits Presley wore on stage in his later years. Director and coproducer Steve Binder had worked hard to reassure the nervous singer and to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, [...] "There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy." [...] Dave Marsh calls the performance one of [...] "emotional grandeur and historical resonance." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Red Blooded Woman" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, an English film director who had previously worked with artists like Beyoncé and Kelis. It was filmed in Los Angeles, California, in December 2003. It begins with a scene of a congested traffic jam in which Minogue is caught. She is shown seated in her car singing to the song in a sensual manner, with the camera repeatedly focusing on her eyes and lips. Her outfit is composed of {{a black and white}} singlet, a satin waist cincher, jeans with chain fringes, and a black sheepskin shrug (<b>this</b> <b>outfit</b> was donated by Minogue to the Arts Centre Melbourne and is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). A few seconds later, she gets down from her vehicle and playfully makes her way to a tank. Climbing up on its ladder, Minogue dances seductively to the chorus of the song. She then resumes walking on the street and is accompanied by two doberman puppies who escape from a nearby car. After entering into the backseat of another car, Minogue begins unwrapping a red dress and proceeds to change into it as she is watched by various onlookers. As the second chorus starts, Minogue is seen dancing with a group of backup dancers at a different location. Her attire consists of a fluorine yellow bustier worn underneath a pastel pink dress designed by French fashion house Balenciaga. The scene changes back to the street, where Minogue is shown entering a truck. She dims the lights and then dances in a different outfit, consisting of a black bikini, red leggings, and laced gloves. However, she exits the truck in the same red outfit she donned earlier. The rest of the video rapidly intersperses scenes of Minogue dancing inside and in front of the truck, on a car, with the backup dancers, and near a gang of motorcyclists.|$|E

500|$|While {{casting the}} [...] "freighter folk"– the {{nickname}} that Losts executive producers/writers/show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse use {{to refer to}} Daniel, Charlotte, Miles and Frank– fake names, occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned, to limit the leak of spoilers. [...] After seeing Ken Leung guest star on HBO's The Sopranos in April 2007, Lindelof and Cuse wrote the role of Miles specifically for him, although it was initially reported that Leung would be playing the part of [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] "Russell". [...] The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writer-producers thought that [...] "it would be cool if his name sounded like 'maelstrom. [...] Had he not taken the part, Lindelof and Cuse claim that Miles would have been scrapped and a new and very different character would have been written into the story instead. [...] Leung, who was originally contracted as a recurring guest star, {{was quoted as saying}} that [...] "Miles doesn't know how to be social, which is great, because I don't know how to be social." [...] Costume designer Roland Sanchez wanted to base one of the freighter folk's clothing after that of Keith Richards, specifically a picture in which he wore a sleeveless vest, which he admired. [...] Sanchez believed that Miles fitted the haggard look and bought an Armani Exchange jacket, cut off the sleeves and added a hood, and that <b>this</b> <b>outfit</b> helped Leung to develop Miles. [...] Co-executive producer/writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name [...] "Lapidus" [...] for years, finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus. [...] Unsatisfied, Kitsis developed the character [...] "Frank Lapidus, Helicopter Pilot". [...] According to the show runners, recurring guest star Jeff Fahey [...] "was the first and only choice for the role". [...] They also commended his [...] "intense eyes" [...] and stated that [...] "he has exactly the right sensibilities" [...] for the part. [...] Frank was not envisioned with a beard, however, the writer-producers allowed Fahey to keep it for the role. [...] The writer-producers have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E
