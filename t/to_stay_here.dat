5|$|The Menara {{gardens are}} located {{to the west}} of the city, at the gates of the Atlas mountains. They were built around 1130 by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min. The name menara derives from the {{pavilion}} with its small green pyramid roof (menzeh). The pavilion was built during the 16th century Saadi dynasty and renovated in 1869 by sultan Abderrahmane of Morocco, who used <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> in summertime.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived back}} in Cairo in late September 1829 where the expedition bought 10,000 francs worth of antiquities, a budget extended {{to them by}} minister Rochefoucauld. Arriving in Alexandria, they were notified that the French boat that would take them back was delayed, and they had <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> two months until the sixth of December. On their return to Alexandria, the Khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha, offered the two obelisks standing {{at the entrance of}} Luxor Temple to France in 1829, but only one was transported to Paris, where it now stands on the Place de la Concorde. Champollion and the Pasha spoke often and on the Pasha's request Champollion wrote an outline of the history of Egypt. Here, Champollion {{had no choice but to}} challenge the short Biblical chronology arguing that Egyptian civilization had its origins at least 6000 years before Islam. The two also spoke about social reforms, Champollion championing education of the lower classes – a point on which the two did not agree.|$|E

[...] The theatre officially reopened on February 4, 1994 with a {{performance}} of Barry Scott's Ain't Got Long <b>to</b> <b>Stay</b> <b>Here,</b> which was {{about the life of}} Martin Luther King, Jr. [...] In March 1995, Lincoln Theatre hosted a play, Where Eagles Fly, written by local playwright Carole Mumin. [...] The play told the story of a local elderly woman who fought the Shaw Urban Redevelopment Project that targeted the Shaw neighborhood for demolition, and sought to preserve the neighborhood and its history.|$|E
500|$|Hull {{expressed}} {{a strong desire}} to retain Campbell's services for the 2008–09 season, with Hull chairman, Paul Duffen, describing Campbell as [...] "too good for the Championship". Following his successes leading to their promotion, Hull were hoping to secure either a permanent move or another season-long loan, depending on Manchester United's willingness to let him go. However, Campbell repeatedly expressed the desire to return to Old Trafford and try to break into the first team, saying [...] "Now I'm back at United, the plan is to try to force my way into the first team." [...] He added, [...] "I'm going to continue to work hard and try to do enough <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> and go on from there." ...|$|E
500|$|By all accounts, Gage {{appeared}} to be a fair administrator, respecting people's lives and property, although he had a healthy distrust of the landowning seigneurs and of the Roman Catholic clergy, who he viewed as intriguers for the French. When peace was announced following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Gage began lobbying for another posting, as he was [...] "very much [...] of this cursed Climate, and I must be bribed very high <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> any longer". [...] In October 1763 the good news arrived that he would act as commander-in-chief of North America while Amherst was on leave in Britain. He immediately left Montreal, and took over Amherst's command in New York on 17 November 1763. [...] When he did so, he inherited the job of dealing with the Indian uprising known as Pontiac's Rebellion.|$|E

500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here.</b> I have been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on." ...|$|E
500|$|Because Mackintosh had {{intended}} to use Aurora as the party's main living quarters, most of the shore party's personal gear, food, equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed. Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton's depots had been landed, the ten stranded men were left with [...] "only the clothes on their backs". [...] Mackintosh [...] summarised their situation: [...] "We {{have to face the}} possibility that we may have <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> unsupported, for two years. [...] We cannot expect rescue before then, and so we must conserve and economize on what we have, and we must seek and apply what substitutes we can gather". Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. [...] These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. [...] "Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop" [...] fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco—"Hut Point Mixture"—was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few dried herbs. [...] By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: [...] "Tomorrow we start for Hut Point".|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{formed a}} {{formidable}} centre-back pairing with Jon Ashton the following {{season as the}} team started putting a decent run of form together during late August and throughout September 2009; with the defence being particularly tight. He scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season on his 50th appearance for the club, giving Stevenage the lead in a 3–1 victory over Salisbury City in October 2009. A month later, he doubled his goal tally, scoring the second goal in Stevenage's 2–0 victory against Chester City, before notching his third goal {{of the season in}} a 6–0 win over Vauxhall Motors in the FA Trophy. Roberts' fourth goal of the campaign came during another 6–0 win, this time at Eastbourne Borough, side-footing the ball into the net from a well-worked free-kick. He scored his fifth goal of the season in a 3–0 win over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow, sliding the ball into the net from close range. Roberts led the side out in their 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough in April 2010; the game that ultimately secured promotion to the Football League {{for the first time in}} the club's history, winning the league with two games to spare. Roberts played a total of 49 times during the season, scoring five times from defence. He was also named as the Conference Premier Player of the Month for April 2010. Stevenage had the best defensive record in the league, conceding just 24 goals in 46 league matches, as well as ending the season having not conceded in their last six games; and conceding just two goals in their last 15 league matches. In May 2010, Roberts signed a new two-year contract with Stevenage. On signing the new deal, Roberts said [...] "there was never any doubt that I wanted <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> I love the club and love the fans. It will be a privilege to lead the team in the Football League". At the Football Conference's Annual Presentation Dinner, he was named in the Team of the Year, alongside fellow Stevenage defenders Ronnie Henry and Scott Laird.|$|E

[...] Hossa's comments came just several months after the Red Wings signed forward Henrik Zetterberg to a 12-year contract extension.|$|E
2500|$|The club's board {{indicated}} that they were losing money due to the facilities at the County Ground not generating enough income to keep the club afloat. Swindon director Bob Holt issued a statement to the town stating: [...] "Please, please come to the games. We know it's expensive, but you have to if you want football in Swindon." [...] Earlier in the season the club had announced its new proposal to redevelop the County Ground, a plan which received the backing of the local council who own the land. Chief Executive Bob Holt commented: [...] "We have been at the County Ground for over 100 years and it is only appropriate that we should explore every opportunity <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> for another 100 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} on January 31, 2008, that Redick asked his agent, Arn Tellem, {{to see about}} a possible trade. [...] "We want to see what's out there," [...] Redick told the Orlando Sentinel, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> but it's been frustrating." [...] Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: [...] "Right now {{it would be very}} hard to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things." [...] The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Redick would not receive more minutes or a trade before the Feb 21 trade deadline. In the last game of the season, with the playoff seed locked up, Redick received more time than he had all season and led the Magic with 18 points, {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
2500|$|The album's themes include {{mortality}} and growing older, or, as Taylor described it, [...] "just realizing, 'I'm not {{as young as}} I used to be, what am I {{going to do with}} myself? I don't have eternity <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> so I need to get up and do something and make it worthwhile'—whatever that means." [...] Pierre's lyricism includes a mix of fact and fiction, which is intended to leave the listener guessing. The album's tone is reflective, which was spurred from Pierre having time to sit at home to write and think. He looked at his relationship with lead guitarist Joshua Cain, noting that the two had written and played music together for 15 years at that point. Pierre felt [...] "overwhelmed with the eventual demise of everything," [...] and considered the fact that [...] "nothing lasts forever" [...] is one of the album's most important points. Occasionally, Pierre's lyricism was considered too personal or dark by other members. One lyric from [...] "Timelines", paraphrased by Pierre in an interview as [...] "rushing into every pore, the whiskey stench of open sores", was changed to [...] "scattered seeds of sycamore," [...] as Cain found the lyric gross, noting it [...] "literally made [...] stomach sick." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, Robeson {{was called}} before HUAC after {{he refused to}} sign an {{affidavit}} affirming {{that he was not}} a Communist. In his testimony, he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to reveal his political affiliations. When asked why he had not remained in the Soviet Union because of his affinity with its political ideology, he replied, [...] "because my father was a slave and my people died to build , I am going <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> and have a part of it just like you and no fascist-minded people will drive me from it!" [...] At that hearing, Robeson stated [...] "Whether I am or not a Communist is irrelevant. The question is whether American citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or sympathies, may enjoy their constitutional rights." [...] Robeson's passport was subsequently revoked. Campaigns were launched to protest the passport ban and the restriction of his right to travel over the next four years, but it was to no avail. In 1957, unable to accept invitations to perform abroad, Paul Robeson sang for audiences in London, where 1,000 concert tickets for his telephone concert at St Pancras Town Hall sold out within an hour, and Wales via the transatlantic telephone cable TAT-1: [...] "We have to learn the hard way that there is another way to sing".|$|E
