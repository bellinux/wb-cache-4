5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} in The Satanic Bible are shaped around a secular, {{scientific}} view of the world.

5|$|A notable {{cultural}} <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> Chiprovtsi {{shared with}} much of the region is the veneration of a family patron saint, named svetets ("saint") and akin to Serbian slava. The practice exists since time immemorial and the family saint is thought to have been chosen by the taking of a random candle by an unaware person. The svetets is associated to the family house: when a daughter-in-law comes to live there, she accepts the family saint of the home, and when a family member or a foreign settler moves out or builds a new house, they adopt a new svetets.|$|E

40|$|Background - Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{and attention}} deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and associated subclinical traits, regularly co-occur with one another. However, the aetiology of their co-occurrence remains poorly understood. This paper provides the first genetically informative, longitudinal analysis of the interaction between <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> ASD and ADHD, and explores their genetic and environmental overlap. Method - Parents of approximately 5000 twin pairs completed questionnaires assessing <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> ASD and ADHD when twins were aged 8 and 12 years. Cross-lagged longitudinal modelling explored their developmental association, enabling a consideration of phenotypic-driven processes. Overlapping aetiological influences on traits at age 12 years were explored using bivariate twin modelling. Results - <b>Traits</b> <b>of</b> ADHD at age 8 years were more strongly predictive <b>of</b> <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> ASD at 12 years than <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> ASD at 8 years were <b>of</b> <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> ADHD at 12 years. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>traits</b> by subscales assessing specific symptom domains suggested that communication difficulties were most strongly associated with <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> ADHD. Bivariate modelling suggested moderate genetic overlap on traits in males (genetic correlation = 0. 41), and a modest degree of overlap in females (genetic correlation = 0. 23) at age 12 years. Conclusions - <b>Traits</b> <b>of</b> ADHD at age 8 years significantly influence <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> ASD at age 12 years, after controlling for their initial relationship at age 8 years. In particular, early ADHD traits influenced later communication difficulties. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature <b>of</b> co-occurring <b>traits</b> across development. In addition, these findings add to a growing body of literature suggesting that <b>traits</b> <b>of</b> ASD and ADHD may arise via similar aetiological processes...|$|R

5|$|The {{complete}} set of observable traits {{that make up the}} structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> albinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn.|$|E

5|$|The tuatara has gastralia, rib-like bones {{also called}} gastric or {{abdominal}} ribs, the presumed ancestral <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> diapsids.

The true ribs are small projections, with small, hooked bones, called uncinate processes, found on the rear of each rib. This feature is also present in birds. The tuatara is the only living tetrapod with well-developed gastralia and uncinate processes.|$|E
5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E
5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development may have led to the evolution of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E

5|$|An {{adaptation}} is an observable {{structure or}} other feature of an organism (for example, an enzyme) generated {{by natural selection}} to serve its current function. A biologist might propose the hypothesis that feathers are adaptations for bird flight. That would require three things: that the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> having feathers is heritable; that the trait does serve the function of flight; and that the trait increases the fitness of the organisms that have it. Feathers clearly meet these three conditions in living birds. However, {{there is also a}} historical question, namely, did the trait arise {{at the same time as}} bird flight? Unfortunately for the hypothesis, this seems not to be so: theropod dinosaurs had feathers, but many of them did not fly. Feathers can be described as an exaptation, having been co-opted for flight but having evolved earlier for another purpose such as insulation. Biologists may describe both the co-option and the earlier adaptation in teleological language.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{churches are}} not the only source of {{inspiration}} that researchers attribute to the Round Church. Some scholars link its design to an Armenian influence, perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the Caucasus. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian monks. Another possible model for the Round Church in Preslav may well be found in Carolingian architecture from the time of Charlemagne, and particularly the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics. At the time of the Round Church's construction, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the Frankish Empire. One <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> the Round Church that is claimed by scholars to be a very recognisable Carolingian influence is the presence of a monumental westwork.|$|E
5|$|Swords and Sorcery is {{presented}} in a first person top-down perspective and contains elements of dungeon crawling, a common <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> role playing video games. The game {{is set in a}} fictional land called Zob, in which he main objective is to explore its catacombs and discover a large wealth of treasure, alongside collecting seven pieces of sacred Zob armour. The game begins with allowing the player to choose their player-character; the default protagonist is called Flubbit the Dull, however there is an option to allow the player to create and personalise their own character. Once a character has been created, a 14 in-game day training scheme will commence which gives the player an opportunity to improve their abilities such as lock picking, sword fighting and thieving. An in-game armoury is also accessible at any time, which includes utilities such as body armour and various weaponry. The form of currency in the game is dragon's teeth, which can be used to purchase items and equipment.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of teleost species {{belong to the}} clade Euteleostei, which consists of 17,419 species classified in 2,935 genera and 346 families. Shared traits of the euteleosts include similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and dorsal fin (supraneural bones), an outgrowth on the stegural bone (a bone located near the neural arches of the tail) and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base. The {{majority of}} euteleosts are in the clade Neoteleosti. A derived <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> neoteleosts is a muscle that controls the pharyngeal jaws, giving them a role in grinding food. Within neoteleosts, the Acanthopterygii have a spiny dorsal fin which {{is in front of}} the soft-rayed dorsal fin. This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may also play a role in defense. Acanthomorphs have developed spiny ctenoid scales (as opposed to the cycloid scales of other groups), tooth-bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming.|$|E
5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958).

Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil simply because he is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that simply because someone or something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination.|$|E

5|$|An {{interpretation}} of {{the story about the}} Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 2010, based on specimens collected in February, 2009 from Benton County, Oregon. Before this, {{it had been}} known locally for several years as the Oregon brown truffle, and assumed to be an undescribed species of Leucangium, based on its overall resemblance to and similar habitat as the Oregon black truffle, Leucangium carthusianum; it was given the provisional name Leucangium brunneum. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences revealed that the species {{is not related to}} the truffle genera of the family Tuberaceae, including Tuber, Dingleya and Reddellomyces. Rather, it has close affinity with the hypogeous (below the soil surface) genera of the Morchellaceae, including Fischerula, Imaia, and Leucangium, but both genetic and morphological characters are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as a distinct genus. All four hypogeous Morchellaceae genera produce huge spores, with sizes ranging from 32 to 100micrometers (μm). Both Kalapuya and Imaia have asci (spore-bearing cells) that have thick cell walls when young, but become thin when mature—a trait not shared with Fischerula. The authors explain that although the hypogeous Morchellaceae genera share the <b>trait</b> <b>of</b> large spore size, striking differences in spore structure and other morphological difference in microscopic characters would have ruled out placing them in the same family as Morchella, {{were it not for the}} convincing molecular evidence proving their relatedness.|$|E
