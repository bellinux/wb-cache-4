40|$|The {{responses}} of the field mouse Mus booduga to shifts in schedules of LD cycles were monitored {{and the results were}} interpreted {{with the help of a}} PRC constructed for the same species. The results reveal that, M. booduga reentrained faster with a lesser number of <b>transients</b> after delay shifts than advance shifts, thus exhibiting “asymmetry effect. ” A positive correlation was observed between the number of <b>transients</b> and the number of hours of shift. In most of the shifts, the sign of the <b>transients</b> (negative for delaying <b>transients</b> and positive for advancing <b>transients)</b> coincided with the direction of the shift. Interestingly, 11 and 12 h of advance shifting resulted in delaying <b>transients.</b> An 11 -h advance shift can also be interpreted as a 13 -h delay. Reentrainment through delaying <b>transients</b> is faster as compared to reentrainment through advancing <b>transients.</b> Thus, this animal might have taken a “shorter route,” as proved by the fact that an 11 -h advance shift has evoked delaying <b>transients.</b> But a 13 -h advance shift evoked only advancing <b>transients.</b> This prompts us to speculate that there may be a “phase jump” in M. booduga. Further, irrespective of whether L or D has been doubled in a 12 -h shift, both evoked only delaying <b>transients...</b>|$|R
40|$|Properties of {{spontaneous}} Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> in the myenteric microvasculature of the guinea-pig stomach were investigated. Specifically, we explored the spatio-temporal origin of Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> {{and the role}} of voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels (VDCCs) in their intercellular synchrony using fluorescence Ca²⁺ imaging and immunohistochemistry. The microvasculature generated spontaneous Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> that were independent of both Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and neural activity. Spontaneous Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> were highly synchronous along the length of microvasculature, and appeared to be initiated in pericytes and spread to arteriolar smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In most cases, the generation or synchrony of Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> was not affected by blockers of L-type VDCCs. In nifedipine-treated preparations, synchronous spontaneous Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> were readily blocked by Ni²⁺, mibefradil or ML 216, blockers for T-type VDCCs. These blockers also suppressed the known T-type VDCC dependent component of ICC Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> or slow waves. Spontaneous Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> were also suppressed by caffeine, tetracaine or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). After the blockade of both L- and T-type VDCCs, asynchronous Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> were generated in pericytes on precapillary arterioles and/or capillaries but not in arteriolar SMCs, and were abolished by CPA or nominally Ca²⁺ free solution. Together these data indicate that pericytes in the myenteric microvasculature may act as the origin of synchronous spontaneous Ca²⁺ <b>transients.</b> Pericyte Ca²⁺ <b>transients</b> arise from Ca²⁺ release from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum and the opening of T-type Ca²⁺ VDCCs is required for their synchrony and propagation to arteriolar SMCs...|$|R

40|$|Brief {{fluctuations}} in dopamine concentration (dopamine <b>transients)</b> {{play a key}} role in behavior towards rewards, including drugs of abuse. Drug-evoked dopamine <b>transients</b> may result from actions at both dopamine cell bodies and dopamine terminals. Inhibitory opsins can be targeted to dopamine neurons permitting their firing activity to be suppressed. However, as dopamine <b>transients</b> can become uncoupled from firing, it is unknown whether optogenetic hyperpolarization at the level of the soma is able to suppress dopamine <b>transients.</b> Here, we used in vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to record <b>transients</b> evoked by cocaine and raclopride in nucleus accumbens (NAc) of urethane-anesthetized rats. We targeted halorhodopsin (NpHR) specifically to dopamine cells by injecting Cre-inducible virus into ventral tegmental area (VTA) of transgenic rats that expressed Cre recombinase under control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter (TH-Cre+ rats). Consistent with previous work, co-administration of cocaine and raclopride led to the generation of dopamine <b>transients</b> in NAc shell. Illumination of VTA with laser strongly suppressed the frequency of <b>transients</b> in NpHR-expressing rats, but not in control rats. Laser did not have any effect on amplitude of <b>transients.</b> Thus, optogenetics can effectively reduce the occurrence of drug-evoked <b>transients</b> and is therefore a suitable approach for studying the functional role of such <b>transients</b> in drug-associated behavior.

40|$|Spontaneous calcium {{oscillations}} in mushroom {{bodies of}} late stage pupal and adult Drosophila brains have {{been implicated in}} memory consolidation during olfactory associative learning. This study explores the cellular mechanisms regulating calcium dynamics in Kenyon cells, principal neurons in mushroom bodies. Fura- 2 imaging shows that Kenyon cells cultured from late stage Drosophila pupae generate spontaneous calcium <b>transients</b> in a cell autonomous fashion, at a frequency similar to calcium oscillations in vivo (10 - 20 /h). The expression of calcium <b>transients</b> is up regulated during pupal development. Although the ability to generate <b>transients</b> is a property intrinsic to Kenyon cells, <b>transients</b> can be modulated by bath application of nicotine and GABA. Calcium <b>transients</b> are blocked, and baseline calcium levels reduced, by removal of external calcium, addition of cobalt, or addition of Plectreurys toxin (PLTX), an insect-specific calcium channel antagonist. <b>Transients</b> do not require calcium release from intracellular stores. Whole cell recordings reveal {{that the majority of}} voltage-gated calcium channels in Kenyon cells are PLTX-sensitive. Together these data show that influx of calcium through PLTX-sensitive voltage-gated calcium channels mediates spontaneous calcium <b>transients</b> and regulates basal calcium levels in cultured Kenyon cells. The data also suggest that these calcium <b>transients</b> represent cellular events underlying calcium oscillations in the intact mushroom bodies. However, spontaneous calcium <b>transients</b> are not unique to Kenyon cells as they are present in approximately 60 % of all cultured central brain neurons. This suggests the calcium <b>transients</b> play a more general role in maturation or function of adult brain neurons...|$|R

We measured EFS-evoked [Ca 2 +]i <b>transients</b> in isolated fura- 2 –loaded SCG cells from Fischer- 344 rats aged 6, 12, and 24 months with either the RyR antagonist ryanodine to block the contribution of CICR to [Ca 2 +]i <b>transients</b> or caffeine to sensitize CICR to EFS. EFS-evoked [Ca 2 +]i <b>transients</b> increased from 6 to 12 months and declined at 24 months and ryanodine decreased [Ca 2 +]i <b>transients</b> in SCG cells from 6 - and 12 -month-old animals only.

Odors produced large fluorescence <b>transients</b> in a subset of KC somata and in restricted regions of the calyx, the neuropil of the MB. In different KCs, odor-evoked fluorescence <b>transients</b> showed diverse changes with odor concentration: in some KCs, fluorescence <b>transients</b> were evoked by an odor at concentrations spanning several orders of magnitude, whereas in others only at a narrow concentration range.
