25|$|On May 12, 1994 at 4:30 pm, {{members of}} Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At {{this time the}} refinery’s {{management}} took over its operations Irving had argued that the refinery might have to shut down and had {{to bring in a}} bevy of rollbacks to the workers’ pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irvings’ demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> decline across North America.|$|E

However, Anthony and his uncles convinced him to continue playing basketball.|$|E
500|$|Part of {{creating}} the new identity for Warriors of Rock was by creating the game's Quest mode. Activision contacted Gene Simmons, who initially thought the company was asking for a KISS song {{to be included in}} the game. Instead, when Simmons learned they wanted him to be the narrator and the voice of the Demigod, he became very interested in the project feeling that the Demigod character had elements of his own stage personality in it. Activision also approached the members of Rush for inclusion of [...] "2112", and the group provided inspiration and feedback on the Rush-themed venues that [...] "2112" [...] is played in within the game. The developers also approached Dave Mustaine of Megadeth to write the music for the game's final boss battle. [...] The Quest mode also gave Activision the opportunity to explore the characters <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the series since its inception but otherwise only used as player avatar.

The trio teams up {{for the first time to}} help a local engineer named Emma, who is researching ancient technology in a nearby tomb and believes a remnant of the Demon Wars may be inside, but came across the monsters inside the tomb. Upon discovering the object, a deactivated robotic creature called a [...] "golem", the three adventurers escort Emma and their discovery back to Adlehyde to exhibit it at the town's Ruin Festival. [...] During the event, where several other golem creatures are on display, a small army of demons led by Belselk of the Quarter Knights proceed to burn the town, steal the golems, and mortally wound Cecilia's father, the king. In order to spare the remaining people of Adlehyde, Cecilia gives Belselk her family heirloom, a pendant called the Tear Drop that has magical properties which the demons believe can be used as a catalyst for reviving their leader. Gurdijeff: With the Tear Drop, it is possible. The demons, however, are trying to use it to revive their master, the Mother. (Wild Arms) [...] When the invaders recall from the town, Rudy and his friends make a pact to stop the Knights from taking control of Filgaia, and to restore balance to the weakening elemental forces of the world <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> decline since the demons' initial invasion.|$|E

2500|$|As pope, John Paul II wrote 14 papal encyclicals {{and taught}} about {{sexuality}} {{in what is}} referred as the [...] "Theology of the Body". Some key elements of his strategy to [...] "reposition the Catholic Church" [...] were encyclicals such as Ecclesia de Eucharistia, Reconciliatio et paenitentia and Redemptoris Mater. In his At {{the beginning of the}} new millennium (Novo Millennio Ineunte), he emphasised the importance of [...] "starting afresh from Christ": [...] "No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person." [...] In The Splendour of the Truth (Veritatis Splendor), he emphasised the dependence of man on God and His Law ("Without the Creator, the creature disappears") and the [...] "dependence of freedom on the truth". He warned that man [...] "giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself". In Fides et Ratio (On the Relationship between Faith and Reason) John Paul promoted a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit of truth in theological matters. Drawing on many different sources (such as Thomism), he described the mutually supporting relationship between faith and reason, and emphasised that theologians should focus on that relationship. John Paul II wrote extensively about workers and the social doctrine of the Church, which he discussed in three encyclicals: Laborem exercens, Sollicitudo rei socialis, and Centesimus annus. Through his encyclicals and many Apostolic Letters and Exhortations, John Paul II talked about the dignity of women and the importance of the family for the future of humanity. Other encyclicals include The Gospel of Life (Evangelium Vitae) and Ut Unum Sint (That They May Be One). Though critics accused him of inflexibility in explicitly re-asserting Catholic moral teachings against abortion and euthanasia <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> place for well over a thousand years, he urged a more nuanced view of capital punishment. In his second encyclical Dives in misericordia he stressed that divine mercy is the greatest feature of God, needed especially in modern times.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, after {{defeating}} an enemy, players {{must move}} to the corpse to retrieve any loot reward from it. [...] Because combat in Rohan {{is intended to be}} on horseback, and because it is incredibly inconvenient to swing the war-steed around just to loot a corpse, Riders of Rohan introduced the concept of Remote Looting. [...] Instead of having to travel back to a defeated enemy's corpse, loot rewards are automatically placed into the Remote Loot panel. [...] An alert is then displayed to the player which, when clicked, will open the Remote Loot panel. [...] This panel will hold a maximum of 50 items for 1 hour (in game time, not real time). [...] If any subsequent items are added before 1 hour has expired, the oldest items will be purged first. [...] If the player waits more than an hour, items <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Remote Loot for that hour will be purged. [...] Each item has its own timer. [...] Once the Remote Loot panel is opened, the player can opt to retrieve the loot or discard it. [...] Loot rewards discarded from the Remote Loot panel are irretrievable. [...] Players are not able to place items from their inventory back into Remote Loot. [...] Stacks of items will be placed into Remote Loot, but subsequent items of the same type will not stack with each other; they count as separate items. [...] For example, if a player is awarded 3 Athelas Potions, the whole stack of 3 will be placed into Remote Loot as 1 item. [...] If the player is later awarded 2 more Athelas Potions, the new stack of 2 will not stack onto the existing stack of 3. [...] The stack of 2 will occupy a separate item slot in Remote Loot, until the player retrieves the items. [...] The new looting rules were initially only implemented in Rohan, but due to positive player feedback were expanded {{to the rest of the}} game world in an update later that year.|$|E
