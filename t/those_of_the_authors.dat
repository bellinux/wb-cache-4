6000|$|Amazing to say, none {{of these}} [...] "more {{primitive}} phases of belief," [...] none of the recrudescent savage magic, was intruded by the late Ionian poets into the Iliad which they continued, by the theory. Such phases of belief were, indeed, by their time popular, and frequently appeared in the Cyclic poems on the Trojan war; continuations of the ILIAD, which were composed by Ionian authors {{at the same time}} as much of the ILIAD itself (by the theory) was composed. The authors of these Cyclic poems-- authors contemporary with the makers of much of the ILIAD-- were eminently [...] "un-Homeric" [...] in many respects. [Footnote: Cf. Monro, The Cyclic Poets; Odyssey, vol. ii, pp. 342-384.] They had ideas very different from <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> of the Iliad and ODYSSEY, as these ideas have reached us.|$|E

5000|$|One {{who turns}} {{for help to}} Neale Fairchild's 1928 study, a {{compendium}} of citations from romantic writings on the [...] "savage" [...] {{may be surprised to}} find book The Noble Savage almost completely lacking in references to its nominal subject. That is, although Fairchild assembles hundreds of quotations from ethnographers, philosophers, novelists, poets, and playwrights from the 17th century to the 19th century, showing a rich variety of ways in which writers romanticized and idealized those who Europeans considered [...] "savages", almost none of them explicitly refer to something called the [...] "Noble Savage". Although the words, always duly capitalized, appear on nearly every page, it turns out that in every instance, with four possible exceptions, they are Fairchild's words and not <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> cited.|$|E
5000|$|Chris de Freitas as {{an editor}} at Climate Research {{accepted}} the paper written by Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas, and {{it was published in}} that small refereed journal on 31 January 2003 under the title Proxy climatic and environmental changes of the past 1000 years. The article reviewed 240 previously published papers and tried to find evidence for temperature anomalies in the last thousand years such as the Medieval warm period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). The authors pointed out their disagreement with the Mann, Bradley and Hughes hockey stick studies; [...] "Our results suggest a different interpretation of the multiproxy climates compared to recent conclusions of Mann et al. (1998, 1999, 2000)." [...] Their abstract concluded that [...] "Across the world, many records reveal that the 20th century is probably not the warmest or a uniquely extreme climatic period of the last millennium". The paper acknowledged funding support from the American Petroleum Institute, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA, while stating that the views were <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> and were independent of the sponsoring agencies.|$|E

Kloor objected to the lack of independent responses to the paper, yet to be published at the time, from other scholars in the field. A second post on the study by Kloor detailed serious reservations by specialists on the collapse study leading to an assertion that Ahmed had made an [...] "uncritical appraisal". The story was reported internationally by other media outlets, but Ahmed's claims about NASA were officially rejected. In a statement, NASA commented that the collapse study [...] "was not solicited, directed or reviewed by NASA. It is an independent study by the university researchers utilizing research tools developed for a separate NASA activity.
