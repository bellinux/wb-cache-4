2500|$|In Britain, Australia and New Zealand {{the strongest}} {{euphonium}} players {{are most likely}} to find a position in a brass band, but even though they often play at world-class levels, the members of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>brass</b> bands are in most cases unpaid amateurs. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of brass bands in Britain (and the Commonwealth) ranging in standard from world class to local bands. Even The Salvation Army has strong ties to the brass band world, as this was a common and practical musical genre in the 1800's. [...] Almost all brass bands in Britain perform regularly, particularly during the summer months. A large number of bands also enter contests against other brass bands of a similar standard. Each band requires two euphoniums (principal and second) and consequently there are considerable opportunities for euphonium players.|$|E
2500|$|Internal BBC {{politics}} {{lies behind}} {{the decision to}} abruptly close Radio 4's FM news service last Saturday with so much still to report {{in the aftermath of}} the war. [...] It appears that a move by <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>brass</b> John Birt and Michael Checkland to appease senior radio executives, less than happy with the rolling news services that took away their Radio 4 FM frequency for the duration of the war. If the frequency immediately reverted to the regular Radio 4 service, it was argued, tempers would be calmed and the way smoothed to more reasoned discussions about whether the BBC should have a permanent radio news service. [...] Those who have become addicted hope that it will: audience research shows that it has attracted new listeners to Radio 4, although the BBC has a problem over what frequency it could allocated in the long term. [...] It can't be FM, due to become Radio 4's main frequency in September, but long-wave listening is diminishing among the BBC's target audience for such a service.|$|E
