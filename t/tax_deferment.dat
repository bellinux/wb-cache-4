40|$|This work {{argues that}} there has been a {{paradigm}} shift microirrigation from a simple water resource management system to a complex, knowledge intensive, management system that manipulates the chemical, physical and biological environment where the crop is grown. It discusses different developments in microirrigation technology in both developed and developing countries. It presents examples of successful applications of the technology well as possible consequences on its diffusion due to privatization, and <b>tax</b> <b>deferment</b> policies adopted by some countries. The remainder of the work reviews new developments in computer-based tools for microirrigation originating in several developed countries. These developments include: 1) automation using expert systems, real-time expert systems and conventional control techniques with low-cost sensors, 2) the use of simulation, and 3) the use of information delivery technologies and management tools based on CD-ROM and interactive multimedi...|$|E
40|$|The {{pensions}} industry's {{argument that}} the favourable tax treatment of occupational pension funds amounts to <b>tax</b> <b>deferment</b> rather than tax exemption is evaluated using a net present value approach to estimate {{the cost of the}} tax foregone in taxing employee pension contributions on a consumption tax basis rather than an income tax basis. It is shown that the net present value estimate and the Revenue Commissioners cash flow estimate are in close agreement if tax rates for workers and pensioners are the same and that the Revenue Commissioners estimate is conservative if tax rates for pensioners are lower than for workers. A comparison is made of the trend in the cost of tax expenditure on occupational pensions since 1980 relative to the trend in the cost of direct expenditure on social welfare pensions and it is shown that the cost of tax expenditure has grown from around 10 per cent in 1980 to 66 per cent in 1997 and that the Exchequer support for the average participant in an occupational scheme has risen from one quarter to more than one-and-a-half times Exchequer expenditure for the average participant in the social insurance scheme. The assumption, therefore, that pensions can be provided at less cost to the Exchequer through private financial institutions is questionable given existing pension tax arrangements. The distribution of the tax incentives provided for members of occupational pension schemes is evaluated and it is shown that most of the benefits accrue to those {{at the top of the}} income distribution. ...|$|E
40|$|Germany's old-age {{retirement}} system {{is based on}} three pillars: the statutory pension scheme, company pension schemes (CPS), and private retirement funds. The current government's coalition agreement expressly foresees a strengthening of CPS since its popularity has heavily stagnated in recent years. The intention is to optimize the fiscal and social insurance-related framework for CPS {{in an attempt to}} encourage its wider use. The present expert opinion is a contribution towards this effort. There is considerable potential for this especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and earners of low and very low incomes, since these groups are disproportionately under-represented when it comes to CPS takeup. In light of this, this opinion gives priority to these target groups. The study is structured as follows. First, a comprehensive literature review is provided and guided interviews with experts performed in order to identify obstacles to the continued spread of CPS among the target groups under review. Then, interviews are held with employers in the SME category as well as earners of low and very low incomes in order to verify the obstacles identified during the first step and consider any additional insights. On this basis, the authors consider which reforms may prove effective in addressing the identified obstacles. Here, as instructed, any potential reforms should endeavor not to create a financial burden on Germany’s tax and social insurance authorities. We then subject these reform ideas to an empirical review that involves interviews with SME tax advisers and again with earners of low and very low incomes. Having analyzed these interviews and discussing additional practical considerations, we explicitly recommend the implementation of selected reforms. In doing so, the authors propose the following two concrete recommendations. Recommendation 1 suggests introducing a mandatory employer contribution on top of deferred compensation that corresponds to the amount of social insurance contributions that are saved as a result, of which employees would be the obvious beneficiaries. This would result in an increase in employers' financial burden compared to the status quo. To compensate, a "CPS deduction" would be introduced as a tax incentive for small enter-prises that decide to introduce a CPS for their employees. This deduction would function similarly to the investment deduction option afforded under Section 7 g of the German Income Tax Act, resulting in a positive liquidity and <b>tax</b> <b>deferment</b> effect for small enterprises. Recommendation 2 aims at incentivizing employees to participate in a CPS. Two alternatives are offered. Either Germany's existing Riester subsidy system could be better integrated into CPS schemes by eliminating the duplication of contributions that exists under the status quo. Alternatively, a "CPS subsidy" could be introduced. This would involve granting a statutory subsidy to employers that contribute a certain minimum amount to the CPS on behalf of their employees. As a consequence, employees would be able to participate in a CPS without having to make a contribution of their own, which would have the desired effect especially for earners of low and very low incomes. In connection with Recommendation 2, the authors mention two additional aspects that ought to be implemented for the benefit of employees. One, a restriction should be placed {{on the extent to which}} CPS payments are set off against basic social security payments. Two, the acquisition costs of insurance-based CPS solutions should be spread across the entire term of the agreement, meaning that no commission fees can be retained that relate to contributions that haven't yet been made. Finally, the authors recommend two measures that serve to flexibilize and simplify the legal framework surrounding CPS: an increase in the tax- and social insurance contribution-exempt total outlay in the presence of insurance-based external funding and, related to this, a switch from an annualized to a lifetime- or length-of-service-based approach. Angesichts der demografischen Entwicklung setzt die Bundesregierung zur Schließung der drohenden Rentenlücke auch auf die betriebliche Altersversorgung (bAV). Dieses Gutachten entwickelt Empfehlungen an den Gesetzgeber zur Optimierung der steuer- und sozialversicherungsrechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen der bAV. Die Zielvorgabe lautet, die Verbreitung der bAV unter Gering- und Niedrigverdienern zu erhöhen und kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen als Arbeitgeber Anreize zu setzen, ihren Arbeitnehmern ein bAV-Angebot zu unterbreiten. Das Gutachten schafft einen umfassenden Überblick über bestehende Hemmnisse für diese beiden Zielgruppen, an der bAV zu partizipieren. Auf dieser Basis werden zehn Reformüberlegungen erarbeitet und auf ihre Wirkungen hin geprüft. Hieraus ergeben sich jeweils eine Handlungsempfehlung für die Arbeitgeber- und die Arbeitnehmerseite. Außerdem werden Ansatzpunkte für eine Vereinfachung der steuer- und sozialversicherungsrechtlichen Regelungen aufgezeigt. Die Analyse der Hemmnisse und die Kernelemente der Empfehlungen wurden durch Interviews mit Experten und mit Angehörigen der Zielgruppen empirisch abgesichert...|$|E
25|$|McDonnell (2006) shows a grave {{complication}} in Virginia's {{mobilization of}} troops was the conflicting interests of distinct social classes, which tended to undercut a unified {{commitment to the}} Patriot cause. The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, the middling yeomen (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used <b>deferments,</b> <b>taxes,</b> military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion {{of the state in}} 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.|$|R
2500|$|Public {{hearings}} of the Gomery Commission {{inquiry into}} the sponsorship scandal involving alleged kickbacks and [...] "donations" [...] from Quebec advertising agencies and corporations to Liberal Party operatives led to {{a drop in the}} Liberal Party's popularity. The security of the minority government came under fire as the Conservatives threatened to force an election by use of their [...] "opposition day," [...] when they get to set the Parliament's agenda. The Conservatives would use this time to hold a vote of no confidence in order to topple Martin's government. To avoid this, Martin removed all opposition days from the schedule and made a televised appearance on April 21, 2005, to attempt to gain support from the Canadian people to let the inquiry run its course before an election is called. In the rebuttal speeches by the opposition party leaders, Layton offered his party's support provided that they were given major concessions in the budget such as canceling the proposed corporate tax cuts. Days later, the Liberals took the NDP up on their offer and negotiated <b>tax</b> cut <b>deferments</b> and new spending initiatives. Among the new commitments was aid for Sudan, which Sudan's officials turned down as Martin did not consult them about it beforehand. This aid was attacked as a perceived attempt to win the vote of a single independent MP, former Liberal David Kilgour. Kilgour nevertheless would vote against the government.|$|R
