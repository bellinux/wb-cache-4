5|$|The {{first house}} on the site was built as a hunting lodge in 1717 for the Duke of Schomberg, a British army {{commander}} of German origin.

5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even took it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, {{of course he had}} to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|Ralph {{ultimately}} {{crosses the}} line when, in a cocaine-induced rage, {{he gets into}} a confrontation with girlfriend Tracee and beats her to death.

Bad blood temporarily surfaces between the two but is shortly resolved after Gigi Cestone dies of an aneurysm, thereby forcing Tony to reluctantly promote Ralph to capo.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the race}} was {{abandoned}} after twelve total laps, it did not reach official status; IndyCar does not consider a race official unless it reaches the halfway mark. As such, no points were awarded and the series championship went to Franchitti by default. If the race had continued and reached official status, Franchitti {{would have been the}} series champion anyway as he had avoided the accident. Power's car, meanwhile, was heavily damaged in the lap 11 crash <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{would not have been able}} to continue racing.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} from football Young had many different jobs, including removals, managing a sports shop, delivering milk, {{working in a}} supermarket, and selling insurance. In his spare time he maintained his fitness by playing badminton, and after winning local tournaments, played the sport for Cheshire. During much of this period he struggled financially, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had to sell the family home and move in with his mother. Deeply depressed {{at this point in}} his life, at one point he attempted suicide. From the mid-1990s Young coached school football teams in the area around his Cheshire home.|$|E
5|$|After the Indonesian film {{industry}} crashed in 1992 Umboh directed two television serials: Pahlawan Tak Dikenal (Unknown Hero; 1994) and Apsari. The crash, {{along with his}} long illness, led his finances to destabilise, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> lived in government housing. In 1994 Suara Pembaharuan (now Suara Pembaruan), inaccurately reported him having died, a claim which Umboh publicly refuted. Umboh died at 4:45am WIB (UTC+7) on 24January 1996 in Jakarta of complications from diabetes and a stroke. He was buried in Jeruk Purut Cemetery, South Jakarta. Three weeks before his death, he was reportedly in good health and preparing to film a new serial entitled Gejolak Kampus Muda (Symptoms of a Youth Campus).|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired {{to his home in}} Kensington, west London. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and {{in the last few weeks}} of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> could not get out of bed. Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E

There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able {{to take control of the}} system, and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the circle}} around the prince, however, Gaveston also became {{entangled}} in conflicts between the King and his son. These difficulties first materialised in a dispute between treasurer Walter Langton and Prince Edward. The case enraged King Edward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> banned his son from court, and banished several men from the prince's household. Though the two were reconciled at a later point, the King still prevented Gaveston from rejoining the prince. This matter was settled before 26 May 1306, however, the date when Gaveston was knighted, {{four days after the}} prince. Later that year Gaveston was once more in trouble, when he and twenty-one other knights deserted a Scottish campaign to attend a tournament. An arrest order was sent out for the deserters, but, at the insistence of Queen Margaret, they were all pardoned in January 1307.|$|E
5|$|In December 1988, the Ramones {{recorded}} {{material for}} their eleventh studio album, Brain Drain; co-produced by Beauvoir, Rey, and Bill Laswell. However, the bass parts were done by Daniel Rey and the Dictators' Andy Shernoff.

5|$|Nicholas Edmund Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 12th Earl of Shaftesbury (born 3 June 1979), {{a former}} DJ and house music {{promoter}} in New York and Privilege in Ibiza, Spain. A short time following his brother's death, Nicholas relocated {{to the family}} seat at Wimborne St Giles, returned to business school {{for a couple of}} years, and assumed the responsibilities of the earldom. He has shown an interest in supporting charitable organisations, primarily those addressing the needs of children with disabilities. In December 2009, Nicholas suffered serious spinal injuries in a horse riding accident. He crushed his vertebrae in the fall. While he experienced initial paralysis necessitating the use of a wheelchair, physical therapy has helped restore his health <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is able to walk, with limitations. With continued rehabilitation, doctors expect a full recovery.|$|E
5|$|Pohl's {{tenure as}} fleet {{commander}} was brief; by January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{was no longer}} able to carry out his duties.

Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5 to 7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. Kaiserin was also present during an advance to the Amrun Bank on 2 to 3 April. The fleet conducted another sortie on 21 to 22 April.|$|E

5|$|Several {{survivors}} from Heliopolis {{are brought}} {{on board the}} Archangel and Kira defends them from enemy attacks until they arrive in Alaska on Earth. Kira has strong reservations against fighting, fearing he may confront Athrun and that he may kill a person. After manipulation by Flay Allster, Kira gradually becomes more aggressive when defending the Archangel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> could kill a person without hesitation. During one of the Archangel's battles against ZAFT, the Strike suffers multiple damages by Athrun and Kira is declared missing in action. He is found alive but injured by Reverend Malchio, who transports him to a space colony known as PLANT where most coordinators reside and is ZAFT's homebase. There, his wounds are treated by Lacus Clyne, a Coordinator who befriended Kira when she was taken aboard the Archangel and {{was used as a}} hostage.|$|E
5|$|Warhol {{subsequently}} {{produced a}} wide variety of art works depicting Campbell's Soup cans during three distinct phases of his career, and he produced other works using a variety of images from the world of commerce and mass media. Today, the Campbell's Soup cans theme is generally used in reference to the original set of paintings as well as the later Warhol drawings and paintings depicting Campbell's Soup cans. Because of the eventual popularity of the entire series of similarly themed works, Warhol's reputation grew <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was not only the most-renowned American pop art artist, but also the highest-priced living American artist.|$|E
5|$|When Terra's {{character}} was first revealed, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish found {{him to be}} very similar to Zack Fair from Final Fantasy VII <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wondered whether he would actually be Zack. However, when considering Terra's weapon being a Keyblade in contrast to all the other Final Fantasy characters shown in previous Kingdom Hearts games, he thought he may not be Zack. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central found there have been various speculations regarding the similarities between Terra and Zack, but thought it would not be strange considering the existence of Nobodies in the series. Selecting Terra for a demo of Birth by Sleep IGN's Ryan Clements agreed with Parish, finding only minor differences between their outfits.|$|E
