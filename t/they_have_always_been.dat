This {{creature}} is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> male.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{indigenous}} {{group in}} the state are the Zapotecs at about 350,000 people or about 31% of the total indigenous population. The Zapotec have an extremely long history in the Central Valleys region and unlike other indigenous groups, {{do not have a}} migration story. For them, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> here. Zapotecs have always called themselves Be'ena'a, which means The People. Zapotec territory extends in and around the Central Valleys region of the state, around the capital city of Oaxaca. The Zapotec language has historically been and is still the most widely spoken in the state, with four dialects that correspond to the four subdivisions of these people: Central Valleys and Isthmus, the Sierra de Ixtlan, Villa Alta and Coapan. Zapotec communities can be found in 67 municipalities. The various Zapotec dialects account for 64 of the total 173 still surviving forms of Oto-Manguean.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} {{paneling}} generally, there were, {{during the last}} fifty years of the period now under review, three styles of design followed by most European carvers, each of which attained great notoriety. Firstly, a developed form of small Panelling. tracery which was very common in France and the Netherlands. A square-headed panel would be filled in with small detail of flamboyant character, the perpendicular line or mullion being always subordinate, as in the German chasse (Muse Cluny), and in some cases absent, as the screen work of Évreux cathedral shows us. Secondly, the linenfold design. The great majority of examples are of a very conventional form, but at Bere Regis, Dorsetshire, the designs with tassels, and at St Sauvur, Caen, those with fringe work, readily justify the universal title applied to this very decorative treatment of large surfaces. At the beginning of the 16th century yet another pattern became the fashion. The main lines of the design consisted of flat hollow mouldings sometimes in the form of interlacing circles (Gatton, Surrey), at other times chiefly straight (Rochester cathedral), and the intervening spaces would be filled in with cusps or sprigs of foliage. It marks the last struggle of this great school of design to withstand the oncoming flood of the new art, the great Renaissance. From this time onward Gothic work, in spite of various attempts, has never again taken a place in domestic decoration. The lines of the tracery style, the pinnacle, and the crocket unequaled as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> in devotional expression are universally considered unsuited for decoration in the ordinary house.|$|E

500|$|By early 1980, The Cockroaches {{began writing}} their own music {{as well as}} {{covering}} various 1960s rock 'n' roll artists, especially The Rolling Stones. In July 1980, they issued their debut single, [...] "I Want a Leather Jacket", on the Refugee Records label. The song was written by Paul, was produced by Greg Owens and the band, and was recorded at their school and at Studio B in Bondi. According to Australian musicologist, Glenn A. Baker, the track provided [...] "the aura of a rockabilly band... <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> much closer in style to the original cocky, bluesy, strident Stones". When they recorded their second single, [...] "Bingo Bango" [...] in June 1981, Hatfield {{had been replaced by}} Geoff O'Reagan on bass guitar. This song was written by John and Anthony, was produced by Owens and was recorded at Wirra-Willa Studios. By August of that year Jeff Fatt had joined on keyboards and Phil Robinson became their bass guitarist. According to Anthony, Fatt {{had been a member of}} [...] "a seminal Sydney rockabilly band called the Roadmasters", and had joined [...] "to fight boredom". They had hired Fatt and his brother to manage their sound system during gigs. Anthony declared this began [...] "a beautiful three-decade relationship that has made him a very wealthy man". Their early road manager was Graham Kennedy, former guitarist-vocalist for the hard rock band, Finch.|$|E

2500|$|In English cricket {{since the}} first half of the 18th century, various ad hoc teams have been formed for {{short-term}} purposes which have been called England (or sometimes [...] "All-England"; i.e., in the sense of [...] "the rest of England") to play against, say, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) or an individual county team. The key factor is that they were non-international and there is a significant difference between them and the official England cricket team which takes part in international fixtures. Conceptually, there is evidence of this sort of team being formed, or at least mooted, since the 1730s. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> [...] "occasional elevens" [...] but, nevertheless, have invariably been strong sides.

So Zack and Miri Make a Porno, {{in spite of its}} sometimes tiresome, sometimes amusing lewdness, follows a gee-whiz romantic-comedy formula that would not be out of place on the Disney Channel. Two best friends who have always been in love with each other discover that ... <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> in love with each other. Granted, this revelation occurs while they are having sex in front of a camera, but it is so sweet and predictable that these potentially tawdry circumstances hardly matter.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{most other}} brass {{instruments}} in an orchestral setting, the trombone {{is not usually}} considered a transposing instrument. [...] Prior to the invention of valve systems, most brass instruments were limited to playing one overtone series at a time; altering the pitch of the instrument required manually replacing a section of tubing (called a [...] "crook") or picking up an instrument of different length. Their parts were transposed according to which crook or length-of-instrument they used at any given time, so that a particular note on the staff always corresponded to a particular partial on the instrument. [...] Trombones, on the other hand, have used slides since their inception. [...] As such, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> fully chromatic, so no such tradition took hold, and trombone parts have always been notated at concert pitch (with one exception, discussed below). Also, it was quite common for trombones to double choir parts; reading in concert pitch meant {{there was no need}} for dedicated trombone parts.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the {{abortion}} rate was affected little by the 1936 decrees, {{although it was}} observed that the rate of infant mortality rose between 1935 and 1940 due to apparently women injuring themselves in illegal abortions that then prevented them from producing healthy children.
