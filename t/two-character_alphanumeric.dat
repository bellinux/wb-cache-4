[...] 01 PERSON-DATA RENAMES PERSON-REC.The second way {{to define}} a union type is by using the REDEFINES keyword. In the example code below, data item VERS-NUM {{is defined as a}} 2-byte binary integer {{containing}} a version number. A second data item VERS-BYTES is defined as a <b>two-character</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> variable. Since the second item is redefined over the first item, the two items share the same address in memory, and therefore share the same underlying data bytes. The first item interprets the two data bytes as a binary value, while the second item interprets the bytes as character values.|$|E
5000|$|Geschwaders, {{other than}} day fighters, {{during the war}} usually bore a four-character {{identification}} code, starting with a <b>two-character</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> [...] (a code unique to each Geschwader) {{to the left of}} the national Balkenkreuz marking and two letters to the right, signifying the individual aircraft's letter within its Staffel as the third letter and the Staffel-designating letter within the Geschwader as the fourth and last letter. The full four-character code was usually shown on the fuselage sides, sometimes with the individual aircraft letter repeated under the wings. Gruppe and Staffel-sized units could also have their own unique codes of this type, most often used for reconnaissance and maritime aviation groups and Wekusta weather observation squadrons, with Staffel sized units using the four-character alphanumeric code almost always using an [...] "H" [...] as the fourth and last character. Late in the war, the first two characters of the Geschwaderkennung code (designating the geschwader) were depicted on the fuselage sides in a much reduced size, possibly as a [...] "low-visibility" [...] security measure. The code tended (though not always), to be omitted altogether by 1945.|$|E
