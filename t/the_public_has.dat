Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{breakdown}} {{is employed}} in environmental analysis of total economic value. Both {{costs and benefits}} can be diverse.

The guiding principle of evaluating benefits is to list all (categories of) parties affected by an intervention and add the (positive or negative) value, usually monetary, that they ascribe to its effect on their welfare.|$|E
