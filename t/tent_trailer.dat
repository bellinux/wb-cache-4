Zach then pursues Vicky at other campgrounds across the country. Vicky is flattered by Zach's interest, and intrigued as well as discomfited by his cynical attitude. Vicky's younger sister Suzy and older brother John both heartily dislike him, and {{think that he is}} dangerous for her. Vicky's father, Dr. Wallace Austin, deduces that Zachary has a history of rheumatic fever that damaged his heart. Several times, Dr. Austin orders Zach to avoid strenuous exercise as he accompanies Vicky {{and her family}} in their sightseeing. Eventually Zach goes missing one evening in a game of hide and seek.
