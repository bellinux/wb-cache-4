5|$|Anup Rubens was {{selected}} to compose the film's music and background score in mid March 2013 marking his second collaboration with both Kumar and Chaitanya after Ishq (2012) and Autonagar Surya (2014) respectively. Kumar read the script to Rubens without revealing the film's cast. After Rubens accepted {{a role in the}} film, both met Nagarjuna. Rubens {{said in an interview that}} he worked for fewer days when compared to his previous works and added that Kumar had a small story to tell within every song in the film. Due to Nageswara Rao's death, a song's tune was replaced with another <b>tune</b> <b>and</b> a few lines of the song Nenu Puttanu from the film Prem Nagar (1971).|$|E

Later, the Simpsons visit a jazz club to hear Bleeding Gums Murphy sing a blues number written by Lisa.|$|E
40|$|A {{tenet of}} {{cochlear}} physiology is that sharp <b>tuning</b> <b>and</b> sensitivity are directly interrelated. Here we show a reciprocal interdependence between <b>tuning</b> <b>and</b> sensitivity in the mammalian cochlea from measurements of basilar membrane (BM) mechanical <b>tuning</b> <b>and</b> neural Suppression <b>tuning</b> curves of wild-type (Tectb(+/+)) and beta-tectorin mutant (Tectb(-/-)) mice. The tectorial membrane (TM) of the mutants lacks striated-sheet matrix, {{which is likely}} to decrease longitudinal elastic coupling. Mechanical <b>and</b> neural <b>tuning</b> curves recorded in mutants are slightly less sensitive, although more sharply tuned. The inverse relationship between sensitivity <b>and</b> <b>tuning</b> observed in the mutants Could be attributed to smaller numbers of the outer hair cells responding in synchrony due to reduced longitudinal coupling in the TM. We suggest that frequency <b>tuning</b> <b>and</b> high sensitivity are not necessarily concomitant but reciprocal properties of the cochlea...|$|R

5|$|The {{song was}} a primary {{theme of the}} film score for The Boy with Green Hair (1948), for which the {{original}} version was used. The producers of the film reportedly paid $10,000 to ahbez for using the song, which was cumulatively more than what {{the author of the}} story, Betsy Beaton, was paid. A recording by Kate Ceberano was featured in the film The Crossing (1990). The <b>tune</b> <b>and</b> lyrics feature prominently in the film Untamed Heart (1993), for which Cole's version was used during the closing credits, while a piano version by Roger Williams served as the opener for the film. The song was also played in intermediate scenes featuring the principal cast.|$|E

5|$|Bach was in {{his second}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, where the feast was the only {{occasion}} during Lent when festive music was permitted. The theme of the hymn suits both the Annunciation and Palm Sunday, in a spirit of longing expectation of an arrival. An unknown poet retained, as in the other chorale cantatas of Bach's second cantata cycle, the hymn's first and last stanza unchanged, but paraphrased the themes of the inner stanzas to a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes da caccia, two solo violins, strings and continuo. All instruments play in the opening festive chorale fantasia, while the soprano carries the hymn <b>tune</b> <b>and</b> the lower voices answer in counterpoint of instrumental motifs. An oboe da caccia accents the first aria, the solo violins and strings return in the second aria, and an independent horn part crowns the closing chorale.|$|E
5|$|Forsythe Racing {{teammates}} Tagliani and Carpentier rounded {{out the top}} ten qualifiers; Carpentier was {{hampered by}} an electrical problem which overheated his engine {{and was unable to}} improve his time when his blowoff valve opened {{between the first and second}} turns. Adrián Fernández was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best lap time was more than two-tenths of a second slower than Bräck. Fittipaldi's car developed a large amount of oversteer and reduced his pace in turn four and he took 12th. Jimmy Vasser and Oriol Servià took the 13th and 14th positions; Servià's car had oversteer after his first timed lap and drove into the pit lane where his crew made adjustments allowing him to drive faster for his second attempt. Nakano, 15th, had a large amount of understeer which slowed him in turn four. Dixon moved from his back-up car to his primary vehicle for qualifying and took 16th. Manning worked on his race setup but gearbox issues before the session prevented his team from focusing on a qualifying <b>tune</b> <b>and</b> he qualified in 17th. Mario Domínguez and Jourdain completed the qualifiers; Jourdain reduced his speed through the third and fourth turns after he oversteered and his slower pace prevented him from spinning.|$|E
5|$|The 1999 final saw Australia face France at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Two tries by Owen Finegan and Ben <b>Tune,</b> <b>and</b> seven {{penalties}} by Matt Burke {{contributed to}} Australia's 35–12 win, as {{they became the}} first nation to win the Rugby World Cup twice. Australia also became the first side to contest successive finals when they faced England in the 2003 final at the Telstra Stadium in Sydney. The hosts opened the scoring in the sixth minute through a Lote Tuqiri try. England responded and scored three penalties by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson and a try by winger Jason Robinson to achieve a 14–5 lead at half-time. Three penalties from Elton Flatley {{in the second half}} allowed Australia to level the score and send the final into extra time. Wilkinson and Flatley scored a penalty apiece before the former scored a drop goal in the last minute of the match to give England a 20–17 victory. They became the first side from the Northern hemisphere to win the tournament.|$|E
