5|$|Responses to {{the ruling}} were divided with a {{significant}} number of commentators focusing upon the erosion of Miranda, and others commenting upon the impact of the case on terrorism suspect interviews—a topic where Congress had recently attempted <b>to</b> <b>legislate.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{referendum}} of the Scottish electorate, held on 11 September 1997, {{approved the}} establishment of a directly elected Scottish Parliament <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> on most domestic affairs. Following this, the Scottish Office, led by the then Secretary of State for Scotland, Donald Dewar, decided that a new purpose-built facility would be constructed in Edinburgh, to house the Scottish Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The Archbishop of Brisbane, Mark Coleridge, also {{intervened in}} the {{referendum}} debate {{to argue that}} same-sex marriage would be equivalent <b>to</b> <b>legislating</b> for incest.|$|R

50|$|In 1948, Procter {{was named}} to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. He retired from the bench in 1961 due <b>to</b> <b>legislated</b> {{mandatory}} retirement at age 75. Procter died in Regina three years later following a lengthy illness.|$|R
5|$|Anniversary of the 1967 {{referendum}}, 27 May – The {{anniversary of}} the 1967 referendum to amend the federal constitution has also been suggested. The amendments enabled the federal parliament <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> with regard to Indigenous Australians and allowed for Indigenous Australians {{to be included in}} the national census. The public vote in favour was 90.77%.|$|E
5|$|After its {{ratification}} of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> Black Codes. The Black Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable behaviors for anyone {{with more than one}} black great-grandparent. Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights. Restrictions on black land ownership threatened to make economic subservience permanent.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
50|$|Levels of {{indebtedness}} {{are high}} and appear to be increasing. The problem of over-indebtedness is made worse by high levels of consumption finance and consumer ignorance and illiteracy. (32 per cent {{of the adult population}} of South Africa were functionally illiterate in 2001.) By allowing the micro-lending industry <b>to</b> function without <b>legislated</b> and enforced interest-rate limits since 1992, the Government effectively made possible the exploitation of the ignorance of lower-income communities, which arguably amounted <b>to</b> <b>legislated</b> economic abuse.|$|R
50|$|As the {{campaign}} moved on, Nunn made her father a focal point, staging joint appearances {{with him at}} military bases and saying that she would emulate his bipartisan approach <b>to</b> <b>legislating.</b> She has also {{said that she would}} seek a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee that he once chaired.|$|R

5|$|In May 2003, the government's attempt <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> Article 23 (National Security) of the Basic Law aroused strong {{suspicion}} among Hong Kong citizens. This Article would grant Hong Kong's police force {{right of access}} to private property on grounds of 'safeguarding national security', but without court warrants. Coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003. This demonstration hastened the resignations of two government ministers and, eventually, that of Tung on 10 March 2005.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia, Adams {{promoted}} colonial unity {{while using}} his political skills to lobby other delegates. On September 16, messenger Paul Revere brought Congress the Suffolk Resolves, {{one of many}} resolutions passed in Massachusetts that promised strident resistance to the Coercive Acts. Congress endorsed the Suffolk Resolves, issued a Declaration of Rights that denied Parliament's right <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> for the colonies, and organized a colonial boycott known as the Continental Association.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E
50|$|She applies {{a pragmatic}} {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>legislating,</b> using managerial skills {{that she has}} developed in the private sector, where her studies in marketing led her to launch the i-Latina advertising agency to oversee all marketing campaigns for Mexico’s Grupo Salinas, which operates in 10 countries throughout the world with 80,000 employees. She has also started an advertising company called Promo Espacio.|$|R
50|$|In the European Union {{legislation}} {{was passed in}} 2010 {{in the form of}} directive 2010/45/EU to facilitate the growth of Electronic Invoicing across all its member states. This legislation caters for varying VAT and inter-country invoicing requirements within the EU, in addition <b>to</b> <b>legislating</b> for the authenticity and integrity of invoices being sent electronically. It is estimated that in 2011 alone roughly 5 million EU businesses will have sent Electronic Invoices.|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, Øverland and Riksmålsforbundet {{published}} the so-called [...] "blue list" [...] that recommended more conservative orthography and forms {{than most of}} the 1938 reforms. This book established {{for the first time a}} real alternative standard in riksmål <b>to</b> <b>legislated</b> bokmål. It set the standard for two of the capital's main daily newspapers, Aftenposten and Morgenbladet. It also contributed to the reversal of the [...] "Oslo decision" [...] in 1954.|$|R
5|$|Australia Acts commencement, 3 March – The {{anniversary of}} the Australia Acts coming into force has been raised as an option, having been {{referred}} to as Australian Independence Day. These Acts removed the United Kingdom's ability <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> for the Australian States, the Queen's ability to disallow or suspend State legislation, as well as severing the remaining appeal channels from the State Supreme Courts and the High Court of Australia to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Queen Elizabeth II signed a proclamation at Government House in Canberra on 2 March 1986 for the Acts to take effect 5.00am Greenwich Mean Time the next day.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as a judge, Hand became politically {{active in the}} cause of New Nationalism. With reservations, in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt's return to national politics. He approved of the former president's plans <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> on behalf of the underprivileged and to control corporations, as well as of his campaign against the abuse of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt's views on these subjects, both in person and in print, and wrote articles for Roosevelt's magazine, The Outlook. His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 while {{teaching}} {{political science and}} serving as dean of students at Willamette, Hatfield began his political career by winning election to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Republican. He defeated six others for the seat {{at a time when}} state assembly elections were still determined by county-wide votes. He served for two terms representing Marion County and Salem in the lower chamber of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. At the time he was the youngest legislator in Oregon and still lived at his parents' home. Hatfield would teach early-morning classes and then walk {{across the street to the}} Capitol <b>to</b> <b>legislate.</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} small and medium-sized enterprise Human Resource (HR) practitioners’ knowledge pertaining <b>to</b> <b>legislated</b> employment rights at the workplace as laid down by the Employment Act (EA) 1955. The EA provides a variety of individual employment rights covering protections of wages, statutory right to the general standard of working time, statutory right to rest day, public holidays, annual leave and sick leave, statutory right to employment security as well as female employee’s statutory right to paid maternity leave. The study also aims to determine whether HR practitioners’ level of knowledge concerning legislated employment rights differed significantly between age groups, years of experience, level of education and size of company. It also examined {{the nature of the}} relationship between the HR practitioners’ level of basic knowledge concerning legislated employment rights and their level of concern in making legally sound decisions in their administrative practice. In addition, it identified whether the HR practitioners’ level of basic knowledge pertaining <b>to</b> <b>legislated</b> employment rights correlate significantly with the size of the company where they are employed...|$|R

5|$|One {{major issue}} is the West Lothian question, in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote on {{legislation}} affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> on devolved matters. This when placed {{in the context of}} England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and free top-up university fees, has led to a steady rise in English nationalism. Some have suggested the creation of a devolved English parliament, while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.|$|E
5|$|Reserved {{matters are}} {{subjects}} that {{are outside the}} legislative competence of the Scotland Parliament. The Scottish Parliament is unable <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> on such issues that are reserved to, and dealt with at, Westminster (and where Ministerial functions usually lie with UK Government ministers). These include broadcasting policy, civil service, common markets for UK goods and services, constitution, electricity, coal, oil, gas, nuclear energy, defence and national security, drug policy, employment, foreign policy and relations with Europe, most aspects of transport safety and regulation, National Lottery, protection of borders, most aspects of social security and stability of UK's fiscal, economic and monetary system.|$|E
5|$|The American Medical Association (AMA) {{opposed the}} act because the tax was imposed on {{physicians}} prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing; instead of enacting the Marihuana Tax Act the AMA proposed cannabis {{be added to}} the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. This approach was unappealing to some legislators who feared that adding a new substance to the Harrison Act would subject that act to new legal scrutiny. Since the federal government had no authority under the 10th Amendment to regulate medicines, that power being reserved by individual states in 1937, a tax was the only viable way <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> marijuana.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his first}} months in Congress, Walsh {{emerged as a}} sharp critic of the Obama Administration, accusing the {{president}} of abandoning the U.S.-Israel alliance and bankrupting the country. He also challenged President Barack Obama to secure the borders with [...] "moats and alligators" [...] if necessary. Walsh maintained a no-compromise approach <b>to</b> <b>legislating</b> that included rejecting any tax increases. He consistently voted against raising the federal debt ceiling and authored {{a balanced budget amendment}} to the United States Constitution.|$|R
5000|$|Senator Polley {{is against}} {{voluntary}} euthanasia. She has stated her objection to voluntary euthanasia {{from a public}} policy perspective, arguing that the risks are too great when it comes <b>to</b> <b>legislating</b> for such a reform. [...] "…From a policy perspective, such proposed legislation {{will never be able}} to guarantee that a human life will not be prematurely ended due to abuse or flaws within such a legislative framework or the social and medical ramifications of such laws".|$|R
5|$|The Everglades Forever Act, {{introduced}} by Governor Lawton Chiles in 1994, {{was an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> the lowering of phosphorus in Everglades waterways. The act put the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in charge of testing and enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down from 500ppb in the 1980s). The SFWMD built Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) near sugarcane fields where water leaving the EAA flows into ponds lined with lime rock and layers of peat and calcareous periphyton. Testing has shown this method {{to be more effective}} than previously anticipated, bringing levels from 80ppb to 10ppb.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and {{autonomous}} communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although {{the effect was}} mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> marriage.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three hundred years, Scotland was {{directly}} governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom, both seated at Westminster, {{and the lack of}} a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity. Suggestions for a 'devolved' Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War. A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution. One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom. Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly <b>to</b> <b>legislate</b> for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.|$|E
5000|$|Preston {{believes}} that Gil-Robles {{was essentially a}} legalist fascist, whose policy of accidentalism would give way <b>to</b> <b>legislating</b> for a fascist dictatorship when he was confident that the populace was controllable. His evidence references Gil Robles' speeches, which were often filled with [...] "anti-democratic and anti-Semitic innuendo", the oppressive, anti-reformist nature of his government partnership with Alejandro Lerroux's Radicals, and the frank admiration offered to foreign fascist regimes by both his propaganda and by his press organ, El Debate.|$|R
