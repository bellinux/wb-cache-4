5000|$|In one of MacDonald's first books, Christianizing Homer: The Odyssey, Plato, and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew, he posited {{the theory}} that <b>the</b> non-canonical <b>Acts</b> of Andrew was a Christian retelling of Homer's Iliad.

That the order of events in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> follows those found in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew, that certain events in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> are better understood when understood in context of the Homeric epics, and that the Homeric texts commonly were available during the first century AD.

5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative.

Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that <b>the</b> <b>act</b> of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and <b>the</b> <b>act</b> of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E

The penultimate chapter analyses the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of John and the book concludes with a close study of the important Armenian translation.
