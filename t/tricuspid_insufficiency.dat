50|$|Minor <b>tricuspid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{is common}} in healthy individuals.

Follow up examination revealed improvement of liver function, reduced peripheral edema and improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. The reduction of the atrial size and repair of the tricuspid valve resulted in a restoration of the conduit and reservoir function of the right atrium.

50|$|Other typical {{signs of}} {{pulmonary}} hypertension include an accentuated pulmonary {{component of the}} second heart sound, a right ventricular third heart sound, and parasternal heave indicating a hypertrophied right atrium.

Evidence of <b>tricuspid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and pulmonic regurgitation is also sought and, if present, {{is consistent with the}} presence of pulmonary hypertension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tricuspid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{may lead}} to the {{presence}} of a pansystolic heart murmur. Such a murmur is usually of low frequency and best heard low on the lower left sternal border. As with most right-sided phenomena, it tends to increase with inspiration, and decrease with expiration.

30|$|We are {{presented}} with a 73 -year-old patient with previous arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic bronchitis who is admitted in the ICU for septic shock secondary to anastomotic rupture in the postoperative of a colon disease. Thirty-two days later, he is extubated without vasoactive drugs. On the 35 th day he started having respiratory problems, fever and hypotension, needing intubation and vasoactive drugs. After a subclavian access, we suspected {{it to be a}} left pneumothorax. In the X-rays, both hemithorax bases were observed with an augment of density, mostly in the right lung. A Lung ultrasound was done in the parasternal line of the right lung and we observed pleural sliding with B lines pattern. It was not present in the left lung and {{we were not able to}} do the echocardiography because of window absence. TC confirmed the presence of anterior pneumothorax, and a thorax tube was inserted. The clinical situation did not improve. ECG demonstrated a new Q wave in the septal face and negative T in the lateral face. An echocardiography was done and moderate biventricular dysfunction, left ventricle dilated with dyskinetic movement were observed. We also noticed pericardial effusion with a dubious tamponade of the right ventricle, nonetheless this was dismissed because this collapse movement occurred in systole. There were mitral and <b>tricuspid</b> <b>insufficiencies.</b> The cava vein was dilated without variability. At a later time, another lung ultrasound was done where pleural sliding was observed in both hemithorax, with a B line pattern at the parasternal line. Pleural effusion and heterogenic consolidation were noticed at the decline parts of both lungs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{papillary}} muscles {{attach the}} mitral valve (the valve between the left atrium {{and the left}} ventricle) and the tricuspid valve (the valve between the right atrium and the right ventricle) {{to the wall of}} the heart. If the papillary muscles are not functioning properly, the mitral valve may leak during contraction of the left ventricle. This causes some of the blood to travel [...] "in reverse", from the left ventricle to the left atrium, instead of forward to the aorta {{and the rest of the}} body. This leaking of blood to the left atrium is known as mitral regurgitation. Similarly, the leaking of blood from the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve and into the right atrium can also occur, and this is described as <b>tricuspid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> or tricuspid regurgitation.|$|E
50|$|Regurgitation {{occurs when}} a valve becomes {{insufficient}} and malfunctions, allowing some blood to flow in the wrong direction. This insufficiency can affect any of the valves as in aortic insufficiency, mitral insufficiency, pulmonary insufficiency and <b>tricuspid</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> The other form of valvular heart disease is stenosis, a narrowing of the valve. This {{is a result of}} the valve becoming thickened and any of the heart valves can be affected, as in mitral valve stenosis, tricuspid valve stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis and aortic valve stenosis. Stenosis of the mitral valve is a common complication of rheumatic fever. Inflammation of the valves can be caused by infective endocarditis , usually a bacterial infection but can sometimes be caused by other organisms. Bacteria can more readily attach to damaged valves. Another type of endocarditis which doesn't provoke an inflammatory response, is nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. This is commonly found on previously undamaged valves. A major valvular heart disease is mitral valve prolapse, which is a weakening of connective tissue called myxomatous degeneration of the valve. This sees the displacement of a thickened mitral valve cusp into the left atrium during systole.|$|E

40|$|Finding an {{untreated}} or asymptomatic large ventricular septal defect (VSD) in {{an elderly}} patient is uncommon.

Although the patient was elderly and the VSD had been asymptomatic for a long time, we considered that high-flow VSD and valve diseases should be repaired simultaneously with coronary disease. Then, he underwent elective surgery, namely, VSD patch repair concomitant with coronary artery bypass grafting, and mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty. His postoperative course was uneventful.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{compared}} the long-term results of surgical valvotomy (S) versus balloon valvuloplasty (BV) for pulmonary valve stenosis in infants and children. METHODS: Results after surgical pulmonary valvotomy (with concomitant ASD/VSD closure) (n = 62, age 2. 9 +/- 3. 5 years) and balloon valvuloplasty (n = 108, age 3. 6 +/- 3. 9 years) were analyzed. Transvalvular mean pressure gradient decrease, freedom from reintervention for restenosis, pulmonary valve <b>insufficiency,</b> and <b>tricuspid</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> were considered. RESULTS: Mean pressure gradient decreased significantly {{more in the}} surgical group (from 64. 8 +/- 30. 8 mm Hg to 12. 8 +/- 9. 8 mm Hg at a mean follow-up of 9. 8 years) than after BV (decreasing from 66. 2 +/- 21. 4 mm Hg to 21. 5 +/- 15. 9 mm Hg after a mean of 5. 4 years; p &lt; 0. 001). Moderate pulmonary valve insufficiency occurred in 44 % after surgery, and in 11 % after BV (p &lt; 0. 001). <b>Tricuspid</b> valve <b>insufficiency</b> occurred in 2 % after surgery, and in 5 % after BV. Restenosis occurred in 3 surgical patients (5. 6 %), 2 patients required reoperation, and 1 patient required a balloon valvotomy. Restenosis developed in 13 BV patients (14. 1 %) : 6 patients were redilated and 7 patients required surgery. Surgical valvotomy led to significantly less reinterventions than balloon valvuloplasty (p &lt; 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical relief of pulmonary valve stenosis produces lower long-term gradients and results in longer freedom from reintervention. Balloon valvuloplasty may remain, despite these results, the preferred therapy for isolated pulmonary valve stenosis, because it is less invasive, less expensive, and requires a shorter hospital stay. Surgery should remain the exclusive form of therapy {{in the presence of}} concomitant intracardiac defects, which need to be addressed...|$|R
