40|$|We {{describe}} a new suction tube for microsurgical procedures which permit a precise {{control of the}} pressure of suction. The new device consists of a suction tube connected to a laterally placed <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> which progressively opens or closes a leak. The surgeon can readily adjust the suction pressure by moving slightly the <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> with his thumb or index!nger up and down almost instantaneously...|$|R

50|$|In a {{double-acting}} steam engine, {{as used in}} {{a railway}} locomotive, {{the direction of the}} vertical thrust on the <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> is always upwards when running forward. It varies from nothing at the end of stroke to a maximum at half stroke when the angle between the con-rod and crank are greatest. When the crank-pin drives the piston, as when coasting, the piston thrust is downwards. The position of maximum thrust is shown by the increased wear at the middle of the <b>slide</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
30|$|Components of {{configuration}} panel are as follows: sensing range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets sensing range of sensor; communication range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets communication range of sensor; supersonic wave range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets supersonic wave range of sensor; frame delay <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which adjusts moving speed of sensor; sensing range checker, which checks if the sensing range of mobile sensor is visualized; communication range checker, which checks if the communication range of sensor is visualized; supersonic wave range checker, which checks if the supersonic wave range of sensor is visualized; node trace line checker, which checks if the distance in which sensor moved until the current time after being {{deployed in the}} beginning is visualized; goal coverage checker, which stops MSNS from operating when a user reaches the desired coverage; interval time checker, which pauses MSNS in operation during a certain time interval; degree K taker, which receives input {{of the number of}} neighboring sensors that sensors should maintain; number of sensor nodes taker, which receives input of the number of sensors to be deployed in the target area; initial deployment selector, which selects the initial location in which sensor are deployed when the MSNS starts; button to start and reset MSNS; and button to pause MSNS in operation and restart it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{technical}} {{factors such as}} analytical design and virtual prototyping, the simple but representative <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> was chosen in this paper and its mathematical model of working contour was established by using the analytic method. And then, the parameterized model and VRML file structural drawing of <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> were given by using double extrusion method. It was proved that {{the components of the}} tripod universal joint were formed easily by using the double extrusion method based on Extrusion nodes. In addition, the tripod universal joint assembly model was also accomplished by using Inline nodes and bottom-up assembling method...|$|R

25|$|The {{drive was}} on the {{trailing}} wheels and the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> were attached to a motion bracket just behind the leading wheels.

25|$|A {{minor change}} to the {{appearance}} of the streamlining was the removal of the locomotives' solid cowcatcher and its replacement with a lattice type, after it was discovered that the original design created a partial vacuum behind the cowcatcher, sucking dust and grime into the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> for the centre cylinder, leading to maintenance problems.|$|R

The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R
