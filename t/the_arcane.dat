25|$|A series named <b>The</b> <b>Arcane</b> Teaching is also {{attributed}} to Atkinson. Perhaps significantly, the doctrine behind <b>The</b> <b>Arcane</b> Teaching is {{remarkably similar to}} the philosophy in The Kybalion (another title {{attributed to}} Atkinson), and significant portions of material from <b>The</b> <b>Arcane</b> Teaching were later re-worked, appearing nearly verbatim in The Secret Doctrines of the Rosicrucians by Magus Incognito (yet another Atkinson alias).|$|E

25|$|Although he {{had split}} from Theosophy when renouncing Leadbeater's {{claim that he}} was the World Teacher, Krishnamurti {{continued}} to exhibit Theosophical influences in his later teachings. In 1923 a former Theosophist, the Anglo-American Alice Bailey, established <b>the</b> <b>Arcane</b> School, which also rested on claims regarding contact with the Ascended Masters. Another former Theosophist, the Austrian Rudolf Steiner, split from the Theosophical Society over the claims about Krishnamurti and then established his own Anthroposophical Society in 1913, which promoted Anthroposophy, a philosophy influenced by Theosophical ideas. In the United States during the 1930s, the I AM group was established by Guy Ballard and Edna Ballard; the group adopted the idea of the Ascended Masters from Theosophy.|$|E
25|$|Master of Magic splits spells {{into six}} schools of magic: Life Magic, which heals and protects; its antithesis Death Magic, which drains life and creates undead; Chaos Magic, which warps targets and spews {{destructive}} energies; Nature Magic, which controls {{the weather and}} turns it against the enemy; Sorcery, which manipulates the air and subverts {{the effects of the}} other schools; and Arcane Magic, which is a general school and free for all. Players select spellbooks from desired schools, allowing them to research and cast spells from those schools. The number of spells a wizard could learn from each school was dependent upon the number of books taken for that school. Additionally, the player could select traits instead of additional spellbooks. These traits would provide a special bonus throughout the game. There are global spells that can affect targets all across the world. Unit or city enhancement spells can boost the potential of its target, such as increasing the movement and attack speed of units, enabling them to regenerate wounds, and increasing the power of their attacks. Wizards can summon fantastic creatures related to their schools. The player can research combat spells, which include direct attacks, debuffs and traps. The final spell learned is <b>the</b> <b>Arcane</b> Spell of Mastery, which takes enormous resources to research and cast but instantly wins the game for the casting player.|$|E

500|$|Barber's head of Liberty {{is purely}} classical, and is {{rendered}} in the Roman style. The head is {{modeled after the}} French [...] "Ceres" [...] silver coinage of the late 19th century, but bears a resemblance to Morgan's design for the silver dollar. This did not escape numismatist Walter Breen in his comprehensive guide to U.S. coins: [...] "Barber must have been feeling unusually lazy. He left the [...] rev design {{as it had been}} since 1860, with minor simplifications. His obv was a mirror image of the Morgan dollar head, with much of Miss Anna Willess Williams's back hair cropped off, the rest concealed... within a disproportionately large cap." [...] In his text introducing the Barber quarter, Breen states, [...] "the whole composition is Germanically stolid, prosy, crowded (especially on rev), and without discernible merit aside from the technical one of low relief". Burdette terms Barber's designs, [...] "typically mediocre imitations of the current French-style—hardly better than <b>the</b> <b>arcane</b> seated Liberty type they replaced".|$|E

500|$|In actuality, Peach {{has been}} kidnapped by the Secret Society of X-Nauts (pronounced [...] "Cross-Nauts" [...] rather than [...] "Ex-Nauts" [...] {{according}} to Goombella's tattle on the X-Yux), a {{group led by}} Sir Grodus that are also searching for the Crystal Stars. While held captive, Peach uses e-mail via the main base's computer, TEC, to inform Mario about the quest and consequently help him to attain all 7 Crystal Stars and locate the treasure. However, the [...] "treasure" [...] is actually the Shadow Queen, a demon responsible for the ancient cataclysm that destroyed the original town 1,000 years ago. The X-Nauts had kept Peach so that her body could be possessed by the Shadow Queen {{in a bid to}} recover her full power. This happens, but <b>the</b> <b>arcane</b> power of the Crystal Stars is then used to separate Peach from her possessor briefly to give Mario and friends the strength needed to fight the Shadow Queen. The game ends when Mario defeats the Shadow Queen and frees and returns home with Peach.|$|E
500|$|Koch finally {{achieved}} {{his ambition}} of joining {{what was then}} known as Qantas Empire Airways (QEA) with an appointment on 4 July 1938. The Singapore service commenced on 2 August 1938 (the westbound service was [...] "officially" [...] opened on 4 August). In <b>the</b> <b>arcane</b> language of QEA, he was promoted from [...] "Extra Mate" [...] to [...] "Senior Mate" [...] in October 1940. This allowed him to fly as relief Captain on the Singapore service. He was soon promoted to [...] "Master", and in June 1943 to [...] "Extra Master". QEA was intimately involved in the war effort almost from its beginning, and in late 1940 was contracted to fly 19 PBY5 Catalinas from Honolulu to Australia {{on behalf of the}} RAAF. By a convenience, the crews were regarded as civilians (to meet American diplomatic niceties) for this operation, but on other RAAF contracts, particularly to combat zones, they were seen as serving in the RAAF Reserve. Brain, Koch and P. G [...]Taylor flew the final delivery flight of the Catalina ferry, arriving in Sydney on 24 October 1941, for the first time via Suva, Fiji. This crew determined to commemorate their mission by flying the first Airmail delivery between Fiji and Australia, and to that end they had a large number of [...] "First Day Covers" [...] (but without Airmail stamps) endorsed by the Suva Post Office prior to departure, and by the Sydney Post Office on arrival (some examples of what became collector's items are held by the Qantas Museum). They also transported 200 pounds weight of ordinary mail on behalf of the Fiji postal authorities. This plan led to a serious contretemps with Pan American, which had the contract to convey the air mail from Fiji but was not due to start operations until 9 November 1941.|$|E
