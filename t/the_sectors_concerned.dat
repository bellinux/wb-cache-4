40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effect of product market {{liberalisation}} on employment allowing for interactions between policies and institutions in product and labour markets. Using panel data for OECD countries over the period 1980 – 2002, we present evidence that product market deregulation is more effective at the margin when labour market regulation is high. The data also suggest that product market liberalisation may promote employment-enhancing labour market reforms. Over the past two decades, many OECD countries have sought to promote productivity and long-term growth by improving the efficiency {{of goods and services}} markets through liberalisation and privatisation programmes. There is a growing body of evi-dence suggesting that these programmes have indeed boosted productivity perform-ances in <b>the</b> <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned,</b> 1 but there is less evidence on their impacts on employment. A few recent theoretical and empirical studies suggest that product market deregulation may stimulate aggregate employment, yet firm conclusions are still lacking. 2 In assessing {{the effect of}} product market regulatory reforms, it is crucial to take into account that these reforms have been implemented in countries with very different labour market settings.

40|$|The {{creation}} of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), in the Uruguay Round, and its entry into force in 1995 marked a new stage {{in the history of}} the multilateral system. It was motivated essentially by the rapid expansion of international services trade within an increasingly open environment in many countries. Given the peculiarities of services trade, including the intangible nature of the products concerned and the need for direct contact between supplier and user in many cases, the Agreement contains a variety of conceptual innovations, including its extension to modes of supply beyond conventional cross-border trade (consumption abroad, commercial presence, and presence of natural persons) and its coverage, and legitimization, of various types of non-tariff restrictions. In turn, the new concepts needed time to be absorbed by the ministries and agencies involved in services trade. Further, the positive-list, or bottom-up, approach to scheduling trade commitments under the GATS meant that great flexibility was given to Members in selecting <b>the</b> <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned</b> and specifying the levels of access provided under individual modes. Thus, not surprisingly, the schedules that emerged from the Uruguay Round, which still account for the majority of current commitments, contain a variety of unclear or superfluous entries that may cause interpretation problems. Their solution could contribute significantly to the clarity and comparability of access obligations across sectors and WTO Members. The scheduling conventions agreed for the Doha Round thus provide specifically for the possibility of technical refinements that leave the substance of commitments unchanged. However, not only was this possibility used more sparingly to date than might have been expected, but additional flaws would be introduced if some current offers were to enter into effect. The following discussion, with a focus on a particular group of entries (market access via commercial presence), tries to explain the scope for such refinements and develop a clearer picture of the areas where further action might be needed...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{multidisciplinary}} analysis of Arab regional integration using the neo- functionalist and transactionalist approaches to integration. Neo-functionalism analyses {{the process of}} integration in the Arab World by studying the role of regional institutions including the league of Arab States and three Arab joint ventures. The transactionalist approach examines the impact of regional trade on political and economic integration in the Arab Mashreq. The analysis of the Arab joint ventures is taken further by using elements of business and finance theories. It is conducted on two different levels: the first analyses the operational and financial performance of these ventures. The second examines their role in promoting regional integration especially in <b>the</b> <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned.</b> The analysis is intended {{to find out whether}} these ventures were commercially viable or were more politically inspired. Qualitative information was collected from conducting constructive interviews with Arab economists, politicians and managers of the Arab joint ventures examined. The quantitative data was collected from recognisable resources including the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia and the Arab Monetary Fund. The problems encountered in this thesis resulted from the application of these theoretical approaches to integration, which are designed to study integration in politically developed societies with more advanced economies. However, the choice is justified since there are no alternatives. Secondly, the data on trade and Arab joint ventures may not be completely accurate since it does not record all transactions. The thesis concludes the following: at the political level, regional institutions did not promote Arab integration since they lacked aspects of supranationality and collective decision-making processes. Also, they did not affect the Arab elite's attitudes and could not initiate a viable process of integration that would spill over from one sector to another. At the economic level, the low level of regional trade in the Arab Mashreq did not prevent the occurrence of many attempts at Arab integration. Moreover, the Arab joint ventures were more politically inspired than commercially. Although they were more resilient to economic and political instability in the Arab World, their role in promoting regional integration was limited.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1980 s, the {{liberalisation}} {{of market}} access has become a dominant element in European infrastructure policy. Starting with telecommunications, reforms have now also targeted the postal services, freight and passenger transportation, in order to develop harmonised and competition-based services. These reforms will require the adjustment of regulations in order to safeguard the provision of public policy objectives. Despite structural differences, a sectoral comparison indicates a series of common features: All three sectors are experiencing a gradual market opening, that will allow monopolies to exist only in peripheral segments (especially in network infrastructure). The pace of liberalisation varies across sectors. While the telecommunications sector has been leading the way, a complete liberalisation of the postal services has yet to begin. As far as the passenger short-distance and regional transportation in the public sector is concerned, additional competition is provided by substitutes, i. e., intermodal competition between various modes of carriers (e. g., automobiles, buses, trains, etc.). The introduction of competition requires an adjustment of the regulatory framework in <b>the</b> <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned.</b> Reforms must take into consideration that services that are in the public interest are maintained even under market conditions, i. e., that services that are essential to full social and economic inclusion are provided to everybody at affordable prices. After all, easier market access and increasing competition have caused also public providers to emphasise cost awareness and profitability. In many ways, this is incompatible with the provision of services that adequately serve the public interest, because such services may not be profitable or because prices of services do not cover costs (such as services supplied to peripheral regions, prices set under the aspect of affordability). On the one hand, increasing liberalisation requires a more precise specification of what services are to be supplied in the public interest (e. g., a definition of universal services). On the other hand, the financing of such non-commercial services must be compatible with a market-based economy. At times when such services were provided exclusively or predominantly by public monopolies (through a high share of services reserved for the public domain) cross subsidies were a feasible option. But as competition intensifies it becomes imperative to spread the financial burden resulting from public welfare services across all providers (e. g., universal services financed within one sector) or to allocate the costs to those who order the services (external financing by the Federal Republic or the states). An {{increase in the number of}} providers of infrastructure services brings about improvements in terms of prices, quality and the choice available; this applies to general services as well as to services provided (below costs) in the public interest. New mechanisms have been established for finding the best providers of universal services and other non-commercial services. A paradigmatic change from the model of the legally obligated service provider to market-based procurement processes (such as universal services auctions and tenders for contracts of limited duration) is emerging. The sectoral analysis also indicates that liberalisation does not only involve risks but also opportunities for safeguarding the continuity of supplies and the maintenance of a comprehensive supply of non-commercial services. The comparison of various sectors points out the importance of specifying goals within the political process (definition of the range and quality of services). The next step in this process will be to efficiently implement political goals by modifying the regulatory framework as well as by an increased reliance on competitive processes of awarding permits.
