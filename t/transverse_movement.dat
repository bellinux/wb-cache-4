2500|$|The port handles around 8 {{million tonnes}} of coal for clients {{such as the}} Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board, Karnataka Power Corporation, cement plants of Tamil Nadu and {{independent}} power producers in northern Tamil Nadu and southern Andhra Pradesh. The coal handling for the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board {{was transferred to the}} Ennore Port. In 2005, as part of pollution-control measure, the port has installed wind curtains made of ultraviolet resistant fabric along the harbour's beachfront for over 1.5km to the east of the coal terminal to prevent wind carrying coal dust into the city at a cost of [...] 3.7 million. In 2008, the port has also installed a semi-mechanised closed coal conveyor system comprising two streams with a capacity of 15 million metric tons/annum and a handling rated capacity of 1,500 metric tons/hour/stream and running for a length of 5km at two berths, namely, Jawahar Dock IV and VI, at a cost of [...] 430 million to transfer the coal to the individual coal plots {{at the southern end of}} the port, from where the cargo will be transported by rail to respective destinations, thus preventing pollution from coal dust and eliminating movement of coal-carrying trucks within the port. The conveyor runs at an elevation of 10–13m and has provision for longitudinal movement along the road to the plots and <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> for stacking coal at individual plots. Coal discharged into the hoppers located at the two docks is conveyed to coal plots through conveyors or tripper cars and is equipped with belt weigher. The conveyor system is expected to remain functional for about 5 years, till Ennore Port is ready to handle coal for all the clients.|$|E

This reduces wear on the wheel and rail surfaces if {{the stability of the}} horizontal <b>transverse</b> <b>movements</b> of the vehicle is not affected. In railway motor vehicles, these requirements are achieved by means of rubber elastic elements which by their own damping capacity also contribute to the reduction of axle movement.

The steam engine itself was a two-cylinder compound which drove the second coupled axle. The low-pressure cylinder on the right was set at an angle due to its large size. The first and fourth coupled axles were Klien-Lindner hollow axles which enabled an outside frame with Hall cranks.

5000|$|An {{advanced}} spatio-spectral scanning system, {{proposed in}} June 2014, {{consists of a}} dispersive element before a spatial scanning system. (This allows for easy switching between spatial and spatio-spectral scanning). The imaging process is based on spectral analysis of a strip of a dispersed image of the scene. The field of view in the wavelength-coded spatial dimension equals the dispersion angle of the dispersive element. As in the more basic system, scanning is achieved by <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> of the slit or by moving the system relative to the scene.|$|E
50|$|On running round a bend, {{the first}} axle is pushed {{sideways}} by {{the curve of}} the rails and so moves the second axle parallel to it in the opposite direction, until the wheel flanges of both axles align with the rails. This distributes the guide forces between the two axles which reduces wear and tear on the wheel flanges. By enabling this <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> of the wheelsets, locomotives with rigid frames do not have to use the thinner wheel flanges etc. normally needed to facilitate smooth running through points, bends and tightly curved sections of track. The 'guide length' of the locomotive is formed by the distance between the two fixed Beugniot lever pivot points.|$|E

40|$|The Arachthos Bridge in Greece {{is about}} 1 km long and crosses the future Arachthos reservoir. This paper {{presents}} the results of the earthquake analysis of the bridge design that won an international design competition. The spans vary from 83 m to 107 m. The Y-shaped piers with heights of up to 80 m are founded on piles. Because of the high seismic stresses in the bridge piers, hydraulic dampers are needed in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. The dampers reduce the seismic stresses in the piers by about 50 %. The optimisation of the seismic dampers is discussed in this paper. Two transverse seismic dampers are provided on each pier and one at each abutment. The seismic dampers allow relative movements between the bridge deck and the top of the bridge piers of up to ∓ 500 mm in the transverse direction. The longitudinal stability of the bridge girder under the static and dynamic loads is achieved by the piers, which are connected with the girder in the longitudinal direc-tion, and the seismic dampers at the abutments. In the longitudinal direction, seismic movements of up to ∓ 250 mm are allowed. The longitudinal dampers at the ends of the bridge girder must allow both longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>movements.</b> The dy-namic analysis shows that maximum residual <b>transverse</b> <b>movements</b> of up to 200 mm are possible. Therefore, provision for the placement of hydraulic jacks is fore-seen on the pier tops for re-centering the bridge deck after a strong earthquake. The stability of the bridge girder under the service loads is provided by shear keys, which are integrated in the pot bearings. Under the design earthquake or an earthquake exceeding the design earthquake, the bridge girder is prevented from falling down from the bearings...|$|R
50|$|When {{describing}} anatomical motion, these planes {{describe the}} axis along which an action is performed. So by {{moving through the}} <b>transverse</b> plane, <b>movement</b> travels from head to toe.

50|$|In {{most members}} of Dicynodontia, both the reduced {{dentition}} and sharp cutting edge around the anterior end of the lower jaw suggest a scissor-like mode of food collection. After collection, mastication would have occurred via a back-and-forth grinding process. However, Dicynodontoides strays from this general pattern of food processing. Its caniniform blades, though periodically absent in this genus, {{are likely to have}} functioned as a paper cutter. However, the short mouth, blunted edges of the lower jaw, and the lack of a tough palatal surface against which the jaw could grind downplay the significance of this apparent shearing component. The morphology of the jaw hinge prevents the anterior end of the lower jaw from meeting the palate, only allowing palatal contact with the more posterior portion of the dentary. While there is little possibility of any <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> in the lower jaw, a crushing function is possible, and consistent with the feeding mechanism observed in other Emydopoids.|$|E
50|$|The {{machinery}} for projecting and withdrawing the {{torpedo tube}} {{consists of a}} couple of chain drums worked by gearing which is driven by a rotary engine made by Root, New York, NY. One of these drums is placed in the tank or reservoir in the bows of the vessel, and the chain from it is used for hauling in the tube. In order to prevent the chain from overriding on the drum, it is guided by passing through a suitable block which, as the drum revolves, is moved transversely along the drum and deposits the chain in regular coils. The <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> of the guiding block is given by a screwed spindle which has a pinion fixed on it gearing into a spur wheel on the chain drum. The hauling out of the torpedo carrier is effected by means of a chain attached to its inner end and led to the second chain drum which is placed above and slightly abaft the tank, as shown in Fig. 2. The arrangement adopted for guiding the chain is the same in this case as in that of the hauling-in drum. Each drum is loose upon its shaft, but is capable of being connected to it by a clutch, the two clutches being connected by levers {{so that they can be}} thrown into gear alternately. The tube can be run in and out by the machinery we have described at the rate of from 8 to 12 double strokes per minute.|$|E

40|$|The high temperature, low frequency, {{internal}} friction spectrum of deformed and annealed α-Zr is dominated at low strain amplitudes by a peak (P 2) at ≈ 600 °C (4 Hz). At higher strain amplitudes, two new peaks P 0 (≈ 480 °C) and P 1 (≈ 530 °C) appear. It is shown that P 0 {{is due to}} the thermally assisted unpinning of dislocations from oxygen interstitials while P 1 and P 2 are due to the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>movements</b> of the same defects in the dislocation core. P 2, previously attributed to grain-boundary relaxation, is a Snoek-Köster peak. A behavioural map of the temperature-strain amplitude plane can be constructed to facilitate the interpretation of amplitude-dependent results.

50|$|Pampatheres are {{believed}} to have attained a weight of up to 200 kg. Like three-banded armadillos, and unlike glyptodonts, their armored shell was given some flexibility by three movable lateral bands of scutes. The osteoderms (bony plates in the skin comprising the armor) of pampatheres were each covered by a single keratinized scute, unlike osteoderms of armadillos, which have more than one scute.A study of pampathere jaw biomechanics showed that their masticatory musculature was more powerful and more adapted for <b>transverse</b> <b>movements</b> than that of armadillos, leading to the conclusion that much of their diet was coarse vegetation. They are thought to have been primarily grazers, unlike armadillos, which are omnivorous or insectivorous. The variation between species in the expression of adaptations for grinding coarse vegetation correlates with the aridity of their habitat; such adaptations are most pronounced in Pampatherium typum, which lived in the arid Pampas, and least pronounced in H. occidentalis, which lived in humid lowlands.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{separate}} effects of thumb and finger extension/flexion on median nerve position and cross-sectional area. METHODS: Ultrasonography {{was used to}} assess median nerve transverse position and cross-sectional area within the carpal tunnel at rest and its movement during volitional flexion of the individual digits of the hand. Both wrists of 165 normal subjects (11 men, 4 women, mean age, 28. 6, range, 22 to 38) were studied. RESULTS: Thumb flexion resulted in <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> of the median nerve in radial direction (1. 2 ± 0. 6 mm), whereas flexion of the fingers produced <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> in ulnar direction, which was most pronounced during flexion of the index and middle fingers (3. 2 ± 0. 9 and 3. 1 ± 1. 0 mm, respectively). Lesser but still statistically significant movements were noted with flexion of the ring finger (2. 0 ± 0. 8 mm) and little finger (1. 2 ± 0. 5 mm). Flexion of the thumb or individual fingers did not change median nerve cross-sectional area (8. 5 ± 1. 1 mm(2)). CONCLUSIONS: Volitional flexion of the thumb and individual fingers, particularly the index and middle fingers, produced significant <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel but did not alter the cross-sectional area of the nerve. The importance of these findings on the understanding of the pathogenesis of the carpal tunnel syndrome and its treatment remains to be investigated...|$|E

The rear of the lead power car struck a concrete parapet (KP404.209) on the leading abutment to the bridge over the Marne–Rhine Canal.

The rear bogie of the lead power car remained where it impacted the concrete parapet. The transformer of the lead power car landed on the east bank of the canal. The remainder of the lead power car slid along the left parapet of the bridge. At the end of the bridge, it overturned, slid down the embankment and came to a rest [...] beyond the end of the bridge.|$|R
40|$|Undulatory {{locomotion}} is an archetypal {{mode of propulsion}} {{for natural}} swimmers across scales. Undulatory swimmers convert transverse body oscillations into forward velocity by a complex interplay between their flexural movements, morphological features and the fluid environment. Natural evolution has produced {{a wide range of}} morphokinematic examples of undulatory swimmers that often serve as inspiration for engineering devices. It is, however, unknown to what extent natural swimmers are optimized for hydrodynamic performance. In this work, we reverse-engineer the morphology and gait for fast and efficient swimmers by coupling an evolution strategy to three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of flows at intermediate Reynolds numbers. The fastest swimmer is slender with a narrow tail fin and performs a sequence of C-starts to maximize its average velocity. The most efficient swimmer combines moderate <b>transverse</b> <b>movements</b> with a voluminous head, tapering into a streamlined profile via a pronounced inflection point. These optimal solutions outperform anguilliform swimming zebrafish in both efficiency and speed. We investigate the transition between morphokinematic solutions in the speed-energy space, laying the foundations for the design of high-performance artificial swimming device...|$|R

The objective of this research is to obtain a model for an equilibrium profile of gravel beaches, which has been divided into the three parts of the transverse profile: Profile in the backshore, intermediate profile submerged and profile Posidonia oceanica area. Furthermore, the results are compared with other models used today. Initially, there had been a historical survey of the development plan and profile of each beach to determine the stability of the same, and see if there have been longitudinal or <b>transverse</b> <b>movements</b> within the analyzed profile. Here are various mathematical models generated from different mathematical functions (potential, exponential and rational) Profile for each zone. They are statistical parameters analyzing the surface error between real and estimating those selected as the best model data.

A sun gear meshes with all three pinion gears and transversely moves the three lead screws upon actuation of a drive gear. The drive gear meshes with the sun gear and is driven by a handle or servomotor.

In order to prevent accidents such as direct contact with other ships and obstacles on the sea floor, we continuously observed the whirling motion at a single anchor by using the DGPS. The results are as follow. 1) At a Beaufort's wind scale (wind force henceforth) of 2 and under, the wind directed against the anchor chain side and a slow whirling of the bow was observed. 2) At a wind force between 3 and 4, a regular elliptic motion was observed. 3) At a wind force 5, a distorted figure 8 movement forming unequal lobes was observed. 4) At a wind force 6, an amplified movement during wind force 5 was observed. 5) At a wind force 7, the relative heading angle formed in both the right and left sides with respect to the wind direction became equal, and a maximum whirling-breadth of 82 meters was measured. 6) When Nagasaki Maru is anchored on a single chain, the following equation for the average distance of <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> "d" and degree of whirling "a" with respect to wind speed "v" was determined. Moreover, the maximum distance of <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> was determined as approximately 1. 5 times the value of "d". d=k 1 _v a=k_ 2 v+ 5 d : the average distance of <b>transverse</b> <b>movement</b> (m) k_ 1 : 2. 0 [1 /knot] v : wind speed (knot) a : degree of whirling (°) k_ 2 : 1. 0 [1 /knot...|$|E
40|$|Sedimentary {{deposits}} in reservoir lakes record the sediment transport {{capacity of the}} up-stream river and past water levels of the downstream basin. Volumes and morphologies of deltas {{can be used to}} calculate flow and sediment dynamics. We constructed circular basins to which we fed constant flow discharge over a feeder channel of gravelly sand with different ratios of added silica flour. During water level rise, the fan radius decreased over time. During water level fall, after dam removal, the deltas were partially destroyed. Surprisingly, for low discharges the channel markedly destroyed the deposit through <b>transverse</b> <b>movements</b> of the initial channel whereas for higher discharges the terraces were pre-served for a longer time. Our results indicate that dam removal at wide lakes may lead to an unexpected inverse relation between discharge and erosion of the deposit, which has consequences for the subsequent sediment pulse magnitude. Point-modelling of sediment transport capacity yielded volumes in good agreement with observed volumes, proving that the time scale of activity can be inferred from feeder channel dimensions and delta volume. Our results suggest that these parameters can yield consistent re-construction of formative time scale also on Mars, which has consequences for interpretation of ancient climate...|$|R
30|$|Samples of pine (Pinus sylvestris) and spruce (Picea abies) were {{impregnated}} with a low-viscous {{epoxy resin}} using a vacuum process. The epoxy was cured in situ and the specimens sectioned. Deposits of the cured epoxy was then {{observed in the}} wood cavities using a scanning electron microscope. The investigation concentrated on tracing the <b>transverse</b> <b>movements</b> of a viscous liquid in the wood, and special attention was therefore given to the cross-field area between ray cells and longitudinal tracheids. A damage hypothesis is proposed {{based on the results}} obtained in the present investigation in combination with those from earlier studies on linseed oil-impregnated pine: In addition to the morphology of the bordered pits, viscous liquid flow in wood is dependent on damage that occurs during the impregnation procedure. For pine sapwood, liquid flow is enabled through disrupted window pit membranes, which divide the longitudinal tracheids and the ray parenchyma cells. A mechanism accounting for the reduced permeability of pine heartwood is believed to be deposits of higher-molecular-weight substances (extractives) in the ray parenchyma cells and on the cell walls. In spruce the thicker ray cells in combination with the smaller pits, which are connected to the longitudinal tracheids, reduce permeability considerably.|$|R
40|$|DURING {{the normal}} {{progression}} {{of a fish}} through water each segment of the body executes a series of <b>transverse</b> <b>movements</b> whose phase is slightly behind that of the segment lying anteriorly to itself, whilst the muscles on {{the two sides of}} each segment differ in phase from each other by one-half of a complete muscular cycle. So long as these conditions are fulfilled, regular waves of contraction pass alternately down each side of the body and tail of the fish. On the form, velocity and frequency of these waves depends the rate of progression of the animal through still water (Gray, 1933 a). It is obvious that the form of the waves depends, in turn, on the degree of contraction taking place in each segment and on the phase difference which exists between successive segments. The present paper deals with the locomotory rhythm of the eel {Anguilla vulgaris), a form well suited to the purpose in view of its clearly defined muscular movements and of the remarkable viability of the fish. So far as is known, the mechanism controlling the co-ordination of fish movement has not been subjected to extensive experimental analysis, but, during the progress of the present work, important contributions have been made b...|$|R
