5|$|On July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan {{underwent}} a colonoscopy, during which a villous adenoma (a pre-cancerous lesion) was discovered. When told by his physician (Dr. Edward Cattau) {{that he could}} undergo surgery immediately or in two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> Reagan elected to have it removed immediately.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks {{of the higher}} altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|Horder {{prescribed}} her an antidepressant, a {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor, {{a few days}} before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse. Commentators have argued that because antidepressants may take up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.|$|E

5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> off work to recover.|$|E
5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} simply as a cold, is a viral {{infectious}} disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E

5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest for two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto {{the floor of the}} nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{sometimes}} assign {{characters to}} particular writers; for example, Cogman {{was assigned to}} Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spend several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines are complete, they spend another two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode. A detailed outline is created, {{with each of the}} writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took {{a month and a half}} to complete both scripts. They are then read by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins, since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries.|$|E
5|$|By 1896, {{the company}} {{produced}} one new car every two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> and built vehicles on order for $2,000. As the orders increased, the company formally incorporated as Haynes-Apperson on May 5, 1898, with $25,000 in capital from stock issued to Portland and Kokomo businessmen. At {{the end of}} that year the company relocated to a large factory it had built in Kokomo. Two new models were designed and the workforce expanded as production increased. Haynes-Apperson ran advertisements in area newspapers and demonstrated cars at county fairs and other exhibitions. Demand for the vehicles grew rapidly from five cars produced in 1898 to thirty in 1899, 192 in 1900, and 240 in 1901. The work kept the factory open 24 hours a day, and two shifts totaling more than 350 workers were needed to keep the factory running at capacity by 1902. Sales totaled over $400,000 that year.|$|E

5|$|On 6 March, during United's 3–1 loss against Liverpool at Anfield, Nani {{was injured}} {{following}} a challenge from Jamie Carragher just before half-time. Nani shed tears after {{the challenge and}} was subsequently taken off the pitch in a stretcher. Following post-match comments to the press from Manchester United, it was believed Nani had suffered a broken leg. However, {{this was not the}} case as he started training the following week. It was thought Nani would miss up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> as a result of this tackle and would return in April, but he recovered in time to play 61 minutes of a 2–1 victory over Marseille on 15 March.|$|E
5|$|Six to 12 larval stages occur. During {{the first}} two stages, the larvae live off {{surrounding}} fungal tissue, until they reach the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the heartwood. After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, they normally turn either up or down, but they turn back if they meet a foreign borehole, encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the fungal mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimeters under the bark. Before this, female larvae sequester a secretion containing fungal oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending on the weather, they remain in the hatch hole for up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> to complete. The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|The chicks hatch 12–14days after {{incubation}} begins. Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and closed eyes. The mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing {{the growth of}} olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.|$|E
5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down and get up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes the umbilical cord to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E

5|$|The {{narrative}} shifts <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> before Kratos' imprisonment. Confronted by Orkos in the Village of Kirra, Kratos is {{advised that}} the visions {{he has been}} experiencing are mind tricks created by the Furies, and instructs him to find the Oracle of Delphi. Upon arrival at the Temple of Delphi, he overcomes Castor and Pollux, who tried to kill the Oracle. In her dying breath, the Oracle instructs Kratos to travel to Delos to retrieve the Eyes of Truth. Taking the Amulet of Uroborus from the now-dead Castor and Pollux, Kratos travels to Kirra's harbor, where he again encounters Orkos. The oath keeper reveals that Ares wanted a perfect warrior to help him overthrow Zeus, so Ares helped Kratos against the barbarians to make him into a perfect warrior. Orkos became the oath keeper and did not question the Furies until Ares tricked Kratos into killing his own family. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos takes a ship to Delos.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{high command}} also {{recognized the need}} for improvements to their logistical network to facilitate the transport of sufficient supplies of food, weapons, and ammunition necessary for continuous large-scale operations. By 1973 the 559th Transportation Group, which controlled the Ho Chi Minh trail (the Trường Sơn Strategic Transportation Route to the North Vietnamese) in southeastern Laos, was ordered to expand east of the Trường Sơn Mountains and directly into South Vietnam. The new logistical route, Corridor 613, ran inside South Vietnam from the DMZ to {{all the way to}} Loc Ninh. Besides creating the new extension, the 559th upgraded its entire network, constructing all-weather, hard-surfaced roads to accommodate the modern mechanized army that had been rebuilt since the Paris Accord. The work required two years to complete, but the time required for the transport of personnel from North Vietnam to the southernmost seat of battle was reduced from four months <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dams {{interrupt}} {{the migration of}} anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams {{in which they were}} born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations of salmon die. Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ fish ladders, which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream. Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. Previously, this journey would have taken two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> With river currents slowed by the dams, and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools, the journey can take several months, which increases the mortality rate. In some cases, the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge. The Chief Joseph Dam and several dams on the Columbia's tributaries entirely block migration, and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams. Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean. In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams, sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam.|$|E
