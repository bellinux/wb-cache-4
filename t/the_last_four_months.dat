25|$|As World War II {{approached}} {{its conclusion}} (effectively on 14 August but formally not until 2 September), training {{activities and the}} strength of Training Command declined. The end of the war in Europe in May caused the focus of training to shift from the needs of the European Theater to those of the Pacific, particularly courses associated with very heavy bombardment. Then, with the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific, most training ceased for those students not planning to remain in the post-war air forces. Before that time, however, the trend in training had gone increasingly toward specialized training on particular types of aircraft. Then during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> of 1945, rapid retrenchment in training occurred, and emphasis shifted to separating people from the Army Air Forces and reorganizing Training Command for its still undetermined peacetime goals.|$|E

500|$|Patio 29 is {{a common}} grave in Santiago General Cemetery where the victims of mutilation, torture, and {{execution}} under the Pinochet military government were buried. Augusto Pinochet {{came to power in}} the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, where he led the army that attacked the presidential palace and overthrew President Salvador Allende. The military junta replaced constitutional rule for 17 years, under which thousands of Chileans were detained and tortured. The Patio 29 cemetery section is bordered by Mexico Avenue to the north, O'Higgins Avenue to the east, Copihues Street to the south, and Maitenes Street to the west. Though the cemetery changed its section numbering in 1987, the section is still known as Patio 29. The section has 105 graves, though many contained more than one person. The plots remain marked by their original rusted iron cross headstones with burial dates and [...] "NN" [...] for [...] "no name". Most of the dates fall within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> of 1973. The site has not been reused for burials. Folksinger Víctor Jara, a prominent casualty of Pinochet's 1973 coup d'état, lies in a crypt across from Patio 29.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after Edgardo's birth, the Mortara family engaged a new servant: Anna [...] "Nina" [...] Morisi, an 18-year-old Catholic from the nearby village of San Giovanni in Persiceto. Like all her family and friends, Morisi was illiterate. She {{had come to the}} city, {{following}} her three sisters, to work and save money towards a dowry so she could eventually marry. In early 1855, Morisi became pregnant, as was not uncommon for unmarried servants in Bologna at this time. Many employers would simply sack girls in such situations, but the Mortaras did not; they paid for Morisi to spend <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> of her pregnancy at a midwife's home and deliver the child, then had her return to work with them. To protect Morisi and themselves from embarrassment, they told neighbours that their maid was sick and recuperating at home. Morisi gave her newborn baby to an orphanage, as the Papal States required unwed mothers to do, then returned to work with the Mortaras. She remained there until she was hired by another Bologna family in 1857; soon after that she married and moved back to San Giovanni in Persiceto.|$|E

500|$|The {{squadron}}'s first combat {{mission was}} flown on 21 September 1944, when it picked up two downed Navy fliers. In November 1944, the squadron began operating from the Philippines. [...] Initially the Army {{was unable to}} support its OA-10s, and for several months, they were supported by the Navy's seaplane tenders, [...] and [...] [...] This support continued even after {{the arrival of the}} squadron's ground echelon. [...] During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> of the war, the squadron began to operate Boeing SB-17 Dumbos, which were equipped with a 27 foot long life boat with survival equipment that could be dropped to downed aircrews, in addition to its Catalinas. [...] This permitted the rescue of crews who were downed in seas that were too high for the Catalinas to land and pick them up. [...] The Dumbos would frequently accompany strike aircraft, orbiting off the coast during the attack, so as to be in position to accompany distressed aircraft on the return flight. [...] If needed, the life boat, whose engines gave it a range 500 miles, could be dropped to crews that ditched or bailed out of their aircraft. The squadron also provided courier service, carried supplies and messages, evacuated allied prisoners and wounded personnel, and occasionally provided reconnaissance.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the cast seen in the final cut of the film, Bill Pullman, Lukas Haas, and Mickey Rourke also performed but their scenes were eventually cut. Billy Bob Thornton recorded narration that was scrapped. Martin Sheen and Viggo Mortensen participated in readthroughs of the script and are thanked in the end credits. Editor Leslie Jones was on location for five months and rarely saw Malick, who left her to her own devices. After principal photography wrapped, she {{came back with a}} five-hour first cut and spent seven months editing, with Thornton contributing three hours of narrative voice-over material. It was at this point that editor Billy Weber came on board, and they spent 13 months in post-production and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> mixing the film, using four Avid machines with a fifth added at one point. Malick edited the footage one reel at a time with the sound off while listening to a Green Day CD. There were no preview screenings but several in-house ones, the largest of which was attended by 15 people for marketing executives. The editors faced the challenge of blending footage of veteran actors with less-experienced ones, integrating the many cameos, and the voice-overs. According to Jones, [...] "Malick removed scenes with dialogue whenever possible, with the final film varying greatly from the original concept". Four months after principal photography, Malick invited Toll to a rough-cut screening of the film. In December 1998, Toll did the first color correction at the lab prior to the film's release in North America.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Actually, the {{productive}} rules of "Vitellone Bianco dell'Appennino Centrale" ban {{the use of}} maize silage in the <b>four</b> <b>months</b> before slaughtering due to the possible negative effects on meat quality, particularly on meat colour and water holding capacity. The studies on this argument are conflicting and conducted on foreign breed. So {{there is a lack}} on Chianina beef, one of the most diffuse breed for meat production in Italy, for this important topic. Aim: To compare the effect of maize silage or hay in diet during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> of fattening on some meat physicalchemical quality characteristics of Chianina beef. Materials and methods: 90 Chianina beef fed with hay (Group 1) or maize silage (Group 2) were slaughtered at an average age of 19 months. After the normal ageing for this meat, different for each muscles, samples of three different muscles (caput longum triceps brachii, longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus), were analysed in order to asses the main meat quality characteristics: pH, colour before and after 48 h of storage to evaluate meat shelf-life, tenderness (expressed as shear force), water holding capacity (evaluated as drip loss, cooking loss and M/T), chemical composition (dry matter, crude protein, ether extract and ash). The variance analysis was used to assess statistical differences. Results and discussion: pH values were normal and similar between muscles and groups. The use of maize silage induced small variation, detectable only instrumentally, in meat colour (L*), drip loss and ether extract of longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus muscles. No differences are shown for the quality of caput longum triceps brachii. Nevertheless, the differences are very low and the final consumer doesn't note any variation. Conclusion: From the results of this study, it seems possible to use maize silage in Chianina diet even during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> of fattening, without any significant change in meat quality, when there is any economic advantage for breeders...|$|R
