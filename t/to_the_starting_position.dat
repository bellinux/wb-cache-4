5|$|The {{northern}} attack force moved south towards Østerport {{where the}} fortification Kastellet laid. The Swedes got {{very close to}} Nyboder and {{were in the process}} of crossing the moat, when they fell victim to a well-conducted ambush, and withdrew with heavy losses. Around 6 in the morning, Charles X of Sweden knew that all attacks had failed. He ordered a retreat to the outskirts of the city, back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{muscular system}} has been {{similarly}} modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified {{to contribute to the}} action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October 1917, the 34th Battalion—as {{a member}} of the 9th Brigade—was {{to take part in the}} 3rd Australian Division's attack on Passchendaele, Belgium. Subject to several days of heavy rain, the {{battlefield}} had been transformed into a boggy marsh on which the attack was to commence. Jeffries commanded B Company during the attack, which he halted at the entrance to Broodseinde railway cutting, as many of the direction tapes leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> had been destroyed or swallowed up by the mud. To avoid any mishaps, Jeffries and another of the battalion's company commanders, Captain T.G. Gilder, pushed on alone as far as Keerselaarhoek cemetery to find the tapes marking the battalions starting line for the attack. Thus, by 03:00 the 34th Battalion was formed up on the line of attack.|$|E

25|$|However, Shanahan {{suddenly}} reversed {{direction by}} naming veteran backup Rex Grossman <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> In Week 1, Grossman threw for 305 {{yards and two}} TD passes as the Redskins crushed the Giants 28-14, ending a six-game losing streak against that team. After beating the Cardinals in Week 2, the Redskins {{got off to a}} surprise 2-0 start. In Week 3, they played the Cowboys on MNF and lost a poorly played game where the latter edged them out with six field goals to win 18-16.|$|E
25|$|Delhomme {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> for the 2008 season. In {{the first}} game of the 2008 season, Delhomme restarted his career by coming back on the San Diego Chargers with a touchdown pass on fourth down as time expired to win the game. This is similar to his debut game in 2003. After finishing the regular season 12-4, tying the Panthers' 2nd best record in franchise history, the Panthers were eliminated from the playoffs when on January 10, 2009, on his 34th birthday, Delhomme threw for a career worst five interceptions (and lost one fumble) against the Arizona Cardinals in the , ending the season with an overall record of 12-5 including the loss in the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|The {{roll test}} can {{determine}} whether the horizontal semicircular canal is involved. The roll test requires the patient {{to be in a}} supine position with their head in 30° of cervical flexion. Then the examiner quickly rotates the head 90° to the left side, and checks for vertigo and nystagmus. This is followed by gently bringing the head back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> The examiner then quickly rotates the head 90° to the right side, and checks again for vertigo and nystagmus. In this roll test, the patient may experience vertigo and nystagmus on both sides, but rotating towards the affected side will trigger a more intense vertigo. Similarly, when the head is rotated towards the affected side, the nystagmus will beat towards the ground and be more intense.|$|E

25|$|Brady {{attended}} Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, {{where he}} graduated in 1995; the ceremony was held at St. Mary's Cathedral. He played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. Brady's football career started as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first, Brady was {{not good enough to}} start on the 0–8 JV team that had not scored a touchdown all year. However, when the starting quarterback went down with an injury, he ascended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> He became the varsity starter his junior year and held the position until he graduated. By Brady's senior year, he struggled getting on the radar of college coaches. He created highlight tapes and sent them out to schools he would consider attending. This led to strong interest from many football programs around the nation.|$|E
25|$|The Orlando Magic {{started the}} 2007–08 season with new coach Stan Van Gundy, and Arroyo again {{was at the}} backup point guard position. On November 28, 2007, he had a career-high 14 assists {{in a game against}} the Seattle SuperSonics. On December 29, 2007, Arroyo was {{promoted}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> after Nelson experienced an extended offensive slump. With Nelson in the starting position during this period the team was having an average of seventeen turnovers per game, and he was unable to score in double digits on 10 out of 17 games. This led to Van Gundy issuing several public notices concerning the team's performance eventually leading to changes in the starting formation. During Arroyo's first three games in the starting position the number of turnovers produced by the team was lowered to eleven per game. Arroyo's points average was within double digits in all of these games and he recorded seventeen assists. Arroyo closed January in the starting position, the team finished the month winning five out of six games.|$|E
500|$|With the {{graduation}} of Pat White, Brown was promoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> for the 2009 season. Against East Carolina, Brown led the Mountaineers to a 3520 victory and completed 24of 31pass attempts for 334yards and four touchdowns. For his performance, the Big East Conference named him the Offensive Player of the Week. The following week, West Virginia lost to Auburn, 4130. Brown completed 18of 32passes for 221yards and one touchdown, but also threw four interceptions and lost one fumble. After the game, head coach Bill Stewart defended Brown and said, [...] "He's learning, and we've {{got a lot}} of football to play. And I'm glad Jarrett Brown is my quarterback." [...] The Charleston Gazette wrote, [...] "Did he take some chances? Yes, and a bunch of them paid off, which is why West Virginia led most of the game." [...] Against Colorado, West Virginia overcame a string of four consecutive fumbles in the first quarter, including one by Brown, to win 3524. Head coach Stewart credited Brown and running back Noel Devine with keeping the offense's composure.|$|E

It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom. The beads are usually rounded and made of a hardwood. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam. If you move them toward the beam, you count their value. If you move away, you don't count their value. The suanpan can be reset <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.|$|E
