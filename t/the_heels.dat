Other joints, such as <b>the</b> <b>heels,</b> knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night.

40|$|Introduction: <b>The</b> plantar <b>heel</b> pad is a {{specialized}} fibroadipose tissue that attenuates and, in part, dissipates the impact energy associated with heel strike. Although near maximal deformation of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad {{has been shown}} during running, in vivo measurement of the deformation and structural properties of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad during walking remains largely unexplored. This study employed a fluoroscope, synchronized with a pressure platform, to obtain force–deformation data for <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad during walking. Methods: Dynamic lateral foot radiographs were acquired from 6 male and 10 female adults (age, 45 ± 10 yrs; height, 1. 66 ± 0. 10 m; and weight, 80. 7 ± 10. 8 kg), while walking barefoot at preferred speeds. The inferior aspect of the calcaneus was digitized and the sagittal thickness and deformation of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad relative to the support surface calculated. Simultaneous measurement of the peak force beneath <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> was used to estimate the principal structural properties of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad. Results: Transient loading profiles associated with walking induced rapidly changing deformation rates in <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad and resulted in irregular load–deformation curves. The initial stiffness (32 ± 11 N. mm- 1) of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad was {{an order of magnitude}} lower than its final stiffness (212 ± 125 N. mm- 1) and on average, only 1. 0 J of energy was dissipated by <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad with each step during walking. Peak deformation (10. 3 mm) approached that predicted for the limit of pain tolerance (10. 7 mm). Conclusion: These findings suggest <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad operates close to its pain threshold even at speeds encountered during barefoot walking and provides insight as to why barefoot runners may adopt ‘forefoot’ strike patterns that minimize heel loading...|$|R
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{contributor to}} Haglund's deformity {{is a tendency}} to walk on the outside of <b>the</b> <b>heel.</b> This tendency, which produces wear on {{the outer edge of the}} sole of the shoe, causes <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> to rotate inward, resulting in a grinding of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> bone against <b>the</b> tendon.

5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses {{is a tendency to}} trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of <b>the</b> <b>heels.</b>|$|E

For the next fifty years, Mysore passed under the rule of successive British Commissioners; Sir Mark Cubbon, renowned for his statesmanship, served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient and successful administrative system which left Mysore a well-developed state.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> human <b>heel</b> pad {{is subject}} to {{repetitive}} loading and {{plays an important role}} in absorbing shocks which may cause injuries. <b>The</b> <b>heel</b> pad has a composite biological structure consisting of the fat pad and the skin. The fat pad tissue is organised into a superficial micro-chamber layer and a deep macro-chamber layer. <b>The</b> <b>heel</b> pad sub-layers have different structures and properties. Hence, to understand the contribution of each layer to <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> problem, it is essential to develop a model with discrete structure. Currently, only plantar pressure measurements are used for diagnosis and treatment of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> problems, whereas it has been shown that high internal tissue stress is an important factor. Because of complex geometry, discrete structure and nonlinear material behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad, <b>the</b> external force applied to <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> may result in inhomogeneous internal stress condition. Therefore, the relationship between the plantar pressure and internal stress does not seem to be simple. Since there is no equipment to allow measurement of internal stress, a detailed multi-layered FE model of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad can be used as a solution to predict the internal stress. The main objective of this work was to obtain the hyperelastic and viscoelastic material properties of <b>the</b> subject-specific <b>heel</b> pad sub-layers in-vivo. For this purpose, a combined methodology of finite element modeling and experimentation was developed. An anatomically detailed 3 D FE model of <b>the</b> human <b>heel</b> area was developed using MR images of the right foot of a female subject. A combined ultrasound and indentation system was used to apply series of slow and rapid compression tests on the same foot. The forcestrain responses of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad and its sub-layers were used as input to the FE model to estimate properties of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad sub-layers using inverse FEA. The hyperelastic and viscoelastic FE models were then implemented to investigate the effects of experimental and geometrical factors on <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad responses. <b>The</b> model was also used to assess the robustness of the hyperelastic FE model when predicting the behaviour of other heels with different geometries. Finally, this model was used with Taguchi method to evaluate the effect of footwear design factors on the compressive stress in <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad tissue. There were some key limitations in this study. For example, the properties of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad sub-layers were estimated only for a specific heel pad. Also, whilst it is preferred to use xviii automatic segmentation and solid modeling to improve repeatability of some FE processes, some parts of the modeling process were performed manually...|$|R
