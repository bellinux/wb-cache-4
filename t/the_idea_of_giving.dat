5|$|The Gore letter did spur some {{progress}} in negotiations, as the Soviet Union allowed in late November 1958 for explicit control measures {{to be included}} in the text of the drafted treaty. By March 1959, the negotiators had agreed upon seven treaty articles, but they primarily concerned uncontroversial issues and a number of disputes over verification persisted. First, the Soviet verification proposal was deemed by the West to be too reliant on self-inspection, with control posts primarily staffed by citizens of the country housing the posts and a minimal role for officials from the international supervisory body. The West insisted that half of a control post staff be drawn from another nuclear state and half from neutral parties. Second, the Soviet Union required that the international supervisory body, the Control Commission, require unanimity before acting; the West rejected <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> Moscow a veto over the Commission's proceedings. Finally, the Soviet Union preferred temporary inspection teams drawn from citizens of the country under inspection, while the West insisted on permanent teams composed of inspectors from the Control Commission.|$|E
5|$|At {{about ten}} years of age, Narayan learned the basics of dhrupad, the oldest genre of Hindustani {{classical}} music, by studying and imitating the practice of sarangi player Uday Lal of Udaipur, a student of dhrupad singers Allabande and Zakiruddin Dagar. After Uday Lal died of old age, Narayan met travelling singer Madhav Prasad, originally of Lucknow, who had performed at the court of Maihar. With Prasad, Narayan enacted the ganda bandhan, a traditional ceremony of acceptance between a teacher and his pupil, in which Narayan swore obedience in exchange for being maintained by Prasad. He served Prasad and was taught in khyal, the predominate genre of Hindustani classical music, but returned to Udaipur after four years to teach music school. Prasad later visited Narayan and convinced him to resign his position and dedicate his time to improvement as a musician, although <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> up a steady life was not well received by Narayan's family. He stayed with Prasad and travelled to several Indian states until Prasad fell ill and advised him to learn from singer Abdul Wahid Khan in Lahore. Following Prasad's death in Lucknow, Narayan enacted the ganda bandhan with another teacher who gave him lessons, but soon left for Lahore and never performed the ritual again.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} film, when Gizmo multiplied, his off-spring closely resembled himself, {{except for the}} leader, Stripe. Here, the four mogwai Gizmo {{produces}} each possess their own distinct personalities and physical features. Additionally, each mogwai has a name, although the names {{were used in the}} script and never spoken aloud in the film. Two of the mogwais were George, black without a stripe and a caricature of Edward G. Robinson, and Lenny, buck-toothed, named for the principal characters in Of Mice and Men, whom they resemble in both appearance and demeanor. Daffy was named for his manic behaviour, and the leader, Mohawk, for his mohawk hairstyle. Based on the original film's character, Stripe, Frank Welker also voices Mohawk. While both the mogwai and gremlin versions of Stripe had fur stripes, Baker hit upon <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> the Mohawk mogwai a fur stripe and giving the Mohawk gremlin something scalier. Gizmo was also redesigned; the puppet was generally larger and its design was simplified. Dante commented Gizmo may look less real in Gremlins 2, but the result was that Gizmo could convey more emotion.|$|E

The award trophy was created by Jack McKnight and Ben Jason in 1953, based on the design of hood ornaments of 1950s cars. It consisted of a finned rocket ship on a wooden base. Each subsequent trophy, {{with the exception of the}} 1958 trophy, has been similar to the original design. The rocket trophy was formally redesigned in 1984, and since then only the base of the trophy has changed each year.

His plan for [...] "Tapestry" [...] was to follow a similar path to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, but with Q playing a similar role to the three ghosts in Dickens' story. Moore envisaged three stages to the story, one where Picard is attacked and needs an artificial heart, another with Picard as a child and a third based on the USS Stargazer. He pitched the idea to executive producer Michael Piller, who wasn't enthusiastic about the premise. The combination of that disapproval and the expected cost of filming because of the additional sets required meant that the episode had to be trimmed.|$|E

500|$|Homer Jay Simpson, {{voiced by}} Dan Castellaneta, is {{the protagonist of}} the show {{and the father of}} the Simpson family. He embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, thoughtless and a {{borderline}} alcoholic. He has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever the situation calls for it, and an integrity reflecting his own values, including a fierce devotion to and protectiveness of his family. His voice started out as an impression of Walter Matthau but eventually evolved into a more robust voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions. Homer has since {{become one of the most}} influential fictional characters and has been described by the UK newspaper The Sunday Times as the greatest comedic creation of modern time. He has inspired an entire line of merchandise, and his catchphrase, the annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!", has been included in the Oxford English Dictionary. During the production of the episode Insane Clown Poppy the writers toyed with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> Homer a long lost legitimate biological daughter, but when the shows showrunner and writer Mike Scully, as well as Matt Groening rejected the idea, the writers changed the story so the clown Krusty would be the one who finds he has a lost daughter.|$|E
500|$|However, it was {{not until}} 1978's seminal Space Invaders, created by Nishikado at Japan's Taito Corporation, that the shooter genre became prolific. Space Invaders pitted the player against {{multiple}} enemies descending {{from the top of the}} screen at a constantly increasing rate of speed. The game used alien creatures inspired by The War of the Worlds (by H. G. Wells) because the developers were unable to render the movement of aircraft; in turn, the aliens replaced human enemies because of moral concerns (regarding the portrayal of killing humans) on the part of Taito Corporation. As with subsequent shoot 'em ups of the time, the game was set in space as the available technology only permitted a black background. The game also introduced <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> the player a number of [...] "lives". Space Invaders was a massive commercial success, causing a coin shortage in Japan, and gaining mainstream popularity in America. It popularised a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player-controlled cannon's movement, and it was the first video game to popularise the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. The aliens of Space Invaders return fire at the protagonist, making them the first arcade game targets to do so. It set the template for the shoot 'em up genre, and has influenced most shooting games released since then.|$|E

[...] by John Legend, [...] "Ancora Qui" [...] by Ennio Morricone and Elisa, and [...] "Freedom" [...] by Anthony Hamilton and Elayna Boynton. The theme, [...] "Django", was also the theme song of the 1966 film. Musician Frank Ocean wrote an original song for the film's soundtrack, but it was rejected by Tarantino, who explained that [...] "Ocean wrote a fantastic ballad that was truly lovely and poetic in every way, there just wasn't a scene for it." [...] Frank Ocean later published the song, entitled [...] "Wiseman", on his Tumblr blog. The film also features a few famous pieces of western classical music, including Beethoven's [...] "FÃ¼r Elise" [...] and [...] "Dies Irae" [...] from Verdi's Requiem. Tarantino has stated that he avoids using full scores of original music: [...] "I just don't like <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> that much power to anybody {{on one of my}} movies." [...] The film's soundtrack album was released on December 18, 2012. Ennio Morricone made statements criticizing Tarantino's use of his music in Django Unchained and stated that he would [...] "never work" [...] with the director after this film, but later agreed to compose an original film score for Tarantino's The Hateful Eight in 2015. In a scholarly essay on the film's music, Hollis Robbins notes {{that the vast majority of}} film music borrowings come from films made between 1966 and 1974 and argues that the political and musical resonances of these allusions situate Django Unchained squarely in the Vietnam and Watergate era, during the rise and decline of Black Power cinema. Jim Croce's hit I Got A Name was featured in the soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|As the dialogue-integrated [...] "tutorial" [...] in {{the first}} Ace Attorney was well received, the {{inclusion}} of one in Justice for All was considered a [...] "major point". While the first game's tutorial involved Phoenix being helped through his first trial by his mentor Mia and the judge, this {{could not be used}} twice, which led to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> Phoenix a temporary amnesia from a blow to the head. Takumi included a circus and magic in the game's third episode; he really wanted to do this, as performing magic is a hobby of his. The episode includes two themes that he wanted to explore: the difficulties in forming a cohesive team with different people, and a person who against the odds tries to make something whole. The former was reflected in how the circus members come together at the end, while the latter was reflected in the character Moe. Several different versions of the fourth episode were created, partially because of them running out of memory on the game's cartridge, but also because of the popularity of the character of Miles Edgeworth: Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes, but when they were in full production the development team learned that the character had become popular, which led to Takumi feeling that he had to use the character more carefully and sparingly. Because of this, he created the character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he â€“ a supposed prodigy â€“ loses every case. The character Pearl Fey was originally intended to be a rival character around the same age as Maya, only appearing in the game's second episode; one of the game's designers suggested that it would be more dramatic if she were much younger, so Takumi wrote her as an eight-year-old. As he ended up liking her, he included her in other episodes as well.|$|E
