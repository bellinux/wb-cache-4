In-house code is {{developed in the}} C++ environment and the characteristics of four-stage turbines with inter-heating are analyzed in terms of maximum thermal efficiency, maximum exergy efficiency and maximum work output over the inlet temperature range of 293 K– 793 K with inlet pressure of 70 bar.

40|$|When a {{flexible}} structure {{is to be}} controlled actively, optimum performance is obtained by integrated, or simultaneous, <b>design</b> of <b>the</b> structure and the controller, {{as opposed to the}} common practice of <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> structure independently of control consideration and then designing a controller for a fixed structure. <b>The</b> primary <b>design</b> <b>objective</b> from <b>the</b> structural point of view usually is to minimize weight, while <b>the</b> control <b>design</b> <b>objectives</b> depend on <b>the</b> application. An important requirement for a practical control system is robustness with respect to uncertain plant parameters. This paper discusses simultaneous control/structure <b>design</b> when <b>the</b> overall <b>design</b> <b>objective</b> combines <b>the</b> weight of the structure and the robustness of the closed-loop control system.

50|$|Already when {{evaluating}} potential architectures, 1D simulation should {{be combined with}} models of control software, as the electronic control unit (ECU) will {{play a crucial role}} in achieving and maintaining the right balance between functional performance aspects when the product will operate. During this phase, engineers cascade down <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>objectives</b> to precise targets for subsystems and components. They use multi-domain optimization and design trade-off techniques. The controls need to be included in this process. By combining them with the system models in MiL simulations, potential algorithms can be validated and selected. In practice, MiL involves co-simulation between virtual controls from dedicated controller modeling software and scalable 1D models of the multi-physical system. This provides the right combination of accuracy and calculation speed for investigation of concepts and strategies, as well as controllability assessment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new front {{propagation}} method to deal accurately with the challenging problem of tracking non-rigid moving objects. This is obtained by employing a Geodesic Active Region model where <b>the</b> <b>designed</b> <b>objective</b> function {{is composed of}} boundary and region-based terms and optimizes the curve position with respect to motion and intensity properties. The main novelty of our approach is that {{we deal with the}} motion estimation #linear models are assumed# and the tracking problem simultaneously. In other words, the optimization problem contains a coupled set of unknown variables; the curve position and the corresponding motion model. <b>The</b> <b>designed</b> <b>objective</b> function is minimized using a gradient descent method; the curve is propagated towards the object boundaries under the in#uence of boundary, intensity and motion-based forces, while given the curve position an analytical solution is obtained for the motion model. Besides, the PDE is implemented using a level set approach where topological changes are naturally handled. Very promising experimental results are provided using real video sequences...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) algorithm for optimal design of damage tolerant structures. The proposed ESO algorithm uses fracture strength as <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>objective.</b> <b>The</b> formulation outlined {{here can be}} used for shape optimisation of structures and allows for cracks to be located along the entire structural boundary. In this work we use an approximate method for evaluating the stress intensity factors associated with the cracks. This extended ESO algorithm is illustrated using the problem of <b>the</b> optimal shape <b>design</b> of a [`]cutout&# 039; in a rectangular plate under biaxial loading and <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of a shoulder fillet under uniaxial tension. It is found that this method reduced the maximum stress intensity factor for the optimum shape and produced a near uniform level of fracture criticality around the boundary. It is also shown that the shapes optimised for stress and fracture strength may differ. This highlights the need to explicitly include fracture parameters in <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>objective</b> function. <b>The</b> results agreed well with those reported in the literature using a biological method...|$|R

Its 120mm rifled ammunition promised greater accuracy and range.|$|E

[...] The water is heated and then routed into a reduced-pressure {{flash evaporation}} [...] "stage" [...] where some of the water flashes into steam. This steam is subsequently condensed into salt-free water. The residual salty liquid from that first stage is introduced into a second flash evaporation stage at a pressure lower than the first stage pressure. More water is flashed into steam which is also subsequently condensed into more salt-free water. This sequential use of multiple flash evaporation stages is continued until <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>objectives</b> of the system are met. A large part of the world's installed desalination capacity uses multi-stage flash distillation. Typically such plants have 24 or more sequential stages of flash evaporation.|$|E
