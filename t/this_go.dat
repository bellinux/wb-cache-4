No.613), introducing reservations in the Madras Presidency, was passed. <b>This</b> <b>G.O.</b> had {{its impact}} {{mainly in the}} field of education. In 1923, the Government passed a second order decrreeing that endowments to universities would be cut if they did not permit the admission of scheduled castes. The admission procedure in the Universities were also heavily altered removing the necessity of a knowledge of Sanskrit for admission to medical colleges.|$|E
25|$|Passenger rail {{service in}} Markham is {{provided}} by the GO Transit Stouffville line, which is a commuter rail line stretching from Lincolnville to downtown Toronto. The line operates only at rush hour and uses tracks owned by Metrolinx, the provincial transit agency. Five stations on the Stouffville line serve Markham, of which 4 are within the municipal borders. Metrolinx announced in 2015 that the Stouffville Line would get an expansion in service, bringing all day both directional trains from Union Station to Unionville GO Station. Markham's section of <b>this</b> <b>GO</b> line also came under the spotlight in 2015 as City of Toronto Mayor John Tory's announced SMART Track plan for rapid transit expansion in Toronto includes the rail spur between Union Station and the Unionville GO.|$|E
25|$|Back in town, at {{the local}} tavern, Gaston sulks at his loss of a bride. LeFou and the patrons attempt to cheer him up ("Gaston"), when Maurice rushes in {{claiming}} a Beast has Belle locked away, they laugh at him but Gaston formulates a plan ("Gaston (Reprise)"). Back at the castle, the Beast grows impatient as Belle has yet to join him for dinner. Cogsworth informs him she refuses to come, after a shouting match between Belle and the Beast (which ends in a victory for Belle) he tells her if she cannot eat with him then she will not eat at all. In his quarters, he sulks and notes his fate should the spell not break ("How Long Must <b>This</b> <b>Go</b> On?"). Eventually, Belle does become hungry and ventures into the kitchen where the servants offer her dinner despite their master's orders. They treat her to an amazing cabaret show ("Be Our Guest").|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} 1913 and 1914 Braque and Picasso {{attempted}} {{to eliminate the}} use of color as chiaroscuro, which had still persisted to some extent in their painting, by amalgamating painting and sculpture. Instead of having to demonstrate through shadows how one plane stands above, or {{in front of a}} second plane, they could now superimpose the planes one on the other and illustrate the relationship directly. The first attempts to do <b>this</b> <b>go</b> far back. Picasso had already begun such an enterprise in 1909, but since he did it within the limits of closed form, it was destined to fail. It resulted in a kind of colored bas-relief. Only in open planal form could this union of painting and sculpture be realized. Despite current prejudice, this endeavor to increase plastic expression through the collaboration of the two arts must be warmly approved; an enrichment of the plastic arts is certain to result from it. A number of sculptors like Lipchitz, Laurens and Archipenko have since taken up and developed this sculpto-painting.|$|E
