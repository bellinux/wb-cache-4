In today´s society human being make more interaction with technology in their daily life than before. It can be an easy way to use that technology to increase the social interaction among human beings. Many attempts were made and also some ongoing projects try to use the Smart Phone as a tool to increase the social interaction among strangers. In <b>my</b> <b>designed</b> project I also developed such software which will work along with the Smart Phone, to enhance the social interaction among strangers. In <b>my</b> <b>designed</b> application I have tried to design the functionalities which {{can be used in a}} public place i. e. café or bar and by using this application people can be able to interact with strangers easily, discover new people as friends and finally can be able to increase social interaction.

40|$|A thesis {{project is}} the final test of the {{theories}} and processes which have been developed over {{the first four years}} of architecture school. This book will follow the processes and discuss the theories which I used In successfully completing my particular project. My project is a performing arts center for Coronado, California. This 90, 000 sq. ft. facility is located in a resort/ retirement community of about 20, 000 people. Additional information provided in the program and site analysis will establish a sound basis for understanding the project. This book is broken down into the steps that I followed during <b>my</b> <b>design</b> process. The first half is devoted to the steps involved in problem definition. An extensive amount of research and analysis was done before any final conclusions could be drawn.

40|$|The concept behind <b>my</b> <b>design</b> was {{to create}} an {{establishment}} which addressed both {{the high levels of}} unemployment within Jerusalem and the constant flood of people migrating into the city. <b>My</b> <b>design</b> encompasses a trade school which will provide necessary tertiary education opportunities to the wider community in conjunction with a temporary housing apartment complex which will provide much needed housing for students and possibly permanent residence. <b>My</b> <b>design</b> is focuses on angles which has created many unique spaces and openings. This has achieved a desired tactile or textual aesthetic, as the buildings invite you to focus on their angles and sharp, clean edges. This idea is further enhanced as the buildings materials, mostly glass and Jerusalem stone create clean, smooth surfaces which contrast their abrasive surroundings. Repetition of shape and line also adds a unique quality to <b>my</b> <b>design,</b> as the linear ribs on the horizontal plane offset the strong vertical elements. Repetition of design features has also achieved unity between the two building complexes. For instance the long, open towers that define the temporary housing building are juxtaposed with the short, compact complex which houses the trade school. Although very different they are unified by the common use of shape and line. Circulation plays a vital role in the <b>design</b> of <b>my</b> buildings. One of the predominant circulation features incorporates a linear horizontal spine that moves through and connects both buildings. This channel functions not only as a passage for people to move from one building to the other but also provides a visual link as to unify the buildings. 	In all <b>my</b> <b>design</b> employs unique repetition, innovation of shape, strategic circulation programs and aesthetics of contrast to achieve both an individual yet functional establishment within the heart of Jerusalem.
