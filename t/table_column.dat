2500|$|Various fairly {{standardized}} {{abbreviations for}} vaccine names have developed, although the standardization {{is by no}} means centralized or global. For example, the vaccine names used in the United States have well-established abbreviations that are also widely known and used elsewhere. An extensive list of them provided in a sortable table and freely accessible, is available at a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web page. The page explains that [...] "The abbreviations [...] this <b>table</b> (<b>Column</b> 3) were standardized jointly by staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ACIP Work Groups, the editor of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the editor of Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (the Pink Book), ACIP members, and liaison organizations to the ACIP." [...] Some examples are [...] "DTaP" [...] for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, [...] "DT" [...] for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and [...] "Td" [...] for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. At its page on tetanus vaccination, the CDC further explains that [...] "Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case 'd' and 'p' denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism." [...] Another list of established vaccine abbreviations is at the CDC's page called [...] "Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations", with abbreviations used on U.S. immunization records. The United States Adopted Name system has some conventions for the word order of vaccine names, placing head nouns first and adjectives postpositively. This is why the USAN for [...] "OPV" [...] is [...] "poliovirus vaccine live oral" [...] rather than [...] "oral poliovirus vaccine".|$|E

50|$|Within {{each group}} (each {{periodic}} <b>table</b> <b>column)</b> of metals, reactivity increases with each lower {{row of the}} table (from a light element to a heavier element), because a heavier element has more electron shells than a lighter element; a heavier element's valence electrons exist at higher principal quantum numbers (they are {{farther away from the}} nucleus of the atom, and are thus at higher potential energies, which means they are less tightly bound).|$|E
