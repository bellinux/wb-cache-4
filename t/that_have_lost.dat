5|$|Amanita australis {{mushrooms}} <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their warts {{and have}} had the colours faded may resemble another New Zealand species, A.nothofagi. The two species may be distinguished reliably using microscopy—A.nothofagi does not have clamp connections {{at the base of}} the basidia, unlike A.australis.A.australis also bears some resemblance to the eastern North American and east Asian species A.abrupta, which also has an abruptly bulbous stem base.|$|E
5|$|Barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould {{species of}} the order Echinosteliales, and the only {{species of the}} genus Barbeyella. First {{described}} in 1914 from the Jura mountains, its habitat is restricted to montane spruce and spruce-fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere, {{where it has been}} recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America. It typically colonises slimy, algae-covered logs <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their bark and have been partially to completely covered by liverworts. The sporangia are roughly spherical, up to 0.2mm in diameter, and supported by a thin stalk up to 0.7mm tall. After the spores have developed, the walls of the sporangia split open into lobes. The species is one of the smallest members of the Myxogastria and is considered rare.|$|E
5|$|Mallards usually form pairs (in October and November in the Northern Hemisphere) {{until the}} female lays eggs {{at the start}} of the nesting season, which is around the {{beginning}} of spring. At this time she is left by the male who joins up with other males to await the moulting period, which begins in June (in the Northern Hemisphere). During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female mallards <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> or abandoned their previous clutch, replacement clutch) or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings.|$|E

5|$|Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, {{meaning it}} obtains {{nutrients}} from decomposing organic matter. It grows scattered or clustered {{in small groups}} on rotting hardwoods, such as basswood, maple, and especially elm; in Europe it is known to grow on horse chestnut. The mushroom prefers low-lying logs {{in areas that are}} periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas shaded by forest canopy. A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood, it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their bark. R. palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn in the United States, or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.|$|E

25|$|Cancer {{cells are}} cells <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> {{their ability to}} divide in a {{controlled}} fashion. A malignant tumor consists of a population of rapidly dividing and growing cancer cells that progressively accrues mutations. However, tumors need a dedicated blood supply to provide the oxygen and other essential nutrients they require in order to grow beyond a certain size (generally 1–2mm3).|$|E

25|$|Alloparenting {{behaviour}} {{is frequently}} observed. Non-breeding and failed breeders show {{great interest in}} other chicks, and will attempt to brood or feed them. This activity is more common as the chicks get older and begin to explore their ledge. There {{has also been a}} record of a pair managing to raise two chicks. Adults <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> chicks or eggs will sometimes bring fish to the nest site and try to feed their imaginary chick.|$|E
25|$|Among the mammals <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> {{the ability}} to {{synthesize}} vitamin C are simians and tarsiers, which together make up one of two major primate suborders, Haplorrhini. This group includes humans. The other more primitive primates (Strepsirrhini) have {{the ability to}} make vitamin C. Synthesis does not occur in a number of species (perhaps all species) in the small rodent family Caviidae that includes guinea pigs and capybaras, but occurs in other rodents (rats and mice do not need vitamin C in their diet, for example).|$|E

40|$|In vitro {{metabolism}} of panomifene (E- 1, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -[4 -(2 -(2 -hy-droxyethyl-amino) -ethoxy) -phenyl]- 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropene), a novel antiestrogen against hormone dependent tumors, {{has been}} inves-tigated using liver microsomes from mouse, rat, dog, and human. Hydroxylation and side chain modifications were the routes of panomifene metabolism. Microsomal biotransformation showed some qualitative similarities, but several differences were ob-served in the metabolic {{profiles of the}} four species tested. Seven metabolites were detected in the incubation mixtures analyzed by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography, although {{there was only one}} produced by all species <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> the side chain. Among the side chain shortened metabolites, the compound <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> the hydroxyethyl-amino group was formed by the micro-somal system of rodents, whereas the one <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> the hy-droxyethyl group was detected in the incubation mixtures with rat...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the common}} use, an orphan {{does not have}} any {{surviving}} parent to care for him or her. However, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), and other groups label any child <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> one parent as an orphan. In this approach, a maternal orphan is a child whose mother has died, a paternal orphan is a child whose father has died, and a double orphan is a child who <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> both parents. [...] This contrasts with the older use of half-orphan to describe children <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> only one parent.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes a {{ghost town}} {{consists}} of many abandoned buildings as in Bodie, California, or standing ruins as in Rhyolite, Nevada, while elsewhere only the foundations of former buildings remain as in Graysonia, Arkansas. Old mining camps <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> most of their population at some stage of their history such as Aspen, Deadwood, Oatman, Tombstone and Virginia City are {{sometimes referred to as}} ghost towns although they are presently active towns and cities. Many U.S. ghost towns, such as South Pass City in Wyoming are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{and another}} activist {{were sentenced to}} three years in prison in 1974, paroled after 12 months. In 1976 Lee brought {{together}} the remaining Band of Mercy activists along with some fresh faces to start a leaderless resistance movement, calling it the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). ALF activists see themselves as a modern Underground Railroad, passing animals removed from farms and laboratories to sympathetic veterinarians, safe houses and sanctuaries. Some activists also engage in threats, intimidation, and arson, acts <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> the movement sympathy in mainstream public opinion.|$|E
25|$|The {{criteria}} of significance {{are applied to}} nominated structures {{in much the same}} fashion as they are for buildings. The basic structural elements must all be intact; no individual parts of the structure are eligible for separate inclusion on the NRHP. An example would be a truss bridge being considered for inclusion. Said truss bridge is composed of metal or wooden truss, abutments and supporting piers; for the property to be considered eligible for the Register, all of these elements must be extant. Structures <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their historic configuration or pattern of organization through demolition or deterioration, much like buildings, are considered ruins and classified as sites.|$|E

25|$|Hoods {{comprise}} {{two basic}} patterns: full shape or simple shape. The traditional full-shape hood {{consists of a}} cape, cowl, and liripipe, as is used at Cambridge. At Oxford, the bachelors' and masters' hoods use simple hoods <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their cape and retain only the cowl and liripipe. Some universities only have a cape and cowl and no liripipe or just consist a cape only; these are classed separately under the Aberdeen shape style. Various other universities have different shapes and patterns of hoods, in some cases corresponding to the pattern current at the ancient universities {{at the time when}} they were founded, and in others representing a completely new design.|$|E
25|$|Human skin {{has a low}} permeability; that is, most foreign {{substances}} {{are unable}} to penetrate and diffuse through the skin. Skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum, is an effective barrier to most inorganic nanosized particles. This protects the body from external particles such as toxins by not allowing them to {{come into contact with}} internal tissues. However, in some cases it is desirable to allow particles entry to the body through the skin. Potential medical applications of such particle transfer has prompted developments in nanomedicine and biology to increase skin permeability. One application of transcutaneous particle delivery could be to locate and treat cancer. Nanomedical researchers seek to target the epidermis and other layers of active cell division where nanoparticles can interact directly with cells <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their growth-control mechanisms (cancer cells). Such direct interaction could be used to more accurately diagnose properties of specific tumors or to treat them by delivering drugs with cellular specificity.|$|E
