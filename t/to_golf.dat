The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.|$|E

5|$|Strong {{was born}} on 13 February 1880 in Ramsgate, Kent, England, to William R. Strong (1846–1899) and Charlotte E. Strong née Stock (1850–1923). Like many golfers from his era, he was first {{introduced}} <b>to</b> <b>golf</b> via his participation as a caddie when he toted bags at Royal St George's Golf Club located in Sandwich, England, in the mid-1890s. In 1905 he emigrated to the United States, departing Liverpool on 14 June 1905 aboard the RMS Teutonic which arrived in New York on 22 June 1905 with $400 in his pocket, a hefty sum at the time.|$|E

5|$|At 1:50p.m. CDT (18:50UTC), the SPC {{issued a}} tornado watch for {{northern}} and central Illinois, far northwestern Indiana, far southern Wisconsin, and portions of Lake Michigan. A 60% chance {{of two or}} more tornadoes was assessed across the watch box, with a 40% chance of at least one strong tornado. Isolated shower activity began forming across the region just prior to the issuance of watch, eventually growing into a line of strong to severe thunderstorms, including supercells. One such high-precipitation supercell was first severe warned at 6:11p.m. CDT (23:11UTC); the National Weather Service office in Chicago, Illinois warned of winds up to 70mph (110km/h) and quarter- <b>to</b> <b>golf</b> ball-sized hail. The weather forecast office upgraded the severe thunderstorm warning to a tornado warning at 6:35p.m. CDT (23:35UTC), and four minutes later, trained storm spotters reported a damaging tornado north of Ashton.

5|$|Often {{considered}} by commentators {{to be the}} benchmark against which other batsmen are compared for attractive, graceful batting, Palairet won many plaudits for his style. In his book, The Jubilee Book of Cricket, Ranjitsinhji includes a number of staged photographs of Palairet playing his shots, and describes his methods in places, using them as the model which young players should adopt. He played predominantly off the front foot, and tended to be less effective on soft pitches. He favoured shots on the off side, particularly the off drive and cover drive. During Palairet's career, bowlers favoured a tactic, known as off theory, of bowling the ball just outside the off stump. The strength of Palairet's off side strokes helped him to score effectively against this tactic. Fry suggests that the early practice that Palairet gained against Attewell and Martin, who bowled accurately at the stumps, was {{a key factor in}} limiting his range of leg side shots. He favoured lofted shots which were often compared <b>to</b> <b>golf</b> strokes.|$|E
