5|$|A {{series of}} {{disturbing}} events troubled Monteverdi's {{world in the}} period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. <b>The</b> <b>plague</b> was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and {{over a period of}} 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. <b>The</b> <b>plague</b> and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect on the economy and artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from <b>the</b> <b>plague.</b>|$|E

5|$|Josquin did {{not stay}} in Ferrara long. An {{outbreak}} of <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> {{in the summer}} of 1503 prompted the evacuation of the Duke and his family, as well as two-thirds of the citizens, and Josquin left by April of the next year, possibly also to escape <b>the</b> <b>plague.</b> His replacement, Jacob Obrecht, died of <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> {{in the summer of}} 1505, to be replaced by Antoine Brumel in 1506, who stayed until the disbanding of the chapel in 1510.|$|E
50|$|The {{next few}} centuries {{were marked by}} several {{localized}} or regional outbreaks of lesser severity. <b>The</b> Great <b>Plague</b> of Milan (1629-1631), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> of Seville (1647), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> of London (1665-1666), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> of Vienna (1679), Great Baltic <b>plague</b> (1708-1712), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> of Marseille (1720), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> of 1738, and Caragea's <b>Plague</b> (1813-1814) were <b>the</b> last major outbreaks of <b>the</b> bubonic <b>plague</b> in Europe.|$|R

25|$|In {{his book}} <b>The</b> <b>Plagues</b> of Egypt: Archaeology, History, and Science Look at the Bible, Siro Igino Trevisanato explores {{the theory that}} <b>the</b> <b>plagues</b> were {{initially}} caused by the Santorini eruption in Greece. His hypothesis considers a two-stage eruption over a time of a bit less than two years. His studies place the first eruption in 1602 BC, when volcanic ash taints the Nile, causing <b>the</b> first <b>plague</b> and forming a catalyst for many of <b>the</b> subsequent <b>plagues.</b> In 1600 BC, the plume of a Santorini eruption caused <b>the</b> ninth <b>plague,</b> <b>the</b> days of darkness. Trevisanato hypothesizes that the Egyptians (at that time under the occupation of Hyksos), resorted to human sacrifice {{in an attempt to}} appease the gods, for they had viewed <b>the</b> ninth <b>plague</b> as a precursor to more. This human sacrifice became known as <b>the</b> tenth <b>plague.</b>|$|R

25|$|In visual art, <b>the</b> <b>plagues</b> have {{generally}} been reserved for works in series, especially engravings. Still, relatively few depictions in art emerged compared to other religious themes until the 19th century, when <b>the</b> <b>plagues</b> became more common subjects, with John Martin and Joseph Turner producing notable canvases. This trend probably reflected a Romantic attraction to landscape and nature painting, for which <b>the</b> <b>plagues</b> were suited, a Gothic attraction to morbid stories, and a rise in Orientalism, wherein exotic Egyptian themes found currency. Given the importance of noble patronage throughout Western art history, <b>the</b> <b>plagues</b> may have found consistent disfavor because the stories emphasize the limits of a monarch's power, and images of lice, locusts, darkness, and boils were ill-suited for decoration in palaces and churches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band was}} {{inspired}} {{for the song}} by {{the second half of}} the film The Ten Commandments, which is based upon the Bible tale of <b>the</b> <b>plagues</b> which were bestowed upon the Egyptians.

[...] The band liked the sound of [...] "creeping death" [...] and decided to write a song about <b>the</b> <b>plagues,</b> with <b>the</b> phrase as its title.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Plagues</b> were an American garage {{rock band}} from Lansing, Michigan who {{were active in}} the 1960s (not to be {{confused}} with other bands of the period named [...] "the Plagues"). They were led by bass player, principal songwriter, and vocalist William Malone. The group had a local and regional hit with [...] "I’ve Been Through It Before". Malone left the band in 1966 to join the Frightened Trees, as the remaining members formed a new group out of the ashes of <b>the</b> <b>Plagues,</b> <b>the</b> Plain Brown Wrapper. Malone later became a successful Hollywood movie director, whose 2008 horror thriller Parasomnia included [...] "I’ve Been Through It Before", as well as other songs by <b>the</b> <b>Plagues</b> and other 1960s garage bands. In the intervening years <b>the</b> <b>Plagues</b> work has attracted a following amongst garage rock enthusiasts and collectors.|$|R
5|$|In 429 BC during <b>the</b> <b>Plague</b> of Athens, Pericles {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} his sister and of both his legitimate sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, from his first wife. With his morale undermined, he burst into tears, and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the more striking in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides. Pericles died of <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E

5|$|Students {{publish a}} campus comedy magazine, <b>The</b> <b>Plague.</b> Like many college humor magazines, this often pokes fun at popular culture {{as well as}} campus life and the idiosyncrasies of New York University. <b>The</b> <b>Plague</b> was founded in 1978 by Howard Ostrowsky along with Amy Burns, John Rawlins, Joe Pinto and Dan Fiorella, and is {{currently}} published once per semester.

5|$|The {{demographic}} decline due to <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> had economic consequences: {{the prices}} of food dropped and land values declined by 30 to 40% {{in most parts of}} Europe between 1350 and 1400.
