5|$|The film {{features}} animation by American {{graphic designer}} and cartoonist Bill Plympton. To illustrate key concepts, Fuck uses sound bites, music, video clips and archival film footage; Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and twenty-two {{films in the}} documentary. The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear {{to be talking to}} each other; <b>the</b> <b>interviewees</b> in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>interviewees</b> in Nefarious include former traffickers, {{international}} humanitarian workers, social workers, psychologists, {{human rights}} experts, and former victims of human trafficking. Interviewees include Canadian journalist Victor Malarek, Jerusalem Institute of Justice founder Calev Myers, Christian therapist Dan Allender, clinical psychologist Melissa Farley, Amsterdam police official Piet Keesman, Baptist missionary Lauran Bethell, Agape International Missions founder Don Brewster, anti-trafficking activist Helen Sworn, former prostitute Annie Lobert, and Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg.|$|E
50|$|They {{define the}} {{three kinds of}} content as follows - {{situational}} content was described as interview questions that get information on how <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> would behave in specific situations presented by the interviewer. For example, a question that asks whether <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> would choose to report a coworker for behaving in an unethical way or just let them go. Job related questions, on the other hand, assess <b>the</b> <b>interviewee's</b> past behavior and job-related information. While psychological interviews include questions intended to assess <b>the</b> <b>interviewee's</b> personality traits such as their work ethic, dependability, honesty etc.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{interview}} {{styles to}} promote discussion between <b>interviewees</b> and <b>the</b> interviewers during member checks. The first, Confrontation Style is only effective {{when there is}} a trusted, warm, and open relationship between the interviewer and <b>the</b> <b>interviewee.</b> This style promotes discussion empowering <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> to have confidence to [...] "fight back" [...] when his/her opinion is questioned. The second, Dialogue and Power, focuses on the inherent power struggle between the interviewer and <b>the</b> <b>interviewee.</b> Interviewers must be aware of this imbalance of power and promote discussion from <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> by valuing opinions and reinforcing equal collaboration between the two.|$|R

5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All <b>the</b> <b>interviewees,</b> including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|Otaku often {{participate}} in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga otaku {{are the subject}} of numerous self-critical works, such as Otaku no Video, which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes fun at the otaku subculture and includes Gainax's own staff as <b>the</b> <b>interviewees.</b> Other works depict otaku subculture less critically, such as Genshiken and Comic Party. A well-known novel-cum-manga-cum-anime is Welcome to the N.H.K., which focuses on the subcultures popular with otaku and highlights other social outcasts such as the hikikomori and NEETs. Works that focus on an otaku character include WataMote, the story of an unattractive and unsociable otome game otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status. Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, Otaku Unite!, focuses on the American side of the otaku culture.|$|E
5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, noting that <b>the</b> <b>interviewees</b> were {{too old to}} thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

5000|$|The {{interpretation}} {{is seen in}} some approaches as co-created by not only the interviewer but also with help from <b>the</b> <b>interviewee,</b> as <b>the</b> researcher uses the interpretation given by <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> while also constructing their own meaning from the narrative.|$|R

25|$|The {{interviews}} highlight many intriguing {{aspects of}} the Japanese psyche. Work was a high, if not central, priority for most of <b>the</b> <b>interviewees.</b> Isolation, individualism, and lack of communication were also strong themes which were common throughout many accounts of the attacks. Many of <b>the</b> <b>interviewees</b> expressed disillusionment with the materialism in Japanese society and the sensationalistic media, {{as well as the}} inefficiency of the emergency response system in dealing with the attack.|$|E
25|$|While {{the book}} {{is made up of}} {{narratives}} from individuals of widely varying backgrounds, the stories share common themes, and together, they reveal many intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche and the values of Japanese society as a whole. In particular, they present an insight into the lifestyle and mentality of Japanese commuters (since the attacks occurred in the morning, nearly all of <b>the</b> <b>interviewees</b> were caught in the subway while making their morning commute).|$|E
25|$|Commissioner of the Police Andy Tsang {{confirmed}} the unprecedented {{challenges to the}} police posed by the occupations, and that as at 15 December a total of 955 individuals had been arrested, 221 activists had been hurt, and that 130 police officers had received light injuries. At the same time, Tsang anticipated further arrests, pending a three-month investigation into the occupation movement. Most activists call in under arrest by appointment remain to be formally charged, and although police said that they reserved the right to prosecute, pro-democracy legislators complained that the uncertain impending prosecution hangs over <b>the</b> <b>interviewees</b> constituted an act of intimidation.|$|E
50|$|Researching {{the company}} itself {{is also a}} good way for {{interviewees}} to impress lots of people during an interview. It shows the interviewer that <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> is not only knowledgeable about the company's goals and objectives, but also that <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> has done their homework and that they make a great effort when they are given an assignment. Researching about the company makes sure that employees are not entirely clueless about the company they are applying for, {{and at the end of}} <b>the</b> interview, <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> might ask some questions to the interviewer about the company, either to learn more information or to clarify on some points that they might have found during their research. In any case, it impresses the interviewer and it shows that <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> is willing to learn more about the company.|$|R
30|$|Interpretation {{validity}} {{occurs when}} the investigator has no influence over <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> answer, avoiding to guide the person to a desired response. Our interview protocol, which was rigorously followed, made {{very clear that the}} interviewer should speak as little as possible, making short questions and letting <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> express him/herself as freely as possible. Nevertheless, in our case, questions already contained concepts and vocabulary such as “startup ecosystem,” “ecosystem agents,” and “maturity model,” influencing <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> to believe that these paradigms were established. The interviewees’ responses can be biased by the few concepts about ecosystems presented to them during the interview.|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} studies {{conducted}} among the Muslim youth in various western European countries have showed that Muslim children have far more antisemitic ideas than Christian children- in 2011 Mark Elchardus, a Belgian sociologist, published a report on Dutch-language elementary schools in Brussels. He found that about 50 percent of Muslim students in second and third grade could be considered anti-Semites, versus 10% of others. In the same year Unther Jikeli published his findings from the 117 interviews he conducted with Muslim male youngsters (average age 19) in Berlin, Paris and London. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>interviewees</b> voiced some, or strong antisemitic feelings. They expressed them openly and often aggressively.|$|E
25|$|According {{to persons}} interviewed at the Pansio {{reception}} centre by national broadcaster Yle, the main suspect arrived to the centre in December 2016 and displayed radicalist behaviour during his stay, such as asking {{how he could}} join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), listening to radicalist sermons on his phone and considering Finns to be infidels. <b>The</b> <b>interviewees</b> warned the reception centre management of this behaviour in January 2017. Helsinki Times published similar interviews afterwards. Yle also reported {{that the police are}} currently monitoring approximately 100 young asylum seeker men in the Southwest Finland area and that the police believe the main suspect had radicalized fairly quickly during August; for example, his behaviour and clothing style had changed.|$|E

Transcripts of the interviews and the names of <b>the</b> <b>interviewees</b> were not released at the time the report was made public. It was estimated that the taxpayer-funded report cost more than $1 million. A separate section of the report rejected allegations by Hoboken's Mayor Dawn Zimmer that Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, director of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, had linked release of Hurricane Sandy relief funds to approval of a project represented by David Samson's law firm.|$|E

50|$|Ali G's {{interviews}} with celebrities (often politicians) gained notoriety {{partly because the}} subjects were not privy to the joke that Ali G, rather than being a real interviewer, was a comic character played by Baron Cohen. According to Rolling Stone magazine, Baron Cohen would always enter the interview area in character as Ali G, carrying equipment and appearing to be an unsuspecting crew member. He would arrive with a suited man, whom <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> naturally thought was the interviewer. Baron Cohen, as Ali G, would sit down to begin conducting the interview by asking <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> some preliminary questions. <b>The</b> <b>interviewee,</b> however, would remain {{under the impression that}} the smartly-dressed director would be conducting the interview until short notice prior to cameras rolling: this would grant an advantage of surprise, whereby <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> {{would be less likely to}} opt out of the Ali interview prior to its start.|$|R

25|$|Médecins Sans Frontières {{conducted}} a research survey in 2005 that found 11.6% of <b>the</b> <b>interviewees</b> {{who took part}} had been victims of sexual abuse since 1989. This empirical study found that witnesses to rape in Kashmir was comparatively far higher than the other conflict zones such as Sierra Lone and Sri Lanka. 63% of people had heard of rape and 13% of the people had witnessed a rape. Dr Seema Kazi holds the security forces more responsible for raping than militants due to rape by the former being larger in scale and frequency. In areas of militant activity the security forces use rape to destroy morale of Kashmiri resistance. Dr Seema Kazi says these rapes cannot be ignored as rare occurrences nor should be ignored the documented acknowledgement of individual soldiers that they were ordered to rape. Kazi explains rape in Kashmir as a cultural weapon of war: In the particular context of Kashmir where an ethnic Muslim minority population {{is subject to the}} repressive dominance of a predominantly Hindu State, the sexual appropriation of Kashmiri women by State security forces exploits the cultural logic of rape whereby the sexual dishonour of individual women is coterminous with the subjection and subordination of Kashmiri men and the community at large.Former Chief Justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court noted in his report on human rights in Kashmir: It is hard to escape the conclusion that the security forces who are overwhelmingly Hindu and Sikh, see it as their duty to beat an alien population into submission.|$|E

500|$|This {{and later}} {{articles}} in the Portuguese press, invariably followed up in the UK, made several allegations, based on no evidence, that would engulf the McCanns for years on social media.

Much was made of apparent inconsistencies within and between the McCanns' and Tapas Seven's statements. The police had asked the group questions in Portuguese, and an interpreter had translated the replies.

500|$|Burney and Ramilisonina {{admitted}} that the most parsimonious explanation for the sightings was that kidoky was a misidentified sifaka or other larger living lemur species.

[...] The possibility of a wild introduced baboon surviving in the forests could not be dismissed. [...] However, the descriptions of kidoky, with its terrestrial baboon-like gait, make Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur the most plausible candidates among the giant subfossil lemurs. [...] At the very least, the stories support a wider extinction window for the giant subfossil lemurs, suggesting that their extinction was recent enough for such vivid stories to still survive in the oral traditions of the Malagasy people.|$|E

Thesis: English Department, Faculty of Cultural Sciences, Sebelas Maret University. This {{research}} was conducted to analyze the power relations between participants, the interviewer (the host) and <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> (<b>the</b> guest) in The Oprah Winfrey Show episode of J. K. Rowling. In this research, the way how the participants in The Oprah Winfrey Show demonstrate their power was described. This research is a descriptive qualitative research. The data were collected by using criterion-based sampling. The source of data is the video of talk show “The Oprah Winfrey Show” taken from You Tube. The data in this research are all interactions during the interview which contains power struggle between participants. There are 23 data which were analyzed to reveal the power relation between the participants. Some results are found in this research. First, the relation between <b>the</b> interviewer and <b>interviewee</b> in <b>the</b> talk show is unequal. The interviewer dominates the interaction during <b>the</b> interview. <b>The</b> <b>interviewee</b> is restrained by {{the capabilities of the}} interviewer who is able to control the contribution of <b>the</b> <b>interviewee.</b> Second, some indicators of power which show the interviewer’s authority in controlling the interview are initiating the interaction, intiating the topic of the interaction, aligning the position of herself and the guest, providing questions, and performing interruptions. The interruptions are used by the interviewer to change the topic of the interviewer, to ask clarification, to give assessment, and to provide repairs. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> sometimes performs power struggles to gain power. <b>The</b> <b>interviewee</b> performs interruptions to take the control of the interview from the interviewer. In some occasion, <b>the</b> <b>interviewee</b> produces questions which cause a role-switching between the interviewer and <b>the</b> <b>interviewee.</b> However, <b>the</b> interviewer is always able to overcome the role-switching and retakes the control of the interviewe. Third, the interviewer is the one who has more power within the interview. The interviewer sets and maintains her position as the one who controls the interview within the talk show.
