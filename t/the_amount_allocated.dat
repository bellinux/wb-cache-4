Reed responded on 3 September with an offer, excluding armament, that exceeded <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>allocated</b> in the budget. Ueno signed the contracts {{for all three}} ships on 24 September despite this problem because Reed was scheduled to depart {{for a trip to}} Russia and the matter had to be concluded before his departure. Ueno had informed the Navy Ministry about the costs before signing, but Kawamura's response to postpone the order for the armored frigate did not arrive until 8 October. The totals for all three contracts came to £433,850 or ¥2,231,563 and did not include the armament. These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of £24,978. The government struggled to provide the necessary money even though the additional expenses had been approved by the Prime Minister's office on 5 June 1876, especially as more money was necessary to fully equip the ships for sea and to provision them for the delivery voyage to Japan.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution of Canada {{gives the}} federal {{government}} exclusive responsibility for national defence, and expenditures are thus outlined in the federal budget. For the 2007–2010 fiscal year, <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>allocated</b> for defence spending was C$6.15 billion which is 1.4 percent of the country's GDP. This regular funding was augmented in 2005 with an additional C$12.5 billion over five years, {{as well as a}} commitment to increasing regular force troop levels by 5,000 persons, and the primary reserve by 4,500 over the same period. In 2010, a further C$5.3 billion over five years was provided to allow for 13,000 more regular force members, and 10,000 more primary reserve personnel, as well as C$17.1 billion for the purchase of new trucks for the Canadian Army, transport aircraft and helicopters for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and joint support ships for the Royal Canadian Navy. In July 2010, the largest purchase in Canadian military history, totalling C$9billion for the acquisition of 65 F-35 fighters, was announced by {{the federal government}}. Canada is one of several nations that assisted {{in the development of the}} F-35 and has invested over C$168million in the program. In 2010, Canada's military expenditure totaled approximately C$122.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|The State Defense Order for 2009 was {{expected}} to amount to a record of RUB 1.2trillion, showing an increase of RUB 70billion from the previous year. The order {{was expected}} to be raised by a further RUB 40billion for 2010, and by RUB 60billion for 2011. In total, the state plans to spend $128billion in military procurement in the 2009–2011 period. Military-Industrial Commission of Russia is responsible for supervising the distribution and implementation of the State Defense Order. In 2005, Putin initiated an industry consolidation programme to bring the main aircraft producing companies under a single umbrella organization, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC). The aim was optimize production lines and minimise losses. The program was divided in three parts: reorganization and crisis management (2007–2010), evolution of existing projects (2010–2015) and further progress within the newly created structure (2015–2025). The State Duma Defense Committee has announced that the nation's defense spending, including research and development R spending, will total $16.3 billion (RUB487 billion) in 2010, $19.2 billion (RUB574 billion) in 2011, $24.3 billion (RUB726 billion) in 2012, and $38.8 billion (RUB1.16 trillion) in 2013. While total defense spending will increase, <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>allocated</b> for R will drop from the current 2010 level of 22 percent to 16 percent by 2013. The modernization of weaponry will instead receive a significant portion of total spending, with 13 percent designated for the 2010 fiscal year, 15 percent for 2011 and 2012, and 14 percent for 2013. The top procurement priorities are the following: RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles, Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles, Su-24 fighters, Su-35 long-range fighters, submarines, corvettes, frigates, and battlefield command-and-control systems. The plan for 2010-2013 only represents a small portion (16%) of that amount, just over RUB2.9 trillion ($98.6 billion). The government intends to spend RUB19 trillion ($613 billion) over the next decade to modernize the armed forces.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} studies a single-period expected utility-based optimal portfolio problem. Assets {{are divided into}} different groups. It is assumed that the actual dependency structure of the asset returns within each group is unknown, but assets belonging to different groups have independent returns. Instead of assuming any particular dependency structure within each group, we propose the maximin criterion as an alternative optimization criterion. The least favorable dependency structure is first identified, then we proceed to analyze the optimal portfolio problem {{as if this were}} the actual dependency structure. Sufficient conditions for ordering <b>the</b> aggregate <b>amounts</b> <b>allocated</b> to different groups, and for ordering <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>allocated</b> to different assets within each group are obtained. © 2005 Elsevier B.

Justified inequality and luck-based equality generated low levels of cooperation, whereas justified equality and luck-based inequality generated high levels of cooperation. Five potential psychological mediators were examined: attraction to the subgroup, perceived interdependency, superordinate identification, self-focused thoughts, and normative expectations. Theoretical and empirical implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved...|$|R
