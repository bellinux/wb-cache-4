5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. <b>The</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|Active solar {{techniques}} use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, {{solar thermal}} collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{building to the}} Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies {{reduce the need for}} alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.|$|E

He was the capo elettore (ward heeler) of Domenico De Michele Ferrantelli, {{the mayor}} of Burgio and member of Parliament for the {{district}} of Bivona, {{as well as on}} good terms with the Baron Inglese. He exercised influence over several Mafia cosche (clans) in the towns of Bisacquino, Burgio, Campofiorito, Chiusa Sclafani, Contessa Entellina, Corleone, and Villafranca Sicula, as well as some districts in the city of Palermo.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from the NWMP, Primrose was offered <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> police magistrate in Edmonton.

Calibration calculates camera parameters, triangulation determines <b>the</b> 3 D <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> point using these parameters. For calibration the RANSAC and LMedS algorithms give the best results, while the normalized 8 point algorithm is not far behind. Triangulation works best with the polynomial algorithm.

5|$|In 1945, the Butoku Kai {{promoted}} Abbe to 7th dan in judo and 6th dan in kendo. Following {{the end of}} World War II, {{however, the}} Butoku Kai and Busen were both closed down. Abbe took up <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> judo teacher for the Kyoto Prefectural Police Department. He became Chief Instructor of judo for the Kyoto police, and also taught at Doshisha University in that city. After the Abbes had a third daughter, Yayoi, Abbe resigned from the Kyoto police. During this period, he felt that judo in Japan was declining, and ended his association with the Kodokan in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In {{all cases}} {{this means that}} <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planet along its orbit {{ultimately}} becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), {{but in some cases}} the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in eccentricity, with some planets' orbits becoming significantly more—or less—elliptical.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target {{is not in the}} array.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that one may construct a 4 -class association scheme on <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Latin square, where the relations are the identity, {{being in the}} same row, {{being in the same}} column, having the same entry, and everything else. We describe the subconstituent (Terwilliger) algebras <b>of</b> such <b>an</b> association scheme. One also may construct several strongly regular graphs on <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Latin square, where adjacency corresponds to any subset of the nonidentity relations described above. We describe the local spectrum and subconstituent algebras of such strongly regular graphs. Finally, we study various notions of isomorphism for subconstituent algebras using Latin squares as examples...|$|R

Russia declined, and in order to {{organize}} adequate defenses established <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> voyevoda. The voyevoda sat in Kola, which became the administrative center of the region. Prior to that, the administrative duties were performed by the tax collectors from Kandalaksha. Newly established Kolsky Uyezd covered most of the territory of the peninsula (with the exception of Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts, which were a part of Dvinsky Uyezd), as well as the northern part of Karelia all the way to Lendery.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic {{points out}} that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tail conveys what the faces lack.

Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E
5|$|The above {{procedure}} only performs exact matches, finding <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> target value. However, {{due to the}} ordered {{nature of}} sorted arrays, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches. For example, binary search {{can be used to}} compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and nearest neighbor. Range queries seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.|$|E

5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E
5|$|In August 1981 {{the program}} {{received}} a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised {{by a large}} production run, {{and the fact that}} the US was shouldering the expense of development. Under the agreement BAe was relegated to <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subcontractor, instead of the full partner status that would have been the case had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to Rolls-Royce, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to Pratt & Whitney. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.|$|E
5|$|In Bhimsen's absence, Rajendra Bikram Shah {{established}} a new battalion, Hanuman Dal, {{to be kept}} under his personal command. By February 1837, both Rana Jang Pande and his brother, Ranadal Pande, had been promoted to <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kaji; and Ranajang was made a personal secretary to the King, while Ranadal Pande was made the governor of Palpa. Ranjang was also made the chief palace guard, the position formerly occupied by Ranbir Singh and then Bhimsen. Thus, this curtailed Bhimsen's access to the royal family. On 14 June 1837, the King took over the command of all the battalions {{put in charge of}} various courtiers, and himself became the Commander-in-Chief.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being merchants, monks, and government officials, Sogdians also served as soldiers in the Tang military. An Lushan, whose father was Sogdian and mother a Gokturk, rose to <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military governor (jiedushi) in the northeast before leading the An Lushan Rebellion (755 – 763 AD), which split the loyalties of the Sogdians in China. The An Lushan rebellion was supported by many Sogdians, and in its aftermath {{many of them were}} slain or changed their names to escape their Sogdian heritage, so that {{little is known about the}} Sogdian presence in North China since that time. Sogdians continued as active traders in China following the defeat of the rebellion, but many of them were compelled to hide their ethnic identity. A prominent case was An Chongzhang, Minister of War, and Duke of Liang who, in 756, asked Emperor Suzong of Tang to allow him to change his name to Li Baoyu because of his shame in sharing the same surname with the rebel leader. This change of surnames was enacted retroactively for all of his family members, so that his ancestors would also be bestowed the surname Li.|$|E

Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, but only after insulting her.|$|E
5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} some conservative readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.|$|E
