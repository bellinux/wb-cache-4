5|$|Bonstelle {{was born}} <b>to</b> <b>Helen</b> and Joseph Bonesteel on her father's farm {{near the town}} of Greece, New York, the {{youngest}} of their eight children. Her exact date of birth is unknown, and she kept it a secret, but it was sometime in November 1869 – 1871.

5|$|Carte {{left the}} theatre, opera company, hotels {{and his other}} {{business}} interests <b>to</b> <b>Helen.</b> Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas. In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to William Greet, overseeing his management of a revival of Iolanthe and several new comic operas. Rupert became chairman of the Savoy Hotel by 1903, which Helen continued to own. In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre. The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909, however, the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.|$|E
5|$|Her {{more radical}} {{positions}} included acceptance of interracial marriage. Despite her opposition to giving African American men {{the right to}} vote without enfranchising all women and the derogatory language she had resorted to in expressing this opposition, Stanton had no objection to interracial marriage and wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick Douglass upon his marriage <b>to</b> <b>Helen</b> Pitts, a white woman, in 1884. Anthony, fearing public condemnation of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and wanting to keep the demand for female suffrage foremost, pleaded with Stanton not to make her letter to Douglass or support for his marriage publicly known.|$|E

5|$|MD234 {{originally}} followed {{what is now}} MD238 from Chaptico east to MD5 at Helen. The ChapticoLeonardtown {{portion of}} the highway was then designated as part of MD237. The original MD234 was constructed in the early 1920s; MD237 {{was built in the}} late 1920s and early 1930s. MD237 between Clements and Leonardtown was reconstructed around 1950. The ChapticoClements section of MD237 and MD234 west of Chaptico were rebuilt around 1960, projects that involved many relocations and several new bridges. At the conclusion of the project in 1961, MD234 was extended east over the former section of MD237 to Leonardtown; MD238 was extended from Chaptico <b>to</b> <b>Helen</b> on what was previously MD234.|$|E
5|$|Starting in late December, {{widespread}} rains {{produced by}} the precursor <b>to</b> <b>Helen</b> prompted the issuance of flood warnings throughout the Top End region. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Cyclone Helen on 4January, the Bureau of Meteorology issued cyclone warnings for areas between the Mitchell Plateau, in Western Australia, to Cape Hotham in the Northern Territory. According to local officials, flooding was the greatest concern from the storm rather than wind damage. The warning area was later condensed to encompass areas from Wadeye to Cape Hotham, including Darwin and the Tiwi Islands. By 6January, warnings were issued for the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula between Karumba and Weipa as the remnants of Helen were forecast to regain storm intensity.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a {{considerable}} amount of poetry, most notably Helen in Egypt (written between 1952–54), an examination from a feminist {{point of view of a}} male-centred epic poetry. H.D. used Euripides's play Helen as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the Trojan War and, by extension, of war itself. This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's Cantos, a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include Sagesse, Winter Love and Hermetic Definition. These three were published posthumously with the collective title Hermetic Definition (1972). The poem Hermetic Definition takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's Canto 106. Sagesse, written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of coda to Trilogy. being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the atom bomb. Winter Love was written together with End to Torment and uses as narrator the Homeric figure of Penelope to restate the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda <b>to</b> <b>Helen</b> in Egypt.|$|E

The route heads northwest through a mix of rural residences and businesses, with the median widening briefly to include some businesses when the route reaches Mechanichsville.
