With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing {{completion}} in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be [...] "very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be no artistic merits in it." [...] He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that [...] "I shan't be at all surprised and offended {{if you find that}} it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts." [...] Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, [...] "the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best." ...|$|E

Everyone has their {{memories}} back, and we’re right at the point the season started. So, presumably, we won’t be getting any more flashbacks. Rather, the story will move forward, hopefully, and show us just how the Darkness and the Light will clash. Knowing Once Upon a Time, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be some sort of compromise, but I think it’d be bold if the show snuffed out one or the other, just to show us what a world without Light, or a world without plot-driving evil, looks like." ...|$|E

Now Mr. Mannering is a brilliant politician and a sound thinker, {{but he is also}} a man of sentiment. They will drug him with it up <b>there.</b> He <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> come back with half a dozen new schemes, and we don't want them, you know. He ought to be speaking at Glasgow and Leeds this week. He simply ignores his responsibilities. He yields to a sudden whim and leaves us plantes la." ...|$|R

Well, let him, let him." [...] Then she clapped her hands and summoned priests, whom she bade go at once and conduct Fahni out of Bonsa-Town. Also she bade them loose certain slaves who were of the Ogula tribe, that they might {{accompany}} him laden with provisions, and send on orders to the outposts that Fahni and his party should pass unmolested from the land.|$|R

40|$|It {{is claimed}} {{that it will}} be {{exceedingly}} unlikely to obtain CTC's in the spacetime of a spinning EYMH-string. It is conjectured that the pathological problems concerning the induced angular momentum and helical structure of time that afflict the U(1) -gauge string, will be solved in the non-abelian YM string model. In the pure YM case we find regular solutions, which resembles the abelian counterpart solutions but without causality violating regions. Just as in the spherical symmetric case, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be <b>probably</b> critical behavior of the field equations at the threshold of blackhole masses. Comment: 3 pages in Revtex.

40|$|This article {{presents}} and evaluates {{the main features}} of the directive 2012 / 28 /EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on certain permitted uses of orphan works, which introduces {{a new form of}} “fair use” of copyright works. The author points out to some leeway, the European legislator leaves with regard to solving the problem of using orphan works (the role of collecting societies), and describes the Polish regulation and practice in the exploitation of orphan works. In conclusion it is argued that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be <b>probably</b> two parallel forms of exploitation of orphan works, i. e. the new form of permitted use of orphan works (so-called fair use) and licensing agreements managed by collecting societies...|$|R

He knows for what, and will be here presently, and drink part of that bottle of sack.

6000|$|But here, as before, I {{think the}} {{distinction}} has arisen entirely from confusing a transitory imperfection with an essential character. So long as our information concerning them is imperfect, we class all objects together according to resemblances which we feel, but cannot define: we group them round types, in short. Thus, {{if you ask}} an ordinary person what kinds of animals <b>there</b> are, he <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> say, beasts, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects, &c. Ask him to define a beast from a reptile, and he cannot do it; but he says, things like a cow or a horse are beasts, and things like a frog or a lizard are reptiles. You see he does class by type, and not by definition. But how does this classification differ {{from that of the}} scientific Zoologist? How does the meaning of the scientific class-name of [...] "Mammalia" [...] differ from the unscientific of [...] "Beasts"? ...|$|R

"You {{will have}} no {{difficulty}} about that," [...] one of them replied, [...] "for there's been a notice up that Government wants to buy horses, and at two o'clock this afternoon, those who have animals to dispose of fit for cavalry service are to bring them into the parade {{ground in front of}} the infantry barracks. Government has only asked for fifty horses, and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be two or three times that number brought in. We have each brought in a horse or two, but they are rather expensive animals. I believe the horses are intended for mounts for staff-officers.

It would seem to them natural that I should take my cousin's place; and that, as the regiment was moving, and {{there was no time to}} teach me drill, I should be expected to pick up what I could on the way. But indeed, I have watched the regiment so often that I think I know all the commands and movements, and could go through them without hesitation. Besides, there won't be much drilling on the march. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be a good deal of skirmishing, and perhaps some rough fighting." ...|$|E
