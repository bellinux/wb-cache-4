40|$|A {{few simple}} cases of {{incremental}} collapse are reviewed {{in the context}} of the design of pressure vessels. Incremental shakedown and limited-life design in terms of an allowable aggregate strain are considered. It is suggested that incremental collapse will commonly impose limitations on design which will be much more severe than high strain endurance. However it is considered that this may not be true if the high strain fatigue is complicated by questions of creep relaxation. Simple results are presented of two selected examples of exploratory experiments, one illustrating incremental collapse in a pipe bend, and the other incremental shakedown in a <b>tie-plate...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The ITER CS {{is in an}} {{advanced}} state of design. Detailed analysis continues. In this paper, finite element analyses done by the US PT are presented. These analyses relate to a few issues still requiring some resolution. Finite element analyses by the ITER International Team (IT) and other US PT analyses are cited for comparison with the finite element results. The degree of preload required to offset vertical tensions in the coils are discussed. Parametric analyses of different preloads and friction coefficients have been performed which point to a lower preload than that specified by the project. Lateral loading on the CS due to postulated off center electromagnetic loads are quantified. Lateral seismic loads are applied, and the existing and proposed restraint systems are discussed. Behavior of the upper flex supports is also available from the simulation model and will be compared with previous work. The coil leads are supported by the preload system <b>tie-plates.</b> Radial differential motion between the <b>tie-plates</b> and coils is quantified for the case {{where there is no}} radial coupling between the coils and <b>tie-plates.</b> Support provisions for the leads are discussed in the context of both load capacity and displacement absorbing ability. vertical loads on the CS. Torsional registration between the modules is provided by interlocking the modules with radial grooves and keys. The compliance of the coil stack and the differential loads along the height of the stack cause small but significant rotations at the flex plates, which are designed primarily for purely radial displacements. There is a lower restraint system for the CS but its required loading has not been well defined [6]. Electromagnetic loads {{have been found to be}} small at this lower support. Seismic loads are more significant and require reconsideration of the design for the lower restraint system...|$|R
