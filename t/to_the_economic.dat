5|$|A few British leaders, {{particularly}} Lord Mountbatten, {{the last}} British viceroy of India, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states. The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely {{states to the}} British India through a complex network of interests. Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, use of ports, and other similar agreements would get terminated, posing a serious threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> life of the subcontinent. Mountbatten was also persuaded by the argument of Indian officials such as V. P. Menon that {{the integration of the}} princely states into independent India would, to some extent, assuage the wounds of partition. The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the accession of princely states to India following the transfer of power, as proposed by the Congress.|$|E
