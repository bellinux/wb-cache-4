40|$|Summary. Streaming {{processing}} of XML transformations is practically needed es-pecially {{if we have}} large XML documents or XML data streams as the <b>transformation</b> <b>input.</b> In this paper, we present the design of an automatic streaming processor of transformations specified in XSLT language. Unlike other similar systems, our pro-cessor guarantees bounds on the resource usage for the {{processing of}} {{a particular type of}} transformation. This feature is achieved by employing tree transducers as the underlying formal base. The processor includes a set of streaming algorithms, each of them is associated with a tree transducer with specific resource usage (memory, number of passes), and thus captures different transformation subclass. The input XSLT stylesheet is analyzed in order to identify the transformation subclass to which it belongs. Then the lowest resource-consuming streaming algorithm capturing this subclass is applied. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} provide an {{effective}} overall health information system, a number of separate systems used by different providers must typically be integrated. However supporting the exchange of data between these disparate health information systems often requires complex data transformation from one system's data formats to another's. We describe a novel data mapping specification tool, domain-specific language and mapping engine that greatly simplifies building such integration infrastructure. Our system allows health systems integrators to specify correspondences between information messages generated by one system to messages that another system consumes. A special mapping language is used to express these correspondences and {{is run by a}} mapping engine to effect data <b>transformation.</b> <b>Input</b> and output messages can be expressed in XML or EDI formats and a separate message exchange system is used to communicate between the data source and data target health information systems.

40|$|A {{regression}} model integrating data pre-processing and <b>transformation,</b> <b>input</b> selection techniques and a data-driven statistical model, facilitated accurate seven day ahead time series forecasting of selected water quality parameters. A core {{feature of the}} modelling approach is a novel recursive input-output algorithm. The herein described model development procedure {{was applied to the}} case of a seven day ahead dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration forecast for the upper hypolimnion of Advancetown Lake, Queensland, Australia. The DO was predicted with an R 2 > 0. 8 and a NRMSE of 14. 9 % on a validation data set by using 10 inputs related to water temperature or pH. A key feature of the model is that it can handle nonlinear correlations, which was essential for this forecasting problem as most of the input time series necessitated nonlinear transformations of the original data. The pre-processing of the data revealed some relevant inputs that had only six days lag, and as a consequence, those predictors were in-turn forecasted one day ahead using the same procedure. In this way, the targeted prediction horizon (i. e. seven days) was preserved. The implemented approach can be applied {{to a wide range of}} time-series forecasting problems in the complex hydro-environment research area. The reliable DO forecasting tool can be used by reservoir operators to achieve more proactive and reliable water treatment management. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|E

Purpose of the process establishing Information Strategy is primarily identify areas where we expect the greatest effects of the deployment of information systems and information and communication technology (IS/ICT) and to determine ways to achieve these effects. In second chapter is presented a general model benefits of IS/ICT, which {{based on the principle}} of <b>transformation</b> <b>inputs</b> (costs) in IS/ICT to outputs (benefits of IS/ICT) and factors that affected the efficiency of <b>transformation</b> <b>inputs</b> to outputs. Next chapters are dedicated benefits from the using of IS/ICT. Managing benefits support strategic decisions of company's management on the volume of investments for construction of IS/ICT, strategic decision on the overall quality required IS and enables business managers to balance costs and benefits of IS/ICT in a specific time.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{statistical}} properties of non-linear transformations (NLT) of random variables, {{in order to}} establish useful tools for estimation and information theory. Specifically, the paper focuses on linear regression analysis of the NLT output and derives sufficient general conditions to establish when the input-output regression coefficient is equal to the partial regression coefficient of the output with respect to a (additive) part of the input. A special case is represented by zero-mean Gaussian inputs, obtained as the sum of other zero-mean Gaussian random variables. The paper shows how this property can be generalized to the regression coefficient of non-linear transformations of Gaussian-mixtures. Due to its generality, and the wide use of Gaussians and Gaussian-mixtures to statistically model several phenomena, this theoretical framework can find applications in multiple disciplines, such as communication, estimation, and information theory, when part of the nonlinear <b>transformation</b> <b>input</b> is the quantity of interest and the other part is the noise. In particular, the paper shows how the said properties can be exploited to simplify closed-form computation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the estimation mean-squared error (MSE), and bounds on the mutual information in additive non-Gaussian (possibly non-linear) channels, also establishing relationships among them.

40|$|The {{expert system}} ELDAR was {{designed}} and tested for the automatic generation of basic data and for the prediction of property data of electrolyte solutions. ELDAR integrates extensive heterogeneous factual knowledge (12. 000 publications, 420. 000 measured data multiples, 1. 200 basic data, documentations of rules (10 subclasses) and modules (50 with 200 effects), thesaurus with the semantic relations of 42. 000 terms for a user friendly interface and for the inheritance and generalisation of knowledge) in a relational data base. It manages algorithmic knowledge normalized in modules (statistical modules, theoretical property equations of the chemical model {{for the production of}} consistent basic data, multiple empirical equations for the consistency check and the prediction) in the method base. A collection of rules for the application of modules, for electrolyte properties (master equations, corresponding states of electrolyte solutions, correlation rules, solvation and association rules) and for the determination of single ion properties and their dependence on temperature and solvent properties was designed for the rule base. Rules coded in Prolog are used in the evaluation of queries via the data base - rule base interaction. The communication manager responds to the user query by automatical data base query, variable <b>transformation,</b> <b>input</b> supply of modules, activation of modules, mapping of the factual knowledge into Horn- clauses, and consultation of the rule base, if necessary in a recursive manner. ELDAR automatically generates basic data and calculates material properties of pure compounds and mixtures. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. This paper surveys three {{distinct}} approaches to bidirectional programming. The first approach, syntactic bidirectionalization, takes a program describing the forward <b>transformation</b> as <b>input</b> and calculates a well-behaved reverse transformation. The second approach, semantic bidirectionalization, is similar, but takes the forward <b>transformation</b> itself as <b>input</b> {{rather than a}} program describing it. It requires the transformation to be a polymorphic function and uses parametricity and free theorems in the proof of well-behavedness. The third approach, based on bidirectional combinators, focuses {{on the use of}} types to ensure wellbehavedness and special constructs for dealing with alignment problems. In presenting these approaches, we pay particular attention to use of complements, which are structures that represent the information discarded by the transformation in the forward direction. ...|$|R
