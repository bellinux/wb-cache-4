30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig. 8 that among the four {{different}} shape models, <b>the</b> 10 positioning <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> square and circular models are generally relatively small. In this paper, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> average <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positioning calculation of each model is calculated according to the data of Fig.  8. The result shows that <b>the</b> average positioning <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> square is 8850  ms, <b>the</b> average positioning <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle is 8860  ms, <b>the</b> average positioning <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle is 9700  ms, and <b>the</b> positioning <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regular hexagon is 9630  ms. <b>The</b> positioning <b>time</b> <b>of</b> positioning square and circular is smaller.
