He is {{a person}} who is going to carry on what you have started, to sit where you are sitting and, when you are gone, attend to <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> think are so important. You can adopt all the {{policies}} you please, but how they will be carried on depends on him. Even if you make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them. He will assume control of your cities and nations. He is going to move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E

500|$|On the {{introduction}} of young Sherlock, Moffat noted {{that it was the}} logical course to take after {{the introduction}} of the Holmes parents: [...] "Once you've got the parents in and you've got the sibling rivalry and stuff, people start to think, 'well what was young Sherlock like?' You just want <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> want to see those things, it's part of updating it." ...|$|E

Clack, a Cambridge University expert on tetrapod evolution, said of Tiktaalik, [...] "It's one of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can point to and say, 'I told you this would exist,' and there it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornwallis {{was serving}} under Field Marshall Haig {{when he played}} in a charity cricket match, taking a hat-trick. He was later invited by C. H. B. Marsham to play for Kent County Cricket Club against Sussex in the 1919 County Championship. Cornwallis, who had not played cricket since school, {{initially}} laughed off the invitation but was told by Haig to accept – being told it was [...] "one of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> have got to say you have done once, Cornie". He took a wicket in the match {{and went on to}} play several more times for Kent in 1919.|$|E

2500|$|An {{interview}} {{conducted with}} British chef Gordon Ramsay by Ryan Tubridy on The Late Late Show in late 2009 led to comment in the Irish media when Ramsay engaged in personal criticism of Tubridy over his appearance. Ramsay compared Tubridy's ears to Dumbo, saying: [...] "Look at <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> must take off {{coming down the}} stairs. I'm surprised you can get through the door". The chef also spoke of his desire to bring Tubridy {{to one of his}} restaurants, commenting [...] "You look like you haven't eaten in years. You're too thin. You're like a little windy piece of asparagus". The Evening Herald said Tubridy had been [...] "ridiculed and humiliated [...] in front of a squirming television audience".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, Hilton {{was arrested}} and charged with driving under the {{influence}} of alcohol, with a blood alcohol content of 0.08%. Her arrest complicated the fifth season of The Simple Life. Hilton's driver's license was suspended in November 2006, and in January 2007 she pleaded no contest to a reckless driving charge. Her sentence was 36 months' probation and fines totaling about $1,500. Her straight-to-DVD film Bottoms Up was released in late 2006. It received negative reviews; Australia's Urban Cinefile said that Hilton, is the lead role, [...] "spends most of her screen time flicking her hair as she delivers lines like 'books are <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> read'". In December 2006 National Lampoon's Pledge This!, in which Hilton appeared and produced, premiered in a limited release before going directly to video. She missed its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, protesting the addition of several nude scenes: [...] "I was so angry I snubbed my own premiere." [...] In August 2008 Worldwide Entertainment Group sued Hilton in Miami District Court, alleging that she did not fulfill her contractual agreement to provide [...] "reasonable promotion and publicity" [...] for the film. She reportedly received $1million for her work.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Dickley, {{now listen}} {{to me for a}} minute," [...] said Dave in a tone of voice that arrested the man's {{attention}} in spite of his irascibility. [...] "Look at me closely. Didn't the fellow who got <b>those</b> <b>things</b> from <b>you</b> look somewhat different from me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Claude did not {{laugh at}} the odd medley in her speech, but answered, 'Well, <b>those</b> little <b>things</b> train <b>you</b> in {{readiness}} and kindness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The back door," [...] he directed, and Mr. Ledbetter {{staggered}} {{through a}} conservatory, leaving a wake of smashed flower-pots behind him. [...] "Never mind the crockery," [...] said the stout man; [...] "it's good for trade. We wait here until a quarter past. <b>You</b> can put <b>those</b> <b>things</b> down. <b>You</b> have!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Then {{there is}} that {{bathroom}} that gets wiped out by a tidal wave. “It was a nightmare,” explains screenwriter Anthony Badalucco, “the water tank had to be rebuilt and rebuilt. It was one of <b>those</b> technical <b>things</b> <b>you</b> just couldn’t control. But the shot is amazing {{when you see it}} on screen.” ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the early}} stages of production, Foreman said that the record was going to sound {{different}} sonically, initially [...] "shaping up to be more acoustic AND more electronic".

6000|$|Ricker laughed. [...] "Oh, no! Merely the fangs and poison-sacks. Look here, young man! Did {{you believe}} all <b>those</b> cynical <b>things</b> when <b>you</b> were saying them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "if you are ready." [...] Then, {{catching}} {{sight of}} the spears we held, he added: [...] "You will not need <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> do not go a-hunting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't do <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> know; there 's {{no need of}} it, and I don't {{think they}} 'd cure my worrying," [...] said Fanny, languidly feeding Ashputtel, who sat decorously beside her, at the table, winking at the cream pot.|$|E
6000|$|He {{showed their}} small relic again with assurance. [...] "You wanted us. Then here we are. Oh {{how we can}} talk!--with all <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> know! You are an invention. And you'll see there are things J know. I shall turn up here--well, daily." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, what I mean is, I'm not {{a princess}} in {{disguise}} {{trying to escape}} from anarchists, or anything like <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> read about in books. I'm just in a perfectly simple piece of trouble. You would be bored to death if I told you about it." ...|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. Say! Why such miscreants are {{the pest}} and vermin of the commonwealth, not {{fit for the}} society of men; but methinks by some of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> discoursed before, you seem to import {{that it is not}} lawful for a man {{to make the best of}} his own.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only chance}} that I see, then, of your {{reviving}} {{your sense of}} responsibility to--to <b>those</b> various sacred <b>things</b> <b>you</b> have forgotten, is in sending for your mother to join you here." ...|$|R
