50|$|The Lange {{model was}} {{developed}} in response to Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek's criticisms of socialism during the socialist calculation debate. The critics argued that any body that owns and consolidates a society's means of production cannot acquire the information needed to calculate general equilibrium prices, and that market-determined prices were essential for the rational allocation of producer goods. The Lange model contains principles proposed by neoclassical economists Vilfredo Pareto and Léon Walras. Lange's theory emphasizes the idea of Pareto efficiency: a situation is Pareto-efficient {{if there is no}} way to rearrange things to make any individual better off without making anyone worse off. To achieve Pareto efficiency, a set of conditions must be formulated in stages. This idea of deriving conditions to ensure that consumer preferences are in balance with the maximum amount of goods and services produced is emphasized by Walras. The theorem indicates that a socialist economy based on public ownership could achieve one of the principal economic benefits of capitalism - a rational price system - and was an important <b>theoretical</b> <b>force</b> behind the development of the concept of market socialism.|$|E

Particularly important to understanding the diversity of cranial form amongst vertebrates is knowledge of the generated magnitudes of bite force because of its use {{as a measure of}} ecological performance. In order to determine an accurate morphological proxy for bite force in elasmobranchs, <b>theoretical</b> <b>force</b> generation by the quadratomandibularis muscle of the spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias was modeled using a variety of morphological techniques, and lever-ratio analyses were used to determine resultant bite forces.

Although no {{differences were found between the}} theoretical and in vivo bite forces measured, modeling analyses indicate that the quadratomandibularis muscle should be divided into its constituent divisions and digital images of the cross-sections of these divisions should be used to estimate cross-sectional area when calculating <b>theoretical</b> <b>force</b> production.

In the surf zone, this momentum flux arises principally through dissipation of incident wave energy by breaking. In this thesis, the generation of low frequency waves by the spatial and temporal modulations of breaking incident waves is addressed first, followed by field estimates of the time and space scales of wave breaking distributions. Lastly, nearshore sand bar behavior, linked theoretically to infragravity waves, is investigated over a five year period. A <b>theoretical</b> <b>forcing</b> mechanism for driving resonant, longshore progressive edge waves is derived from the momentum equations. Forcing within the surf zone is examined through group scale modulations in incident wave dissipation by depth-limited brealdng.

Initial surf zone growth rates are predicted and found to be rapid, with edge wave amplitudes growing {{to the size of the}} incident waves on the order of 10 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} some of {{the philosophical}} foundations that shaped Paulo Freire’s pedagogy. From a componential analysis of the literature, a dominant theme of “critique ” emerged. From a philosophic perspective, critique implies the human capacity of rational thinking when humans are {{given the opportunity to}} reflect on their sociohistorical conditions. This achievement of telos leads to an escape from Marx’s concept of false consciousness into an existential perspective—that is, each person’s confrontation with choice. Ultimately, the paper argues the potential exists to employ Freireian pedagogy in practice if educators understand the philosophical narratives and assumptions on which his work is based. Freire’s Contribution to Adult Education Recent adult education literature suggests that the pedagogical theories of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire are gaining increased popularity among many adult educators. Merriam & Brockett (1997) report, for example, that Freire is having “a profound influence on adult education worldwide ” (p. 43). Merriam and Caffarella (1999) suggest that critical theory, feminism, and postmodernism, all <b>theoretical</b> <b>forces</b> in contemporary adult education, owe a direct “indebtedness to Paulo Freire’s work ” (p. 341).

Here, we consider adhesion between a single fiber and a substrate by van der Waals or electrostatic interactions. For a given contact area A, the <b>theoretical</b> pull-off <b>force</b> of the fiber is σthA where σth is the theoretical strength of adhesion. We show {{that it is possible}} to design an optimal shape of the tip of the fiber to achieve the <b>theoretical</b> pull-off <b>force.</b> However, such design tends to be unreliable at the macroscopic scale because the pull-off force is sensitive to small variations in the tip shape. We find that a robust design of shape-insensitive optimal adhesion becomes possible only when the diameter of the fiber is reduced to length scales on the order of 100 nm. In general, optimal adhesion could be achieved by a combination of size reduction and shape optimization. The smaller the size, the less important the shape. At large contact sizes, optimal adhesion could still be achieved if the shape can be manufactured to a sufficiently high precision. The robust design of optimal adhesion at nanoscale provides a plausible explanation for the convergent evolution of hairy attachment systems in biology...|$|R
