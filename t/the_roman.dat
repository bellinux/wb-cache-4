5|$|The {{constitution}} of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic {{was a set}} of unwritten norms and customs, which together with various written laws, guided the manner by which <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic was governed.

5|$|The {{history of}} the Constitution of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic is {{a study of the}} ancient Roman Republic that traces the {{progression}} of Roman political development from the founding of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic in 509 BC until the founding of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Empire in 27 BC. The constitutional history of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic can be divided into five phases. The first phase began with the revolution which overthrew <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Kingdom in 510 BC, and the final phase ended with the revolution which overthrew <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Republic, and thus created <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Empire, in 27 BC. Throughout the {{history of the}} republic, the constitutional evolution was driven by the struggle between the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> military describes the major chronological transformations in the organisation and constitution of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> armed forces. <b>The</b> <b>Roman</b> military was split into <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> army and <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> navy, although these two branches were less distinct than {{they tend to}} be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution.|$|E
5|$|A flint {{arrowhead}} {{discovered in}} Sale suggests a prehistoric human {{presence at the}} location, {{but there is no}} further evidence of activity in the area until <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> period. A 4th-century hoard of 46Roman coins was discovered in Ashton upon Mersey, one of four known hoards dating from that period discovered within the Mersey basin. Sale lies along the line of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> road which runs between the fortresses at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum), via the fort at Manchester (Mamucium); the present-day A56 follows the route of the road through the town. After <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> departure from Britain in the early-5th century, Britain was invaded by the Anglo-Saxons.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> attack {{so that they could}} allow the women and {{children}} to retreat across the Halys River. Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference. While they were going to the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry charging at them. In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius' bodyguard due to their numbers but were driven back when the escort that had been accompanying <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> foragers arrived and forced the Galatians to retreat.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} as a galley slave, Judah is {{assigned}} to the flagship of <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who {{has been charged with}} destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. When <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers, and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> way by falling on his sword, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> fleet's victory.|$|E

Since they were making little progress in the siege, Philip met with several of the most prominent, fearing that if <b>the</b> <b>Romans</b> captured Heraclea first, the Lamians would surrender to <b>the</b> <b>Romans.</b> Philip's fears became reality when a Roman messenger ordered him to abandon the siege.|$|R
