25|$|In {{accordance}} with the COFIPE (the Spanish acronym for the Federal Code of Electoral Procedures and Institutions), the Official Count began on Wednesday July 5, 2006. The sealed ballot packages together with their signed actas de escrutinio y cómputo (official tally sheets) were collected by the District's Electoral Council. Each <b>tally</b> <b>sheet</b> was examined for possible errors or alterations; Council members from any party are allowed to raise certain objections, and under a specified set of circumstances packages could be opened and examined; for example, the package could be opened and recounted {{in the case of}} an illegible <b>tally</b> <b>sheet.</b> The District Electoral Council would then certify the totals from each package and polling place, and remit the results to the IFE.|$|E
25|$|A file {{was then}} {{made for the}} polling place. The file {{contained}} {{a copy of the}} log (Acta de la jornada electoral), a copy of the signed <b>tally</b> <b>sheet,</b> and a copy of any protests filed. Separate packets contained the unused ballots, the annulled ballots, and the valid votes. A separate envelope contained the list of voters. Finally, all files were placed together in a sealed packet; the sealed packet was then signed by every member of the Directing Committee, and any party representative who so desired (article 234).|$|E
25|$|Within a few hours, the IFE and {{the polling}} station {{officials}} explained that between 8 and 10 ballots {{for the election}} to the Lower House had been incorrectly placed in the presidential ballot box (this could be seen because the ballots for the presidential, senatorial, and lower house elections were printed on different colored paper, to match {{the colors of the}} boxes). Article 231 of the COFIPE states that ballots placed in the incorrect box should be moved to the correct box. The president of the polling station ordered the ballots moved to the correct box, and all representatives present agreed to this. The video had been recorded by the representative of the Coalition, who also signed the report that explained it in the official <b>tally</b> <b>sheet.</b> On July 11, both the president of the polling place and the observer representing López Obrador's Coalition confirmed that this was indeed what had occurred.|$|E

These 11, 181 election <b>tally</b> <b>sheets</b> from across Haiti were posted online by Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council (CEP). It finds that for some 1, 326 voting booths, or 11. 9 percent of the total, <b>tally</b> <b>sheets</b> were either never received by the CEP or were quarantined for irregularities. This corresponds to about 12. 7 percent of the vote, which was not counted and is not included in the final totals that were released by the CEP on December 7, 2010 and reported by the press. It also found many more <b>tally</b> <b>sheets</b> that had irregularities in the vote totals that were sufficient to disqualify them, and a large number of clerical errors that further undermines the credibility of the vote count. The report finds that based on the numbers of irregularities, it is impossible to determine who should advance to a second round.

2500|$|After the PREP was {{concluded}} on 4 July, the official district-based counts were begun on Wednesday 5 July 2006. [...] In {{accordance with the}} Federal Code of Electoral Procedures and Institutions (COFIPE), each of Mexico's 300 congressional districts tabulated the votes recorded on the tally sheets (the [...] "actas") for each voting precinct in their district.

[...] That polling place does not exist. Another nonexistent polling place is number 4940 contiguous 2, of which the Coalition states: [...] "the number of ballots received {{by the president of}} the polling place, which was 405, does not agree with the 309 ballots deposited in the ballot box plus the 175 blank ballots left over, giving a variance of more 11." [...] The list of nonexistent polling places that were challenged has no end. Another example is number 2164, of which the coalition notes: [...] "the number of ballots received {{by the president of the}} polling place, which was 455, does not agree with the 314 ballots deposited in the ballot box and the 167 unused ballots, giving a variance of more than 24." [...] In addition, there is a good number of polling places that were challenged despite the fact that the data in the <b>tally</b> <b>sheet</b> agrees fully, and that the <b>tally</b> <b>sheet</b> is signed by the representatives of the coalition For the Good of All, and others that were already opened during the district council counts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Mann's {{second season}} in the NFL, the Lions had a new quarterback in Frank Tripucka. [...] Following a team outing, Mann overheard Tripucka's wife {{complaining}} that too many receivers were dropping balls. [...] Mann told Mrs. Tripucka to tell her husband {{to throw the ball}} to him, saying, [...] "I don't drop passes." [...] On December 11, 1949, Mann was credited with 8 catches for 182 yards and two touchdowns (including a 64-yard touchdown pass from Tripucka in the first quarter and a 41-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter) against the Green Bay Packers. [...] The mark tied his own single-game NFL record for receiving yardage. [...] After the game, Mann's wife, described as [...] "an ardent football fan," [...] pointed out to statistician Nick Kerbawy that her <b>tally</b> <b>sheet</b> showed that her husband caught nine passes. Kerbawy ran back through the play-by-play account of the game and discovered she was right.|$|E

5000|$|In the Panamanian presidential {{election}} of 7 May 1989, Guillermo Endara Galimany, along with vice presidential candidates Ricardo Arias-Calderon and Guillermo [...] "Billy" [...] Ford ran against Manuel Noriega's candidate Carlos Duque. The U.S. government gave $10 {{million to the}} Endara campaign. The election results were annulled by the Panamanian Government on May 10, due to what Noriega called [...] "foreign interference." [...] However, a tally organized by the anti-Noriega alliance showed Endara beating Noriega's puppet candidate, Carlos Duque, by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. Noriega had planned to declare Duque the winner regardless of the actual results; indeed, his cronies had prepared phony <b>tally</b> <b>sheets</b> {{to take to the}} district centers.

2500|$|The Official Count {{does not}} {{necessarily}} reopen the ballot packets and do a full vote-by-vote recount. It mostly only tabulates the numbers from the 130,000 sets of official paperwork (the [...] "actas") for the hand counts previously done {{for all of the}} 130,000 precincts. Because the packets usually remain closed, some claim that much of the fraud and irregularities allegedly done at the precinct level would not be discovered by the official count. Although the representatives from any political parties in the district board may request that a packet be opened and recounted, this can only be done under specific sets of circumstances listed in the COFIPE (article 247; though the article refers only to the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, it is explicitly referred to elsewhere, e.g. article 250 for presidential elections). For example, the package could be opened and recounted {{in the case of an}} illegible, missing, or inconsistent <b>tally</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Each party {{representative}} then {{received a}} copy of the official tally sheet; the representative was then required to sign a proof of receipt. On the outside of the sealed electoral packet a transparent envelope containing a signed copy of the official <b>tally</b> <b>sheet</b> was placed (article 235). The chair of the Directing Committee then placed an enlarged copy of the final tallies in a visible location outside of the polling place; this copy was supposed to be signed by the Chair, and could be signed by any other members of the Committee and party representatives who so desired (article 236). Finally, the polling place was then officially closed, and the Chair of the Directing Committee (with any party representatives who so desired) delivered the sealed packet and documentation to the District Office, where the official count (see below) began some days later. Polling places next to the District Office were required to deliver it [...] "immediately" [...] upon closure of the polling place. Urban polling places located away from the District Office were required to deliver the packets within 12 hours, and rural polling places within 24 hours of closure (article 238).|$|E

25|$|His {{conclusion}} {{is that there was}} no bias in the arithmetic errors (in other words, they were not present more often in the polling places won by one or the other candidate); he concludes that the errors were likely caused by the normal distribution of mathematical and organizational abilities of the randomly selected citizens in the polling place, and in the sometimes confusing design of the <b>tally</b> <b>sheets</b> and inadequate training of polling place workers.|$|R
