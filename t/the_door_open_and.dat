According to Paul the queen then {{recruited}} the king's cubicularius (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on June 28, care was taken to leave <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him. Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.|$|E
5|$|Alex realizes Geiger is {{controlling}} the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to Geiger's cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives inside the room. Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw to cut <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the navigator, Merced, to flood {{the ship and}} slow it down by opening the ballast doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she {{climbs out of the}} elevator, and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the fire door in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he got sick from copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired {{was for the}} WWE Intercontinental Championship in a Steel cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring. Jeff Hardy was {{defending}} the title against Johnny Nitro. The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs {{off the top of the}} cage. Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled Nitro from the top of the cage and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but Nitro put his foot on the bottom rope. Nitro then made it over the cage, but just as Nitro was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> Nitro fell onto the top of the door, paining him between his legs. As Nitro was on top of the door, Hardy kicked the cage door, and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said she}} found the episode both [...] "dishearting" [...] and [...] "engaging", as well as later adding that it was [...] "sad" [...] and [...] "frightening" [...] when Jake O'Connor was accused of murdering his father. Writing about the final scene which shows Megan enter the Russellâ€™s house, {{she said that she}} wanted to [...] "smack" [...] Megan for doing so, saying [...] "What was she thinking? She knew Scanlon had committed the murder and that Jen was acting strangely when she wouldn't let her in. Yet, she went back to find <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> walked right in. Megan's intelligent enough to know that something wasn't right but she's unarmed and untrained to handle the situation. For some reason she seemed incapable of making the smart decision to wait for the real police". Orlando said of the flashback scenes that she hopes in future episodes they [...] "delve deeper" [...] into Megan's father's death, saying that it was [...] "certainly a turning point for the character and I'd love to know more". She said it was [...] "nice" [...] to see scenes between Peter and Megan and said of the carpooling storyline, [...] "Snacks for carpool didn't seem like a bad idea but they could have used a couple of healthier options to go with the chocolate". Of Curtis and Kate's examining Manny Santos, she said that their expressions were [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] when they decided whether Manny was a juvenile, adding that it gave [...] "a much needed moment of comic relief in an otherwise heavy episode". She finished in saying that the episode [...] "grabbed her attention", finishing, [...] "These engaging characters and this episode was a winner for Body of Proof". In the carpooling storyline it featured Tastykake's products, a line of snack foods based in Philadelphia. Such products which were mentioned were Krimpets and KandyKakes, with the ABC saying they were the [...] "best".|$|E
500|$|On the August 22 {{episode of}} Raw, Miz and R-Truth {{attacked}} Santino Marella before his match. They then cut a promo agreeing {{there was a}} conspiracy in the WWE keeping both of {{them out of the}} main event picture, and declared they would, together, seize any future opportunity. They began referring to themselves as [...] "The Awesome Truth". On the August 29 episode of Raw, Truth interfered in Miz's match and the duo attacked CM Punk. At Night of Champions, after the referee was distracted while The Miz attempted a pin, Miz assaulted him, causing Awesome Truth to lose a WWE Tag Team Championship match to Air Boom (Kofi Kingston and Evan Bourne) by disqualification. Seeking retribution, Miz and Truth later attacked both Triple H and CM Punk during their No Disqualification match in the main event. Because of their actions from the previous night, R-Truth and The Miz were fired by Triple H on the September 19 episode of Raw. At the conclusion of the main event match at Hell in a Cell, R-Truth and The Miz jumped the barricade wearing black hooded sweatshirts and entered the cell as it was being raised. They then used weapons to attack Alberto Del Rio, CM Punk, John Cena, the Referee and camera men while the cell was again lowered. After this, the entire WWE roster led by Triple H came out to find a way into the cell, before New Orleans Police Department officers were able to get <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> arrest them. The two later posted a video on YouTube apologizing to the WWE Universe for their actions. The Miz and R-Truth were reinstated by John Laurinaitis on the October 10 episode of Raw. At Vengeance, Miz and R-Truth defeated CM Punk and Triple H in a tag team match, after interference from Triple H's long time friend Kevin Nash. Later that night they assaulted John Cena during his WWE Championship match with Alberto Del Rio. On the October 24 episode of Raw, Awesome Truth attacked John Cena and Zack Ryder. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Miz and R-Truth defeated Cena and Ryder. At Survivor Series, The Awesome Truth were defeated by John Cena and The Rock. On the November 21 episode of Raw, Cena instigated an argument between R-Truth and Miz, which resulted in Miz performed a Skull Crushing Finale on the stage on R-Truth. This was a pretext to explain R-Truth's absence during his suspension {{as a result of his}} violating of the Wellness Policy.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{missing fact}} is that when after being helped the first time (before the police arrived) was that after the initial help, Nizah {{was found in the}} street after a taxi refused her service.

2500|$|... "On Tuesday evening, at 5pm, Messrs Grove, of Bond Street, {{sent word}} {{that they had}} a very fine {{sturgeon}} on their slab. Of course, I went down at once to see it... The fish measured 9 feet in length [...] I wanted to make a cast of the fellow... and they offered me the fish for the night: he must be back in the shop the next morning by 10 am... I was determined to get him into the kitchen somehow; so, tying a rope to his tail, I let him slide down the stone stairs by his own weight. He started all right, but 'getting way' on him, I could hold the rope no more, and away he went sliding headlong down the stairs, like an avalanche down Mont Blanc... he smashed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>open...</b> <b>and</b> slid right into the kitchen... till at last he brought himself to an anchor under the kitchen table. This sudden and unexpected appearance of the armour-clad sea monster, bursting open the door... instantly created a sensation. The cook screamed, the house-maid fainted, the cat jumped on the dresser, the dog retreated behind the copper and barked, the monkeys went mad with fright, and the sedate parrot has never spoken a word since." ...|$|E
