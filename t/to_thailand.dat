5|$|In May 1962 the Australian Government {{decided to}} deploy a {{squadron}} of CAC Sabre fighters <b>to</b> <b>Thailand</b> to bolster that country's defences. This action was undertaken as part of Australia's Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) commitment to defend Thailand against attack from its Communist neighbours, which was thought likely to occur. The United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand also deployed forces <b>to</b> <b>Thailand</b> {{in response to this}} perceived threat, though Malaysia and several other SEATO members chose not to be involved. On 28May, Minister for Defence Athol Townley announced that Australia's contribution would be an RAAF squadron equipped with Sabre fighters. The eight aircraft, along with their pilots and ground crew, were drawn from No.77 Squadron, which formed part of Australia's Commonwealth Strategic Reserve forces at RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia. In order to preserve Malaysia's neutrality, the Sabres were flown <b>to</b> <b>Thailand</b> via Singapore. This force was designated No.79 Squadron while at Tengah Air Base in Singapore on 29May.|$|E

Until 1968, most U.S. jet fighter-bomber sorties only occurred when aircraft were returning <b>to</b> <b>Thailand</b> from Rolling Thunder missions carrying unexpended ordnance loads. They would then be directed to targets in northeastern Laos.|$|E

5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma <b>to</b> <b>Thailand</b> and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E
5|$|Although the durian is not native <b>to</b> <b>Thailand,</b> {{the country}} is {{currently}} {{one of the major}} exporters of durians, growing 781,000 tonnes of the world's total harvest of 1,400,000 tonnes in 1999, 111,000 tonnes of which it exported to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Canada. Malaysia and Indonesia follow, both producing about 265,000 tonnes each. Of this, Malaysia exported 35,000 tonnes in 1999. Chantaburi in Thailand each year holds the World Durian Festival in early May. This single province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand.

5|$|However, Punjab CID {{successfully}} infiltrated {{the conspiracy}} {{at the last}} moment through a sepoy named Kirpal Singh. Sensing that their plans had been compromised, D-Day was brought forward to 19 February, but even these plans found their way to the intelligence. Plans for revolt by the 130th Baluchi Regiment at Rangoon on 21 January were thwarted. Attempted revolts in the 26th Punjab, 7th Rajput, 130th Baluch, 24th Jat Artillery and other regiments were suppressed. Mutinies in Firozpur, Lahore, and Agra were also suppressed and many key leaders of the conspiracy were arrested, although some managed to escape or evade arrest. A last-ditch attempt was made by Kartar Singh and V. G. Pingle to trigger a mutiny in the 12th Cavalry regiment at Meerut. Kartar Singh escaped from Lahore, but was arrested in Varanasi, and V. G. Pingle was apprehended in Meerut. Mass arrests followed as the Ghadarites were rounded up in Punjab and the Central Provinces. Rash Behari Bose escaped from Lahore and in May 1915 fled to Japan. Other leaders, including Giani Pritam Singh, Swami Satyananda Puri and others fled <b>to</b> <b>Thailand.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the UNTAC {{administration}} had banned forest logging and timber exports, a major industry and source of foreign earnings. In October 1993, Ranariddh issued {{an order to}} lift the ban on a temporary basis so as to allow trees that were already felled to be exported for timber. The Khmer Rouge still controlled large tracts of forests in the regions of western and northern Cambodia bordering Thailand, and helped finance its operations by selling timber to Thai forestry companies The Cambodian government was unable to impose its will in Khmer Rouge territory, and was eager to regain the logging revenues. In January 1994, Ranariddh and Hun Sen signed a bilateral agreement with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. The agreement provided for felled trees to be legally exported <b>to</b> <b>Thailand</b> on a temporary basis until 31 March 1994. The agreement also arranged for specially-designated customs zones to be created within Thai territory, which allowed Cambodian custom officials to inspect the logs and collect export duties.|$|E
