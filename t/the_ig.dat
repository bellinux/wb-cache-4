5|$|<b>The</b> <b>IG</b> Farben Building, {{also known}} as the Poelzig Building, {{formerly}} informally called The Pentagon of Europe, is a building complex in Frankfurt, Germany, which currently serves as the main building of the West End Campus of the University of Frankfurt.

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of space scientist Duncan Steel. The informal group of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon {{became known as the}} Independent Group (IG) and has worked to analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location of Flight 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered by a lack of data publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; <b>the</b> <b>IG</b> also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. <b>The</b> <b>IG</b> did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly available information, to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of <b>the</b> <b>IG</b> members have worked on analysing specific elements of Flight 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{original}} {{design in the}} modernist New Objectivity style {{was the subject of}} a competition which was eventually won by the architect Hans Poelzig.

5|$|After 1952, the {{building}} {{served as the}} European centre of the American armed forces and {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. V Corps.

5|$|After World War II, with <b>the</b> <b>IG</b> Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of}} its {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other half of which it already owned. However, Bayer Aspirin made up {{only a small fraction of}} the British aspirin market because of competition from Aspro, Disprin (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: acetaminophen. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{affinity}} chromatography using glutaraldehyde-fixed cells immobilized on Sephadex beads {{has been used}} to isolate immunoglobulins (Ig's) specific for cell surface glycoproteins. Ig's that specifically bound and agglutinated the same cells as those originally fixed on the columns were isolated from nonimmune sera of various species. Periodate treatment of the cell-columns and the free cells destroyed their ability to bind <b>the</b> <b>Ig's,</b> and <b>the</b> binding of <b>the</b> <b>Ig's</b> to untreated cells was inhibited by monosaccharides such as D- galactose and sialic acid. The binding of antibodies directed against cell surfaces obtained by immunizing animals with the same mouse tumor cell lines used on the columns (P 388 and EL 4) was not inhibited by various saccharides. Surface glycoproteins obtained from the mouse tumor cells by immunoprecipitation with <b>the</b> column-isolated <b>Ig's</b> yielded specific electrophoretic patterns that differed from those obtained using <b>Ig's</b> from <b>the</b> sera of rabbits immunized with the tumor cells. The data suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Ig's</b> isolated by cell-column chromatography were directed against carbohydrates, probably those in terminal positions of the polysaccharide portions of the tumor cell surface glycoproteins. Column-isolated Ig's specific for carbohydrates were also useful in studies of cell interactions in nonmammalian systems including Dictyostelium discoideum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In a prior report we suggested that the consolidation of certain offices of inspectors general (<b>IG)</b> could strengthen <b>the</b> independence, efficiency, and effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>IGs</b> in <b>the</b> federal government. Based on the potential for benefits and the similarities in their basic missions, we identified the Amtrak Office of Inspector General and the Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Inspector General as among those Congress might consider for consolidation. We reported that by consolidating the office of <b>the</b> Amtrak <b>IG</b> with <b>the</b> larger DOT <b>IG</b> office, <b>the</b> resulting office would have a larger budget and more staff with which to achieve its mission. Potential benefits include an increased ability to improve the allocation of human and financial resources and {{to attract and retain}} an adequate and skilled workforce.

25|$|Sodium channel beta {{subunits}} are type 1 transmembrane glycoproteins with an extracellular N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus.
