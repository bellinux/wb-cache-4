40|$|International audienceTitanium and its alloy foams {{have been}} {{receiving}} a growing interest for biomedical industry {{due to their}} biocompatibility and high potential in dental, spinal, joint and hip implant applications. Near net shape production and reproducibility of a product require {{a full understanding of}} the processing parameters' effect on manufacturing and final properties. The shape complexity of titanium surgical implants, for example dental implants, necessitates a good control in compaction and sintering of metal skeletons containing macropores for near-net shape manufacturing. In this study, effects of processing parameters such as spacer powder size and amount on compaction, sintering and final structural properties were investigated. Commercially pure cellular titanium with porosities ranging between 35 and 75 % and pore sizes between 100 mu m and a few millimeters were produced via powder metallurgy with spacers. Architectural parameters of the foams, before and after sintering, were quantitatively characterized via X-ray computed microtomography. Addition of fine spacer powders enhanced compaction and densification of the foam structure. Pore walls were observed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>thicker</b> during sintering. The use of coarser space holders resulted in thicker pore walls and a wider pore wall thickness distribution. The results indicated that strength and stiffness tend to increase with increasing pore size. Among the structural features that spacer size altered, pore wall thickness and pore face roughness were found to be the most dominant effects on strength and stiffness. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The use {{of glass}} as {{building}} material has increased {{for many years}} and has over the past decade also been used in structural elements. The main feature of glass is that it is transparent and therefore allows light. This also means that an expanded use of the material would provide a great opportunity to create modern architecture. There are no standards for the design of glass components in Sweden, but there are current efforts to develop standards for this in Europe, so called Eurocodes. Some of the properties of glass is that it’s a durable material that can withstand moisture and other types of attacks and it is fragile to temperature changes. The type of glass used in construction is float glass, i. e. glass produced by the mass flowing on a tin bath and slowly cooling down. Thus, the dimensions of the material is very thin, it is then also easy to swing. Therefore, sound insulation ability is not satisfying. In order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>thicker</b> dimensions of the glass several layers of glass can be laminated together by using a transparent intermediate layer that is usually polyvinyl butyral, PVB. The structural characteristics are that glass is a brittle material that has a high strength under compression, about 890 MPa, and rather low tensile or bending strength, 45 MPa. Tempered glass has a higher tensile strength, 120 MPa. The tempering process is done by reheating the glass followed by a faster cooling. A compressive stress is then formed on the surface and the breakage of the glass happens first when the maximum tensile stress is exceeded. The strength of glass is also dependent of what the surface of the glass looks like, damage on the surface can cause a breakage. The design of connections between glass and other materials is very important to avoid stress concentrations in the glass. A hole made in the glass implies loss of strength which should be considered if connections with bolts are intended. The area in contact with other materials can preferably be staggered to reduce stress concentrations. A structural glass column could add value for a room, when compared to using a non-transparent traditional building material. To get a more stabile construction a glass column should consist of several sheets of glass glued together. For the design of glass columns, in which glass sheets are either laminated together or glued together by other means the shear deformations that may arise in the adhesives must be taken into account. This is done by taking into account that the materials have different Young’s modulus and shear modulus. The report shows various methods to take this into account in the calculation process. The methods give similar results, but they also show that introduction of simplifications means that the design is not on the safe side. The resistance of a glass column is relatively good compared to other materials, the limiting glass is thin, and brittle fracture. It’s therefore important to incorporate some type of back up into the design of the glass pillar. A good solution can be to glue together multiple sheets of glass. More research is needed on this subject, both to develop standards for the calculation of glass element strength and develop formulas that make the design easier. For the glass to make a breakthrough as a construction material, it must not only appear standards for the design, but it also must be cheaper to choose glass as a material, perhaps by pre-fabricated glass elements.

40|$|Objective. The {{method for}} {{preparing}} multilayer films by the consecutive deposition of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes has gained tremendous recognition due the user friendly preparation, capability of incorporating high loads {{of different types}} of biomolecules in the films, fine control over the materials’ structure, and robustness of the products under ambient and physiological conditions. However the preparation of such films needs the assembly on a substrate and, sometimes, cannot be detached from it, which has limited the application of such films in areas as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Herein, we report the production of chitosan/alginate (CTS/ALG) free-standing films that can be detached from an underlying inert substrate without any postprocessing step allowing the determination of physical properties of fundamental significance such as ion permeation and mechanical properties. Methods. In this work, the buildup of free-standing multilayer films made of CTS and ALG was investigated. Several conditions were tested to follow the film growth in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>thick</b> films. The CTS/ALG free-standing films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Permeability tests were performed using FITC-dextran, with several molecular weights, as a drug model molecule. Cell adhesion was assessed using C 2 C 12 myoblast cells over a period of 48 h. Results and Discussion. The produced membranes can be detached from an underlying inert substrate without any postprocessing step. Permeability experiments on these membranes revealed that the permeation of FITC-dextran depended greatly on its molecular weight. The results showed that these films are a good substrate for cell adhesion as spread cells were observed all over the surface, by actin and heochst staining. Conclusions. The production of free-standing films permits the direct experimental determination of many physical properties of fundamental significance such as ion permeation and mechanical properties that can be tuned for real-world applications. These free-standing films are easy detachable, easy to handle, stable in the presence of physiological solutions and biocompatible, demonstrating potential for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [86]- 89) This thesis {{examined how}} {{a boy with}} Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) and autistic-like characteristics responded in three different settings. More specifically the study was examining {{if there were any}} changes in attention, peer play, and motor-skill development and if so, what were they and how did they occur? The study was a qualitative one in which fieldwork research methodology was used. Field notes were used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>thick</b> descriptions about the observed contexts in which the practice of specific motor skills occurred and the social events that happened during the practice times. Documentary information and videotapes were also part of the data-collecting process. These qualitative data were analyzed using an inductive process that generated assertions. The assertions were then triangulated with the other sources of information. The three settings that were used for this study were the Motor Development Research Program, the Special Physical Education Teaching-Research Clinic and the subject’s regular physical education class. The findings showed commonalities across all three program settings on the different criteria. The subject demonstrated attention in the three programs by following directions and staying on task, by making eye contact to peers and by making eye contact to the teacher. Peer play was seen in all three settings when the subject showed affection and gave assistance. Gestures were observed for brief periods of time across all programs; however, they did not seem to affect the child’s attention and cooperation. The motor-skill development of the subject in the three motor skills studied ABSTRACT (running, kicking, and overhand throwing) did show progressive change over the 10 -week observational period. The context of some programs appeared to facilitate the development of some motor and prosocial behaviors. This qualitative case study approach provided the opportunity to closely observe changes in behavior that occurred {{in the context of the}} three different settings. This study supplied important information to better understand how a child with PDD and autisticlike characteristics can become more functional in society. M. S. Ed. (Master of Education...|$|R

In general, there are always interface fluctuations and interface intermixing during the epitaxial growth of compound semiconductor heterostructures. In this case, {{a better understanding of the}} role played by the fluctuations of QW thickness, and composition on the optical properties of the InGaAs/InAlAs heterostructures, is highly desirable for optimizing the device performance [38, 39]. Based on our experimental observation and simulations, it is very important to obtain smooth, abrupt interfaces for achieving high-quality QW structures. Depending on the application and desired thickness of the InGaAs/InAlAs structures, we should select a different approach to optimize the growth conditions in order to achieve the best quality QW. In order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> high-quality <b>thick</b> QWs, suppressing the composition drift or composition separation inside the QW will be the best choice. In order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> high-quality narrow QWs, however, more attention should be paid for obtaining smooth, abrupt InGaAs/InAlAs interfaces.|$|R

40|$|Laser welding is a {{promising}} technique for welding thick metal sheets, {{which is usually}} used for achieving full penetration in a single weld pass. However, among the imperfections that can occur, dropout formation becomes an increasingly larger problem when the sheets <b>to</b> be welded <b>get</b> <b>thicker.</b> When the sheets are 15 mm or thicker {{it is a challenge}} to suppress and countermeasures <b>to</b> suppress dropouts <b>get</b> less impact. If full penetration is not achieved, the dropout formation cannot be formed and the melt flows to form better weld caps. Therefore a typical method when welding 15 mm and thicker is to use partial penetration {{from both sides of the}} joint and thereby achieving full penetration, at a cost of increasing plate handling complexities and time losses. If the mechanisms behind the dropout formation can be understood, countermeasures may be developed and applied in order to be able to laser weld thicker plates with full penetration single pass welding. In order to understand the mechanics of the formation of dropout during full penetration welding in 15 mm thick plates, experiments have been conducted using laser hybrid arc welding (LAHW) using the laser in CW mode and also applying power modulation. During the experiments, the root has been observed with High Speed Imaging (HSI) to observe the mechanisms behind the formation. It is determined that the downward flow from the keyhole along with the surface tensional forces of the molten steel and its cooling rate play the most significant roles.

To support this Balangan county government make policy / program that is handling the construction and improvement of roads, routine and periodic maintenance. The policy is to achieve a smooth road services, safe and comfortable. So that development activities in the area there is no constraint. Way to memenuhu smoothness, safety and comfort requirements would have a thickness of the layers according to the circumstances existing subgrade. On that basis then, in the final writing, the author raised the title of Flexible Pavement Thickness Analysis Methods With ISO 1989 And Methods NCSA (National Crushed Association Design) At Toll Road District Education Balangan. The purpose of the writer was to determine thick flexible pavement with ISO 1989 method and the method of NCSA (National Crushed Association Design). Based on secondary data using the ISO 1989 obtained the results of calculations for the surface layer lataston HRS-WC with 3 cm thick HRS-BASE 4 cm thick, the base layer of crushed stone class A with 20 cm thick, and a layer of crushed stone foundation below grade B with a thickness of 10 cm. With the NCSA method <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a <b>thick</b> layer with a thick surface layer lataston 5 cm, the base layer of crushed stone class A 10 cm thick layer of crushed stone foundation under class B with a thickness of 25 cm. Of the two methods above can be known methods NCSA at the surface layer and the base layer is thinner, but to the method NCSA foundation layer 15 cm thicker than the method of ISO 1989...|$|R
