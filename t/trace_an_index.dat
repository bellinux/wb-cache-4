By replacing the representations on Hilbert spaces with this canonical imbedding, we define Fredholm modules and corresponding Chern-Connes characters that are intrinsic to the C^∗-dynamical system (A,ξ, Z^d). The compression of the Dirac operator against projectors from A _ξ Z^d produces generalized Fredholm operators over H_ <b>A</b> and Mingo's <b>index</b> defines <b>a</b> KK-map from K_ 0 (A _ξ Z^d) to K(A).

Eve never appeared better than that evening.

Her step even was that of a lady, having neither the mincing tread of a Paris grisette, a manner that sometimes ascends even to the bourgeoise the march of a cockneyess, nor the tiptoe swing of a belle; but it was the natural though regulated step, of a trained and delicate woman.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{a problem on}} a rectilinear crack in hardening elastoplastic material with load which is applied at infinity under plane-strain deformation conditions. While distributing  J -integral {{in this case it}} is necessary to take into account specific characteristics associated with strain potential for environments with nonholonomic state equations. While considering a problem on a crack in elastoplastic material a principal term of asymptotic expansion in crack tip vicinity has <b>an</b> unknown singularity <b>index</b> in addition to an indefinite multiplier. It has been shown for steel 12 X 18 H 9 T that while having invariance of energy integral it is possible to <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> singularity <b>index</b> for <b>a</b> principal term of stresses. The paper presents dependences of crack length compared to permissible Griffith’s length in accordance with the applied load which is associated with yield strength. Conceptions of  J -integrals have been described for solution of a quasi-static problem. The developed approach can be used to formulate a criterion for destruction of elastoplastic material containing a rectilinear crack. The obtained theoretical dependences pertaining to determination of structure limit state characteristics have permitted to make a motivated selection of geometric parameters with due account of material strength properties. Results of the investigations can be used while preparing recommendations for development of structures with prescribed properties. The given approach makes most sense to be applied for determination of critical forces and critical value of crack length for elastoplastic material. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{nosocomial}} {{epidemic of}} multiply resistant (MR) Klebsiella pneumoniae characterized by resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin {{occurred in a}} Veterans Administration hospital from 1975 to 1977. A total of 66 infected or colonized patients were observed in a 2 -year period; there were 43 urinary tract infections, 13 wound or soft tissue infections, 8 pneumonias, and 6 patients with only asymptomatic stool colonization. Four patients had both pneumonia and a urinary tract infection. There were five secondary bacteremias. The majority of MR K. pneumoniae strains were type 30, but types 17, 21, and 23 and nontypable organisms were also recovered. Other gram-negative bacilli with the same antibiotic resistance pattern were isolated from 14 patients. Seven MR K. pneumoniae and three resistant Escherichia coli isolates were shown to transfer resistance to E. coli K- 12. MR K. pneumoniae-infected patients were seriously ill, had long hospitalization times (mean, 67 days), and were in close geographic proximity to other cases. Compared with controls, cases more frequently had prior antibiotic treatment and urinary catheters, but not respiratory instrumentation, nasogastric tubes, or antacid treatment. The apparent {{source of the outbreak}} was <b>traced</b> to <b>an</b> <b>index</b> case who entered the hospital with an MR K. pneumoniae urinary tract infection. Asymptomatic gastrointestinal carriage without infection elsewhere was infrequent (1. 6 % of cultured patients), but 78 % of patients with MR K. pneumoniae infections at other sites also had the organism in their stools. Hospital antibiotic usage was unchanged before and during the outbreak. The identification of <b>an</b> <b>index</b> case and relative lack of asymptomatic stool carriers are unique features of this plasmid-mediated MR K. pneumoniae epidemic. Although this MR K. pneumoniae outbreak appeared to be controlled by the use of isolation techniques, a simultaneous increase in gentamicin resistance among other gram-negative organisms was observed...|$|R

Anomalies, such as the index effect, indicate weaknesses in this theory as it has been proved {{that it is possible to}} outperform the market using public information. Hence, the index effect can be linked to market efficiency which makes it interesting to study from a theoretical perspective. The mapping of the index effect is also interesting from a practical perspective, as it leads to a better understanding of whether investors and firms should take this anomaly into account. Problem: Is there <b>an</b> <b>index</b> effect, how does it behave and what can explain this effect? Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the index effect. This is to be able to draw conclusions about market efficiency and if investors and firms should take this anomaly into account. The index effect will be studied on OMXS 30 and OMXH 25 as these <b>indices</b> enables <b>a</b> price effect being <b>traced</b> to <b>an</b> <b>index</b> revision, separate from any new information being revealed. Method: The research approach will be deductive in nature, where existing theories in the field are used to generate hypotheses. These are then tested quantitatively by an event study based on time series data for stocks on the basis of <b>an</b> <b>index</b> revision. Conclusions: The results of this study shows <b>an</b> <b>index</b> effect for included stocks but not for excluded stocks. The index effect for included stocks can be distinguished from the end of the reference period. This is in line with what can be expected, since the criteria are designed so that a revision can be predicted. This effect is permanent and can be <b>traced</b> to <b>an</b> increased demand for stocks that are not perfect substitutes (Imperfect Substitute Hypothesis) and a greater awareness among investors (Awareness Hypothesis). Days after revision when the index effect already has reached its cumulative peak, there is a trend towards a reversal. This can be explained by that there exists a temporary price pressure associated with the revision (Price Pressure Hypothesis), in addition to a permanent effect. Finally, the index effect has decreased over time indicating that the market has become more efficient...|$|R
40|$|We present <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> {{formula for}} <b>an</b> <b>index</b> over the {{spectrum}} of four dimensional superconformal field theories on S 3 × time. Our index receives contributions from states invariant under at least one supercharge and captures all information – that may be obtained purely from group theory – about protected short representations in 4 dimensional superconformal field theories. In {{the case of the}} N = 4 theory our <b>index</b> is <b>a</b> function of four continuous variables.

Our index does not reproduce the entropy of supersymmetric black holes in AdS 5, {{but this is not a}} contradiction, as it differs qualitatively from the partition function over supersymmetric states of the N = 4 theory. We note that entropy for some small supersymmetric AdS 5 black holes may be reproduced via a D-brane counting involving giant gravitons. For big black holes we find a qualitative (but not exact) agreement with the naive counting of BPS states in the free Yang Mills theory. In this paper we also evaluate and study the partition function over the chiral rin...|$|R

Factors in the coronary prognostic index that were associated with impairment of left ventricular function at the time of infarction and that had predicted mortality to three years and from three to six years also predicted mortality from six to 15 years. These factors were cardiac enlargement, pulmonary venous congestion, and the presence of infarction before the index infarct.

40|$|Abstract — The {{longevity}} of {{wireless sensor networks}} is a major issue that impacts the application of such networks. While communication protocols are striving to save energy by acting on sensor nodes, recent results show that network lifetime can be prolonged by further involving sink mobility. As most proposals give their evidence of lifetime improvement through either (small-scale) field tests or numerical simulations on rather arbitrary cases, a theoretical understanding {{of the reason for}} this improvement and the tractability of the joint optimization problem is still missing. In this paper, we build a unified framework for investigating the joint sink mobility and routing problem. We formally prove the NP-hardness of the problem. We also investigate the induced sub-problems. In particular, we develop an efficient interior point algorithm to solve the sub-problem involving a single sink, then we generalize this algorithm to approximate the original problem. Finally, we apply the algorithm to a set of typical topological graphs; the results demonstrate the benefit of involving sink mobility, and they also suggest the desirable moving <b>traces</b> of <b>a</b> sink. <b>Index</b> Terms — Wireless sensor networks, lifetime, sink mobility, routing.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} the optimal minimum-energy {{scheduler}} for the adaptive joint allocation {{of the task}} sizes, computing rates, communication rates and communication powers in virtualized networked data centers (VNetDCs) that operate under hard per-job delay-constraints. The considered VNetDC platform works at the Middleware layer of the underlying protocol stack. It aims at supporting real-time stream service (such as, for example, the emerging big data stream computing (BDSC) services) by adopting the software-as-a-service (SaaS) computing model. Our objective is the minimization of the overall computing-plus-communication energy consumption. The main new contributions of the paper are the following ones: (i) the computing-plus-communication resources are jointly allotted in an adaptive fashion by accounting in real-time for both the (possibly, unpredictable) time fluctuations of the offered workload and the reconfiguration costs of the considered VNetDC platform; (ii) hard per-job delay-constraints on the overall allowed computing-plus-communication latencies are enforced; and, (iii) {{to deal with the}} inherently nonconvex nature of the resulting resource optimization problem, a novel solving approach is developed, that leads to the lossless decomposition of the afforded problem into the cascade of two simpler sub-problems. The sensitivity of the energy consumption of the proposed scheduler on the allowed processing latency, as well as the peak-to-mean ratio (PMR) and the correlation coefficient (i. e., the smoothness) of the offered workload is numerically tested under both synthetically generated and real-world workload <b>traces.</b> Finally, as <b>an</b> <b>index</b> of the attained energy efficiency, we compare the energy consumption of the proposed scheduler with the corresponding ones of some benchmark static, hybrid and sequential schedulers and numerically evaluate the resulting percent energy gaps...|$|R

This necessary condition {{is not usually}} sufficient, however; for {{that we need a}} re-finement of the Lefschetz number called the Reidemeister trace. Abstractly, the Lefschetz number is <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> in <b>a</b> symmetric monoidal category, while the Reidemeister <b>trace</b> is <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> in <b>a</b> bicategory; in this paper we relate these contexts by using indexed symmetric monoidal categories. In particular, we will show that for any symmetric monoidal category with <b>an</b> associated <b>indexed</b> symmetric monoidal category, there is an associated bicategory which produces refinements of trace analogous to the Reidemeister trace. This bicategory also produces a new notion of trace for parametrized spaces with dualizable fibers, which refines the obvious “fiberwise ” traces by incorporating the action of the fundamental group of the base space. We also advance the basic theory of indexed monoidal categories, including introducing a string diagram calculus which makes calculations much more tractable. This abstract framework lays the foundation for generalizations of these ideas to other contexts. Content...|$|R
