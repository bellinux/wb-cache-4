40|$|The present {{experimental}} study of soot processes in hydrocarbon-fueled laminar nonbuoyant and nonpremixed (diffusion) flames at microgravity within a spacecraft was motivated by the relevance of soot {{to the performance of}} power and propulsion systems, to the hazards of unwanted fires, and to the emission of combustion-generated pollutants. Soot processes in <b>turbulent</b> <b>flames</b> are of greatest practical interest, however, direct study of <b>turbulent</b> <b>flames</b> is not tractable because the unsteadiness and distortion of <b>turbulent</b> <b>flames</b> limit available residence times and spatial resolution within regions where soot processes are important. Thus, laminar diffusion flames are generally used to provide more tractable model flame systems to study processes relevant to <b>turbulent</b> diffusion <b>flames,</b> justified by the known similarities of gas-phase processes in laminar and <b>turbulent</b> diffusion <b>flames,</b> based on the widely-accepted laminar flamelet concept of <b>turbulent</b> <b>flames.</b> Unfortunately, laminar diffusion flames at normal gravity are affected by buoyancy due to their relatively small flow velocities and, as discussed next, {{they do not have the}} same utility for simulating the soot processes as they do for simulating the gas phase processes of <b>turbulent</b> <b>flames...</b>|$|R

50|$|Diffusion flames can be laminar {{diffusion}} flames (e.g. Candles and matches {{burning in}} the air etc.) and turbulent diffusion flames (e.g. furnaces, turbo-machinery, some liquid-fuel rocket engines and internal combustion engines) depending {{on the nature of}} mixed gas flow. Further, the flame shapes of this kind of burning are divided into two categories oxygen-rich diffusion flames and oxygen-deficient. Flame shapes also depend on the discharging velocity of fuel and air. Eddies inside the air flow {{plays an important role in}} deciding the flame shapes. With increase in discharging velocity of fuel into the air laminar diffusion flames tends to become turbulent diffusion flames. This leads to an increase in the flame height and finally it gains a maximum height (critical limit). After this limit further increase in the jet velocity of the fuel adds to instability of <b>turbulent</b> <b>flame.</b> The position where laminar flame is changing into <b>turbulent</b> <b>flame</b> is termed as “break-up point”. Increase in jet velocity after critical limit results in decrease of the whole flame height. Beyond this point the height of the break-up point reaches a certain value where even after increasing the jet velocity of fuel the flame height will not change. Studies by Hawthorne et al. prove that the chemical reaction rates in turbulent diffusion flames and in laminar diffusion flames are almost similar.|$|E

The primary objective of this investigation is to identify the mechanisms involved in the generation and interaction of large-scale structures in microgravity flames. This involves a study of vortex/flame interactions in a space-flight experiment utilizing a controlled, well-defined set of disturbances imposed on a laminar diffusion flame.

40|$|International audienceMulti-scale {{features}} of <b>turbulent</b> <b>flames</b> near a wall display {{two kinds of}} scale-dependent fractal features. In scale-space, an unique fractal dimension cannot be defined and the fractal dimension of the front is scale-dependent. Moreover, when the front approaches the wall, this dependency changes: fractal dimension also depends on the wall-distance. Our aim here is to propose a general geometrical framework that provides the possibility to integrate these two cases, in order to describe the multi-scale structure of <b>turbulent</b> <b>flames</b> interacting with a wall. Based on the scale-entropy quantity, which is simply linked to the roughness of the front, we thus introduce a general scale-entropy diffusion equation. We define the notion of "scale-evolutivity" which characterises the deviation of a multi-scale system from the pure fractal behaviour. The specific case of a constant "scale-evolutivity" over the scale-range is studied. In this case, called "parabolic scaling", the fractal dimension is a linear function of the logarithm of scale. The case of a constant scale-evolutivity in the wall-distance space implies that the fractal dimension depends linearly on the logarithm of the wall-distance. We then verified experimentally, that parabolic scaling represents a good approximation of the real multi-scale {{features of}} <b>turbulent</b> <b>flames</b> near a wall...|$|R

50|$|The flamelet concept {{considers}} the <b>turbulent</b> <b>flame</b> as an aggregate of thin, laminar(Re<2000), locally one-dimensional flamelet structures present within the turbulent flow field. Counterflow diffusion flame {{is a common}} laminar flame {{which is used to}} represent a flamelet in a turbulent flow. Its geometry consists of opposed and axi-symmetric fuel and oxidizer jets. As the distance between the jets is decreased and/or the velocity of the jets is increased, the flame is strained and departs from its chemical equilibrium until it eventually extinguishes. The mass fraction of species and temperature fields can be measured or calculated in laminar counterflow diffusion flame experiments. When calculated, a self-similar solution exists, and the governing equations can be simplified to only one dimension i.e. along the axis of the fuel and oxidizer jets. It is in this direction where complex chemistry calculations can be performed afford-ably.|$|E
50|$|This model approximates the <b>turbulent</b> <b>flame</b> as {{a series}} of laminar flamelet regions {{concentrated}} just around the stoichiometric surfaces of the reacting mixture. This model exploits the use of experimental data for determining relations between the variables considered like mass fraction, temperature etc. The nature and type of dependence of the variables is predicted through experimental data obtained during laminar diffusion flame experiment and laminar flamelet relationship is deduced based on the same. These relationships are then used to solve the transport equations for species mass fraction and mixture composition. The model can very well be implemented for situations where concentration of minor species in the combustion is to be computed like quantifying the generation of pollutants. A simple enhancement to the model results in the flamelet time scale model which takes finite rate kinetics effect into consideration. The flamelet time scale model produces steady laminar flamelet solution when reaction proceeds very fast and captures the finite rate effects when reaction chemistry is dominant.|$|E

For each individual fuel-air mixture presented in this work and the recently published iso-octane data from Leeds, normalized <b>turbulent</b> <b>flame</b> speed data of individual fuel-air mixtures approximately follow a Re-T,f(0. 5) scaling, for which the average radius is the length scale and thermal diffusivity is the transport property of the turbulence Reynolds number. At a given Re-T,Re-f, it is experimentally observed that the normalized <b>turbulent</b> <b>flame</b> speed decreases with increasing Markstein number, which could be explained by considering Markstein diffusivity as the leading dissipation mechanism for the large wave number flame surface fluctuations. Consequently, by replacing thermal diffusivity with the Markstein diffusivity in the turbulence Reynolds number definition above, it is found that normalized <b>turbulent</b> <b>flame</b> speeds could be scaled by Re-T,M(0. 5) irrespective of the fuel, equivalence ratio, pressure, and turbulence intensity for positive Markstein number flames...|$|E

The {{focus of the}} present work is on clarifying the impact of pressure dilatation/flamelet scrambling effects with a comprehensive second-moment closure used for evaluation purposes. Model extensions that take into account flamelet orientation and molecular diffusion are derived. Isothermal pressure transport is included with an additional variable density contribution derived for the flamelet regime of combustion. Full closure is assessed by comparisons with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNSs) of statistically ‘steady’ fully developed premixed <b>turbulent</b> planar <b>flames</b> at different expansion ratios. Subsequently, the prediction of lean premixed <b>turbulent</b> methane–air <b>flames</b> featuring fractal grid generated turbulence in an opposed jet geometry is considered.

Levels of anisotropy are broadly consistent with the DNS data and key aspects of opposed jet flames are well predicted. However, it is also shown that complications arise due to {{interactions between}} the imposed pressure gradient and combustion and that redistribution is affected along with the scalar flux at the leading edge.
