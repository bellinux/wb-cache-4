40|$|It {{has been}} proven that the noise-tuning-based {{hysteretic}} noisy chaotic neural network (NHNCNN) can use the noise <b>tuning</b> <b>factor</b> to improve the optimization performance obviously at lower initial noise levels while can not at initial higher noise levels. In order to improve the optimization performance of the NHNCNN at initial higher noise levels, we introduce a new noise <b>tuning</b> <b>factor</b> into the activation function and propose an improved hysteretic noisy chaotic neural network (IHNCNN) model. By regulating {{the value of the}} newly introduced noise <b>tuning</b> <b>factor,</b> both noise levels of the activation function and hysteretic dynamics in the IHNCNN can be adjusted to help to improve the global optimization ability as the initial noise amplitude is higher. As a result, the IHNCNN can exhibit better optimization performance at initial higher noise levels. In order to demonstrate the advantage of the IHNCNN over the NHNCNN, the IHNCNN combined with gradual expansion scheme (GES) is applied to solve broadcast scheduling problem (BSP) in wireless multihop networks (WMNs). The aim of BSP is to design an optimal time-division multiple-access (TDMA) frame structure with minimal frame length and maximal channel utilization.

The growing complexity of database systems stimulates the development of software tools to probe and predict system performance and to help in system design. The main contributions of this thesis are a study of DBMS <b>tuning</b> <b>factors</b> influencing its performance under OLAP workload, the design and validation of a queueing network model to capture the main features of the DBMS behavior, and the use of a quantitative approach to project the DBMS performance with OLAP workload. We built a workload model for OLAP, which is based on the TPC-H benchmark, to investigate the impact of DBMS <b>tuning</b> <b>factors</b> (such as buffer pool, sort heap, prefetching and number of I/O servers) on OLAP performance. We found there are certain thresholds on buffer pool and sort heap size in a DBMS with OLAP workload.

We propose a queueing network model (QNM) to represent the DBMS under study and give the results of preliminary experiments to validate this model. We have indicated, through discussion and example, how to modify the parameters of this model i to represent various common changes to the hardware (CPU and disk upgrade) and workload (number of users and database size).

40|$|Aerosol {{nucleation}} is {{an important}} source of particle number in the atmosphere. However, in order to become cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), freshly nucleated particles must undergo significant condensational growth while avoiding coagulational scavenging. In an effort to quantify the contribution of nucleation to CCN, this work uses the GEOS-Chem-TOMAS global aerosol model to calculate changes in CCN concentrations against a broad range of nucleation rates and mechanisms. We then quantify the factors that control CCN formation from nucleation, including daily nucleation rates, growth rates, coagulation sinks, condensation sinks, survival probabilities, and CCN formation rates, in order to examine feedbacks that may limit growth of nucleated particles to CCN. Nucleation rate parameterizations tested in GEOS-Chem-TOMAS include ternary nucleation (with multiple <b>tuning</b> <b>factors),</b> activation nucleation (with two pre-factors), binary nucleation, and ion-mediated nucleation. We find that nucleation makes a significant contribution to boundary layer CCN(0. 2 %), but this contribution is only modestly sensitive to the choice of nucleation scheme, ranging from 49 to 78 % increase in concentrations over a control simulation with no nucleation. Moreover, a two order-of-magnitude increase in the globally averaged nucleation rate (via changes to <b>tuning</b> <b>factors)</b> results in small changes (less than 10 %) to global CCN(0. 2 %) concentrations. To explain this, we present a simple theory showing that survival probability has an exponentially decreasing dependence on the square of the condensation sink. This functional form stems from a negative correlation between condensation sink and growth rate and a positive correlation between condensation sink and coagulational scavenging. Conceptually, with a fixed condensable vapor budget (sulfuric acid and organics), any increase in CCN concentrations due to higher nucleation rates necessarily entails an increased aerosol surface area in the accumulation mode, resulting in a higher condensation sink, which lowers vapor concentrations and growth rates. As a result, slowly growing nuclei are exposed to a higher frequency of coagulational scavenging {{for a longer period of}} time, thus reducing their survival probabilities and closing a negative feedback loop that dampens the impact of nucleation on CCN. We confirm quantitatively that the decreases in survival probability predicted by GEOS-Chem-TOMAS due to higher nucleation rates are in accordance with this simple theory of survival probability...|$|R

The questions of how to impose the posterior information being variably regularized and how to forget this information are carefully discussed. The estimator design adopts the strategy of the iterated Kalman filter but differs in that, instead of the separated moments of the linearized system, only the augmented covariance matrix is updated. To suppress obsolete information, a decision problem involving the Kullback-Leibler divergence is solved. The decision provides the best combination {{of a pair of}} time-evolution model hypotheses in terms of the geometric mean.
