5|$|Spokane and its {{metro area}} in general, {{particularly}} northern Idaho has been stigmatized {{in the popular}} consciousness {{by a number of}} hate groups that have been set up in and around Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in the past. Low ethnic diversity made the region a destination for some seeking to escape more cosmopolitan cities for a locale with a relatively homogenous, white population. This trend increased with the arrival of retired engineer Richard Butler from California who traveled to Hayden, Idaho in 1974 to eventually establish a white supremacist church called the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, better known by its political arm, the Aryan Nations. Aryan Nations recruits and associates were responsible for several hate crimes and terror plots during the mid 1980s and 1990s. The group went defunct in 2000 when <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Poverty</b> <b>Law</b> Center filed a civil suit which resulted in a $6.3 million settlement, which led to the eventual bankruptcy and closure of their Hayden compound. Another significant act of hate was the attempted bombing of Spokane's Martin Luther King Day Parade by Kevin Harpham of Addy, Washington in 2011. <b>The</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Poverty</b> <b>Law</b> Center currently lists three hate groups in the Spokane and Coeur d'Alene metro areas, in the categories of anti-Muslim, Holocaust denial, and general hate.|$|E

Shortly after the bombing, the FBI hired an additional 500agents to investigate potential domestic terrorist attacks.|$|E
