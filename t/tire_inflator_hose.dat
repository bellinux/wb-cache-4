40|$|Tire {{industry}} {{has become one}} of the huge industries at present since the number of vehicles are rapidly increasing. Since the tire directly related to the vehicle safety, durability, running cost and comfort level of the passengers tire selection and maintenance addressed widely. Maintaining a tire is a duty of the vehicle user and he may has to check the tire rapidly for wear, cuts and other irregularities. The most important activity of tire maintenance is to maintain the pressure of the tire. The tire pressure is an important issue since it directly relates to the safety of the vehicle, durability, running cost and comfort level of the passengers as mentioned above. A rapid check for tire pressure is essential since tire pressure may reduce normally with the time apart from losing pressure when the tire drives over a pothole or hump. Checking the tire is done using a machine called <b>tire</b> <b>inflator.</b> This machine must be accurate and user friendly since the operator has to trust on it. <b>Tire</b> <b>inflators</b> are available mostly in tire shops and in gas stations. <b>Tire</b> <b>inflators</b> are mainly two types, Analog <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> and Digital <b>tire</b> <b>inflators.</b> Digital <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> arrived the market recently and analog <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> are getting replaced with digital <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> as the convenience of operation. Digital <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> read the pressure with a pressure sensor and with this sensor the dynamic pressure readings are not possible. Hence to get the static pressure the inflation process has to be stopped. In other words, while in the inflation, the <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> has no idea about the tire pressure until the inflation stops. In this case, to have an idea about the rise of pressure, there must be a method to identify the type of the tire. The tire identification mechanism must be fast, accurate and reliable. The other requirement is that the tire has to be identified online and this process must not delay the inflation process. The main tusk of this exercise is to develop an artificial neural network based tire identification method. A developed <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> model was used to collect information and to test the tire identification process. To develop the network, three inputs were considered. By expanding the number of layers in the network experiment was carried out. The results were successful and that the network with two hidden layers zero percent error achieved...|$|R

5000|$|Canned <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> {{contain a}} {{pressurised}} fluid mixture of three components: ...|$|R
50|$|Since 1970 most BCs {{have used}} for {{inflation}} mainly gas {{from one of}} the diver's main cylinders, and an oral inflation tube have been generally retained for abnormal situations (no high pressure gas left, malfunction of an <b>inflator</b> <b>hose)</b> both underwater and on the surface.|$|R
5000|$|The harness {{is usually}} fitted with {{stainless}} steel D-rings secured by stainless steel [...] "sliders", small slotted plates which hold their position by friction. A loop of elastic cord is normally attached {{at the same}} place as the left shoulder D-ring, to secure the wing’s <b>inflator</b> <b>hose.</b> This arrangement is extremely rugged, reliable and hard-wearing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vent valves}} of a BCD are more secure and have backups, often via the <b>inflator</b> <b>hose,</b> the left {{shoulder}} valve, the right shoulder valve {{and sometimes the}} bottom. The dry suit has none, other than manipulating the neck and wrist seals, the wrist seals may not be available if wearing certain types of gloves.|$|R
50|$|If a canned <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> {{is used on}} a tire {{mounted on}} a wheel with chrome plating, then it is very {{important}} to thoroughly clean the entire wheel and the inside of the tire in order to prevent Chrome Peel.|$|R
50|$|When diving with {{a single}} first stage on a single cylinder, both second stage hoses route to the right, and the <b>inflator</b> <b>hose</b> and SPG hose route to the left. This lets divers use all the {{components}} {{in exactly the same}} way and store them in the same places as when they use two first stages. A long hose may be used for the primary, but is not obligatory for shallow open water diving.|$|R
50|$|The biggest {{complaint}} by tire professionals regarding <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> {{is around}} removing the sealant {{from inside the}} tire. They {{believe that it is}} a difficult, time-involved process that may damage the tire. Some brands like Fix-A-Flat offer a water-soluble formulation that allows the product to be removed quickly and easily with a towel and water.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} {{arrangement for}} sidemount {{is that all}} cylinders are independent, and each is provided with a single demand valve, an SPG, and on one or two, a low pressure <b>inflator</b> <b>hose</b> for buoyancy compensator and, if used, the drysuit. This implies that if gas is shared in an emergency, the recipient will be breathing from a different cylinder to the donor, unlike the more usual arrangement with backmount, where both divers breathe off the same set.|$|R
50|$|Canned <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> are {{single-use}} devices {{intended to}} provide a quick, temporary solution to drivers who experience flat tires. These devices seal the punctured tire and then reinflate it with pressurized gas, providing enough pressure to allow the vehicle to be driven {{for a short period}} at low speed. This allows the motorist to have the damaged tire professionally repaired or replaced, avoiding the need to replace the wheel at the roadside.|$|R
5000|$|Inflator valve {{malfunction}} can {{inflate the}} bladder when the buoyancy is not needed, {{and if not}} recognized and dealt with promptly, can result in uncontrolled ascent with associated risk of decompression illness. This can happen more quickly with inflators combined with alternative demand valves as they must use a larger bore hose connector. However, the standard overpressure and dump valves provided are able to vent air faster than the inflator valve can fill the bladder. This can be mitigated by the ability to disconnect the <b>inflator</b> <b>hose</b> under pressure, a skill which is trained by some agencies.|$|R
50|$|Also {{for safety}} reasons, the US National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration has {{mandated}} that all 2008 vehicles {{sold in the}} US and manufactured on or after September 1, 2007 must be equipped with tire pressure monitoring systems. Because many of these sensors are inside the tire, there was a concern {{about whether or not}} canned <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> and sealants would affect the sensors’ ability to correctly operate. Manufacturers have been working on finding solutions to this new legislation.|$|R
40|$|Motor vehicle {{accidents}} {{are one of}} the main killers on the road. Modern vehicles have several safety features to improve the stability and controllability. The tire condition is critical to the proper function of the designed safety features. Under or over inflated tires adversely affects the stability of vehicles. It is generally the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s user responsibility to ensure the tire inflation pressure is set and maintained to the required value using a <b>tire</b> <b>inflator.</b> In the <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> operation, the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s user sets the desired value and the machine has to complete the task. During the inflation process, the pressure sensor does not read instantaneous static pressure to ensure the target value is reached. Hence, the inflator is designed to stop repetitively for pressure reading and avoid over inflation. This makes the inflation process slow, especially for large tires. This paper presents a novel approach using artificial neural network based technique to identify the tire size. Once the tire size is correctly identified, an optimized inflation cycle can be computed to improve performance, speed and accuracy of the inflation process. The developed neural network model was successfully simulated and tested for predicting tire size from the given sets of input parameters. The test results are analyzed and discussed in this paper...|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} for the dry suit or BCD inflation valve to freeze while inflating, for similar reasons to regulator freeze. If this happens it can cause a runaway ascent {{if it is not}} dealt with immediately. If possible the low pressure <b>inflator</b> <b>hose</b> should be disconnected before it freezes onto the valve, while dumping air to control buoyancy. Excessive dumping of air may leave the diver too negative so it is preferable to have at least two controllable buoyancy systems, such as a dry suit and BCD, preferably supplied from different first stages. If the dry suit inflation valve freezes open it may allow water to leak into the suit once disconnected, so this usually results in aborting the dive.|$|R
50|$|Another variety, {{the dual}} bladder wing, {{contains}} a second, redundant bladder and inflation assembly, {{with the second}} bladder being intended for use if the primary bladder fails, either through a puncture, or through an inflation valve failing. Some technical divers may choose a dual bladder wing to have backup redundancy if the primary bladder fails. Detractors of this arrangement point out that if the extra bladder is inadvertently inflated, the diver may not realise that this has occurred, and it may result in an uncontrolled buoyant ascent. This risk may be reduced by having only oral inflation for the backup wing, or requiring the same <b>inflator</b> <b>hose</b> {{to be used for}} both wings, and having the backup bladder inflation on the opposite side to the primary bladder.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{low-pressure}} hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style quick release couple, fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible valve nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose. Both types of BCD and dry suit <b>inflator</b> <b>hoses</b> are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8” male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|R
50|$|The gas {{used in some}} inflators {{contains}} butane {{which is}} flammable and which may explode if exposed to high temperatures (either when in the can or in a re-inflated <b>tire).</b> Other <b>inflators</b> use a non-flammable formulation instead.|$|R
50|$|In newer cars, {{the socket}} is {{equipped}} with a plastic cover without the lighter heating element, due to declining popularity of smoking. However, the socket has been repurposed and continues to be used to power consumer electronics in vehicles. Often, a vehicle may come with several outlets for convenience, some in the rear passenger area of the vehicle or even the cargo area, for such purposes as powering portable GPS devices, recharging mobile phones, or powering a <b>tire</b> <b>inflator,</b> a vacuum cleaner or a thermoelectric cooler. These outlets usually have a plastic cap tethered to them, and are usually labeled as being only for DC power, because they are not intended to withstand the heat produced by an electrical cigarette lighter.|$|R

Tucker is stabbed while trying to give Princess enough time to escape with Tommy, the murdered customer's friend.|$|R
2500|$|The US and Canadian {{version of}} the Chevrolet Cruze entered limited {{production}} at Lordstown, Ohio, in July 2010 as a 2011 model, replacing the Chevrolet Cobalt. Full production began September 8, 2010. For these markets, the Cruze utilizes a more advanced Watts Z-link rear suspension from the Opel Astra (J). Offered in LS, LT, LTZ, and Eco trim lines, both the 1.8-liter and the turbocharged 1.4-liter engines are offered, coupled with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. With a starting price slightly higher than most compact competitors, the base model Cruze LS is equipped with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine and comes with air-conditioning and power locks, the higher-level LT and LTZ models is fitted with the 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine. For the Eco model, aerodynamic improvements have been made such as an electronically controlled air shutter that adjusts air flow to the engine depending on the temperature, wind speed and tow weight. To save weight, Chevrolet replaces the space saving spare tire and jack on the Eco model with a <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> kit, reducing weight by [...]|$|R
5000|$|In most scuba sets, a {{buoyancy}} compensator (BC) or buoyancy {{control device}} (BCD), {{such as a}} back-mounted wing or stabilizer jacket (also known as a [...] "stab jacket"), {{is built into the}} harness. Although strictly speaking this is {{not a part of the}} breathing apparatus, it is usually connected to the diver's air supply, to provide easy inflation of the device. This can usually also be done manually via a mouthpiece, in order to save air while on the surface, or in case of a malfunction of the pressurized inflation system. The BCD inflates with air from the low pressure <b>inflator</b> <b>hose</b> to increase the volume of the scuba equipment and cause the diver gain buoyancy. Another button opens a valve to deflate the BCD and decrease the volume of the equipment and causes the diver to lose buoyancy. Some BCDs allow for integrated weight, meaning that the BCD has special pockets for the weights that can be dumped easily in case of an emergency. The function of the BCD, while underwater, is to keep the diver neutrally buoyant, i.e., neither floating up or sinking. The BCD is used to compensate for the compression of a wet suit, and to compensate for the decrease of the diver's mass as the air from the cylinder is breathed away.|$|R

Items removed include air conditioning, the stereo system, rear seats, trunk floorboard and carpet, backup camera and emergency <b>tire</b> sealer and <b>inflator.</b> Exhaust resonators also have been removed for weight savings {{with the benefit of}} creating a sharper exhaust tone.|$|R
5000|$|For example, the [...] "Regina Valve" [...] is a valve {{very much}} {{similar to the}} Presta and mostly being used in Italy. Invisible tire valves are {{different}} in design from traditional <b>tire</b> valves. An <b>inflator</b> stem is not used; instead, a removable cap on a valve stem embedded in the tire rim is fitted, with only the cap visible. When inflating the tire, the cap is first removed, typically with a coin, and then a [...] "portable" [...] dedicated inflator stem is screwed onto the valve stem. Through the <b>inflator</b> the <b>tire</b> is inflated as usual.|$|R
