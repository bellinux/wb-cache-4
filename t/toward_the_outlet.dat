40|$|The in situ {{activity}} {{and distribution of}} heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria and their potential interactions were investigated in a full-scale, two-section, trickling filter designed for biological degradation of volatile organics and NH 3 in ventilation air from pig farms.

In situ aerobic activity showed a significant decrease through the filter, while the distribution of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was highly skewed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> filter <b>outlet.</b> Nitrite oxidation was not detected {{during most of the}} experimental period, and the AOB activity therefore resulted in NO 2 −, accumulation, with concentrations often exceeding 100 mM at the filter inlet.

As Qanats lead water {{by the force of}} gravity, the mother well is usually constructed on alluvial depositions at the bed of mountains and hills. This phenomenon has the advantage of reaching the water at a place and depth that is usually protected from outside contamination. To reach the water table, and locate the place of the mother well, the Qanat builders had to go through a trial an error process by digging a few boreholes.

Even the goshawk hesitates before taking a swoop at him, not knowing quite whether the gaudy creature is dangerous or only uncanny. I saw a great hawk once drop like a bolt upon a kingfisher that hung on quivering wings, rattling softly, before his hole in the bank. But the robber lost his nerve at the instant when he should have dropped his claws to strike. He swerved aside and shot upward in a great slant to a dead spruce top, where he stood watching intently till the dark beak of a brooding kingfisher reached out of the hole to receive the fish that her mate had brought her.

Wilson evidently heard them, though they were not in sight, and he circled somewhat so as to get ahead of them and drive them back. The invisible brook ran down over the rocks with murmur and babble. He halted with instinctive action. He listened. Forest sounds, soft, lulling, came on the warm, pine-scented breeze. It would have taken no keen ear to hear soft and rapid padded footfalls. He moved on cautiously and turned into a little open, mossy spot, brown-matted and odorous, full of ferns and bluebells. In the middle of this, deep in the moss, he espied a huge round track of a cougar. He bent over it. Suddenly he stiffened, then straightened guardedly. At that instant he received a hard prod in the back. Throwing up his hands, he stood still, then slowly turned. A tall hunter in gray buckskin, gray-eyed and square-jawed, had him covered with a cocked rifle. And beside this hunter stood a monster cougar, snarling and blinking.|$|E

40|$|Thermal-hydraulic {{analysis}} of a specially designed steam expansion device (heat cavity) was performed to prove the feasibility of steam expansions at elevated rates for power generation with higher efficiency. The steam expansion process inside the heat cavity greatly depends on the gap within which the steam expands and accelerates. This system {{can be seen as}} a miniaturized boiler integrated inside the expander where steam (or the proper fluid) is generated almost instantaneously prior to its expansion in the work-producing unit. Relatively cold water is pulsed inside the heat cavity, where the heat transferred causes the water to flash to steam, thereby increasing its specific volume by a large factor. The gap inside the heat cavity forms a special nozzle-shaped system in which the fluid expands rapidly, accelerating <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> system <b>outlet.</b> <b>The</b> expansion phenomenon is the cause of ever-increasing fluid speed inside the cavity system, eliminating the need for moving parts (pumps, valves, etc.). In fact, the subsequent velocity induced by the sudden fluid expansion causes turbulent conditions, forcing accelerating Reynolds and Nusselt numbers which, in turn, increase the convective heat transfer coefficient. When the combustion of fossil fuels constitutes the heat source, the heat cavity concept can be applied directly inside the stator of conventional turbines, thereby greatly increasing the overall system efficiency...|$|R
30|$|Storm flow during high-intensity {{rainfall}} is {{a special}} case of hillslope response characterized by an array of flow types that vary throughout the watershed and are susceptible to time-dependent change depending on topography, climate, soils, geology, land cover, vegetation, seasonality, and disturbance factors including wildland fire, agriculture, forest management activities, and water management. The hillslope response during storm flow depends on direct runoff composed of surface runoff (infiltration excess or saturation excess runoff; Horton, 1938; Dunne and Black, 1970) and subsurface storm flow. Although both mechanisms provide the fast-flow component of runoff (Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967; Agnese et al., 2001), the former has a faster response time than the latter because the residence time of water at the surface is shorter than the residence time {{of water in the}} soil. Fast hillslope response occurs on both convex and concave hillslopes, whereas slower hillslope response is associated with the process of subsurface storm flow and is mostly observed on convex hillslopes with deeply incised channels. The hillslope response is usually evaluated separately from the stream network response, which is the process of transport of all hillslope contributions <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> watershed <b>outlet</b> (Robinson and Sivapalan, 1996).|$|R
5000|$|A {{peristaltic}} pump {{is a type}} of positive displacement pump used for pumping a variety of fluids. The fluid is contained within a flexible tube fitted inside a circular pump casing (though linear {{peristaltic pump}}s have been made). A rotor with a number of [...] "rollers", [...] "shoes", [...] "wipers", or [...] "lobes" [...] attached to the external circumference of the rotor compresses the flexible tube. As the rotor turns, the part of the tube under compression is pinched closed (or [...] "occludes") thus forcing the fluid to be pumped to move through the tube. Additionally, as the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam ("restitution" [...] or [...] "resilience") fluid flow is induced to the pump. This process is called peristalsis and is used in many biological systems such as the gastrointestinal tract. Typically, there will be two or more rollers, or wipers, occluding the tube, trapping between them a body of fluid. The body of fluid is then transported, at ambient pressure, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pump <b>outlet.</b> Peristaltic pumps may run continuously, or they may be indexed through partial revolutions to deliver smaller amounts of fluid.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{constitutes}} an {{experimental study of}} the separation performances of a gas-liquid cylindrical cyclone (GLCC) separator that interests the oil industry. The global hydrodynamics behavior in the GLCC is characterized by flow visualization under various inflow operating conditions. The effect of the inlet nozzle design on the performances of the separator is studied by using three different nozzles, and it proves {{to be a key}} parameter. With an insufficient nozzle restriction, low swirl intensity is imparted to the flow. Due to inadequate centrifugal effects, liquid is prematurely carried over by the gas as flooding occurs in the separator upper part. High amounts of gas are also carried under by the liquid stream. On the other hand, with a too severe nozzle convergence, the important drag applied by the gas leads to liquid ``short circuiting'' <b>the</b> cyclone <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> gas <b>outlet.</b> In addition to the nozzle design, the separator performances are influenced by phenomena such as liquid bridging or the occurrence of the slug flow regime at the cyclone inlet.

40|$|Abstract Fractures and {{defects in}} {{wellbore}} cement {{can lead to}} increased possibilities of CO 2 leakage from abandoned wells during geological carbon sequestration. To investigate the physicochemical response of defective wellbore cement to CO 2 -rich brine, we carried out a reactive flow-through experiment using an artificially fractured cement sample at a length of 224. 8 mm. A brine solution with dissolved CO 2 at a pH of approximately 3. 9 was injected through the sample at a constant rate of 0. 0083 cm 3 /s. Surface opti-cal profilometry analysis and 3 -D X-ray microtomography imaging confirmed fracture closure and self-healing behavior consistent with the measured permeability decrease. Visual inspection of the reacted frac-ture surface showed the development of reactive patterns mapping the flow velocity field inside the frac-ture, as well as restricted flow <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sample <b>outlet.</b> <b>The</b> postexperiment permeability of the core sample was measured at half of its initial permeability. A reactive transport model was developed with parameters derived from the experiment to further examine property evolution of fractured cement under dynamic flow of CO 2 -rich brine. Sensitivity analysis showed that residence time {{and the size of}} initial frac-ture aperture are the key factors controlling the tendency to self-healing or fracture opening behavior and therefore determine the long-term integrity of the wellbore cement. Longer residence time and small aper-tures promote mineral precipitation, fracture closure, and therefore flow restriction.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis investigates the effects of urban development on two small streams near Madisonville, Texas. One stream is natural and used as a control against which Town Branch, the urbanized stream, is compared. Changes in width, depth, and channel capacity with drainage are evaluated for both creeks. When compared with the natural stream, the urbanized stream shows a complex response characterized by changes in capacity, width, and depth that are different from expected. These differences reflect the influences of urban features including earthen impoundments, concrete bank reinforcements, and encroachment of urban development. Channel capacities are larger than expected in the headwaters of the urbanized creek, but decreases through the urban area, before resuming a more natural trend in <b>the</b> lower reaches <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> basin <b>outlet.</b> Sediment analysis reveals possible disturbance of the natural trend due to urbanization.
