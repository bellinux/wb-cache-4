5|$|Indirect {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles {{have been observed}} in laboratories. Many particle physics candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect <b>them</b> <b>directly</b> are underway.|$|E
5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism {{may lead to}} secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency is associated with obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency may lead to osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat <b>them</b> <b>directly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting <b>them</b> <b>directly.</b> Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E

5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge <b>them</b> <b>directly</b> would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|Each Poor Law Union {{employed}} {{one or more}} relieving officers, {{whose job}} it was to visit those applying for assistance and assess what relief, if any, they should be given. Any applicants considered to be in need of immediate assistance could be issued with a note admitting <b>them</b> <b>directly</b> to the workhouse. Alternatively they might be offered any necessary money or goods to tide them over until the next meeting of the guardians, who would decide on the appropriate level of support {{and whether or not}} the applicants should be assigned to the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the wounds}} inflicted by the blast were {{permanently}} debilitating, {{such as those}} caused by flying glass or by the flash of the explosion. Thousands of people had stopped to watch the ship burning in the harbour, many from inside buildings, leaving <b>them</b> <b>directly</b> {{in the path of}} glass fragments from shattered windows. Roughly 5,900 eye injuries were reported, and 41 people lost their sight permanently.|$|E

5|$|The {{cattle egret}} {{is a popular}} bird with cattle ranchers for its {{perceived}} role as a biocontrol of cattle parasites such as ticks and flies. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets {{reduced the number of}} flies that bothered cattle by pecking <b>them</b> <b>directly</b> off the skin. It was the benefit to stock that prompted ranchers and the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry to release the species in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with <b>them</b> <b>directly.</b> Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|After the {{six years}} of absolutism that {{followed}} Ferdinand's return to the throne on 1 January 1820, Rafael del Riego initiated an army revolt {{with the intent of}} restoring the 1812 Constitution. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after an unstable period, a French invasion supported by an alliance of the major powers had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate <b>them</b> <b>directly</b> to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.|$|E

5|$|Before the Treaty of Lisbon {{came into}} force, the {{executive}} {{power of the}} EU was held by the Council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However, the Council was allowed to withdraw these powers, exercise <b>them</b> <b>directly,</b> or impose conditions on their use. This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon, after which the Commission exercises its powers just {{by virtue of the}} treaties. Powers are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to the Commission's lack of power over areas like foreign policy– that power is held by the European Council, which some analysts have described as another executive.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{similarities}} between Pithecanthropus erectus (Java Man) and Sinanthropus pekinensis (Peking Man) led Ernst Mayr to rename both Homo erectus in 1950, placing <b>them</b> <b>directly</b> {{in the human}} evolutionary tree. To distinguish Java Man from other Homo erectus populations, some scientists began to regard it as a subspecies, Homo erectus erectus, in the 1970s. Other fossils found {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century in Java at Sangiran and Mojokerto, all older than those found by Dubois, are also considered part of the species Homo erectus. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery the fossils of Java Man were the oldest hominin fossils ever found. The fossils of Java Man have been housed at the Naturalis in the Netherlands since 1900.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{continued}} to promote internal infrastructure improvements throughout his term in Congress. He introduced legislation {{to build more}} forts in the northwest, to grant federal funding for improvement projects in Indiana and Ohio, and led the debate in support of using federal funds to build the nations longest canal, Wabash and Erie Canal, through Indiana. He introduced a legislative amendment that made a provision to locate and survey the National Road to the west, toward the Mississippi River, so {{the people living in}} Indiana and Illinois would have some assurance that the road's large federal appropriation would benefit <b>them</b> <b>directly.</b> Jennings helped secure appropriation of funds to survey the Wabash River and make it more accessible to year-round steamboat travel.|$|E

5|$|The Council of Regency, the Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires and the peninsulars {{opposed the}} new situation. The Royal Audiencia {{secretly}} swore {{allegiance to the}} Council of Regency a month later and sent communiqués to the other cities of the Viceroyalty, to request them to deny recognition to the new government. To {{put an end to}} these activities, the Junta assembled Cisneros and {{all the members of the}} Royal Audiencia on the pretext that their lives were in danger, and sent them into exile aboard the British ship Dart. Captain Mark Brigut Larrea was instructed to avoid American ports and deliver all of <b>them</b> <b>directly</b> to the Canary Islands. The Junta then appointed a new Audiencia composed entirely of criollos loyal to the revolution.|$|E
5|$|The first mode would feature 2D and pre-rendered {{graphics}} {{enhanced with}} 3D spell and battle effects. Some {{of the effects}} created by Lazur would rely on software programming rather than the Nintendo 64 hardware, as the latter would not be capable of rendering <b>them</b> <b>directly.</b> The second mode would be a full 3D mode played in either regular or high display resolution, and would feature different level of detail textures depending on camera distances, to maximize clarity and performance. Both modes {{would be in a}} top-down perspective, although more cinematic camera angles, similar to those from , were also considered for the 3D mode.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} sources {{used by the}} evangelist were the Jewish scriptures (the Tanakh, more or less identical with the Christian Old Testament), probably in the Greek translation. John quotes from <b>them</b> <b>directly,</b> references important figures from them, and uses narratives from them {{as the basis for}} several of the discourses. But the author was also familiar with non-Jewish sources: the Logos of the prologue (the Word that is with God from the beginning of creation) derives from both the Jewish concept of Lady Wisdom and from the Greek philosophers, while John 6 alludes not only to the exodus but also to Greco-Roman mystery cults, while John 4 alludes to Samaritan messianic beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the bay where the pirates were said to be, Alligator dispatched boats to engage the enemy vessels, as the water was too shallow for the warship to engage <b>them</b> <b>directly.</b> With Allen personally commanding one of the boats, the Americans assaulted the schooner Revenge. Although the Navy was able to force the pirates into abandoning Revenge, the buccaneers managed to fight {{their way out of}} the bay and inflict seven casualties. With their commander mortally wounded, the boats ceased pursuit of the pirates, but were able to recover the vessels that had been held in the bay.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, the PSC {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of the groups that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve <b>them</b> <b>directly.</b> The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they had made in doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.|$|E
5|$|Hitler sought Lebensraum ("living space") for the German {{people in}} Eastern Europe and his {{aggressive}} {{foreign policy is}} considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In December 1941, he formally declared war on the United States, bringing <b>them</b> <b>directly</b> into the conflict. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In {{the final days of the}} war during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, he married his long-time lover Eva Braun. Less than two days later on 30 April 1945, the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army and their corpses were burned.|$|E
