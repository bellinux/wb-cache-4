40|$|Chk 1 {{is widely}} {{known as a}} DNA damage {{checkpoint}} signaling protein. Unlike many other checkpoint proteins, Chk 1 also plays an essential but poorly defined role in the proliferation of unperturbed cells. Activation of Chk 1 after DNA damage is known to require the phosphorylation of several C-terminal residues, including the highly conserved S 317 and S 345 sites. To evaluate the respective roles of these individual sites and assess their contribution to the functions of Chk 1, we used a gene <b>targeting</b> <b>approach</b> to introduce <b>point</b> mutations into the endogenous human CHK 1 locus. We report that the essential and nonessential functions of Chk 1 are regulated through distinct phosphorylation events and can be genetically uncoupled. The DNA damage response function of Chk 1 was nonessential. Targeted mutation of S 317 abrogated G 2 /M checkpoint activation, prevented subsequent phosphorylation of Chk 1, impaired efficient progression of DNA replication forks, and increased fork stalling, but did not impact viability. Thus, the nonessential DNA damage response function of Chk 1 could be unambiguously linked to its role in DNA replication control. In contrast, a CHK 1 allele with mutated S 345 did not support viability, indicating an essential role for this residue during the unperturbed cell cycle. A distinct, physiologic mode of S 345 phosphorylation, initiated at the centrosome during unperturbed mitosis was independent of codon 317 status and mechanistically distinct from the ordered and sequential phosphorylation of serine residues on Chk 1 induced by DNA damage. Our findings suggest an essential regulatory role for Chk 1 phosphorylation during mitotic progression...|$|R

An <b>approach</b> <b>targeted</b> to <b>point</b> out strategies being more effective and consistent with the goals of competitive growth. In order to assess the effects that a more integrated territory mobility approach could produce in relation to the functional reorganization of urban systems both on national and local scale, the paper suggests an analysis that quantifies the “financial mass” invested in transport infrastructure and urban equipments as well as its weight modification in the course of time. The above said assessment was worked out by analysing the trend of public expenditure in Italy during the five-year period 2000 - 2005, appraising the “value” of the interventions in transport infrastructure in comparison to the interventions for realizing and managing urban equipments. The worked out analysis stresses how much the strategies of territorial development, both on central and local level, mainly rely on the interventions for realizing and managing transport infra structures.

40|$|Many {{countries}} {{in the developing world}} have adopted an approach to monetary policy that focuses on maintaining a low level of inflation, to the exclusion of other important objectives such as employment generation, increasing investment or reducing poverty, despite the widespread evidence that moderate levels of inflation have few or no costs. Some have even adopted formal “inflation targeting”, an approach which commits the central bank to hitting a fairly rigid inflation target, often as low as 2 %. However, this focus has led to slower economic growth and lower employment growth, without succeeding in lowering inflation at a smaller economic cost than traditional methods of inflation fighting. Clearly, it is time to find an alternative to inflation targeting. This paper presents the real <b>targeting</b> <b>approach</b> to monetary policy, which I argue is superior alternative to the costly and ineffective inflation <b>targeting</b> <b>approach.</b> Under this real <b>targeting</b> <b>approach,</b> central banks are given a country appropriate target such as employment growth, unemployment, real GDP or investment, usually subject to an inflation constraint. Given these two targets – the real target and the constraint – the central bank will find multiple tools to reach these targets, designing new tools and rediscovering old tools such as asset based reserve requirements and other credit allocation techniques. The real <b>targeting</b> <b>approach</b> might also be complemented by other policies, such as capital management techniques to deal with possible capital flight. The real <b>targeting</b> <b>approach</b> has the potential to make central bank policy more transparent, more accountable, and more socially useful than most currently existing central bank structures. ...|$|R

The goal was to obtain conjugates which retained the maximum antigen recognition features and that produced the highest fluorescence intensities. We found that only amine <b>targeted</b> <b>approach</b> could produce higher dye per antibody variants (> 3) with a maximum yield of antibody conjugates. Sulfhydryl and carbohydrate <b>targeted</b> <b>approaches</b> are site-specific, however, they led to the generation of low amount of functional dye-antibody conjugates.

We wanted to demonstrate the relationship of CD 1 d with peptide antigen presenters i. e. major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the cell surface. We documented using fluorescent dye-antibody conjugates and biophysical tools that CD 1 d harbors a close relationship with MHC I, β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 m), MHC II and GM 1 gangliosides on the plasma membrane of human B cells at resting state.

40|$|Recombinant {{adenoviral}} vectors {{are promising}} reagents for therapeutic interventions in humans, including gene therapy for biologically complex diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases. In this regard, the major advantage of adenoviral vectors is their superior in vivo gene transfer efficiency {{on a wide}} spectrum of both dividing and non-dividing cell types. However, this broad tropism at the same time represents an important limitation for their use in therapeutic applications where specific gene transfer is required. This limitation may be overcome by using <b>targeting</b> <b>approaches.</b> In this regard, targeting may be achieved at three levels: transductional targeting, translational targeting and targeting of the expressed transgene. Here we describe our research efforts towards cancer specific gene therapy using these different <b>targeting</b> <b>approaches.</b> The results show that targeting of adenoviral vectors may be achieved using cancer specific cell surface molecules for transductional and transgene targeting or cancer specific promoters for transcriptional targeting.

These results confirm the existence of hazardous substances in the hospital effluents. The University Hospital Frantz Fanon in Blida {{is located in a}} sensitive place of Mitidja. The effluents can contaminate surface water (valley Sidi El Kebir, valley Mazafran) and groundwater via infiltration and the porous nature of the soil. It is feared that the underground current (groundwater) contaminate {{a large portion of the}} basement of the Mitidja in the long run. Faced with the urgency and the risk they represent, we have developed a method called the <b>targeted</b> <b>approach</b> for more effective management of hospital waste. Indeed, in the global approach, the hospital effluents are collected by a sewer system treated in a wastewater treatment plant before being rendered in the environment.

Watershed-scale evaluation of effects of BMP implementation on fecal bacteria and sediment yield can be estimated using a watershed water quality model, and strategies for identifying critical areas in a watershed can be pollutant specific. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model {{was used in the}} Upper Wakarusa watershed (950  km 2) in northeast Kansas to explore effectiveness of vegetative filter strip (VFS) lengths applied at the edge of fields to reduce non-point source pollution. The Upper Wakarusa watershed is a high priority total maximum daily load (TMDL) designation watershed for fecal bacteria in Kansas. This study characterizes fecal bacteria sources (human, livestock, and wildlife) and targets VFS to abate sediment and fecal bacteria pollution from the Upper Wakarusa watershed. Objectives of this study were to test the effectiveness of VFS lengths (0, 10, 15 and 20  m) for removing overland process sediment and fecal bacteria concentration, rank sub-watersheds after determining sediment and fecal bacteria contribution of each sub-watershed, and demonstrate the SWAT model's ability to evaluate effectiveness of VFS application to abate sediment and fecal bacteria using <b>targeted</b> and random <b>approaches</b> to select 10, 25 and 50 % of the sub-watersheds.
