40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 08 - 11, 1968 / Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThis {{presentation}} {{deals with}} a multi-mission deep-space telemetry system, its rationale, analysis, development into hardware, and its subsequent planned application to an actual spacecraft mission whose preparation is now in progress. The spacecraft system encodes raw binary data into a comma-free, bi-orthogonal code which antipodally modulates a square-wave subcarrier, which in turn phase-modulates the downlink carrier. There is no separate signal for subcarrier, word, or symbol sync; all <b>transmitted</b> <b>sideband</b> power is thus available for data transmission...|$|E
40|$|We {{theoretically}} study {{nonlinear optics}} of excitons under intense THz irradiation. In particular, the linear near infrared absorption and resonantly enhanced nonlinear sideband generation are described. We predict a rich {{structure in the}} spectra which can be interpreted {{in terms of the}} quasienergy spectrum of the exciton, via a remarkably transparent expression for the susceptibility, and show that the effects of strongly avoided quasienergy crossings manifest themselves directly, both in the absorption and <b>transmitted</b> <b>sidebands.</b> Comment: 4 pages RevTex, 3 eps figs included, as publishe...|$|R
50|$|Radiofax is <b>transmitted</b> {{in single}} <b>sideband</b> {{which is a}} {{refinement}} of amplitude modulation. The signal shifts up or down a given amount to designate white or black pixels. A deviation less than that for a white or black pixel is taken to be a shade of grey. With correct tuning (1.9 kHz below the assigned frequency for USB, above for LSB), the signal shares some characteristics with SSTV, with black at 1500 Hz and peak white at 2300 Hz.|$|R
50|$|Vestigal <b>sideband</b> <b>transmits</b> {{the carrier}} and one {{complete}} side-band, but filters out the redundant side-band. It is {{a compromise between}} AM and SSB, allowing simple receivers to be used but requiring almost as much transmitter power as AM. One advantage is that only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used. It {{can be heard in}} the transmission of certain radio time signal stations. Vestigial sideband is used for over the air Television Broadcasts both analog and digital.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{communications}} system which uses a combination of single and double- sideband techniques. Audio intelligence information is <b>transmitted</b> via single <b>sideband</b> and a single frequency tone is <b>transmitted</b> via double <b>sideband</b> to provide a means of carrier- frequency reinsertion at the receiving terminal. This system provides the power and spectrum conservation achieved by single-sideband techniques, and the means of obtaining the proper frequency for carrier reinsertion at the receiver which can be obtained by synchronous reception of the double- sideband information. The carrier frequency, which is common to both the single and doublesideband signals during the generation process at the transmitter, is suppressed to the fullest possible extent prior to the actual transmission of the sidebands. Use of a narrow bandwidth filter for the double sidebands at the receiver allows the synchronizing tone to be transmitted at a level much lower than that of the intelligence-bearing single sideband, providing economy of transmitted power. The inherent automatic-frequency-control feature of the synchronous detector allows system frequency stability requirements to be lessened, and provides rapid frequency correction to overcome Doppler frequency shifts.

50|$|During {{this period}} of operation, {{communications}} via satellite did not yet exist. As a result, communications between the DAMP ship and New Jersey was {{through the use of}} single-sideband (SSB) radio, generally {{through the use of a}} 10 kW transmitter. The DAMP ship generally <b>transmitted</b> upper <b>sideband</b> (USB) voice and/or lower sideband (LSB) frequency-shift keying radioteletype in the area of 16 and 22 MHz when atmospheric conditions were favorable. When communications became difficult because of atmospheric conditions, the DAMP ship shifted to carrier wave (CW) transmission using standard Morse Code. In addition, because the ship could be out to sea for extended periods, such as a month or so, the DAMP ship carried an amateur radio room and equipment, which technical personnel could use to communicate with their families back home in the States via short wave radio.|$|R
40|$|Pilot-based {{calibration}} {{techniques are}} used to reduce the effects of multipath fading in mobile satellite receivers. One of the more recent of these techniques, namely the tone calibration technique (TCT), suggests <b>transmitting</b> double <b>sideband</b> modulation with the pilot tone located {{at the center of}} its spectrum where the amplitude and phase characteristics of the channel are most stable. To 'make room' for the pilot {{in the presence of the}} Doppler shift, the equivalent low-pass data sidebands must be shaped so as to have zero response in the neighborhood of dc. Other techniques such as transparent tone-in-band (TTIB) similarly 'notch out' a hole in the center of the data spectrum for location of the pilot. An alternate possibility which is at the same time much more bandwidth efficient than TCT is a dual-pilot tone calibration technique (DPTCT) that symmetrically locates a pair of pilots outside the data spectrum near the band edges of the channel. The operation and performance of DPTCT are analyzed, and its effectiveness is compared to that of the single tone TCT technique...|$|R
40|$|Large Cryogenic Gravitational wave Telescope (LCGT) is {{the future}} Japanese gravitational-wave detector. It will employ the {{broadband}} resonant sideband extraction (RSE) as its optical configuration. We compared four signal extraction schemes that have been proposed so as to downselect one of them as the scheme for LCGT. The selected scheme uses the phase and amplitude modulation sidebands: the phase modulation <b>sidebands</b> <b>transmitting</b> to the antisymmetric port (AP) and the amplitude modulation sidebands reffected to the symmetric port (SP) by {{the functions of the}} Michelson asymmetry. Using these sidebands, a new technique called 'delocation' is applicable. One advantage is that the control signals of the undesired signals do not appear at the AP, where the differential signals appear...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{distribution}} of millimeter wave signals while merging of radio frequency and optical fiber technologies, A Radio over Fiber (RoF) system is taking under research and its time-domain analysis is used while considering the phase noise effect with a power spectral density (PSD) and autocorrelation function to its performance improvements. This analysis uses a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DD-MZM) and photodetector (PD) for <b>transmitted</b> single <b>sideband</b> (OSSB) signal as the OSSB signal is tolerable for power degradation due to a chromatic fiber-dispersion effect. In time domain, we have shown the output current of PD is the function of Phase Noise from Laser linewidth and RF Oscillator linewidth. In this paper, we have calculate the received signal power {{with respect to the}} power spectral density (PSD), derive a closed-form of signal to noise ratio and shall analyse the bit error rate (BER) performance using different modulation scheme. In simulation results, we have illustrated the variation of signal to noise ratio with respect to RF Oscillator linewidth under different values of percentage of received power. Also, we shall observe the BER performance using different modulation scheme variation with RF Oscillator linewidth. Finally, we suggest the condition for choosing RF Oscillator linewidth for better performance of RoF system for its future implementation...|$|R
40|$|We propose and mathematically {{characterize}} a novel radio-over-fiber (ROF) downlink, where a {{radio access}} point (RAP) {{benefits from the}} transmit diversity gain of space-time block coding (STBC). Significantly, this transmit diversity is achieved using a single optical modulator in the base station (BS). In the proposed architecture, each RAP is fed with a single optical double-sideband signal, where each <b>sideband</b> <b>transmits</b> {{one of the two}} STBC-encoded signals. This optical signal is generated in the BS by performing the simultaneous optical upconversion of the baseband STBC signals using a single Mach-Zehnder modulator. The proposed optical backhaul is designed and simulated to impose negligible degradation to that imposed by the dominant wireless link, thereby enabling a designer to exploit the advantages offered by a wireless link having a diversity gain...|$|R
40|$|Sideband mutual {{interactions}} between VLF {{waves in the}} magnetosphere are investigated. Results of an experimental program involving the generation of sidebands by means of frequency shift keying are presented which indicate that the energetic electrons in the magnetosphere can interact only with sidebands generated by signals with short modulation periods. Using {{the value of the}} memory time during which electrons interact with the waves implied by the above result, it is estimated that the length of the electron interaction region in the magnetosphere is between 4000 and 2000 km. Sideband interactions are found to be similar to those between constant-frequency signals, exhibiting suppression and energy coupling. Results from a second <b>sideband</b> <b>transmitting</b> program show that for most cases the coherence bandwidth of sidebands is about 50 Hz. Sideband mutual interactions are then explained by the overlap of the ranges of the parallel velocity of the electrons which the sidebands organize, and the wave intensity in the interaction region is estimated to be 2. 5 - 10 milli-gamma, in agreement with satellite measurements...|$|R
