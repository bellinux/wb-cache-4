Synthesis, characterization, and application were investigated for each topic. ^ Line-formations were formed spontaneously by self-assembly from vanadium sol-gels and other metal containing solutions on glass substrates. The solutions were {{prepared by the}} dissolution of metal oxide or salt in water. A more straightforward method is proposed than used in previous work. Analyses using optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and infrared spectroscopy showed discreet lines whose deposition could be controlled by varying the concentration. A mechanism was developed from the observed results. ^ Microwave heating, the addition of graphite rods, and oxidants, can enhance HCB remediation from soil. To achieve remediation, a Teflon® vessel open to the atmosphere along with an oxidant, potassium persulfate (PerS) or potassium hydroxide, along with uncoated or aluminum oxide coated, graphite rods were heated in a research grade microwave oven. Microwave heating was used to decrease the heating time, and graphite rods were used to increase the absorption of the microwave energy by providing thermal centers.

The {{temperature dependence}} of the dc resistivity of the pure sample has shown the Peierls metal-insulator phase transition at 180 K, where the transition is very sharp. The rubidium doping shifts the transition temperature to a lower temperature (170 K) and smears out the metal-insulator phase transition, i. e., the rubidium doping broadens the transition peak. Compared with the rubidium doping, the <b>tungsten</b> <b>doping</b> broadens the transition peak more and shifts the transition temperature to a lower temperature (140 K). The temperature-dependent dc resistivity curves of pure, Rb-doped, and W-doped blue bronze K 0. 3 MoO 3 single crystals are analyzed {{in terms of the}} pseudogap just above TP and the Peierls energy gap below TP. The non-linear transport properties of pure, Rb-doped, and W-doped blue bronze K 0. 3 MoO 3 single crystals have shown a nonlinear conductivity due to an incoherent CDW sliding, when the applied electric field exceeds the first threshold field (ET). Furthermore, above a second threshold field (ET* > ET) a coherent CDW-sliding sets in. For all studied samples, we find a monotonic increase of ET and ET* with decreasing temperature.

40|$|Serial co-sputtering is an {{extension}} of conventional magnetron sputtering: it utilizes cylindrical primary rotating sputter sources within a metallic or reactive sputtering process. With one or more auxiliary sputter sources the surface of the primary sputter target is simultaneously coated with additional elements. In the primary sputtering process, these elements get implanted and mixed into the primary target material leading to production of multi-component films. In this paper we use an installation of this technology called "Megatron TM ", which involves an effective gas separation between primary and auxiliary chamber volumes. With this setup, we fabricated TiO 2 :W and TiO 2 :Nb layers by using a rotating Titania target as primary source and planar W and Nb targets as auxiliary sources, respectively. In both cases the so called sputter yield amplification effect (SYA) was demonstrated: Within the TiO 2 matrix the heavier element e. g. tungsten keeps the sputter cascade close to the target surface and thus significantly enhances the sputter rate. Additionally, by niobium doping in combination with a post-deposition annealing it is possible to get TiO 2 :Nb layers with tailored Nb composition as conductive transparent oxides (TCO). Due to the independent power control of the secondary target the tungsten and niobium concentration can easily be optimized. We present doping series for optimizing either the SYA effect for TiO 2 :W or the effect of a transparent conductive TCO for TiO 2 :Nb. With <b>tungsten</b> <b>doping</b> we achieved an enhancement of more than twice the DC sputter rate.

40|$|VO 2 nanobelts with metal-semiconductor {{properties}} {{were prepared}} through low temperature hydrothermal reaction and post annealing. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometry were employed to investigate the evolution of structure, morphology and properties of the VO 2 nanobelts. The results illustrate that the pure VO 2 (B) nanobelts {{can be obtained by}} hydrothermal reaction. The shape of the nanobelts evolves with hydrothermal temperature, time and reactant concentration. With the increasing of hydrothermal temperature from 160 degrees C to 200 degrees C, the nanobelts become homogenous and regular. The regular nanobelts are also obtained by the decrease of V 2 O 5 concentration. Samples prepared at 200 degrees C over 48 h have superior morphology and crystallinity. After annealing, VO 2 (B) can be transformed into VO 2 (M), which is dependent on the hydrothermal conditions. Samples prepared at 160 degrees C over 48 h and 180 degrees C over 48 h can be transformed into VO 2 (M) at 450 degrees C over 2 h, while samples obtained at 200 degrees C over 48 h should be annealed at 500 degrees C for 2 h. The nanobelts are transformed into irregular nanostructures, nanorods and nanobelts at the hydrothermal temperatures of 160 degrees C, 180 degrees C and 200 degrees C, respectively. However, samples prepared at 200 degrees C over 48 h with a V 2 O 5 concentration of 0. 0125 M can keep the intact nanobelts after annealing. The DSC analysis proves that the VO 2 (M) shows good phase transition behavior around 68 degrees C and the phase transition temperature can be reduced to 58 degrees C by 0. 5 at% <b>tungsten</b> <b>doping.</b> After mixing the VO 2 (M) with acrylic resin, the visible transmission of the VO 2 composite coating on glass is up to 52. 2 % and the solar modulation at 2000 nm is up to 31. 5 %, which means that it is a good candidate for smart windows...|$|E
40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) {{has been}} {{discussed}} as a promising material for high power bipolar devices for almost twenty years. Advances in SiC crystal growth especially the development of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have enabled the fabrication of high quality material. Much progress has further been achieved in identifying minority charge carrier lifetime limiting defects, which {{may be attributed to}} structural defects, surface recombination or point defects located in the band gap of SiC. Deep levels can act as recombination centers by interacting with both the valence and conduction band. As such, the defect levels reduce the minority charge carrier lifetime, which is of great importance in bipolar devices. Impurities in semiconductors play an important role to adjust their semiconducting properties. Intentional doping can introduce shallow defect levels to increase the conductivity or deep levels for achieving semi-insulating (SI) SiC. Impurities, especially transition metals generate defect levels deep in the band gap of SiC, which trap charge carriers and thus reduce the charge carrier lifetime. Transition metals, such as vanadium, are used in SiC to compensate the residual nitrogen doping. It has previously been reported that valence band edges of the different SiC polytypes are pinned to the same level and that deep levels related to transition metals can serve as a common reference level; this is known as the LANGER-HEINRICH (LH) rule. Electron irradiation introduces or enhances the concentration of existing point defects, such as the carbon vacancy (VC) and the carbon interstitial (Ci). Limiting the irradiation energy, Eirr, below the displacement energy of silicon in the SiC lattice (Eirr < 220 keV), the generated defects can be attributed to carbon related defects, which are already created at lower Eirr. Ci are mobile at low temperatures and using low temperature heat treatments, the annealing behavior of the introduced Ci and their complexes can be studied. Deep levels, which appear and disappear depending on the electrical, thermal and optical conditions prior to the measurements are associated with metastable defects. These defects can exist in more than one configuration, which itself can have different charge states. Capacitance transient investigations, where the defect’s occupation is studied by varying the depletion region in a diode, can be used to observe such occupational changes. Such unstable behavior may influence device performance, since defects may be electrically active in one configuration and inactive after transformation to another configuration. This thesis is focused on electrical characterization of deep levels in SiC using deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). The first part, papers 1 - 4, is dedicated to defect studies of both impurities and intrinsic defects in as-grown material. The second part, consisting of papers 5 - 7, is dealing with the defect content after electron irradiation and the annealing behavior of the introduced deep levels. In the first part, transition metal incorporation of iron (Fe) and tungsten (W) is discussed in papers 1 and 2, respectively. Fe and W are possible candidates to compensate the residual nitrogen doping in SiC. The doping with Fe resulted in one level in n-type material and two levels in p-type 4 H-SiC. The capture process is strongly coupled to the lattice. Secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements detected the presence of B and Fe. The defects are suggested to be related to Fe and/or Fe-B-pairs. Previous reports on <b>tungsten</b> <b>doping</b> showed that W gives rise to two levels (one shallow and one deep) in 4 H- and only one deep level in 6 H-SiC. In 3 C-SiC, we detected two levels, one likely related to W and one intrinsic defect, labeled E 1. The W related energy level aligns well with the deeper levels observed in 4 H- and 6 H-SiC in agreement with the LH rule. The LH rule is observed from experiments to be also valid for intrinsic levels. The level related to the DLTS peak EH 6 = 7 in 4 H-SiC aligns with the level related to E 7 in 6 H-SiC {{as well as with the}} level related to E 1 in 3 C-SiC. The alignment suggests that these levels may originate from the same defect, probably the VC, which has been proposed previously for 4 H- and 6 H-SiC. In paper 3, electrical characterization of 3 C-layers grown heteroepitaxially on different SiC substrates is discussed. The material was of high quality with a low background doping concentration and SCHOTTKY diodes were fabricated. It was observed that nickel as rectifying contact material exhibits a similar barrier height as the previously suggested gold. A leakage current in the low nA range at a reverse bias of - 2 V was achieved, which allowed capacitance transient measurements. One defect related to DLTS peak E 1, previously presented in paper 2, was detected and suggested to be related to an intrinsic defect. Paper 4 gives the evidence that chloride-based CVD grown material yields the same kind of defects as reported for standard CVD growth processes. However, for very high growth rates, exceeding 100 mm/h, an additional defect is observed as well as an increase of the Ti-concentration. Based on the knowledge from paper 2, the origin of the additional peak and the assumed increase of Ti-concentration can instead both be attributed to the deeper and the shallower level of tungsten in 4 H-SiC, respectively. In the second part of the thesis, studies of low-energy (200 keV) electron irradiated as-grown 4 H-SiC were performed. In paper 5, bistable defects, labeled EB-centers, evolved in the DLTS spectrum after the annihilation of the irradiation induced defect levels related to DLTS peaks EH 1, EH 3 and the bistable M-center. In a detailed annealing study presented in paper 6, the partial transformation of M-centers into the EB-centers is discussed. The transition between the two defects (M-centers → EB-centers) takes place at rather low temperatures (T ≈ 400 oC), which suggests a mobile defect as origin. The M-center and the EB-centers are suggested to be related to Ci and/or Ci complex defects. The EB-centers anneal out at about 700 oC. In paper 7, the DLTS peak EH 5, which is observed after low- and high-energy electron irradiation is presented. The peak is associated with a bistable defect, labeled F-center. Configuration A exists unoccupied and occupied by an electron, whereas configuration B is only stable when filled by an electron. Reconfiguration temperatures for both configurations were determined and the reconfiguration energies were calculated from the transition kinetics. The reconfiguration B→A can also be achieved by minority charge carrier injection. The F-center is likely a carbon related defect, since it is already present after low-energy irradiation...|$|E

Raman spectroscopy revealed the importance of combined Mo and W doping for achieving low friction at both ambient and high temperature.

The obtained results showthat addition of tungsten to the sol-gel preparation of TiO 2 delayed the conversion of anatase to rutile phase. Further increase in tungsten loading apparently stabilized the anatase phase from transformation into inactiverutile. It is also found that, <b>tungsten</b> <b>doped</b> TiO 2 exhibited a remarkable enhancement of the photocatalyticactivity compared with the unmodified TiO 2 for the photodegradation of the two selected organochlorinesherbicides...|$|R

A crystallization of titanium dioxide occurs during annealing of the films in air. Depending on the <b>tungsten</b> {{and nitrogen}} <b>doping</b> level, anatase or rutile phase formation is observed.

40|$|Metal oxides are {{generally}} very stable in aqueous solutions and cheap, but their photochemical activity is usually limited by poor charge carrier separation. Here {{we show that}} this problem can be solved by introducing a gradient dopant concentration in the metal oxide film, thereby creating a distributed n n homojunction. This concept is demonstrated with a low cost, spray deposited and non porous <b>tungsten</b> <b>doped</b> bismuth vanadate photoanode in which carrier separation efficiencies of up to 80 are achieved. By combining this {{state of the art}} photoanode with an earth abundant cobalt phosphate water oxidation catalyst and a double or single junction amorphous Si solar cell in a tandem configuration, stable shortcircuit water splitting photocurrents of 4 and 3 mAcm 2, respectively, are achieved under 1 sun illumination. The 4 mAcm 2 photocurrent corresponds to a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 4. 9, which is the highest efficiency yet reported for a stand alone water splitting device based on a metal oxide photoanod...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectrochromic ‘smart windows’, {{capable of}} {{dynamically}} adjusting light transmittance, glare and {{solar heat gain}} by an electric field have attracted more and more interests in both research laboratories and industry. Among various electrochromic materials, anodically coloring NiOx is of essential importance as the ion storage layer for building complementary electrochromic devices. In this paper, we have deposited <b>tungsten</b> <b>doped</b> NiOx thin films on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates by reactive magnetron sputtering in a mixed gas ambient of Ar and O 2. The atomic ratio of W/Ni were varied by changing the number of metal strips placed {{on top of the}} nickel oxide target. The electrochromic properties of Ni-W oxide thin films were tested & compared in a 3 electrode electro-chemical system with NaOH as liquid electrolyte. The experimental results showed that light transmittance modulation; coloration efficiency, as well as response times of the W-Ni oxide thin films can be greatly improved by controlling the ratio of W/Ni...|$|R

The limitations in the WS 2 application are related to its thermal stability in air (An et al. 2014). The present work is therefore aimed at studying tribological properties of nanolamellar <b>tungsten</b> disulfide <b>doped</b> with zinc oxide nanoparticles.|$|R
40|$|Growing ambitions for {{efficient}} resource utilization {{and improving}} environmental standards stimulate {{the abandonment of}} environmentally harmful lubricants. However, dry forming leads to direct contact between tool and workpiece surface which causes increasing friction and wear. This paper presents a methodology for realization of lubricant free deep drawing processes. Dry deep drawing of a rectangular cup is investigated by a numerical simulation. First numerical results reveal the necessity of modifying the tribological system in order to realize dry deep drawing. Basic tribological investigations reveal increasing friction and intensive wear under dry conditions. Therefore, tailored surfaces are developed to improve the tribological properties without lubrication. By laser structuring various micro features were fabricated on the tool surface. Furthermore, <b>tungsten</b> <b>doped</b> hydrogenated amorphous carbon coatings (a-C:H:W) were deposited on the tool using unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The tribological behavior of these surface modifications were researched by a ring-on-disc-tribometer. The wear mechanisms during the dry sliding process are discussed depending on the micro features and coatings. The obtained test results help building the basic concept for generating tailored surfaces and subsequently to realize lubricant free deep drawing...|$|R
40|$|The high {{temperature}} tribological applications of state-of-the-art diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coatings in automotive industry are often compromised {{due to their}} poor adhesion strength and low thermal stability. A molybdenum and <b>tungsten</b> <b>doped</b> carbon-based coating (Mo−W−C) is developed in order to overcome these limitations and to enhance tribological performance during boundary lubricated sliding at ambient and elevated temperature. The coating was deposited utilising HIPIMS technology. Mo−W−C coating showed lowest mean friction coefficient (µ= 0. 033) compared {{to a number of}} commercially available state-of-the-art DLC coatings when pin-on-disc experiments were carried out at ambient temperature. Similarly at 200 °C, a significant reduction in friction coefficient was observed for Mo−W−C coating with increase in sliding distance unlike DLC coating. Raman spectroscopy revealed importance of combined Mo and W doping and tribochemically reactive wear mechanism of Mo−W−C coating during sliding. The significant decrease in friction and wear rate was attributed to the presence of graphitic carbon particles (from coating) and 'in-situ' formed metal sulphides (WS 2 and MoS 2, where metals from coating and sulphur from oil) in transfer layer...|$|R

In this work we examine different experimental approaches for controlling Ce 3 + concentration in cerium oxide model catalyst systems such as: i) influencing the stoichiometry of ceria, ii) introducing high valence doping agent, and iii) growing ultra thin ceria films with a strong metal substrate interaction. Structure, morphology and chemical state of prepared reduced ceria based systems were examined by means of surface science techniques: scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In the present work an original method of ceria film reduction was introduced that allows stepwise control on stoichiometry and degree of film reduction (i).
