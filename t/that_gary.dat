5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they {{got to know each}} other. They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other, highlighting the idea <b>that</b> <b>Gary</b> and Val were always destined to end up together one way or another.|$|E
