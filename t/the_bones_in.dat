5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> {{the rear of the}} mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge {{on the surface of the}} angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E

5|$|In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were {{supported}} by {{the evolution of the}} avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> the skeleton, making them hollow. Early avian-style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build could sustain. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for animals that are active but too large {{to get rid of all}} the excess heat through their skin.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> Turku {{were still}} in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a {{transfer}} to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation of Finland in the Great Northern War. The man behind the idea was the infamous Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas who had defected to the Russian side {{during the war and}} {{was in charge of the}} grim occupation of Finland. What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming's reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece of parchment stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities.|$|E

25|$|Bones serve {{a variety}} of {{mechanical}} functions. Together <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> the body form the skeleton. They provide a frame to keep the body supported, and an attachment point for skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints, which function together to generate and transfer forces so that individual body parts or the whole body can be manipulated in three-dimensional space (the interaction between bone and muscle is studied in biomechanics).|$|E

25|$|A diet {{deficient}} in vitamin D {{in conjunction with}} inadequate sun exposure causes osteomalacia (or rickets when it occurs in children), which is a softening of <b>the</b> <b>bones.</b> <b>In</b> the developed world, this is a rare disease. However, vitamin D deficiency has become a worldwide problem in the elderly and remains common in children and adults. Low blood calcifediol (25-hydroxy-vitamin D) can result from avoiding the sun. Deficiency results in impaired bone mineralization and bone damage which leads to bone-softening diseases, including rickets and osteomalacia.|$|E
25|$|The {{skeleton}} {{had belonged}} to an individual who, based on evidence of osteoarthritis in the lumbar vertebrae, eburnation, and severe wear on the teeth with pulp exposure, was about 50 years old – relatively old for an early human – when he died. The bone structure had a gracile character, which contrasts with the morphology of modern indigenous Australians. Parts of the skeleton had deteriorated in situ: substantial portions of the skull were missing and most of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> the limbs have suffered surface damage.|$|E
25|$|Whereas the devotional {{importance}} of relics and the economics associated with pilgrimages caused {{the remains of}} most saints to be divided up and spread over numerous churches in several countries, Saint Nicholas is unusual in {{that most of his}} bones have been preserved in one spot: his grave crypt in Bari. Even with the allegedly continuing miracle of the manna, the archdiocese of Bari has allowed for one scientific survey of <b>the</b> <b>bones.</b> <b>In</b> the late 1950s, during a restoration of the chapel, it allowed a team of hand-picked scientists to photograph and measure the contents of the crypt grave.|$|E

25|$|Anticonvulsants affect <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> many ways. They cause hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, low Vitamin D levels, and {{increased}} parathyroid hormone. Anticonvulsants {{also contribute to}} the increased rate of fractures by causing somnolence, ataxia, and tremor which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people.Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants than for people taking non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants. In addition to all of the above, primidone can cause arthralgia.|$|E
25|$|Raw bones fed to dogs contain high {{amounts of}} calcium and {{phosphorus}} {{that is essential}} for neuromuscular, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine and clotting function. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus for adult dogs should be 1:1. Compared to commercial dog food, the raw food diet allows dogs to work for their meal, ripping the meat off bones and then gnawing at <b>the</b> <b>bones.</b> <b>In</b> regards to dental health, bone to tooth gnawing allows a dog to rid their teeth of plaque buildup promoting good oral health. Skeptics argue however that this isn't healthy for dogs and it can cause dental fractures.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains in}} the ossuary were placed with great care and were {{undamaged}} {{at the time of}} burial. In order to maximise the use of space, the remains were packed very tightly together; so tight that it was nearly impossible to identify individual skeletons unless articulated. Due to the tightly compacted nature of this ossuary, bones were broken or bent {{in the shape of the}} walls (particularly long bones). These fractures are not consistent with trampling and because the broken ends remained in close proximity, it was interpreted that great care was taken to minimize damage to <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> the filling and packing of the ossuary.|$|E
