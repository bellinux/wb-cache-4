25|$|Early in the 20th century polio {{would become}} the world's most feared disease. The disease hit without warning, tended to strike white, {{affluent}} individuals, required long quarantine periods during which parents were separated from children: it was impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> would get the disease and who would be spared. The consequences of the disease left polio victims marked for life, leaving behind vivid images of wheelchairs, crutches, leg braces, breathing devices, and deformed limbs. However, polio changed not only {{the lives of those}} who survived it, but also affected profound cultural changes: the emergence of grassroots fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical philanthropy, the rise of rehabilitation therapy and, through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled, polio survivors helped to spur the modern disability rights movement.|$|E

500|$|The final alleged {{stalking}} incident came {{to light}} on December 13, 2005. In the preceding days, Cho had contacted a female friend of Koch via AIM and wrote on her door board {{a line from the}} Act 2, Scene II of the Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet. In the passage, Romeo laments to Juliet" [...] a name, I know not how <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{their writing}} Wellek and Warren {{attempted}} {{to present a}} single voice despite the dominance of individuals. Their success in presenting such a voice has been debated. Wellek later recalled that people often {{told him it was}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> had written which chapter without consulting the book's introduction. However, the literary scholar C. J. van Rees of Tilburg University notes that Wellek's influences are prevalent in chapters authored by Warren. Aldo Scaglione, in a review of the second edition, wrote that [...] "one immediately senses the change of hand" [...] between chapters by different authors.|$|E
500|$|These fights {{were usually}} {{close-up}} and personal, {{with a number}} of shots blasted from pistols, often resulting in innocent bystanders hit by bullets gone wild. Much of the time, it would be difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> had [...] "won” the gunfight for several minutes, as the black powder smoke from the pistols cleared the air. How famous gunfighters died is as varied as each man. Many well-known gunfighters were so feared by the public because of their reputation that when they were killed, they {{died as a result of}} ambush rather than going down in a [...] "blaze of glory". Others died secluded deaths either from old age or illness.|$|E

2500|$|Losey {{became a}} major figure in New York {{political}} theatre, first directing the controversial failure Little Old Boy in 1933. He declined to direct a staged version of Dodsworth by Sinclair Lewis, which led Lewis to offer him his first work written for the stage, Jayhawker. Losey directed the show, which had a brief run. Bosley Crowther in The New York Times noted that [...] "The play, being increasingly wordy, presents staging problems that Joe Losey's direction does not always solve. It is hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> {{is responsible for the}} obscure parts in the story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Samuel Reid, a {{volunteer}} from Louisiana, described McCulloch and his ranger company as [...] "men in groups with long beards and mustaches, dressed in every variety of garment, with one exception, the slouched hat, the unmistakable uniform of a Texas ranger, and a brace of pistols around their waists, [...] were occupied drying their blankets, cleaning and fixing their guns, and some employed cooking at different fires, {{while others were}} grooming their horses. A rougher-looking set we never saw. They were without tents, and a miserable shed afforded them the only shelter. Captain McCulloch introduced us to his officers {{and many of his}} men, who appeared orderly and well-mannered people. But from their rough exterior, it was hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> or what they were. Notwithstanding their ferocious and outlaw look, there were among them doctors and lawyers and many a college graduate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} many ‘green on blue’ attacks {{might have}} been prevented if existing security measures had been applied correctly, but according to NATO officials numerous military guidelines were not followed — by Afghans or Americans — because of concerns that they might slow {{the growth of the}} Afghan army and police. Despite that the current process for vetting recruits is effective, a lack of follow-up has allowed Afghan troops who fell under the sway of the insurgency or grew disillusioned with the Afghan government to remain in the force. In other instances the vetting process for Afghan soldiers and police was never properly implemented. NATO officials knew it according to the Washington Post, but they looked the other way, worried that extensive background checks could hinder the recruitment process. Also ignored were requirements that Afghans display proper credentials while on base. Many Afghans, even those who were vetted, were never issued official badges, making it impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> was supposed to have access to any particular facility. Measures specifically designed to curtail attacks (American and NATO service members should for example always carry a loaded magazine in their weapons to save precious moments if attacked by Afghan forces) were also inconsistently applied. The [...] "Guardian Angel" [...] program (The programm calls for one or two soldiers to monitor the Afghans during every mission or meeting. These soldiers, [...] "angels" [...] called and whose identities are not disclosed to the Afghans, must be prepared to fire on anyone who tries to kill a coalition service member.) was often seen as a distraction from NATO’s mission. Calls to minimize off-duty time spent with Afghan troops were similarly thought by NATO officials to undermine the goal of relationship-building, but according to a directive from NATO leaders troops are now being advised to stay away from Afghan soldiers and police officers during vulnerable moments, such as when they are sleeping, bathing or exercising. Additional security measures include improved training for counterintelligence agents, a more intense vetting system for new recruits, establishing an anonymous reporting system for soldiers to report suspicious activity; increasing the presence of Afghan counterintelligence teams among Afghan troops; banning the sale of Afghan army and police uniforms to help stop infiltrators posing as soldiers and policemen; and revetting soldiers when they return home from leave.|$|E

2500|$|Qizhou {{was a major}} {{fortress}} city situated {{near the}} Yangtze and a 25 thousand strong Jin army advanced on it in 1221. News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand [...] "great leather bombs" [...] (皮大炮), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, {{they were unable to}} match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, [...] "The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb , whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [...] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their cheeks were exploded to bits, and only one half [...] was left." [...] Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: [...] "The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [...] at the eastern gate, as well as my own quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, {{to the point that they}} struck even on top of [...] sleeping quarters and [...] nearly perished! Some said there was a traitor. If not, how would they have known the way to strike at both of these places?" [...] Zhao was able to examine the new iron bombs himself and described thus, [...] "In shape they are like gourds, but with a small mouth. They are made with pig iron, about two inches thick, and they cause the city's walls to shake." [...] Houses were blown apart, towers battered, and defenders blasted from their placements. Within four weeks all four gates were under heavy bombardment. Finally the Jin made a frontal assault on the walls and scaled them, after which followed a merciless hunt for soldiers, officers, and officials of every level. Zhao managed an escape by clambering over the battlement and making a hasty retreat across the river, but his family remained in the city. Upon returning at a later date to search the ruins, he found that the [...] "bones and skeletons were so mixed up that there was no way <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> was who." ...|$|E
