5|$|After {{learning}} of the plans of the Governor-General of the Philippines to deport Don Felipe, he sailed to Yokohama, Japan, staying <b>there</b> <b>only</b> briefly until proceeding to Hong Kong where he joined other Filipino exiles who found asylum when the revolution broke out in 1896. Twenty-two months after the departure of Don Felipe for Hong Kong, Agoncillo {{and the rest of}} the family (her last two daughters were not yet born) followed him into exile. They rented a house at 535 Morrison Hill in the Wan Chai district. While in Hong Kong, Agoncillo gave birth to their last child on March 22, 1906.|$|E
5|$|Before Indiana {{became a}} state, the Indiana Territory had two governors. William Henry Harrison, the first governor, built a plantation-style home in Vincennes, and named it Grouseland for its many birds. Built in 1804, {{it was one}} of the first brick {{buildings}} in the territory. The home is still preserved and is a National Historic Landmark. Thomas Posey, the territory's second governor, had a home built in Corydon, but lived <b>there</b> <b>only</b> briefly before moving to Jeffersonville where he rented a room in a boarding house. The Posey House is preserved as part of a National Historic District.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} law, Jinnah briefly {{embarked}} on a stage career with a Shakespearean company, but resigned after receiving a stern letter from his father. In 1895, at age 19, he became the youngest Indian to be called to the bar in England. Although he returned to Karachi, he remained <b>there</b> <b>only</b> a short time before moving to Bombay.|$|E

5|$|Early on, it {{was learned}} that {{diseases}} were species specific, {{so there was}} no danger of a disease or virus spreading to other races and potentially causing a pandemic.

5|$|In November 1907 {{six more}} {{families}} consisting of 27 individuals from Mingulay squatted on Sandray, {{which has a}} sheltered beach. Meanwhile, {{the plight of the}} Vatersay raiders had been raised at Westminster. Despite considerable public sympathy they were eventually sentenced to two months in prison. Shortly thereafter the Congested Districts Board purchased the entire island of Vatersay with the aim of providing new crofts. By the next summer there were 14 Mingulay families living <b>there.</b> <b>Only</b> six families remained on Mingulay itself, and all of them planned to leave.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series of trials in July and August 1612 accounts for more than two per cent of that total. Court records show that Lancashire was unusual in the north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring Cheshire, for instance, also suffered from economic problems and religious activists, but <b>there</b> <b>only</b> 47 people were indicted for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.|$|E

5|$|Keith Floyd (1943–2009) was an English broadcaster, restaurateur {{and food}} writer. He {{was brought up}} in Somerset, England, where his mother taught him to cook. He was educated at Wellington, a local public school, {{although}} he left at the age of sixteen. He joined the Bristol Evening Post as a cub reporter—where he worked alongside the future playwright Tom Stoppard. He was commissioned into the Royal Tank Regiment in 1963 as a second lieutenant, but his career <b>there</b> <b>only</b> lasted until 1966; he left military service and moved to London and then France, where he worked in several restaurants in various roles.|$|E

5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} {{right to keep}} and bear arms. The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before the enactment of the Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but <b>there</b> <b>only</b> applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the hoarded Flying Eagle cents re-entered circulation. Many {{remained}} <b>there</b> <b>only</b> a few years, {{being pulled}} out from among the new bronze cents in Treasury Department redemption programs in the 1860s and 1870s—thirteen million copper-nickel cents were retired by exchange for other base-metal coinage. By the 1880s, it was a rarity in circulation. The 2018 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1857, 1858 large letters, and 1858 small letters each at $30 in G-4 Good condition, the next to lowest collectable grade (AG-3). The 1856 is $6,500 in that grade, rising to $20,000 in uncirculated MS-63. The 1858/7 starts at $75 in G-4, rising to $11,000 in MS-63. An 1856 cent in MS-66 condition sold at auction in January 2004 for $172,500.|$|E

He was accepted into the air cadet basic training program at Randolph Air Force Base in Universal City, Texas. Upon completion of the program, he was assigned to Williams Air Force Base in Mesa, Arizona. In March 1951 Grissom received his pilot wings and commission as a second lieutenant. Betty remained in Indiana, and while he was away his first child, Scott, was born. After his birth they joined Grissom in Arizona. The family remained <b>there</b> <b>only</b> briefly and in December 1951 they moved to Presque Isle, Maine, where Grissom was assigned to Presque Isle Air Force Base and {{became a member of the}} 75th Fighter Interceptor Squadron.|$|E

He discovers through Veerabahu that both Marthandan and Ratna, the {{previous}} king's daughter {{and the original}} heir to Ratnapuri's throne, have been kidnapped and held in custody on an island named Kanni Theevu. Veerangan sails to the island and comes across Ratna, {{who falls in love}} with him; he reciprocates her feelings. Pingalan and Karmegam arrive <b>there</b> <b>only</b> to find that the island's chieftain is none other than Vijayavarman, who has kidnapped Ratna after she was born. Vijayavarman plans to marry Ratna himself, get rid of Pingalan, and declare himself the ruler of Ratnapuri. Pingalan decides to take Ratna back and make himself king legally by marrying her. Ratna does not approve of it. Pingalan takes her away by force. Veerangan saves her from Pingalan's clutches. The duo then free Marthandan and Karmegam, who had been captured by Vijayavarman and is now reformed. Both Marthandan and Veerangan defeat Vijayavarman. Veerangan marries Ratna, and Marthandan issues a proclamation stating that Ratnapuri is a democracy.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside <b>there</b> <b>only</b> at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
