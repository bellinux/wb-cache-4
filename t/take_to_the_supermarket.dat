5000|$|One day, Mare <b>takes</b> Mark <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket</b> where <b>the</b> {{kidnapping}} took place, but faints. In the hospital, Mark {{finds out}} that Mare is pregnant and is surprised {{that she does not}} want him to tell Dan. Dan continues to seek evidence that will prove whether or not Mark is actually Luke, despite Mare's confession that she does not want to know whether Mark's story proves to be either true or false. At the police station, Dan {{finds out that}} the city in Idaho where Mark claims to have grown up - [...] "Emerald City" [...] - does not exist. Upset with Mark, Dan reluctantly saves his life when he almost falls off the roof. Mark then claims that Emerald City was a lie told to cover up his much worse past, and assures Dan of his credibility by showing him a birth mole that Luke also had. Shortly after, Mare rejects the latest of several marriage proposals from Dan, who has just found out through Mark about her pregnancy.|$|R
30|$|The {{specificity}} of our findings is limited somewhat by our need to group variables. For example, {{there may be}} differences in maternal age within our 10 -year brackets; and Pacific cultures are a heterogeneous group (although being a key policy target). Similarly, {{some of the differences}} in proxy quality indicators are likely to be an inevitable function of care type. For example, children cared for by a nanny, relative or home-based carer were more likely to experience trips or outings at least once a week, and their parents were more likely to receive daily feedback about their child. We may however be comparing ‘apples with oranges’: a centre may not receive a positive indicator here, yet might have comprehensive discussions once a week with parents and take children once a month <b>to</b> <b>the</b> zoo. Similarly, a nanny might receive a positive indicator on these variables because they have more opportunity for even brief 1 : 1 daily feedback, and might <b>take</b> <b>the</b> child <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket</b> with them once a week. What represents ‘quality care’ may differ across care types, but this information may be valuable nevertheless for child carers and policy-makers. Further work with the New Zealand Ministry of Education may allow for linkage to standardised service assessments to provide additional analyses of the quality of care.|$|R
40|$|How {{many times}} have we all jotted down a list <b>to</b> <b>take</b> with us <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket?</b> Even a simple {{vertical}} column of ordinary household items requires more than we realize. We scan areas {{of the house and}} pull from memory different food stuffs or supplies that need to be replenished or replaced: refrigerator (need milk, butter, juice); cabinets (we’re out of sandwich bags and sponges); canisters (need coffee and tea); laundry room (need detergent and bleach); dinner (… [...] good question). All this information requires a flow of memory, organization, and planning. Most of us do this part of the task spontaneously and routinely. Now we need to create that list on paper. As automatic as it seems, writing simple words like “coffee,” “sandwich, ” and “juice, ” requires a call-up of a sequence of letters and shapes for each word—spelling [...] and an ability <b>to</b> manipulate <b>the</b> pen or pencil in order <b>to</b> encode <b>the</b> letters. During the physical act of jotting down a list, we control several muscle groups <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> writing tool flowing in a direction— moving vertically, horizontally, and in a circular fashion (rotary movement). Fine motor coordination is key as we stimulate certain muscle groups, inhibit others, and balance, flex, and contract movements. We don’t punctuate the list, write it in a creative way, grab the attention of a reader, or develop a theme and add flourish and detail to our assertions. A list is just a list...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things we can do as parents is to help our children develop positive feelings about themselves. Children with good selfconcepts are more likely to grow into happy and productive members of society. Parents have a lot to do with how children see and feel about themselves. Providing a warm, loving relationship filled with support, encouragement, and interest in the child helps children feel good about themselves. Children who grow up with constant criticism, scoldings, or discouraging remarks are not likely to see themselves as worthy and good people. There are many things that parents can do to help children develop good self-concepts. Here are a few suggestions: Communicate respect and confidence in your children. Give them opportunities to make choices when possible. Provide opportunities to make a contribution. Assign them household chores they can handle, such as making their bed, helping to sort laundry, or setting the table. Be sure your children know you love them—even when their behavior is not acceptable. Children need to know they are loved and valued for who they are, not for what they do. Accept their feelings while helping them learn appropriate ways to express and handle negative ones. Teach your child, for example, that it’s OK to be angry and to use words to talk about what is bothering him or her, but it’s not OK to hurt others. Praise your child … thoughtfully. Be genuine and specific with praise. Children recognize empty compliments or insincere praise. Think about what you are teaching your child through the things you praise. For example, praising your child when he or she makes a good choice teaches responsibility and that he or she is capable of making good decisions. You teach your child to value effort if you praise hard work as well as praising your child’s achievements. Sometimes, responding to your child’s efforts with appreciation is as powerful as praise. Give your child opportunities to explore and learn. <b>Take</b> trips together <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket,</b> <b>the</b> library, and places in the community. Mastering new situations helps children develop confidence. Trips together also show children that you value spending time with them. To learn more about empowering your child to become confident and self-disciplined, check out thi...|$|R
