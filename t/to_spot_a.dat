He is said to arrive at midnight on the year's first new moon to lower a ghostly drawbridge spanning a vanished moat. In 1966 and 1967 a hundred people turned out to watch and allegedly managed <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>a</b> cowled figure, but in 1968 the few spectators who turned up saw nothing.|$|E

Captain Vladimir Ivlev fired an AA-2 Atoll at the Mirage, which exploded in the exhaust from the Atar engine, shredding the nozzle and tail of Snir's aircraft. Snir disengaged and managed to nurse his damaged aircraft to a safe landing in Rephidim. Ivlev, short on fuel, let off an unsuccessful cannon burst at one of the Phantoms before heading back to al-Qutamiya.|$|E

25|$|Modern F1 {{cars and}} other {{high-end}} formula racing cars have information displays on their steering wheels which can flash up the word flag to warn drivers when they are entering a sector with a local yellow. Most new circuits and older ones used for F1 employ trackside flashing lights at regular intervals, as a clearer way to signal yellow, green, red, blue or SC flag status to drivers than relying on them <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>a</b> marshal waving a flag, especially so on modern circuits where there are large run-off areas which put the marshals {{well away from the}} actual track.|$|E
25|$|Multiple choice {{questions}} {{are given in}} the first section of the written paper; students will first answer multiple-choice questions on grammar, where students are required <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>a</b> mistake in tense and provide the correct conjugate or word form, or provide correct punctuation which as of 2015 has a weight of 10. It also tests vocabulary the students are required to choose a word from a list that fills in a blank that will express a sentence logically, with a current weight of 5. A vocabulary cloze is then given, also with a weightage of 5. The next section is the Visual Text Comprehension, where candidates are required to study a visual stimulus(advertisement,flyer, etc.). A writeup will be given for the candidate to evaluate. Using these, the candidates have to answer question related to both of them, each weighting 1 mark for 8 questions.|$|E
25|$|Hinsley {{wrote that}} it was {{difficult}} to measure the influence of intelligence gained during the battle, because although Ultra revealed German situation reports, reinforcement details and unit identifications and that more intelligence was gleaned from prisoners and captured documents, it was not known how swiftly the information reached Freyberg or how he used it. The German parachute warfare manual had been captured in 1940 and after the war, Student said that he would have changed tactics, had he known. Field signals intelligence was obtained, including bombing instructions and information from the Fliegerkorps XI tactical code. Lack of air cover prevented much British air reconnaissance north of Crete but on 21 May, signals intelligence enabled an aircraft <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>a</b> convoy. After midnight, twelve ships were sunk by the navy and the rest scattered, which led to a second invasion convoy being called back. The second convoy was intercepted during the morning of 22 May, despite the cost to the navy of a daylight operation and no more seaborne attempts were made.|$|E

500|$|Elliot Huntley {{has complained}} of the song's {{enforced}} period in hibernation: [...] " [...] simply beggars {{belief that the}} track was rejected by Martin, Lennon and McCartney – three men whose reputations rested on their ability <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>a</b> good tune when they heard one." [...] Huntley views [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] as worthy of [...] "fully fledged standard" [...] status, with Barham's [...] "soaring" [...] strings and Harrison's [...] "sublime" [...] slide guitar combining to take the song [...] "into the heavens, where it stays". Mojo contributor John Harris highlights the song in his review {{of one of the}} few [...] "truly essential" [...] solo albums by a former Beatle, writing: [...] "The faster songs [...] (eg Wah Wah) are delightful; the slowies (Isn't It A Pity, Beware Of Darkness) simply jaw-dropping." ...|$|E
500|$|Prey can {{be spotted}} from a distance; European bee-eaters are able <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>a</b> bee [...] away, and blue-cheeked bee-eaters have been {{observed}} flying out [...] to catch large wasps. Prey is approached directly or from behind. Prey that lands {{on the ground or}} on plants is usually not pursued. Small prey may be eaten on the wing, but larger items are returned to the perch where they are beaten until dead and then broken up. Insects with poisonous stings are first smacked on the branch, then, with the bird's eyes closed, rubbed to discharge the venom sac and stinger. This behaviour is innate, as demonstrated by a juvenile bird in captivity, which performed the task when first presented with wild bees. This bird was stung on the first five tries, but by ten bees, it was as adept at handling bees as adult birds.|$|E
500|$|Stories {{including}} Zhou {{have also}} been used to educate. The Secondary School system of Hong Kong teaches children the value of mentorship by making them read about the close teacher-pupil relationship between Zhou and Yue. A morale tale called [...] "Yue Fei Studies Archery" [...] in Children's Pictorial, a Chinese magazine tailored for children ages two through seven, demonstrates how great achievements are only made possible via diligent practice. The story states how young Yue stumbles upon Zhou's training hall in a neighboring town while gathering fire wood. Yue applies to become a student, but Zhou tells him he must first practice {{the art of the}} [...] "far-sighted person" [...] by staring into the morning sun to improve his eyesight. After years of unrelenting practice, Yue is able <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>a</b> lone goose flying off in the distance and two cicadas on a tree far into the forest. Zhou then officially takes him as his disciple and adopted son. Under his tutelage, Yue is able to master the eighteen weapons of war and to shoot a falling leaf from one-hundred paces away.|$|E

500|$|Once a {{duty of care}} (or duty to act, as required) {{has been}} shown, the jury should then be asked, {{following}} Lord Mackay in R v Adamoko: [...] "having regard {{to the risk of}} death involved, [...] the conduct of the defendant... so bad in all the circumstances as to amount to a criminal act or omission". This has two elements: firstly, the breach of the duty of care must relate to the risk of death (confirmed in R v Singh), and not to any lesser harm. In other words, the breach of the duty of care must cause the victim's death. Secondly the breach of the duty of care must be so egregious as to amount to a crime. For example, on the fact of Adomako itself, the defendant, an anaesthetist, failed <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>a</b> problem with the victim's breathing tube for 11 minutes, something expert evidence suggested a competent anaesthetist would spot within thirty seconds or so. The defendant was convicted. This definition has been opposed as being circular, as defining the crime of manslaughter as gross negligence as being negligence to a criminal degree. The jury may, under this characterisation, be ruling upon a point of law and not a point of fact.|$|E
500|$|Two CH-53E Super Stallions {{carrying}} a 60-man security detail—51 Marines and nine Navy SEALs—departed Guam at 02:47, [...] from the embassy, and {{were expected to}} arrive at 06:20. They performed two aerial refuelings. During the first refueling, a pipe burst {{on one of the}} helicopters, dousing soldiers in fuel and nearly forcing a return to the Guam; problems with the helicopters' navigation system also complicated the refueling rendezvous. The helicopters arrived in Mogadishu at dawn, crossing the coast just south of the harbor at [...] in altitude on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city. On their arrival in Mogadishu, the crew of the helicopters were using an outdated 1969 map, which showed the embassy in an isolated area. Furthermore, they had been told the embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course. The embassy was, in fact, surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings in the city. The helicopters were flying too low <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>a</b> strobe light which was placed on the embassy's water tower (the highest point within the embassy compound) and the golf course in the embassy compound had a black, oil-coated surface—not the familiar green grass that the helicopter crew would recognize.After breaking radio silence (their only direct communication with the embassy was unencrypted) to contact the embassy, they were able to discern it and land at 07:10. As they arrived, a group of about 100 to 150 Somalis were attempting to enter the embassy compound via ladders on the wall, but scattered as the helicopters arrived.|$|E

[...] Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer added, [...] "He [...] is a modern-day fast bowler based on the likes of [...] Pollock and [...] McGrath.

25|$|Born in Colchester, Essex, Napier is a fast-medium bowler, whose stock {{delivery}} reaches between 85mph-90mph. Napier has {{displayed a}} slower ball in Twenty20 games which has proved hard <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b> <b>As</b> a batsman, Napier can {{be among the}} most deadly not only in domestic cricket but in world cricket also. He has twice hit 16 sixes in an innings, once in a Twenty20 match, and once in a County Championship match. His fielding has been known to be slightly below par, but it can be put down to the fact that Napier is very injury prone and he cannot afford to throw himself around.|$|R
