5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. <b>The</b> <b>patches</b> frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} appears paradoxical and counter-intuitive as {{a method}} of camouflage, since disrupting outlines depends on using patches of colour which contrast strongly with each other, so <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> are themselves conspicuous. While background matching works best for a single background, disruptive coloration is a more effective strategy when an animal or a military vehicle may have a variety of backgrounds.|$|E

5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E

40|$|This {{laboratory}} study describes the sediment patterns formed in a sand bed around circular patches of rigid vertical cylinders, representing {{a patch of}} reedy emergent vegetation. <b>The</b> <b>patch</b> diameter was {{much smaller than the}} channel width. Two patch densities (solid volume fraction 3 % and 10 %) and two patch diameters (22 and 10 cm) were considered. For flows above the threshold of sediment motion, patterns of sediment erosion and deposition were observed around and within <b>the</b> <b>patch.</b> Scouring within <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> was positively correlated with turbulent kinetic energy in <b>the</b> <b>patch.</b> For sparse patches, sediment scoured from within <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> was mostly deposited within one patch diameter downstream of <b>the</b> <b>patch.</b> For dense patches, which experience greater flow diversion, sediment scoured from <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> was carried farther downstream before deposition along <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> centerline. Differences between the sparse and dense patch patterns of deposition are explained in the context of flow diversion and wake structure, which are related to a nondimensional flow blockage parameter. While sediment was redistributed near <b>the</b> <b>patch,</b> observations suggest that net deposition was not recorded at the reach scale. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|Although {{many studies}} of {{vigilance}} examine head raising in foraging, grooming or resting animals, pauses during intermittent locomotion are rarely considered {{from the perspective}} of vigilance, and no studies have compared head raising and pausing in the same system. We videotaped central place foraging chipmunks, Tamias striatus, as they approached a patch, collected sunflower seeds, and left to return to their burrows. There was a strong similarity between head raising during foraging and pausing during intermittent locomotion. Chipmunks paused more frequently when moving towards <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> than when leaving <b>the</b> <b>patch.</b> Chipmunks in <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> raised their heads at an intermediate rate, which tended to decrease with time in <b>the</b> <b>patch.</b> Pauses and <b>the</b> duration of motionless periods during head raises were very short (w 0. 4 s), and their frequency distributions were similar. Animals remained motionless during 22 % of the time spent approaching <b>the</b> <b>patch,</b> 14 % of the time spent in <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> and 7 % of the time spent leaving <b>the</b> <b>patch.</b> Rates of pausing and head raising generally decreased with short-term familiarity (number of trips to <b>the</b> <b>patch)</b> and with long-term familiarity (proximity of <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> to <b>the</b> burrow). Trials with higher pause rates when approaching <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> had higher head-raising rates in <b>the</b> <b>patch.</b> Whether <b>the</b> focal individual was solitary, dominant or subordinate in a dyad, or competing with multiple chipmunks in <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> had no effect on pausing or head raising. In a separate experiment, exposure to a model hawk increased pause and head-raising rates. We conclude that head raising during foraging and pausing during locomotion serve a similar vigilance function, that this vigilance is directed towards detection of predators rather than conspecifics, and that time allocated to vigilance is sufficient to significantly reduce foraging rates and affect many space use and foraging decisions...|$|R
