25|$|Polish Americans {{took to the}} Catholic {{schools in}} great numbers. In Chicago, 36,000 {{students}} (60 percent of the Polish population) attended Polish parochial schools in 1920. Nearly every Polish parish in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church had a school, whereas in Italian parishes, it was typically one in ten parishes. Even as late as 1960, about 60% of the Polish American students attended Catholic schools.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> parochial school {{system can be}} divided into three phases. During the first (1750–1870), parochial schools appeared as ad hoc efforts by parishes, and most Catholic children attended public schools. During the second period (1870–1910), the Catholic hierarchy made a basic commitment to a separate Catholic school system. These parochial schools, like the big-city parishes around them, tended to be ethnically homogeneous; a German child would not be sent to an Irish school, nor vice versa, nor a Lithuanian pupil to either. Instruction {{in the language of the}} old country was common. In the third period (1910–1945), Catholic education was modernized and modeled after the public school systems, and ethnicity was deemphasized in many areas. In cities with large Catholic populations (such as Chicago and Boston) there was a flow of teachers, administrators, and students from one system to the other.|$|E
500|$|After its {{original}} broadcast, however, {{a scene in}} the episode involving a fictitious, sexually suggestive Super Bowl commercial for the Catholic Church became a subject of controversy. [...] The scene garnered scrutiny from <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> anti-defamation and civil rights organization The Catholic League, whose members sent hundreds of angry letters to the Fox network, demanding any mention of Catholicism in the episode be excised. In September the same year, when the episode was supposed to repeat, the Catholic League asked Fox if they could censor the scene, which the network agreed to. The network's decision was criticized by journalists and staff members. The censored version of the episode is still in syndication.|$|E

500|$|With {{most of the}} {{refugees}} being Catholic, the voluntary agencies most prominent in helping the US and French governments with humanitarian relief efforts were Catholic. The National Catholic Welfare Conference and Catholic Relief Services contributed over US$35 million ($ as of [...] ) and sent hundreds of aid workers to South Vietnam. US clerics such as Joseph Harnett {{spent more than a}} year supervising the establishment of humanitarian and religious projects in Saigon. These included the establishment and maintenance of orphanages, hospitals, schools and churches. Harnett's volunteers fed rice and warm milk to 100,000refugees on a daily basis. Tens of thousands of blankets donated by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> organisations served as beds, makeshift roofs against monsoonal downpours and as temporary walls in mass housing facilities. The United Nations Children's Fund contributed technical assistance and helped to distribute merchandise, foodstuffs and various other gifts.|$|E
500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> press, the {{migration}} was given front page coverage in diocesan newspapers. The accounts were often sensationalist, demonizing the communist Viet Minh as religious persecutors who committed barbaric atrocities against Catholics. Our Sunday Visitor called the [...] "persecution" [...] in Vietnam [...] "the worst in history", {{alleging that the}} Viet Minh engaged in [...] "child murder and cannibalism". San Francisco's Monitor told of a priest whom the Viet Minh [...] "beat with guns until insensible and then buried alive in a ditch". Newark, Ohio's The Advocate posted an editorial cartoon titled [...] "Let Our People Go!", depicting mobs of Vietnamese refugees attempting to break through a blood-laced fence of barbed wire. Milwaukee's Catholic Herald Citizen described two priests who had been chained together and [...] "suffered atrocious and endless agony". Other papers depicted the Viet Minh blowing up churches, torturing children and gunning down elderly Catholics. One paper proclaimed that [...] "the people of Vietnam became a crucified people and their homeland a national Golgotha". The Catholic media also ran stories about Buddhist refugees who converted, hailing it as proof of their religion's superiority.|$|E

[...] Samuel Lake is remembered for his ambitious bid to complete Milford Docks for £80,000 in a mere seven months in 1880, and his subsequent bankruptcy in 1883 which delayed actual completion {{for a number of}} years. [...] An ecclesiastic figure to gain prominence from the town was Frederick Ebenezer Lloyd, an independent Catholic bishop who contributed to the early development of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church.

500|$|Minaj {{released}} her second studio album [...] in April 2012. The album {{was preceded by}} the promotional singles [...] "Roman in Moscow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Hoe".

[...] Minaj and rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform their single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", on the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012. She was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, premiering [...] "Roman Holiday" [...] during the 2012 ceremony on February 12. Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> League criticizing Minaj for bringing a fake [...] "Pope" [...] to escort her on the red carpet. The [...] "exorcism" [...] scene that was performed during her appearance was criticized as well. According to the Catholic League president Bill Donohue [...] "Perhaps the most vulgar part was the sexual statement that showed a scantily clad female dancer stretching backwards while an altar boy knelt between her legs in prayer. Finally, 'Come All Ye Faithful' was sung while a man posing as a bishop walked on stage; Minaj was shown levitating." ...|$|E
