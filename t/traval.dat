25|$|Two years pass. Moagim {{makes no}} attempt to attack Llancarfan, but {{continues}} to conquer lands outside the city. When news arrives that the Twelve Duns, home of the Myrmidon, has fallen, Ravanna, who {{is in love with}} Damas, heads there, saving thousands of refugees, and forging an alliance between the Duns and the city. Meanwhile, Connacht receives word from the Smiths that a device he commissioned from them is ready; the SunHammer. However, when he reaches the forge, he finds it under attack by the Spider Cult, a group who worship Skyrosh, a giant spider from another dimension. Finding the Cult has stolen the Tain and the SunHammer, Connacht readies his forces to attack, but before he can do so, the Smiths infiltrate the cultists' temple. They wipe out the Cult, retrieve the artifacts and imprison Skyrosh within the Tain. When Connacht attacks, he finds a note from <b>Traval</b> explaining Skyrosh came into the world by way of an accident during the construction of the Tain, so the Smiths felt honor-bound to defeat her, following her inside the Tain to kill her.|$|E
25|$|The army is decimated, {{leaving a}} {{demoralized}} Connacht planning {{to return to}} Gower. However, he is prevented by Damas and Myrdred, who suggests they find Mazzarin. Legend claims Bahl'al killed Mazzarin centuries ago, but Myrdred believes him to be still living. The trio {{set out to find}} him, accompanied by Ravanna, a Myrmidon warrior. Entering his crypt, Mazzarin is initially uninterested in helping them. However, impressed by Connacht, he transfers his knowledge of the Total Codex, a book that tells of future events, into Connacht's mind. In Llancarfan, Connacht speaks to the dwarven Smiths of Muirthemne about creating a magical device that could imprison infinite enemies. Forgemaster <b>Traval</b> says they can make it, but they need their tome of building from Myrgard, which is currently under siege by Ghôls. Connacht leads an army to lift the siege, annihilating the Ghôls. The Dwarves form an alliance with humanity, and give Connacht the tome. In Llancarfan, the Smiths build Connacht a Tain; a small magical device containing a pocket universe of limitless capacity, capable of sweeping an infinite number of enemies inside it. With the Tain in hand, Connacht and a small contingent of men head to the Dire Marsh, and wipe out the Myrkirida.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2014, Sarandos {{said the}} series was {{beginning}} to look [...] "at casting Jessica." [...] By November, Krysten Ritter, Alexandra Daddario, Teresa Palmer, Jessica De Gouw, and Marin Ireland were being tested {{for the role of}} Jessica Jones, with Ritter having been auditioning since October. Additionally, Lance Gross, Mike Colter, and Cleo Anthony were in contention for the role of Luke Cage, which was envisioned as a recurring role in the series before headlining Luke Cage. The next month, Ritter was cast as Jessica Jones. Ritter and Palmer had been the final candidates for the role, with both auditioning opposite Colter to test chemistry. Colter was confirmed as Luke Cage later in December. In January 2015, David Tennant was cast as Kilgrave, and Rachael Taylor was cast as Patricia [...] "Trish" [...] Walker. The latter character was added to the series as a replacement for Danvers, as she was set to feature in her own film. A month later, Carrie-Ann Moss joined the cast, with her role revealed that October to be a female version of male comic book character Jeryn Hogarth.

In 1976, Jackman turned professional at the age of 34. That year, an unofficial world championship event known as the Women's World Squash Championship was inaugurated. It was held in Brisbane, and Jackman was seeded No. 3 behind McKay and Sue Newman. She defeated Newman in the semi-finals, before losing to McKay in the final.|$|R
50|$|In France, the Czech airmen, {{including}} Kuttelwascher, {{were initially}} {{enlisted in the}} French Foreign Legion. When World War II broke out and France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, the French started to use the Czech pilots. On 17 May 1940, Kuttelwascher {{was assigned to the}} French GC III/3 fighter squadron, flying a Morane-Saulnier MS.406, then a Dewoitine D.520 fighter. It is unclear whether he achieved any victories in France or how many; incomplete French documents do not confirm any victories, but Kuttelwascher claimed he destroyed or damaged several enemy aircraft.

40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{dissertation}} research involves combinatorial optimization. This {{is a key}} area in operations research and computer science. It includes lots of problems that have {{a wide variety of}} real-world applications. In addition, most of these problems are inherently difficult to solve. My specific disseration topic is the minimum labeling spanning tree (MLST) problem and some variants, including the label-constrained minimum spanning tree (LC-MST) problem and the colorful <b>travaling</b> salesman problem (CTSP). All of the three problems are NP-hard. The MLST problem tries to find a spanning tree of a graph with the smallest number of labels. The LC-MST problem tries to find the minimum-cost spanning tree of a graph with no more than K labels. The CTSP tries to find a hamiltonian cycle of a graph with the smallest number of labels. For each of the problems, we use both heuristic and genetic algorithms to solve them. From the computational results, the genetic algorithm can always obtain a better tradeoff between the solution quality and the running time. My disseration research shows that the genetic algorithm can be successfully applied to solve many NP-hard problems...|$|R

5000|$|The club were {{affiliated}} to the Surrey {{county and}} won the inaugural Surrey Cup, first played for in 1891. However, they do not appear at this stage to have been considered a prominent London side having not been mentioned in Francis Marshalls 1892 publication, Football; the Rugby union game. However, in 1893 they gained more renown through the actions of H.E. Steed. On 20 September 1893, J. A. Miller of the Yorkshire county proposed {{at a meeting of}} the Rugby Football Union that players be allowed compensation for bona fide loss of time. This was seconded by his fellow Yorkshireman M. Newsome. The honorary secretary of the RFU, George Rowland Hill, opposed this and he was supported by R Whalley of Lancashire. A vote was cast and won by 282 to 136 votes in favour of declining to sanction the proposal for compensation for bona fide loss of time. Present at the meeting were an enormous amount of representatives from the north of England who had <b>travalled</b> to support the vote for compensation, having used two special trains for the purpose.

25|$|In 2006 {{both girls}} decided to {{concentrate}} on beach volleyball full-time, working on improving their skills {{more and more and}} also getting more experience. The first tournament of the season was an Eredivisie event in Kijkduin where they finished 2nd. On international level they started participating in higher quality tournaments like the European Championship Tour. In Hamburg they reached the 13th position. In the same weekend they <b>travalled</b> to Assen in their home country and in addition they won the TopTeams Cup Assen. In another 6 Eredivisie tournaments they reached one 1st place, four 2nd positions and a 3rd position, before heading to Marseille to play in a FIVB World Tour event. They reached the 41st position on the highest possible level. At the European Championship Tour event in Valencia they finished in 21st position. August 2006 {{turned out to be a}} good month for Van Iersel/Wesselink. First they travelled to South Korea to participate in an exhibition tournament where they finished 5th. A 4th position was reached a few days later in Austria during the European Championships under 23, while they had the ages of 18 and 19. The following weekend they took part in the Dutch national Championships in Scheveningen finishing 4th again, behind the three top Dutch teams for many years. With these results in mind they travelled to Poland to play the World Championships under 21 in Mysłowice. Again they faced opponents quite older than they were themselves, but this didn't seem to bother them much and they won the bronze medal. In the semi finals they lost from the eventual champions, while they had beaten the same team in the group stage earlier in the tournament. In addition they stayed in Poland to play the Warsaw FIVB World Tour event, finishing 33rd.|$|R
