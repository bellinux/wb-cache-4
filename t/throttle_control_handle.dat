50|$|Usually, the <b>throttle</b> valve is <b>controlled</b> with a <b>throttle</b> pedal or lever via {{a direct}} {{mechanical}} linkage. In vehicles with electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>control,</b> the manual <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> sends {{a signal to}} the Engine Control Unit (ECU), which then directly controls the position of the throttle valve. This means that the operator does not have direct <b>control</b> over the <b>throttle</b> valve; the ECU can finely control the valve in order to reduce emissions or maximize performance.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The stabifity of an {{aircraft}} with automatic <b>throttle</b> and elevator <b>controls</b> {{has been investigated}} theoretically using an analogue computer. Throttle application proportional to change in airspeed,, incidence, or rate of pitch may provide damping of the long-period motion, but speed is shown {{to be the most}} suitable variable. The control of {{an aircraft}} having negative static margin is considered and shown to require either the addition of an integral <b>control</b> on the <b>throttle</b> or a combination of <b>throttle</b> and elevator <b>controls.</b> Where it is required to control height by means of the elevator, some aircraft flying under certain conditions can only be adequately stabilised by means of an automatic <b>throttle</b> <b>control.</b> 1. Introduction. The longitudinal stability of various aircraft with automatic <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> has been investigated theoretically. Several types of <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> have been studied. The main effects of elevator controls are known 1, but are summarised in this report. When a height lock is added to an elevator control an unstable mode is often introduced. This instabilit...|$|R

50|$|Helicopter rotors are {{designed}} to operate at a specific rotational speed. The <b>throttle</b> <b>controls</b> {{the power of the}} engine, which is connected to the rotor by a transmission. The throttle setting must maintain enough engine power to keep the rotor speed within the limits where the rotor produces enough lift for flight. In many helicopters, the <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> is a single or dual motorcycle-style twist grip mounted on the collective control (rotation is opposite of a motorcycle throttle), while some multi-engine helicopters have power levers.|$|R
50|$|Helicopter rotors are {{designed}} to operate in a narrow range of RPM. The <b>throttle</b> <b>controls</b> the power produced by the engine, which {{is connected to the}} rotor by a fixed ratio transmission. The purpose of the throttle is to maintain enough engine power to keep the rotor RPM within allowable limits so that the rotor produces enough lift for flight. In single-engine helicopters, the <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> is a motorcycle-style twist grip mounted on the collective control, while dual-engine helicopters have a power lever for each engine.|$|R
