Bokova {{declared}} that media outlets {{should not be the}} target of military activities. On 11 August, after the NATO airstrike on Majer (on 9 August) that allegedly killed 85 civilians, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on all sides <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible to avoid killing innocent people.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Roebuck's first {{association}} with Griffith {{was working on}} the set of NBC's Matlock (at {{the end of the first}} season in 1987), having a limited scene with him as one of the young doctors who overheard Griffith's complaints that his belly ached. At that time, he didn't play Cliff Lewis. Later, Roebuck filled in as one of Matlock's lawyer assistants. Roebuck got the call from Fred Silverman, Dean Hargrove, and Andy Griffith to replace Clarence Gilyard, Jr. as Cliff Lewis for the final three seasons after Matlock moved to ABC. The show simultaneously moved from Los Angeles, California, to Wilmington, North Carolina, where Griffith did not have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> traveling.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Aragon {{provided}} new ships {{to help maintain}} the siege: the Vice Admiral of Valencia, Jaime Escribano, arrived in mid-August with ten Aragonese galleys. These boats and another fifteen Castilian ships commanded by Admiral Egidio Boccanegra were sent to Ceuta <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> damage {{as possible to the}} fleet of the King of Morocco, who was waiting at this port for the arrival of the fleet from Granada to go to Algeciras' aid. In the first encounter, the Christians tried to surprise the Muslim fleet by sending into combat only the fifteen Castilian ships, while the Aragonese ships maneuvered as if preparing to go to the aid of the Moroccans. The strategy would have been expensive to the Moroccans had they not captured a Castilian sailor before the final encounter, who warned them of the ruse. The ships from Ceuta quickly returned to port and the Christian fleet had to return to the Bay of Algeciras. On his return back at the siege, Egidio Boccanegra sent twenty of his ships to wait at Getares, ready to intercept the Moors if they decided to attack the encirclement.|$|E

2500|$|Emden was {{the first}} to fire at 09:40, and scored hits on her fourth salvo: two shells {{exploded}} near the aft control station and wrecked the aft rangefinders, while a third punched through the forward rangefinder and through the bridge without exploding. These shots landed at a range of approximately the 30-degree elevation of her main guns allowed her to fire much further than British estimates. Von Müller recognised that his success in the battle required Emden <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> damage as possible before the other ship retaliated, but despite the heavy rate of fire from the Germans over the next ten minutes (at points reaching a salvo every six seconds), the high angle of the guns and the narrow profile presented by Sydney meant that only fifteen shells hit the Australian warship, of which only five exploded. As well as the rangefinders, damage was sustained to the S2 gun when a nearby impact sent hot shrapnel into the gun crew then ignited cordite charges being stored nearby for the fight, and another shell exploded in a forward mess deck. [...] Four sailors were killed and another sixteen wounded; the only casualties aboard Sydney during the entire engagement.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, DeLorean was {{appointed}} to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire General Motors line, and his eventual rise to president seemed inevitable. However, the idea of him assuming that position was almost intolerable to GM executives, and on April 2, 1973, he announced that he was leaving the company, telling the press [...] "I want to do things in the social area.

GM gave him a Florida Cadillac franchise as a retirement gift, and DeLorean did in fact take over the presidency of The National Alliance of Businessmen, a charitable organization with the mission of employing Americans in need, founded by Lyndon Johnson and Henry Ford. GM was a major contributor to the group, and agreed to continue his salary while he remained president of NAB. DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, saying [...] "There's no forward response at General Motors to what the public wants today."

2500|$|Because {{treating}} people equally is not {{by itself}} enough to achieve equality for everyone, the law requires that employers owe positive duties to disabled people to give preferential treatment. According to Chacón Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA disabilities involve an impairment [...] "which hinders {{the participation of the}} person concerned in professional life". This includes all varieties of mental and physical disabilities. Because treating disabled people equally based on ability to perform tasks could easily result in persistence of exclusion from the workforce, employers are bound <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as reasonably possible to ensure participation is not hindered in practice. Under the Equality Act 2010 sections 20 to 22, employers have to make [...] "reasonable adjustments". For example, employers may have to change physical features of a workplace, or provide auxiliary aids to work, or adjust their working habits and expectations. In effect, the law views society as being the cause of the [...] "disability" [...] if it fails to ensure people are accommodated, rather than seeing the person's handicap as being merely a personal misfortune. EA 2010 Schedule 8 lists more examples of reasonable adjustments, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission provides guidance. In the leading case, Archibald v Fife Council, it was held that the council had a duty to exempt a lady from competitive interviews for a new job. Mrs Archibald, previously a road sweeper, had lost the ability to walk after complications in surgery. Despite over 100 applications for grades just above a manual worker, in her submission, the employers were fixated on her past history as a sweeper. The House of Lords held it could be appropriate, before such an ordeal, for a worker to fill an existing vacancy without a standard interview procedure. By contrast, in O’Hanlon v Revenue and Customs Commissioners the Court of Appeal rejected {{that it would be a}} reasonable adjustment, as Ms O'Hanlon was requesting after falling into clinical depression, for an employer to increase sick pay to full pay, after the expiry of a six-month period that applied to everyone else. The aim is always to ensure that disabilities are not a barrier to full participation in working life, as much as possible.|$|E
