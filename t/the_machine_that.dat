5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E

50|$|The Austrian {{economist}} Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk {{argued against}} both the Adam Smith labor theory of price and Marx's theory of exploitation.

500|$|A {{challenge}} {{faced by}} the designers of these sets {{is that they are}} not able to work with the full palette of Lego bricks and colors ever produced when designing. [...] Instead they are limited to the bricks and colors currently in production by Lego {{at the time of the}} product design. [...] As an example, for Café Corner, the designer wanted to include a bicycle piece in the set, but at the time, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> made bicycle pieces was broken. [...] It had to be fixed in order for the designer to be able to include the piece in his design. [...] With Market Street, the fan designer was limited to only the bricks and color combinations available as 'active components,' meaning bricks that were already in production. [...] No new bricks could be introduced.|$|E

500|$|That year, the {{department}} {{set out to}} improve the new highway. Concrete slabs were laid between Petrolia and Highway7, as well as along a [...] section between Thamesville and Dresden. The following year, the route was paved between Dresden and Edys Mills before {{the effects of the}} Great Depression forced {{the department}} to concentrate on paving Highway22. The election of a new government in mid-1934 led to the resumption of work in June as a depression relief project. New equipment (namely a Caterpillar Excavator), as well as the expertise of Andy Newman, an engineer who was hired when he demonstrated his abilities with the machinery upon passing a construction site on his drive home. Newman, who helped design <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> nobody else could operate, allowed work to proceed at a much faster rate than before. The machinery could dig quicker than 50 men, and this effort showed when the gap between Petrolia and Edys Mills and the remaining gaps between Dresden and Thamesville were graded and paved {{by the end of the}} summer. On October19, 1934, Highway21 was officially opened by Robert Mellville Smith, deputy minister of the Department of Highways.|$|E
500|$|Mallozzi stated {{before the}} airing of season 6 that [...] "Jonas {{will bring a}} unique alien {{perspective}} and ability to the team [...] {{will allow him to}} contribute in areas of expertise usually owned by [...] and Daniel." [...] Brad Wright hoped that [...] "what Corin, as Jonas, will bring to the show is a renewed sense of amazement" [...] of traveling around the galaxy although older characters have grown accustomed to it. The season6 opening two-parter [...] "Redemption" [...] intended to establish Jonas as a team player who can contribute ideas, although writer Robert C. Cooper felt the need to acknowledge and not [...] "trivialize what the [...] character meant to the team and to the show for five seasons". The writers incorporated the initial viewer resistance to the change by making O'Neill the most resistant to Jonas' presence, allowing viewers to grieve Daniel and gradually come to terms with his absence. The producers based Jonas's motivation to join SG-1 on his former reluctance to shut off <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> indirectly killed Daniel, and his feelings of responsibility for Daniel's death. [...] Jonas was slowly integrated into the story in a prolonged transition stage over the first half of season 6.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Indestructible" [...] was {{directed}} by Max Vitali and Nils Ljunggren. Vitali had previously worked with Robyn on the music videos for [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and [...] "Dancing on My Own". For the video, Australian artist Lucy McRae, who makes [...] "body architecture", designed a special [...] "tube dress" [...] for Robyn to wear. McRae also designed the outfits Robyn wore on the Body Talk album covers. The dress for the video {{was made up of}} plastic pipes that were periodically filled with colored fluids and wrapped around Robyn's body. Robyn recalled that <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> kept the liquid flowing was [...] "very complicated". It was powered by drills and required [...] "a whole lot of complex machinery to function". The machine was built by McRae, who had to do it quickly because of the video's budget. McRae said, [...] "Me and the dream team had never done anything like this before, the whole project was happening for the first time. The machine was super loud." [...] The shooting stopped four times due to leaks, and the team had to mop and re-set the technology. The shooting took twenty hours, and by 3 a.m. McRae said that Robyn was wrapped [...] "in a kilometre of tubing draped over her head and body". She praised Robyn's stamina throughout the shoot, saying that [...] "there were chaotic moments that could have been potentially disastrous and the entire time Robyn was working with us, smiling, moving when the tubes were stuck and just super happy we were making it happen." ...|$|E
