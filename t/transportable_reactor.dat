50|$|The hydrogen-moderated {{self-regulating}} {{nuclear power}} module (HPM), {{also referred to}} as the compact self-regulating <b>transportable</b> <b>reactor</b> (ComStar), is a new type of nuclear power reactor using hydride as a neutron moderator. The design is inherently safe, as the fuel and the neutron moderator is uranium hydride UH3, which is reduced at high temperatures (500-800 °C) to uranium and hydrogen. The gaseous hydrogen exits the core, being absorbed by hydrogen absorbing material such as depleted uranium, thus making it less critical. This means that with rising temperature the neutron moderation drops and the nuclear fission reaction in the core is dampened, leading to a lower core temperature. This means as more energy is taken out of the core the moderation rises and the fission process is stoked to produce more heat.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedLead-cooled Fast Reactors (LFRs) offer {{great potential for}} future compact nuclear power systems. The Small, Secure, <b>Transportable,</b> Autonomous <b>Reactor</b> (SSTAR) is a concept for an advanced fast reactor cooled by lead. Such reactors could be improved by using lead that is enriched in radiogenic lead (e. g., 208 Pb) {{in contrast to the}} average natural isotopic concentration. This improvement is due to the improved neutron reflection and lower neutron absorption cross-sections of the radiogenic isotopes. Artificial isotope separation of lead is cost-prohibitive; however, a natural lead source that is high in 208 Pb and low in 204 Pb could be used to improve the design of the reactor. The natural variation of lead isotopic content is geochemically investigated to determine if there are favorable naturally occurring lead sources. The results of the investigation are then used in Monte-Carlo simulations with the MCNP 5 code to determine the potential benefits of using such a lead composition to the design of a simplified SSTAR-type reactor. The results demonstrate that natural lead sources high in 208 Pb could lead to a reduction in the required core enrichment of up to 1 percent; this benefit could also be applied to make the design smaller, or to increase the power output.

As a response to the needs of developing countries to meet their rapidly growing energy requirements, the Safe, <b>Transportable,</b> Autonomous <b>Reactor</b> (STAR) program originated. This concept relies on small, passively safe, and highly autonomous nuclear power stations to make nuclear energy available to countries not containing the infrastructure to support a conventional reactor. Nuclear Reactor remote Monitoring software (NRM), a part of this project, has been developed to centralize and coordinate operations support for multiple plants, guarantee safety and nonproliferation, and improve cost-effectiveness. NRM allows soft real time monitoring of the reactor power, primary and secondary coolant temperatures, control rod movement, and secondary coolant zones in the steam generator (subcooled, saturated, and superheated). The coherence of the data sets is checked with QUASIMODO, a thermohydraulics computational code. NRM receives the measurement of physical variables from a data acquisition system.

RECS is similar to the Reactor Vessel Auxiliary Cooling System (RVACS) incorporated into the PRISM design. However, to enhance the heat removal, RECS incorporates fins on the containment vessel exterior to enhance heat transfer to air as well as removable steel venetian conductors that provide a conduction heat transfer path across the reactor vessel-containment vessel gap to enhance heat transfer between the vessels. The objective of the present work is to investigate the effectiveness of air cooling in removing heat from the vessel and limiting the coolant temperature increase following a sudden complete loss of the steam generator heat sink...|$|R

The GNEP program plans development of a sodium cooled Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR) {{that can be used}} to reduce the amount spent LWR fuel in storage and the number of high level waste sites needed for expansion of nuclear power throughout the world over the 21 st century. In addition, the program proposes to make nuclear power more available while reducing the proliferation concerns by revising policies and technology for control of weapons useable materials. This would be accomplished with establishment of new institutional arrangements based on selective siting of reprocessing, enrichment and waste disposal facilities. The program would also implement development of small reactors suitable for use in developing countries or remote regions with small power grids. Over the past several years, under the Department of Energy (DOE) NERI and GEN IV programs research has been conducted on small lead cooled reactors. The Small Secure <b>Transportable</b> Autonomous <b>Reactor</b> (SSTAR) [2] is the most recent version of this type of reactor and research is continuing on it in the GEN IV program in parallel with GNEP.

Pre-conceptual studies of SSTAR viability have continued {{with the objective of}} improving the system thermal hydraulic performance and raising the plant efficiency as well as extending the neutronics analysis. This effort has been motivated by several considerations. First, the initial Pre-conceptual studies were focused upon a ''pancake'' core having a height-to-diameter of 0. 5. It was found that a compact core with high average burn up could be realized with a height-to-diameter ratio of 0. 8. Second, the initial assumed reactor vessel height of 12. 2 meters limited the height of the Pb-to-CO{sub 2 } in-reactor heat exchangers (HXs) which reduced the efficiency of supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO 2) Brayton cycle power converter. It was found that by increasing the reactor vessel height to 18 meters, the greater driving head for single-phase natural circulation would offset both the greater pressure drop of the 0. 8 height-to-diameter ratio core as well as the pressure drop of taller HXs. This has enabled the plant efficiency to be increased from 40 to 43 % and the plant electrical power to be raised from 18 to 20 MWe. Third, reactivity feedback coefficients, which had previously not been generated for SSTAR, have now been calculated for the core. The reactivity feedback coefficients provide a basis for future investigation of the autonomous load following and passive shutdown behavior of the reactor.

TokuhiroThe Secure <b>Transportable</b> Autonomous <b>Reactor</b> – Liquid Metal system {{combines}} a Generation IV nuclear reactor with an advanced Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (S-CO[subscript] 2) Brayton power conversion cycle. The Brayton cycle {{was selected as}} the power conversion cycle due to its high efficiency, small turbomachinery size, and competitive cost due to reduced complexity as compared to a traditional Rankine cycle. Overall system thermal efficiency is closely tied to the performance of the precooler and recuperators. The Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger (PCHE) manufactured by Heatric is being considered for use as both the precooler and recuperator in the STAR-LM system due to its high effectiveness, wide temperature and pressure operating range, small size, and low cost. PCHEs have been used primarily in the hydrocarbon processing industry to date, and are relatively new in being considered for nuclear applications. 	In this study, a PCHE is investigated using S-CO[subscript] 2 and water as the heat transfer media in conditions relevant to the precooler in the STAR-LM system. Experiments conducted with small temperature differences across the PCHE revealed that the heat transfer coefficient is strongly correlated with the temperature-dependent specific heat near the pseudocritical point. The STAR-LM precooler outlet temperature is near the pseudocritical point, making this region of interest to this work. Testing was conducted to determine the effect of property variation near the precooler outlet in conditions with large temperature differences in the PCHE. These tests revealed that maintaining the precooler outlet temperature near the pseudocritical point does not {{have a significant effect on}} heat transfer coefficients in the PCHE under large temperature difference test conditions. 	Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models were developed to simulate fluid flow and heat transfer in the PCHE.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this dissertation were {{to find a}} principal domain of promising and technologically feasible reactor physics characteristics for a multi-purpose, modular-sized, lead-cooled, fast neutron spectrum reactor fueled with an advanced uranium-transuranic-nitride fuel and to determine the principal limitations {{for the design of}} an autonomous long-term multi-purpose fast reactor (ALM-FR) within the principal reactor physics characteristic domain. The objectives were accomplished by producing a conceptual design for an ALM-FR and by analysis of the potential ALM-FR performance characteristics. The ALM-FR design developed in this dissertation is based on the concept of a secure <b>transportable</b> autonomous <b>reactor</b> for hydrogen production (STAR-H 2) and represents further refinement of the STAR-H 2 concept towards an economical, proliferation-resistant, sustainable, multi-purpose nuclear energy system. The development of the ALM-FR design has been performed considering this reactor within the frame of the concept of a self-consistent nuclear energy system (SCNES) that satisfies virtually all of the requirements for future nuclear energy systems: efficient energy production, safety, self-feeding, non-proliferation, and radionuclide burning. The analysis takes into consideration a wide range of reactor design aspects including selection of technologically feasible fuels and structural materials, core configuration optimization, dynamics and safety of long-term operation on one fuel loading, and nuclear material non-proliferation. Plutonium and higher actinides are considered as essential components of an advanced fuel that maintains long-term operation. Flexibility of the ALM-FR with respect to fuel compositions is demonstrated acknowledging the principal limitations of the long-term burning of plutonium and higher actinides. To ensure consistency and accuracy, the modeling has been performed using state-of-the-art computer codes developed at Argonne National Laboratory. As a result of the computational analysis performed in this work, the ALM-FR design provides for the possibility of continuous operation during about 40 years on one fuel loading containing mixture of depleted uranium with plutonium and higher actinides. All reactor physics characteristics of the ALM-FR are kept within technological limits ensuring safety of ultra-long autonomous operation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the current status}} of the development of the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) in support of Generation IV (GEN IV) Nuclear Energy Systems. The approach being taken by the GIF plan is to address the research priorities of each member state in developing an integrated and coordinated research program to achieve common objectives, while avoiding duplication of effort. The integrated plan being prepared by the LFR Provisional System Steering Committee of the GIF, known as the LFR System Research Plan (SRP) recognizes two principal technology tracks for pursuit of LFR technology: - a small, transportable system of 10 - 100 MWe size that features a very long refueling interval, - a larger-sized system rated at about 600 MWe, intended for central station power generation and waste transmutation. This paper, in particular, describes the ongoing activities to develop the Small Secure <b>Transportable</b> Autonomous <b>Reactor</b> (SSTAR) and the European Lead-cooled SYstem (ELSY), the two research initiatives closely aligned with the overall tracks of the SRP, and outlines the Proliferation-resistant Environment-friendly Accident-tolerant Continual & Economical Reactors (PEACER) conceived with particular focus on burning/transmuting of long-lived TRU waste and fission fragments of concern, such as Tc and I. The current reference design for the SSTAR is a 20 MWe natural circulation pool-type reactor concept with a small shippable reactor vessel. Specific features of the lead coolant, the nitride fuel containing transuranics, the fast spectrum core, and the small size combine to promote a unique approach to achieve proliferation resistance, while also enabling fissile self-sufficiency, autonomous load following, simplicity of operation, reliability, transportability, as well as a high degree of passive safety. Conversion of the core thermal power into electricity at a high plant efficiency of 44 % is accomplished utilizing a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle power converter. The ELSY reference design is a 600 MWe pool-type reactor cooled by pure lead. This concept has been under development since September 2006, and is sponsored by the Sixth Framework Programme of EURATOM. The ELSY project is being performed by a consortium consisting of twenty organizations including seventeen from Europe, two from Korea and one from the USA. ELSY aims to demonstrate the possibility of designing a competitive and safe fast critical reactor using simple engineered technical features while fully complying with the Generation IV goal of minor actinide (MA) burning capability. The use of a compact and simple primary circuit with the additional objective that all internal components be removable, are among the reactor features intended to assure competitive electric energy generation and long-term investment protection. Simplicity is expected to reduce both the capital cost and the construction time; these are also supported by the compactness of the reactor building (reduced footprint and height). The reduced footprint would be possible due to the elimination of the Intermediate Cooling System, the reduced elevation is the of the design approach of reduced height components. JRC.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an update on}} development of a pre-conceptual design for the Small Secure <b>Transportable</b> Autonomous <b>Reactor</b> (SSTAR) Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) plant concept and supporting research and development activities. SSTAR is a small, 20 MWe (45 MWt), natural circulation, fast reactor plant for international deployment concept incorporating proliferation resistance for deployment in non-fuel cycle states and developing nations, fissile self-sufficiency for efficient utilization of uranium resources, autonomous load following making it suitable for small or immature grid applications, and {{a high degree of}} passive safety further supporting deployment in developing nations. In FY 2006, improvements have been made at ANL to the pre-conceptual design of both the reactor system and the energy converter which incorporates a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle providing higher plant efficiency (44 %) and improved economic competitiveness. The supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle technology is also applicable to Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors providing the same benefits. One key accomplishment has been the development of a control strategy for automatic control of the supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle in principle enabling autonomous load following over the full power range between nominal and essentially zero power. Under autonomous load following operation, the reactor core power adjusts itself to equal the heat removal from the reactor system to the power converter through the large reactivity feedback of the fast spectrum core without the need for motion of control rods, while the automatic control of the power converter matches the heat removal from the reactor to the grid load. The report includes early calculations for an international benchmarking problem for a LBE-cooled, nitride-fueled fast reactor core organized by the IAEA as part of a Coordinated Research Project on Small Reactors without Onsite Refueling; the calculations use the same neutronics computer codes and methodologies applied to SSTAR. Another section of the report details the SSTAR safety design approach which is based upon defense-in-depth providing multiple levels of protection against the release of radioactive materials and how the inherent safety features of the lead coolant, nitride fuel, fast neutron spectrum core, pool vessel configuration, natural circulation, and containment meet or exceed the requirements for each level of protection. The report also includes recent results of a systematic analysis by LANL of data on corrosion of candidate cladding and structural material alloys of interest to SSTAR by LBE and Pb coolants; the data were taken from a new database on corrosion by liquid metal coolants created at LANL. The analysis methodology that considers penetration of an oxidation front into the alloy and dissolution of the trailing edge of the oxide into the coolant enables the long-term corrosion rate to be extracted from shorter-term corrosion data thereby enabling an evaluation of alloy performance over long core lifetimes (e. g., 30 years) that has heretofore not been possible. A number of candidate alloy specimens with special treatments or coatings which might enhance corrosion resistance at the temperatures at which SSTAR would operate were analyzed following testing in the DELTA loop at LANL including steels that were treated by laser peening at LLNL; laser peening is an approach that alters the oxide-metal bonds which could potentially improve corrosion resistance.

40|$|This report {{documents}} work {{carried out}} during FY 2008 on further investigation of control strategies for {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} (S-CO{sub 2 }) Brayton cycle energy converters. The main focus of the present work has been on investigation of the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle control and behavior under conditions not covered by previous work. An important scenario {{which has not been}} previously calculated involves cycle operation for a Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) following a reactor scram event and the transition to the primary coolant natural circulation and decay heat removal. The Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) Plant Dynamics Code has been applied to investigate the dynamic behavior of the 96 MWe (250 MWt) Advanced Burner Test Reactor (ABTR) S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton cycle following scram. The timescale for the primary sodium flowrate to coast down and the transition to natural circulation to occur was calculated with the SAS 4 A/SASSYS- 1 computer code and found to be about 400 seconds. It is assumed that after this time, decay heat is removed by the normal ABTR shutdown heat removal system incorporating a dedicated shutdown heat removal S-CO{sub 2 } pump and cooler. The ANL Plant Dynamics Code configured for the Small Secure <b>Transportable</b> Autonomous <b>Reactor</b> (SSTAR) Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) was utilized to model the S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton cycle with a decaying liquid metal coolant flow to the Pb-to-CO{sub 2 } heat exchangers and temperatures reflecting the decaying core power and heat removal by the cycle. The results obtained in this manner are approximate but indicative of the cycle transient performance. The ANL Plant Dynamics Code calculations show that the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle can operate for about 400 seconds following the reactor scram driven by the thermal energy stored in the reactor structures and coolant such that heat removal from the reactor exceeds the decay heat generation. Based on the results, requirements for the shutdown heat removal system may be defined. In particular, the peak heat removal capacity of the shutdown heat removal loop may be specified to be 1. 1 % of the nominal reactor power. An investigation of the oscillating cycle behavior calculated by the ANL Plant Dynamics Code under specific conditions has been carried out. It has been found that the calculation of unstable operation of the cycle during power reduction to 0 % may be attributed to the modeling of main compressor operation. The most probable reason for such instabilities is the limit of applicability of the currently used one-dimensional compressor performance subroutines which are based on empirical loss coefficients. A development of more detailed compressor design and performance models is required and is recommended for future work in order to better investigate and possibly eliminate the calculated instabilities. Also, as part of such model development, more reliable surge criteria should be developed for compressor operation close to the critical point. It is expected that more detailed compressor models will be developed as a part of validation of the Plant Dynamics Code through model comparison with the experiment data generated in the small S-CO{sub 2 } loops being constructed at Barber-Nichols Inc. and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). Although such a comparison activity had been planned to be initiated in FY 2008, data from the SNL compression loop currently in operation at Barber Nichols Inc. has not yet become available by the due date of this report. To enable the transient S-CO{sub 2 } cycle investigations to be carried out, the ANL Plant Dynamics Code for the S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton cycle was further developed and improved. The improvements include further optimization and tuning of the control mechanisms as well as an adaptation of the code for reactor systems other than the Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR). Since the focus of the ANL work on S-CO{sub 2 } cycle development {{for the majority of the}} current year has been on the applicability of the cycle to SFRs, work has started on modification of the ANL Plant Dynamics Code to allow the dynamic simulation of the ABTR. The code modifications have reached the point where a transient simulation can be run in steady state mode; i. e., to determine the steady state initial conditions at full power without an initiating event. The results show that the steady state solution is maintained with minimal variations during at least 4, 000 seconds of the transient. More SFR design specific modifications to the ANL Plant Dynamics Code are required to run the code in a full transient mode, including models for the sodium pumps and their control as well as models for reactivity feedback and control of the reactor power...|$|R
40|$|The US National Energy Policy of 2001 {{advocated}} {{the development of}} advanced fuel and fuel cycle technologies that are cleaner, more efficient, less waste-intensive, and more proliferation resistant. The need for advanced fuel development is emphasized in on-going DOE-supported programs, e. g., Global Nuclear Energy Initiative (GNEI), Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI), and GEN-IV Technology Development. The Directorates of Energy & Environment (E&E) and Chemistry & Material Sciences (C&MS) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) are interested in advanced fuel research and manufacturing using its multi-disciplinary capability and facilities to support a design concept of a small, secure, <b>transportable,</b> and autonomous <b>reactor</b> (SSTAR). The E&E and C&MS Directorates co-sponsored this Laboratory Directed Research & Development (LDRD) Project on Mono-Uranium Nitride Fuel Development for SSTAR and Space Applications. In fact, three out of the six GEN-IV reactor concepts consider using the nitride-based fuel, as shown in Table 1. SSTAR is a liquid-metal cooled, fast reactor. It uses nitride fuel in a sealed reactor vessel that could be shipped to the user {{and returned to the}} supplier having never been opened in its long operating lifetime. This sealed reactor concept envisions no fuel refueling nor on-site storage of spent fuel, and as a result, can greatly enhance proliferation resistance. However, the requirement for a sealed, long-life core imposes great challenges to research and development of the nitride fuel and its cladding. Cladding is an important interface between the fuel and coolant and a barrier to prevent fission gas release during normal and accidental conditions. In fabricating the nitride fuel rods and assemblies, the cladding material should be selected based on its the coolant-side corrosion properties, the chemical/physical interaction with the nitride fuel, as well as their thermal and neutronic properties. The US NASA space reactor, the SP- 100 was designed to use mono-uranium nitride fuel. Although the SP- 100 reactor was not commissioned, tens of thousand of nitride fuel pellets were manufactured and lots of them, cladded in Nb- 1 -Zr had been irradiated in fast test reactors (FFTF and EBR-II) with good irradiation results. The Russian Naval submarines also use nitride fuel with stainless steel cladding (HT- 9) in Pb-Bi coolant. Although the operating experience of the Russian submarine is not readily available, such combination of fuel, cladding and coolant has been proposed for a commercial-size liquid-metal cooled fast reactor (BREST- 300). Uranium mono-nitride fuel is studied in this LDRD Project due to its favorable properties such as its high actinide density and high thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of mono-nitride is 10 times higher than that of oxide (23 W/m-K for UN vs. 2. 3 W/m-K for UO{sub 2 } at 1000 K) and its melting temperature is much higher than that of metal fuel (2630 C for UN vs. 1132 C for U metal). It also has relatively high actinide density, (13. 51 gU/cm{sup 3 } in UN vs. 9. 66 gU/cm{sup 3 } in UO{sub 2 }) which is essential for a compact reactor core design. The objective of this LDRD Project is to: (1) Establish a manufacturing capability for uranium-based ceramic nuclear fuel, (2) Develop a computational capability to analyze nuclear fuel performance, (3) Develop a modified UN-based fuel that can support a compact long-life reactor core, and (4) Collaborate with the Nuclear Engineering Department of UC Berkeley on nitride fuel reprocessing and disposal in a geologic repository...|$|R
