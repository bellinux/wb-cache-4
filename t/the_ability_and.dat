5|$|Polyethnicity {{refers to}} the {{proximity}} of people from different ethnic backgrounds within a country or other specific geographic region. It also relates to <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>and</b> willingness of individuals to identify themselves with multiple ethnicities. It occurs when multiple ethnicities inhabit a given area, specifically through means of immigration, intermarriage, trade, conquest and post-war land-divisions. This has had many political and social implications on countries and regions.|$|E

5|$|The {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. This {{was the first time}} the new government had been directly opposed, and through a clear show of federal authority, Washington established the principle that federal law is the supreme law of the land, and demonstrated that the federal government had both <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>and</b> willingness to suppress violent resistance to the nation's laws. The government's response to the rebellion was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. This also was one of only two times in U.S. history that an incumbent president has personally commanded the military in the field; James Madison would command an army in 1814.|$|E

5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} a pair of blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. Called Athena's Blades (also known as the Blades of Athena) in this game, they can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Barbarian Hammer, the Spear of Destiny, and periodically, the Blade of Olympus—offering alternative combat options. Although Kratos begins the game with Athena's Blades and the magic ability Poseidon's Rage (both at maximum power), the blade's power is reduced and the magic is relinquished after an encounter with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be regained by obtaining a certain urn). As with previous games, Kratos learns to use up to four magical abilities, such as Typhon's Bane that acts as a bow and arrow for distant targets, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. Other new magical abilities include Cronos' Rage, Head of Euryale, and Atlas Quake. The special ability Rage of the Gods, featured in the previous game is replaced by Rage of the Titans; unlike the previous game, the Rage meter—which allows usage of the ability—does not have to be full in order to use <b>the</b> <b>ability,</b> <b>and</b> can be switched on and off at will.|$|E

25|$|A {{great power}} is a {{sovereign}} state that is recognized as having <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>and</b> expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own.

25|$|Before the Meiji Era, {{the title}} yokozuna was conferred on ōzeki who {{performed}} sumo {{in front of}} the Shogun.

Thus {{there are a number of}} early wrestlers who were, by modern standards, yokozuna in name only. In these early days yokozuna was also not regarded as a separate rank in the listings, but as an ōzeki with special dispensation to perform his own ring entering ceremony.|$|E

25|$|Some in the Republican Party support unilateralism {{on issues}} of {{national}} security, believing in <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>and</b> right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense. In general, Republican thinking on defense and international relations is heavily influenced by the theories of neorealism and realism, characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure, {{as opposed to being}} the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders. The realist school's influence shows in Reagan's Evil Empire stance on the Soviet Union and George W. Bush's Axis of evil stance.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>and</b> {{degree of}} {{regeneration}} in reptiles differs {{among the various}} species, but the most notable and well-studied occurrence is tail-regeneration in lizards. In addition to lizards, regeneration has been observed in the tails and maxillary bone of crocodiles and adult neurogenesis has also been noted. Tail regeneration has never been observed in snakes. Lizards possess the highest regenerative capacity as a group. Following autonomous tail loss, epimorphic regeneration of a new tail proceeds through a blastema-mediated process that results in a functionally and morphologically similar structure. Tail regeneration in lizards presents an interesting case study {{for the evolution of}} regenerative abilities as regenerative ability among the 3,300 extant species varies greatly among them.|$|E

For some unknown reason, according to Delgado, the sinking of U-176 remained a secret to the Cuban public until {{after the end of the}} war. In 1946, Delgado was finally awarded the Meritorious Naval Service Order with Red Badge.

25|$|A second interpretation, that Nash {{referred}} to by the mass action interpretation, is less demanding on players: ``t is unnecessary {{to assume that the}} participants have full knowledge of the total structure of the game, or <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>and</b> inclination to go through any complex reasoning processes. What is assumed {{is that there is a}} population of participants for each position in the game, which will be played throughout time by participants drawn at random from the different populations. If there is a stable average frequency with which each pure strategy is employed by the ``average member of the appropriate population, then this stable average frequency constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

25|$|The Inuit practiced {{a form of}} shamanism {{based on}} animist principles.

The angakkuq of a community of Inuit was not the leader, but rather a sort of healer and psychotherapist, who tended wounds and offered advice, as well as invoking the spirits to assist people in their lives. His or her role was to see, interpret and exhort the subtle and unseen.

In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{specification}} of software components {{which can be}} loaded not only from your local system {{but also from the}} other systems over the computer network. Because components from the other sys-tem are not always enough reliable or safe to act freely in your own system, you should limit their activities to a certain context. Because some existing systems like Java RMI and an Applet provide a mechanism for such limitation implicitly, users sometimes lose sight of <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>and</b> limitations of such components. Therefore, they fail to reuse the components in the right way. We provide a way to specify such properties, so that component users can precisely understand <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>and</b> limitations. ...|$|R
25|$|Stephenson and {{the other}} {{salesmen}} and office seekers who maneuvered for control of Indiana's Invisible Empire lacked both <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>and</b> the desire to use the political system {{to carry out the}} Klan's stated goals. They were uninterested in, or perhaps even unaware of, grass roots concerns within the movement. For them, the Klan had been nothing more than a means for gaining wealth and power. These marginal men had risen {{to the top of the}} hooded order because, until it became a political force, the Klan had never required strong, dedicated leadership. More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan, or who pursued some of the interests of their Klan constituents, also accomplished little. Factionalism created one barrier, but many politicians had supported the Klan simply out of expedience. When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement, those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan's behalf.|$|E
25|$|In the Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network's Final Report to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health in 2007, {{health systems}} in many {{countries}} were noted to {{have been unable to}} deliver adequately on gender equity in health. One explanation for this issue is that many healthcare systems tend to neglect the fact that men and women’s health needs can be very different. In the report, studies have found evidence that the healthcare system can promote gender disparities in health through the lack of gender equity in terms of the way women are regarded - as both consumers (users) and producers (carers) of health care services. For instance, healthcare systems tend to regard women as objects rather than subjects, where services are often provided to women as a means of something else rather on the well-being of women. In the case of reproductive health services, these services are often provided as a form of fertility control rather than as care for women's well-being. Additionally, although the majority of the workforce in health care systems are female, many of the working conditions remain discriminatory towards women. Many studies have shown that women are often expected to conform to male work models that ignore their special needs, such as childcare or protection from violence. This significantly reduces <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>and</b> efficiency of female caregivers providing care to patients, particularly female ones.|$|E
