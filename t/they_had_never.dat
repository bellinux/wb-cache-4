5|$|Dillmann {{then decided}} to try {{wheelchair}} basketball again. She retrieved her old basketball chair, now somewhat mouldy and smelly, from the basement, and sought a game with her old team, RSV Lahn-Dill.

Soon after the wedding, he ran away from home to live with an {{unemployed}} student in Shaoshan. There he spent much of his time reading, particularly historical works like Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian and Ban Gu's History of the Former Han Dynasty, and political tracts like Feng Guifen's Personal Protests from the Study of Jiao Bin.|$|E
5|$|After Marcoux {{had lost}} his vision, his brother Billy Joe (B.J.) Marcoux decided to put his college {{education}} on hold in order to assist him with skiing. Alpine Canada introduced them to {{a new kind of}} skiing called Para-Alpine. They were inspired by the McKeever brothers to do visually impaired para-alpine. Other than the Paralympics, his brother B.J. has been his sighted guide using radio communication ever since then; something <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> used before.|$|E
5|$|Children {{survived the}} Jastrebarsko and Donja Reka camps only because {{concerned}} individuals from Zagreb, Jastrebarsko, and surrounding villages offered humanitarian aid. Among {{those who worked}} to alleviate children's suffering were Marinić, Budisavljević, and Davila. One survivor, Milan Vujić, {{was taken from the}} camp when he was sick and cared for {{until the end of the}} war by a Croatian family in Koprivnica. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> accepted the Ustaše regime or its policies. Many Croats, he stated, took in and even adopted children from Jastrebarsko and treated them kindly.|$|E

They played in the Gateway Conference from 1983 to 1992 before joining the Missouri Valley Conference in 1992. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> finished above 3rd place, tying for that position in 2010 (their first since 1992). <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> made it past the Second Round of the Missouri Valley Conference tournament.|$|R
5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard.|$|E
5|$|The Mongol Empire's rise gave Western Christians the {{opportunity}} to visit lands that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen before, and they set out in large numbers along the Empire's secure roads. Belief that a lost Nestorian kingdom existed in the east, or that the Crusader states' salvation depended on an alliance with an Eastern monarch, was {{one reason for the}} numerous Christian ambassadors and missionaries sent to the Mongols. These include Franciscan explorers Giovanni da Pian del Carpine in 1245 and William of Rubruck in 1253.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the {{election}} Barber was moved from the FCO to the Treasury to take over as Chancellor from Iain Macleod, who died suddenly on 20 July. Though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> enjoyed an easy relationship, Douglas-Home recognised his colleague's stature, and felt his loss politically as well as personally. Some commentators have maintained that Macleod's death and replacement by the less substantial figure of Barber fatally undermined the economic success of the Heath government.|$|E

5|$|Shen Kuo {{also made}} {{hypotheses}} {{in regards to}} geology and climatology in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. Shen believed that land was reshaped over time due to perpetual erosion, uplift, and deposition of silt, and cited his observance of horizontal strata of fossils embedded in a cliffside at Taihang {{as evidence that the}} area was once the location of an ancient seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles east over an enormous span of time. Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a dry northern climate zone where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been known to grow, climates naturally shifted geographically over time.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Tate {{arrives and}} discovers that Bob Ewell has {{died during the}} fight. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the {{prudence}} and ethics of charging Jem (whom Atticus believes to be responsible) or Boo (whom Tate believes to be responsible). Atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife. Boo asks Scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at his front door he disappears again. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective, and regrets that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> repaid him for the gifts he had given them.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} Hope holds a broken lyre, {{based on an}} ancient Athenian wood and {{tortoiseshell}} lyre then {{on display in the}} British Museum. Although broken musical instruments were a frequently occurring motif in European art, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> previously been associated with Hope. Hope's lyre has only a single string remaining, on which she attempts to play. She strains to listen {{to the sound of the}} single unbroken string, symbolising both persistence and fragility, and the closeness of hope and despair. Watts had recently shown interest in the idea of a continuity between the visual arts and music, and had previously made use of musical instruments as a way to invigorate the subjects of his portraits.|$|E

Chelsea were appearing in the final for the eleventh time. They had won the FA Cup six times previously (in 1970, 1997, 2000, 2007, 2009 and 2010), and had been beaten {{in the final four}} times (in 1915, 1967, 1994 and 2002). Liverpool and Chelsea had previously met nine times in the FA Cup, including two semi-finals (most recently in 2006), although <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> met in the final before. Chelsea had the upper hand in those nine meetings, winning five times to Liverpool's four; however, Liverpool won both semi-finals between the two clubs, both on neutral grounds. The only domestic cup final to feature both teams was the 2005 League Cup final, which Chelsea won 3–2 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|As a Protestant, George was {{considered}} a suitable partner for the niece of King Charles II of England, Lady Anne. Although they were distantly related (second cousins once removed; they were both descended from King Frederick II of Denmark), <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> met. George was hosted by Charles II in London in 1669, but Anne had been in France {{at the time of}} George's visit. Both Denmark and Britain were Protestant countries, and Louis XIV was keen on an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain the power of the Dutch Republic. Anne's uncle Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester, and the English Secretary of State for the Northern Department, Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, negotiated a marriage treaty with the Danes in secret, to prevent the plans leaking to the Dutch. Anne's father, James, Duke of York, welcomed the marriage because it diminished the influence of his other son-in-law, Dutch Stadtholder William III of Orange, who was naturally unhappy with the match.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E

5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver {{for weeks at a time}} when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been together for more than a few days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked when they found out, as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{communities}} grew {{quickly in}} many parts of the empire (and especially in the East) after 260, when Gallienus brought peace to the Church. The data to calculate the figures are nearly non-existent, but the historian and sociologist Keith Hopkins has given crude and tentative estimates for Christian population in the 3rd century. Hopkins estimates that the Christian community grew from a population of 1.1 million in 250 to a population of 6 million by 300, about 10% of the empire's total population. Christians even expanded into the countryside, where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been numerous before. Churches in the later 3rd century were no longer as inconspicuous as they had been in the first and second. Large churches were prominent in certain major cities throughout the empire. The church in Nicomedia even sat on a hill overlooking the imperial palace. These new churches probably represented not only absolute growth in Christian population, but also the increasing affluence of the Christian community. In some areas where Christians were influential, such as North Africa and Egypt, traditional deities were losing credibility.|$|E
5|$|Contributors to Poedjangga Baroe were {{influenced}} by the Tachtigers, a Dutch literary movement from the 1880s. Sutherland suggests that the romantic theme prevalent in their works was adapted by the authors to escape the changing realities of Indonesian society. As opposed to earlier works published by Balai Pustaka such as Marah Rusli's Sitti Nurbaya (1922), which emphasized regional cultural values, prose published in Poedjangga Baroe focused on national identity, and writers included areas that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> visited. Old themes, such as forced marriage, were abandoned. According to Sutherland, most contributors to Poedjangga Baroe kept a sense of ambivalence towards the Dutch colonial government as well as traditional culture as a central theme in their works. Although they rejected Dutch control of the archipelago, these nationalist writers embraced Western culture; Sutherland writes {{that some of the}} most staunchly nationalist writers were also the most westernized.|$|E
