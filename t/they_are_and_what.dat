There is also an exploration of religious attitudes towards homosexuality, and the dilemma of religious homosexuals, torn between who <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they believe. A non-fiction film with similar themes that has been contrasted with Latter Days is Trembling Before G-d.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times {{rated the}} film as the best of 2009, writing, [...] "The Hurt Locker is a great film, an {{intelligent}} film, a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is and where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they're doing and why." [...] He applauded how the suspense was built, calling the film [...] "spellbinding." [...] Ebert considered Renner [...] "a leading contender for Academy Awards," [...] writing, [...] "His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man {{is and what he}} feels. He is not a hero in a conventional sense." [...] He eventually ranked it the second-best film of the decade, behind only Synecdoche, New York.|$|E

2500|$|Relatively {{early in}} his career, the {{literary}} scholar [...] observed the specific form of critique within Leitner's verse: [...] "By way of his language, Leitner creates the resistance that reality is {{no longer able to}} offer him." [...] In his review entitled [...] "Love and social critique," [...] has verified that observation while exploring Leitner's collection of poems [...] "Schreite fort, Schritt." [...] Leitner, says Lutz Rathenow in an analysis of the poem Angel in Die Welt, often varies the motif of uncertainty: [...] "Anton G. Leitner goes beyond that: and what is there to do, when angels no longer know what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> their mission is? In this slender poem of no more than 27 words, angels are, above all, exhausted. The author is able to place each word with such ambiguity that the poem raises more questions than answers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regulated {{genes are}} {{categorized}} {{in terms of}} what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they do, important relationships between genes may emerge. For example, we might see evidence that a certain gene creates a protein to make an enzyme that activates a protein [...] to turn on a second gene on our list. This second gene may [...] be a transcription factor that regulates yet another gene from our list. Observing these links we may begin to suspect that they represent much more than chance associations in the results, and that they are all on our list because of an underlying biological process. On the other hand, it could be that if one selected genes at random, one might find many that seem to have something in common. In this sense, we need rigorous statistical procedures to test whether the emerging biological themes is significant or not. That is where gene set analysis comes in.|$|E

Data reveal three main categories of dilemmas: teaching, professional identity and future career plans. When coping with dilemmas, participants turned to various people around them. They felt some of the dilemmas were beyond their control, thus, could not be resolved due to problems in the Turkish education system. Findings are discussed as related to professional learning...|$|R

Unfortunately, as war photographs were long regarded with extreme disfavor in the South after the rebellion, most were disposed of. Fortunately, this was not the case for the many cherished family portraits of Confederate servicemen who lived and died during the war.

One of the projects was a site-based sound portrait of Houston by Robert Whitman, a New York artist known for his theater and technology works. Whitman assembled volunteers and assigned each participant a specific location on a map of Houston and a time to call in. When they reached Whitman, they talked about where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw. Using a sound mixing board, Whitman then arranged recordings of the calls into a concertlike sound piece that was broadcast live on Pacifica radio.|$|R
