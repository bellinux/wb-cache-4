5|$|Blues is a {{combination}} of African work songs, field hollers, and shouts. It developed in <b>the</b> <b>rural</b> <b>South</b> {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century. The most important characteristics of the blues is its use of the blue scale, with a flatted or indeterminate third, as well as the typically lamenting lyrics; though both of these elements had existed in African American folk music prior to the 20th century, the codified form of modern blues (such as with the AAB structure) did not exist until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from <b>the</b> <b>rural</b> <b>South</b> to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E

25|$|The {{collapse}} of cotton production {{contributed to the}} Great Migration of the early 20th century, when a total of 1.5 million African Americans left <b>the</b> <b>rural</b> <b>South</b> for jobs in northern and midwestern cities.

25|$|Slavery {{was illegal}} {{in much of}} the North, having been outlawed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

The use of Vulcans on the Otago Central Line, and between Christchurch and Invercargill, ceased in April 1976.

25|$|The {{population}} of Italy almost doubled during the twentieth century, but {{the pattern of}} growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from <b>the</b> <b>rural</b> <b>South</b> to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened {{as a consequence of}} the Italian economic miracle of the 1950-60s.
