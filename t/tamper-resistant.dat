5|$|In January 2015, the US National Transportation Safety Board cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety {{recommendations}} related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and <b>tamper-resistant</b> flight recorders and transponders.|$|E
5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a <b>tamper-resistant</b> bracket {{to the top of}} the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E
25|$|In 46 of the 50 United States {{and all of}} Canada, <b>tamper-resistant</b> sockets are now {{required}} in new residential construction. These prevent contact by objects like keys or paper clips inserted into the socket.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{electrical}} {{codes in}} the US and Canada began to require additional safety {{features in the}} basic NEMA 5-15R and 5-20R configurations to address specific electric shock hazard concerns. The safety features listed below are not mutually exclusive; for example, <b>tamper-resistant</b> GFCI receptacles are available.|$|E
25|$|Some tampers {{bypass the}} meter, wholly or in part. Safe tampers {{of this type}} {{normally}} increase the neutral current at the meter. Most split-phase residential meters in the United States are unable to detect neutral currents. However, modern <b>tamper-resistant</b> meters can detect and bill it at standard rates.|$|E
25|$|The 1982 {{incident}} {{inspired the}} pharmaceutical, food, and consumer product industries to develop <b>tamper-resistant</b> packaging, such as induction seals and improved quality control methods. Moreover, product tampering {{was made a}} federal crime. The new laws resulted in Stella Nickell's conviction in the Excedrin tampering case, for which she was sentenced to ninety years in prison.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer {{manufactures}} a {{preparation of}} short-acting oxycodone, marketed as OXECTA, which contains inactive ingredients, {{referred to as}} <b>tamper-resistant</b> AVERSION® Technology. It does not deter oral abuse. Approved by the FDA in the US in June 2011, the new formulation makes crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the opioid impractical because {{of a change in}} its chemical properties.|$|E
25|$|A common {{real-world}} example can {{be found}} in commercial direct broadcast satellite television systems such as DirecTV and Malaysia's Astro. The company uses <b>tamper-resistant</b> smart cards to store decryption keys so that they are hidden from the user and the satellite receiver. However, the system has been compromised in the past, and DirecTV has been forced to roll out periodic updates and replacements for its smart cards.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} 2008 National Electrical Code and the 2009 Canadian Electrical Code, listed <b>tamper-resistant</b> {{receptacles}} that address electric shock hazards to children {{must now be}} installed in almost all areas of new or renovated dwellings. According to statistics cited by the NFPA, the code change adds only $40 {{to the cost of}} building an average, 75-receptacle home in the US, yet prevents shock hazards to a child that sticks a single, metal object into the receptacle. The new receptacles are expected {{to reduce the number of}} electric shocks to children because inserting a normal, two-blade electrical plug applies pressure on both sides of the receptacle to open an internal, spring-loaded shutter, but a foreign object fails to do so and therefore does not make contact with the live electrical contacts. However, the device can still be defeated by inserting two objects simultaneously. Despite its weaknesses, the <b>tamper-resistant</b> receptacle is superior to protective plastic outlet caps which must be individually installed on each receptacle (and are a choking hazard when removed), and to sliding covers that children easily learn to defeat.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Purdue Pharma's abuse-resistant OxyNEO and six generic {{versions}} of OxyContin {{had been on}} the Canada-wide approved list for prescriptions since 2012. In June 2015, then federal Minister of Health Rona Ambrose announced that within three years all oxycodone products sold in Canada would need to be <b>tamper-resistant.</b> Some experts warned that the generic product manufacturers may not have the technology to achieve that goal, possibly giving Purdue Pharma a monopoly on this opiate.|$|E
25|$|Three {{improvements}} to card security {{have been introduced}} to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking <b>tamper-resistant</b> smart cards which are intended to make forgery more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the EMV (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit card security code (CSC) is now present {{on the back of}} most cards, for use in card not present transactions. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies. They have begun to address these needs through organisations such as PCI DSS and the Secure POS Vendor Alliance.|$|E
25|$|A {{sense of}} Congress was {{given that the}} U.S. Secretary of State should {{expedite}} the full implementation of the integrated entry and exit data system for airports, seaports, and land border ports of entry specified in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). They {{also found that the}} U.S. Attorney General should immediately start the Integrated Entry and Exit Data System Task Force specified in section 3 of the Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000. Congress wanted the primary focus of development of the entry-exit data system was to be on the utilization of biometric technology and the development of <b>tamper-resistant</b> documents readable at ports of entry. They also wanted the system to be able to interface with existing law enforcement databases. The Attorney General was ordered to implement and expand the foreign student monitoring program that was established under section 641(a) of the IIRIRA. which records the date and port of entry of each foreign student. The program was expanded to include other approved educational institutions, including air flight schools, language training schools or vocational schools that are approved by the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of State. US$36,800,000 was appropriated for the Department of Justice to spend on implementing the program.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Title VII {{sets forth}} {{the first federal}} mandate of <b>tamper-resistant</b> {{prescription}} pads for Medicaid reimbursement. The requirement states that “Effective October 1, 2007; Medicaid outpatient drugs will be reimbursable only if non-electronic written prescriptions are executed on a <b>tamper-resistant</b> pad.” The recommendation for this provision was previously enumerated by President Bush in his 2008 budget, which projected that the prevention of fraudulent prescriptions could reap $355 million in taxpayer savings. Although not objecting to the new requirement's rationale, the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) on July 17, 2007 asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to delay implementation because of the short timeline. In the request letter to CMS, APhA warned that the immediate implementation of the Act could potentially result in many Medicaid patients being turned away from pharmacies if not possessed of a valid prescription written on a <b>tamper-resistant</b> pad.

[...] They are available {{in a variety of}} models including GFCI and <b>tamper-resistant.</b> [...] For added protection, WR receptacles should be protected by Extra-Duty While In-Use or Weather-Resistant Covers. [...] These covers are ruggedly constructed to seal out moisture (dripping or condensing), dust, debris, and insects, while providing easy access to receptacles to allow homeowners to use power tools, trimmers, sprinkler systems, and pumps with confidence and improved safety.|$|E
2500|$|Representatives Charles Wilson (D-Ohio), Marion Berry (D-Arkansas), and Mike Ross (D-Arkansas) joined APhA in {{representing}} concerns of Medicaid enrollees and pharmacies. The representatives {{are reported to}} be working on an amendment aimed at limiting the <b>tamper-resistant</b> pad to only controlled substances. Further, an individual with the American Medical Association was interviewed about the topic by the Associated Press. [...] "The implementation timetable is too short to educate prescribing physicians about the new law and is also likely too short to produce and distribute the enormous quantity of new prescription pads that will be needed," [...] said Dr. Edward Langston, chairman of the board for the American Medical Association (as reported to the Associated Press). Dr. Langston also warned that, in effect, such a rapid implementation of law threatens access to medicine. The AP article also reported that CMS spokesperson Steve Hahn indicated that there were no plans to push back the October 1 implementation date, but that the agency is talking with [...] "health care providers" [...] to help prepare.|$|E
2500|$|On January 5, 2012, General Motors {{announced}} that it would offer a customer satisfaction program to provide modifications to the Chevrolet Volt to reduce the chance that the battery pack could catch fire days or weeks after a severe accident. General Motors explained the modifications will enhance the vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a <b>tamper-resistant</b> bracket {{to the top of the}} battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. On January 20, 2012, the NHTSA closed the Volt's safety defect investigation related to post-crash fire risk. The agency concluded that [...] "no discernible defect trend exists" [...] and also found that the modifications recently developed by General Motors are sufficient to reduce the potential for battery intrusion resulting from side impacts. The NHTSA also said that [...] "based on the available data, NHTSA does not believe that Chevy Volts or other electric vehicles pose a greater risk of fire than gasoline-powered vehicles." [...] The agency also announced it has developed interim guidance to increase awareness and identify appropriate safety measures regarding electric vehicles for the emergency response community, law enforcement officers, tow truck operators, storage facilities and consumers.|$|E
